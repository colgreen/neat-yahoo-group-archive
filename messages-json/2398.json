But when I set=\r\n it a bit lower, I end up with 100\n&gt; species of 1 chromosome after some 100=\r\n generations. I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; find the golden middle. On his FAQ\n&gt; (http:=\r\n//www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html), Kenneth Stanley\n&gt; himself pr=\r\nesents a method to automatically set the speciation\n&gt; threshold by descreas=\r\ning or increasing it with, say, 0.3, whenever the\n&gt; number of species becom=\r\nes more or less than a preset target amount of,\n&gt; say, 10.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, whe=\r\nn I apply this method (with population size 100 and target\n&gt; species count =\r\n10), then after some 100 generations I end up with 20 to\n&gt; 25 species and a=\r\n speciation threshold of 40 and rising. Of the\n&gt; resulting species, one spe=\r\ncie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\n&gt; contain 5 chromosomes or less and=\r\n 10 species contain just one chromosome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone else encountered su=\r\nch problems before, or have some idea to\n&gt; what might be causing this? How =\r\ndo you keep a &#39;normal&#39; amount of more\n&gt; or less equally sized species?\n\nHi =\r\nBas,\n\nI thought I&#39;d chime in and back the conversation up a little from\nimp=\r\nlementation to theory.\n\nWhy are we using speciation (and along with it expl=\r\nicit fitness\nsharing) to begin with?  I thought the idea was that new speci=\r\nes\nrepresented forays into new areas of the search space, and that\nexplicit=\r\n fitness sharing was a way to initially protect these\nexploratory jumps.\n\nO=\r\nbviously you don&#39;t want just 1 species in your population, or the\nother ext=\r\nreme, where every individual is in its own species.  But the\ndescription ab=\r\nove &quot;one specie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\ncontain 5 chromosomes o=\r\nr less and 10 species contain just one\nchromosome&quot; actually sounds just fin=\r\ne to me...not a &quot;problem&quot; at all. \nSeems to me that if you restrict the num=\r\nber of species to something\nlike 7 species, then if you have a significantl=\r\ny different\narchitecture arise, it&#39;s going to just get lumped in with an ex=\r\nisting\nspecies, and this new &quot;experimental&quot; topology may be watered down by=\r\n\ncrossover.\n\nI can understand the rationale for restricting the number of s=\r\npecies,\nbut it also seems more organic to let the number of species fluctua=\r\nte\nas long as you don&#39;t end up with either extreme.  And above all, how\nis =\r\nthe fitness improving?  Ken did ablation tests with and without\nspeciation,=\r\n but it might be worthwhile to look at differences between\nfixed and fluid =\r\nspeciation (though I would suspect that there wouldn&#39;t\nbe a substantial dif=\r\nference in performance).\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
