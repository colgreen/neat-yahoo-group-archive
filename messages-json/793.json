Their \ncomplete paper list is here:\n\nhttp://helen.cs-i.brandeis.edu/papers/\n\nBut the stuff on Pareto coevolution can give you a lot of insight \ninto what coevolution is really trying to do and what it needs to do \nit.\n\nAs an aside, I think coevolving good board game strategies is really \nhard.  The problem is they learn totally bizarre strategies that \nwork against each other but have little relation to the real world.  \nIt may be necessary to fold in some kind of hand-coded player into \ne.g. the hall of fame, to keep them sane.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Philip and I have been discussing the next experimental domain we&#39;d\n&gt; like to explore, and we&#39;ve decided on Go-moku (probably starting \nwith\n&gt; a smaller size, e.g., 7x7, and scaling up to 15x15).\n&gt; \n&gt; For our GECCO paper, we used direct evolution, i.e., we calculated \nthe\n&gt; fitness of our networks each generation based on performance versus\n&gt; hand-coded players.  But we&#39;re very interested in coevolutionary\n&gt; techniques, as this seems to be the logical future for domains in\n&gt; which good computer opponents don&#39;t exist.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if any of you have read Panait and Luke&#39;s paper \ncomparing\n&gt; K-Random Opponents coevolution and SET (Single-Elimination \nTournament)\n&gt; coevolution:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/twocompetitive.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Their findings suggest that both of these approaches work well, and\n&gt; may be dependent on the amount of randomness in the domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; They also point out that most professional sports rely on a\n&gt; combination of these approaches, which they broadly categorize as\n&gt; &quot;renaissance&quot; and &quot;duel&quot; approaches.  Most pro sports have a \nregular\n&gt; season, in which teams play a broad sample of other teams.  Those \nwith\n&gt; the best overall records at the end of the season enter a\n&gt; single-elimination tournament to decide who is &quot;the best&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other sports, like tennis, are almost exclusively SET-based.  I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering if the group has any thoughts on these types of dynamics,\n&gt; and if anyone knows of any theoretical work done on these dynamics.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, what are the relative advantages to double-elimination, \nversus\n&gt; single-elimination?  It&#39;s twice as computationally expensive, but \nhow\n&gt; well does it contribute to the coevolutionary dynamics?  K-Random \nOpps\n&gt; seems more biologically plausible, but SET and DET are much more\n&gt; efficient, and seem easier to extend with Hall of Famers.  If they\n&gt; work as well or better in general, shouldn&#39;t they be the preferred\n&gt; method?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
