Hearing a talk on neural networ=\r\nk\nensembles at this year&#39;s GECCO, though related to a control task, I\ncould=\r\n see how it could easily be mapped onto a game domain.  If you\nevolve a num=\r\nber of different &quot;specialists&quot;, and then in a secondary\nphase, evolve a &quot;co=\r\nach&quot; (called a &quot;gating network&quot; in Pardoe&#39;s paper)\nwhich decides at a given=\r\n point in time which of the specialists should\nbe making the current move, =\r\nyou can have adaptive behavior even\nwithout plasticity in the connection we=\r\nights.  This approach would\nwork better in longer games, or in the case of =\r\nTic-Tac-Toe or\nRoshambo, iterated games, which would give the coach network=\r\n ample\ntime to assess patterns in game play of the opponent.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
