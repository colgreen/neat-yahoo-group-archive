Which does the Job quite well. But\nnow I got some additional rules, so that my Programm produces just\njunk.\n\nWere the problem:\nI have a number of (lets call them Buckets) \nThey are aligned in two rows.\nThen I have Two machinetypes. On for Filling and one for emtying the\nBuckets.\nThe material has to go into one Bucket (stay for a while) then from\nthis into anoter (again Stay) and into a third (stay) and then out.\nThere are specific Buckets for each phase.\n\nNow I have some rules for the machines.\none cannot go pass the other while it is filling.\nfor emtying and filling it to another bucket i need two Machines.\nThe buckets do not have eaquel size, but do always have to be full.\nAn emtying machine must not leave a Bucket while it is not empty \n....\n\nSome rules differ on each Plant.\nThe goal is to get as much material through the mashine.\n\nSo how do I have to get startet?!\nI Tried to think of an algorithm which tries every possible\nCombination\n(You can go asleep while its working. :-&lt; )\n\nI discoverd NEAT for Delphi and thought that this could be the right\nthing. \nBut I didn&#39;t find any Quickstart or similar to use it. What Functions\ndo I have to call? And the biggest Question: How should I connect the\nGene? (Which to take for Input and for Output?)\n\nIs there any chance of constant learning? What if it generates an\noutput against one of of the Rules. How to tell it that it was wrong?\n\nCan anybody point me tho the right direction.\nBtw. I use Delphi but I accept Ideas in every language.\n\nRoland Schuller, AUSTRIA\n\n\n\n"}}
