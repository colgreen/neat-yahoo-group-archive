And second, I intend to use qadpz to achieve a discrete form \nof para=\r\nllel processing.\n\n   The various experiments and their associated &quot;.ne&quot; par=\r\nameter files \nreveal a limited range for the various parameters. That being=\r\n the \ncase, could you make any suggestions as to the max ranges which have =\r\n\nbeen found to be stable and &quot;play nicely&quot; with neat (i.e. not blow-up \nnea=\r\nt), based upon your experiences?\n\nThanks,\n   Andy\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy, the biggest difficu=\r\nlt here will be the CPU time this kind of \n&gt; experiment may require.  In ef=\r\nfect it takes the square of the time \n&gt; it would take to simply run evoluti=\r\non in a domain with a regular \n&gt; parameter set. That is because e.g. if you=\r\n had populations of size \n&gt; 100, then it you&#39;d need a meta-population of 10=\r\n0, each of which is \n&gt; an evolution of population 100.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps however=\r\n on some small problems this would still be \n&gt; feasible.  (Certainly with p=\r\narallel processing it also becomes more \n&gt; feasible)  Yet it&#39;s important to=\r\n remember that it is likely that \n&gt; what you are finding are the right para=\r\nmeters for *that* problem, \n&gt; rather than the best ones in general (it&#39;s li=\r\nkely there is no \n&gt; such &quot;best&quot;). \n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, if you did run such an=\r\n experiment, it&#39;s a good \nquestion \n&gt; what the inputs would be.  I would ad=\r\nd to your list inputs that let \n&gt; the network see the current parameter set=\r\ntings, e.g. the current \n&gt; mutation rate, etc.  That way, it can deduce, e.=\r\ng., &quot;hey the slope \n&gt; isn&#39;t good and I have a really low mutation rate so m=\r\naybe I should \n&gt; notch it up a little.&quot;  That is, it&#39;s useful to know what =\r\nstate \n&gt; you&#39;re in before you think about changing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that in mi=\r\nnd, you might consider the outputs being delta \nvalues \n&gt; rather than absol=\r\nutes.  In other words, they would request \n&gt; a &quot;normalized&quot; change magnitud=\r\ne on their respective parameters.  \n&gt; That way the network has (in an abstr=\r\nact sense) an &quot;egocentric&quot; \n&gt; perspective of how it moves through parameter=\r\n space.  However, if \n&gt; that doesn&#39;t work well, you can always try absolute=\r\ns (on a \n&gt; normalized range).  In either case, I&#39;m imagining one output for=\r\n \n&gt; each evolution parameter that the network controls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n   I am currently working on a version of neat to supervise neat, \n&gt; by \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; way of manipulation of the parameters on a generation by \n&gt; generation \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; basis for the purpose of attempting to accelerate the integral of \n&gt; the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; fitness of the underlying neat task (UNT). The byproduct would be \n&gt; =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; evolution of a supervisor genome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    My current thoughts =\r\nregarding inputs to the supervisor are as \n&gt; &gt; follows:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) normali=\r\nzed log of UNT generation #,\n&gt; &gt; 2) last UNT generation highest fitness (HF=\r\n),\n&gt; &gt; 3) last UNT generation HF accum,\n&gt; &gt; 4) # of generations since last =\r\nchange of HF of UNT,\n&gt; &gt; 5) average of UNT generation HF,\n&gt; &gt; 6) slope of a=\r\nverage of UNT generation HF (last 2 points),\n&gt; &gt; 7) slope of HF accum (last=\r\n 2 points).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Does anyone have any thoughts regarding the contemp=\r\nlated \n&gt; inputs, \n&gt; &gt; and/or suggestions for possible other candidate input=\r\ns?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Thoughtful suggestions are always appreciated!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Than=\r\nks,\n&gt; &gt;    Andy\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
