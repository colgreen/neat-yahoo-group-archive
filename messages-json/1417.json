If an add node\nconnection mutation rate of 0.01 with a population of 100 means that\nan average of one node will be added in the entire population in one\ngeneration, it seemed like a painfully slow way of incrementing\ntopology.  It seems the answer is crossover.  Even if through mutation\nonly one node is added in the first generation, if there is only one\nspecies and that individual is mating with other individuals without\nthat node, then presumably there could be 30 extra nodes in the\nsubsequent generation.\n\nIf topology is not cumulative due to the effects of crossover in this\nway, mutation will be the only way to increment topology, and you&#39;re\nnot exploiting the effects of crossover.  So on average, if your\nmutation rates are 0.01 for add node and 0.03 for add connection, with\na population size of 100 evolved for 100 generations, your average\nindividual will accumulate 1 new node and 3 new connections, which is\nabout on par with what you&#39;re experiencing.\n\nSo it seems to me you&#39;re either going to need to use crossover, as\nNEAT does.  Or dramatically increase your mutation rates.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
