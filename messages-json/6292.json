If yes, then based on what you said, is this the reason why\nself-adaptive mutation rates work better when coupled with novelty search?\n\n\nI believe the idea of self-adaptive mutation rates formed the basis for\nmore advanced evolution strategies such as CMA-ES. I am not trying to\ndefend CMA-ES here, which I agree with Jeff that it works differently than\nthe basic approach of encoding the mutation rates in the genotype. However,\nI am wondering whether a combination of novelty search with CMA-ES would be\na good approach in speeding up the search for novel behaviours.\n\nOf course, I can see some disadvantages of CMA-ES, an example being that\nthe genotype is a vector of real numbers with a fixed size...
