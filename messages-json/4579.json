I hope it helps\n&gt; others evolve ambulating creatures with HyperNEAT as well.  It really\n&gt; helps to have the example you have now provided that shows how such a\n&gt; substrate might be set up.\n\nThanks! \n\nPlease see my responses below.\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s difficult to find a good benchmark.  There are some\n&gt; publications citing successful biped walking, such as Reil and\n&gt; Husbands, but no one seems to be able to reproduce their results with\n&gt; the same setup.  In fact, I have never heard of anyone reproducing\n&gt; their results although I know several who have tried; I would be\n&gt; interested to hear from anyone who has.  There are some other works\n&gt; that produced bipeds as well, though I don&#39;t know the citations\n&gt; offhand.  But they usually involve some kind of hand-designed aspect\n&gt; or a &quot;hand of God,&quot; which means something that holds the biped up\n&gt; while it is learning, kind of like training wheels.  That makes\n&gt; comparison with such systems kind of apples and oranges if you don&#39;t\n&gt; apply such techniques.  And I think ideally we&#39;d like to be able to\n&gt; just tell evolution to go and let it do its own thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the anecdotal difficulty of the problem, for now I would\n&gt; consider it a success to get any biped to walk without any special\n&gt; tricks.  I do not see the biped so much as a benchmark as I see it a\n&gt; gateway to more interesting domains.  If you can evolve a biped, then\n&gt; you can probably evolve a lot of other creatures and also make bipeds\n&gt; that do increasingly interesting things.  It also validates a method&#39;s\n&gt; ability to produce complex controllers.\n\nI agree with all of that. We ran into the same issues with quadrupeds.\n\n&gt; Yes, recurrence is necessary to get oscillations with leaky\n&gt; integrators, which brings up an interesting issue for HyperNEAT: The\n&gt; substrate must include some sort of recurrence in its architecture.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t think many aside from Peter have played with recurrent\n&gt; substrates.  Of course, it should be possible and interesting to try.\n\nWe have tried the quadruped problem here with recurrence. Interestingly,\nrecurrence hurt HyperNEAT and helped P-NEAT.\n\n&gt; Like I said, at the moment our focus is not on comparison.  What we\n&gt; want is a concrete understanding of the domain: What makes it hard,\n&gt; what are the keys to making it work, what makes it most interesting,\n&gt; etc.  Perhaps we will think about comparison later.  But I think at\n&gt; the moment the interesting question is why so many have trouble with\n&gt; this problem.  Even Tyler Streeter only got his biped to walk a few\n&gt; steps before falling.  We want to master the domain completely so that\n&gt; in the future anyone can play with it easily and use it as a gateway\n&gt; to more interesting and complex control problems.\n\nI hope you accomplish that goal!\n\nI am surprised to hear you say that Tyler Streeter only got his robot to\nwalk a few steps. In this video, the final gait seems very stable and takes\n15 steps before the end of the clip:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TulriQmSC_U&feature=related\n\nThanks again for the kind words about my work. \n\n\n\n"}}
