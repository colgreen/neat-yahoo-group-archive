It&#39;s part 1 in a series of at least =\r\n3 \n&gt; tutorials. The next tutorial will cover co-evolution and the third one=\r\n \n&gt; will cover HyperNEAT, so hopefully the resulting NNs will get \n&gt; progre=\r\nssively stronger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts, comments, or questions are always welcome.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
