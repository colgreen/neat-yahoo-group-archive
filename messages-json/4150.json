Has she actually run any\n&gt; simple simulations using this implementation? My advisor is a big fan\n&gt; of Izhikevich, so I&#39;m interested to hear how those are working out.\n\nShe was on the list, I don&#39;t think she is anymore (need to talk to\nher!). Anyways, the Izhikevich model has a simple working example. If\nyou have Python installed, try this:\n\npython network.py (network.py is in /trunk/neat/iznn)\n\nIt prints to screen the membrane potential for each time step and\noutputs a graph if you have the required libraries. Here&#39;s an example:\n\nwww.ime.usp.br/~cesargm/spiking_neuron.svg\n\nFor STDP and related issues, I&#39;d recommend you to check out this guy&#39;s\nwebsite: http://www.coneural.org/florian/ -- Razvan Florian has some\nnice papers on that subject and he&#39;s mostly concerned with using\nspiking networks for robot controlling. His work is much more applied\nthan theoretical, so it&#39;s much easier to grasp those learning methods\nfor SNNs.\n\n[]&#39;s\nCesar\n\n"}}
