My project is to explore various neuro-evolution approaches\nto time ser=\r\nies prediction.\n\nI am trying to code my own version of NEAT for the same. I=\r\n am trying\nto model it on Matlab_neat by Christian Mayr. \n\nOne thing that I=\r\n observed in the implementation of matlab neat is that\nthe search for innov=\r\nations is always limited to the particular\ngeneration in which we are tryin=\r\ng to bring about the mutation. Is\nthere any particular reason for wanting t=\r\no do so? Is this done only in\nMatlab neat or is it a part of the NEAT proce=\r\nss itself?\n\nthanks,\nregards\nSidhant\n\n\n\n\n"}}
