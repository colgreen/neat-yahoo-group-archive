The question is how the very first \ngeneration coul=\r\nd proceed when there is no information about either \npopulation to begin wi=\r\nth.  Our paper may have omitted this detail.\n\nWe used a tournament in one p=\r\nopulation (say A) to bootstrap the \nprocess.  It was basically like a sport=\r\ns championship tournament, \nwhere everyone is paired off, and then those wh=\r\no won the first round \nplay against each other, those who won the second ro=\r\nund play against \neach other, and so on, until the final is between two cha=\r\nmps.  That \nis one reason we used populations of 256 (it is a power of 2). =\r\n \n\nNote that this tournament gives you a rough idea of who is good and \nwho=\r\n is not in the initial population, which is all you need to get \nthe proces=\r\ns rolling.  Then fitnesses are assigned to population A \nbased on how well =\r\nindividuals did in the tournament and coevolution \nproceeds normally from t=\r\nhere.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zymeth02&quot; &lt;zymeth02@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Hi, im new here and also new at NEAT. Im really interested to know\n&gt; mor=\r\ne about the coevolution setup K. Stanley used in the paper\n&gt; &quot;competitive c=\r\noevolution through evolutionary complexification&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was mentioned th=\r\nat a host population is evolved against an \nevolving\n&gt; parasite population.=\r\n 4 best specie champions and 8 samples from the\n&gt; HoF are selected to be op=\r\nponents for each individual in the host\n&gt; population.\n&gt; Now, what i find un=\r\nclear is when did u get the specie individuals&#39;\n&gt; fitness. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is it A?\n&gt;=\r\n gen 1: all host fight against all parasite \n&gt; gen 2: all host fight agains=\r\nt 4 champ from prev gen & 8 HoF\n&gt; gen 3: repeat gen 1\n&gt; gen 4: repeat gen 2=\r\n\n&gt; ..repeat pattern\n&gt; \n&gt; However, too computationaly expensive\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it B=\r\n?\n&gt; generation 1: for each specie in parasite population, compete each\n&gt; in=\r\ndividual against one another, in order to calculate fitness. Then\n&gt; for eac=\r\nh host, fight against 4 champ & 8 HoF.\n&gt; gen 2: repeat gen 1\n&gt; .. repeat pa=\r\nttern\n&gt; \n&gt; or i&#39;m both wrong :D\n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; Btw, what if there is only 1 organism in a specie? =\r\nThat means it is\n&gt; the fittest in that niche, so who does it mate with?
