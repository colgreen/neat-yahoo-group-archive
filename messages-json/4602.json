This phenomenon, \n&gt; known as partial penetrance, has been observed in diverse \n&gt; developmental systems. However, it remains unclear how the \n&gt; underlying genetic network specifies the set of possible \n&gt; alternative fates and how the relative frequencies of these \n&gt; fates evolve.\n&gt; Using B. subtilis sporulation as a model system, we identify \n&gt; a stochastic cell fate determination process in mutants, \n&gt; where multiple discrete cell fates are exposed, including a \n&gt; novel, potentially adaptive fate, where two spores are made \n&gt; by a single cell (twin sporulation). We experimentally \n&gt; analyze the underlying genetic network and show how fate \n&gt; discreteness and frequency depend on competition between the \n&gt; underlying cellular processes of differentiation, replication \n&gt; and division. Specifically, we show that the accumulation of \n&gt; consecutive mutations can gradually increase the penetrance \n&gt; of the new sporulation phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate the \n&gt; relevance of our mutational analysis to real evolutionary \n&gt; changes by analyzing wild species that show the alternative \n&gt; sporulation phenotype.\n&gt; Together our results suggest that noise can facilitate \n&gt; developmental evolution by enabling the initial expression of \n&gt; discrete morphological traits at low penetrance, and allowing \n&gt; their stabilization by gradual adjustment of genetic parameters.\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; cds-mailer mailing list\n&gt; cds-mailer@...\n&gt; http://listserv.cds.caltech.edu/mailman/listinfo/cds-mailer\n\n\n"}}
