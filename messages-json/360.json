I think it is extremely important to be\nconceptually clear, for two primary reasons:\n\n1) To communicate more effectively with others in the\nfield, so that the exchange of ideas is more efficient\nand fruitful\n\n2) To understand which features of the process you are\nemulating are inherent in your algorithm.  For\nexample, understanding that artificial populations are\nsubject to genetic drift just as natural populations\nare helps you better understand the dynamics of your\nsystem and helps you determine better starting points\nfor parameters to try.\n\nYou&#39;re working with Fogel&#39;s paradigm, which uses an\nextremely small population size (30, correct?).  This\nmade me suspicious of Fogel&#39;s claims right off the\nbat...a population this small seems like a bad idea\nfor a number of reasons, including genetic drift\n(Fogel doesn&#39;t actually use a genotype-&gt;phenotype\nmapping, but the basic concept still applies).\n\n&gt; We may end up having to find our own words to\n&gt; describe the process we are choosing to use, because\n&gt; strictly speaking...we are not technically\n&gt; using nature&#39;s version of evolution.\n\nWell, but in those cases where the dynamics of natural\nsystems map relatively well to what we&#39;re doing, we\nwould want to capture that in the language we use,\nwouldn&#39;t we?\n\nFor example, why would I use a term other than\n&quot;cooperative coevolution&quot; if that describes the\ndynamics of my system reasonably well?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
