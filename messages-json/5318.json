In my HyperNEAT library, I have a t=\r\nic tac toe experiment where the evaluation plays against an &quot;everything&quot; pl=\r\nayer.  Basically, whenever it is the everything player&#39;s turn, that player =\r\ncreates a new game for every possible action.  In other words, if the every=\r\nthing player moves first, he creates nine copies of the game state, one for=\r\n each first move, and the hyperneat player plays all nine of these games (w=\r\nhich then expand into more games, etc.)  This is tractable because tic tac =\r\ntoe is such a small search space.  I like this approach because it is easy =\r\nto know when you have achieved a perfect player, since every possible game =\r\nstate that could be reached given the individual&#39;s current policy is presen=\r\nted.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; A=\r\nnthony,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the kind words. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; There is at least one more =\r\ntutorial coming. I have the HyperNEAT code \n&gt; implemented, it&#39;s actually ve=\r\nry simple. The problem is that even the \n&gt; HyperNEAT Tic-Tac-Toe player sti=\r\nll sucks, and I was kind of implicitly \n&gt; promising a near-optimal player n=\r\next. It&#39;s funny how sometimes simple \n&gt; domains turn out to be so difficult=\r\n. If I don&#39;t come up with anything in \n&gt; a few days, I&#39;ll write it up anywa=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to hear suggestions from the group on better ways to \n=\r\n&gt; coevolve a better player. I&#39;ve been toying around with dual populations \n=\r\n&gt; where one is O and the other is X, similar to the host-parasite setup I \n=\r\n&gt; posted at the end of part 2, but no luck so far. The only other ideas I \n=\r\n&gt; have left are to drastically increase the population size or to add in \n&gt;=\r\n an optimal opponent with random noise like Fogel did originally. I \n&gt; hesi=\r\ntate to do the latter though, as coevolution is generally a more \n&gt; elegant=\r\n solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; Anthony Ison wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n so much for these tutorials Wesley.

Specifically, I show how to create a parallel\n&gt; &gt; two-player competiti=\r\nve coevolution evaluator and a hall of fame\n&gt; &gt; evaluator that you can wrap=\r\n around other evaluators.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The resulting AI is still not very strong=\r\n, but it is at least as good as\n&gt; &gt; the part 1 player. The next tutorial wi=\r\nll cover HyperNEAT and\n&gt; &gt; (hopefully) evolving an optimal player.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThoughts, comments, and questions are always welcome.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
