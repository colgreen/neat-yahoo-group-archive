The problem is that there are so\n&gt;  many possible spurious correlations between good pictures and other\n&gt;  irrelevent factors that the classifier will not get the deeper\n&gt;  concept of what makes a good picture.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yet I agree with John in the sense that there is extremely rich and\n&gt;  unusual data in the Picbreeder database that may be useful for\n&gt;  something beyond Picbreeder itself.  I just think the right way to\n&gt;  leverage it is tricky.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The idea of complexity is also quite muddy.  Unfortunately, the word\n&gt;  means a lot of different things.  In fact, perhaps the best formal\n&gt;  definition (&quot;minimal description length&quot;) is both proven\n&gt;  uncomputable in general and also does not correlate to what is meant\n&gt;  by the normal intuitive use of the word complexity with respect to\n&gt;  evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As evolutionary complexity goes up in the sense we usually mean it,\n&gt;  it is not just that the phenotype takes more bits to describe.\n&gt;  There is also a sense of organization, i.e. regularity, that begins\n&gt;  to take hold.  That is in direct opposition with the idea of minimal\n&gt;  description length.  In fact, what we really want is some kind of\n&gt;  partnership between complexity and organization.  Unfortunately that\n&gt;  introduces yet another mysterious word: organization; it also\n&gt;  introduced a partnership between two seemingly opposing forces.  Yet\n&gt;  I think this muddiness and internal conflict is important because it\n&gt;  shows that this problem is extremely slippery.  It makes me wonder\n&gt;  what is meant by &quot;doing well&quot; for humans asked to select for\n&gt;  complexity.\n&gt;\n&gt;  In any case, I do like the theme behind John&#39;s idea, but I think\n&gt;  something more sophisitcated needs to be done to capture the deeper\n&gt;  reasons that certain pictures are selected.\n\nIn classical art there are &#39;rules&#39; for good works.  The rule of\nthirds, for example.  Why do those rules exist?  I would posit that\nthose rules exist because of a mathematical relationship that exists\nin how the signals travel around in our brain.  I suspect that a\nnetwork COULD be developed that would be able to identify the pure\naesthetic merit of a particular image, because I think that at that\nlevel, aesthetics is a purely mathematical function.\n\nThat said, I think that it would be very unlikely to be able to say,\n&quot;hey, that looks like a bunny rabbit that has been borgified...cool!&quot;\nSince our choice of what to breed for is based partly on aesthetics\nand partly on the emotional tie to the objects that something reminds\nus of, there is little chance that a controller network could totally\nreplace the human.\n\nBut what if?  What if a controller could be evolved which learned to\nrecognize good image composition rules?  How might such a thing extend\nthe usefulness of PicBreeder in general?  What might it teach us?\nWhat might it say about the limits of computer controls?  What might\nit say about US?  Is there any merit at all to undertaking such an\nexperiment?  In my opinion, there is.\n\n-- John\n-- \nJohn Arrowwood\nJohn (at) Hanlons Razor (dot) com\nJohn (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n--\nhttp://arrowwood.blogspot.com\n\n"}}
