It is still making improvements, and \nmaybe i&#39;ll see magic when i get home again, but i&#39;m still dissapointed. \nThe chance of adding a node is set to 2%, so i&#39;m crossing my fingers \nthat it&#39;s just being slow and carefull.\nIs there any science to prdicting the size/complexity of a domain before \nstarting?
