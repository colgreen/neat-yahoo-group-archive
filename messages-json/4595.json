It\n&gt; &gt; turns out that such a network represents an ap=\r\nproximation of the ODEs.\n&gt; &gt; To elaborate, let us write the derivatives in =\r\ndiscrete form.

For constant step size, we can rewrite it as\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   x_=\r\n(n+1) =3D G(x_n)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We can represent such equations using a network t=\r\nhat takes the current\n&gt; &gt; joint angle as input and produces the desired ang=\r\nle for the next time\n&gt; &gt; step as output.  So such a network should work as =\r\nan approximation of\n&gt; &gt; the coupled oscillator system.

What are the neces=\r\nsary and sufficient conditions for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something to be considered a c=\r\noupled non-linear oscillators?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ken!  The coupling here =\r\nmeans that the oscillators influence each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other&#39;s behavior.  Let me=\r\n use the term &quot;coupled cell system&quot; to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more precise.  A coupled =\r\ncell system is a collection of cells, where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each cell i is a dynami=\r\ncal system with state x_i.  If cell i is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coupled to another cell j,=\r\n then it means that the state of cell i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depends on the state of cel=\r\nl j.  Such a system is represented by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system of ODEs.  For exampl=\r\ne, the ODEs for a system with two cells\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that are coupled to each ot=\r\nher can be written as follows:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    x_1 =3D F_1=\r\n(x_1, x_2)   ........ cell 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    x_2 =3D F_2(x_2, x_1) =\r\n  ........ cell 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The LHS of the above ODEs represent the =\r\ntime derivatives of the state\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variables, and the functions F_1 and =\r\nF_2 represent the internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dynamics of the cells.  The linearity or=\r\n non-linearity of the system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is determined by the nature of F_1 and=\r\n F_2.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The term &quot;cell&quot; is used instead of &quot;oscillator&quot; in t=\r\nhe above\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terminology because it is not necessary for individual cel=\r\nls to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; capable of producing oscillations.  However, the coupled c=\r\nell system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a whole can display oscillatory behaviors.  More impo=\r\nrtantly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; making some of the cells and couplings identical can const=\r\nrain the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cells to oscillate synchronously or with constant phase re=\r\nlations with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other, a property that is useful for modeling gai=\r\nts.  For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, making the cells and couplings identical in the a=\r\nbove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two-cell system results in F_1 =3D F_2 =3D F.  It is then poss=\r\nible to show\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that functions F exist for which solutions x_1 and x_2=\r\n of the system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are periodic and half a period out of phase with eac=\r\nh other (see [1]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below for details).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gaits are pro=\r\nduced by assigning these cells to control the legs of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; robot.  But=\r\n how do we find an appropriate function F?  In my GECCO\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper, I fo=\r\nund F by representing it as a neural network module and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then evolvi=\r\nng it.  That is, the coupled cell system is implemented as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a neural=\r\n network controller, where each network module represents one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ODE o=\r\nf the system.  The state variables x_i are the leg joint angles.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nus the network takes joint angles as input and produces desired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joi=\r\nnt angular velocities as output.  This formalism has the following\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nadvantages:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   1. Theoretical understanding of the possible=\r\n gaits.  Coupled cell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      systems can be designed that model centr=\r\nal pattern generators in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      animals, producing symmetric, animal-=\r\nlike gaits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   2. Modularity: The coupled cell system I use=\r\nd for quadrupeds has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      four identical cells/modules that differ =\r\nonly in the permutation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of inputs they receive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;   3. Simple feed-forward neural network implementation, i.e. no need\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;      for leaky integrators or recurrency.  Notice that the sigmoid\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;      activation function of the neurons in the network provides any\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      necessary non-linearity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I had to manu=\r\nally specify the modules and the permutation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs to each modu=\r\nle. It would be cool if HyperNEAT can evolve that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specification aut=\r\nomatically.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, I am assumi=\r\nng that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of a couple=\r\nd non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate for th=\r\ne neurons to be non-leaky?  I guess I am curious why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having a non=\r\n-leaky neuron would be the most favorable choice in such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; model,=\r\n or whether it is somehow a matter of definition.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice=\r\n that my description above did not make any assumptions about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaky=\r\n or non-leaky neurons.  Either type should be OK.  I used\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non-leaky=\r\n neurons because they are simpler and sufficient.  I did not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experi=\r\nment with leaky neurons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, what are the m=\r\ninor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that would cre=\r\nate this kind of system?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the substrate needs =\r\nto implement the ODEs of the coupled\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cell system, i.e. substrate ou=\r\ntputs must be the time derivatives of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its inputs.  This condition i=\r\ns satisfied if inputs are joint angles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and outputs are desired angu=\r\nlar velocities.  The minor adjustment to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jeff&#39;s substrate that I me=\r\nntioned was to interpret outputs as desired\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angular velocities inst=\r\nead of desired angles.  In principle, inputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; besides joint angles a=\r\nre also not necessary for generating gaits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the other inpu=\r\nts he used (roll, pitch, yaw, and touch) may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful for more com=\r\nplex behaviors that require such additional sensory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce=\r\n oscillations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reliably, but I am not sure if that is actually any=\r\nthing different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from what you are describing or just another inst=\r\nance of the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phenomenon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I men=\r\ntioned above, a coupled cell system is a dynamical system.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since ne=\r\ntworks of leaky neurons can approximate any dynamical system,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you a=\r\nre right that it is another instance of the same phenomenon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Howeve=\r\nr, the coupled cell system framework allows us to reason about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nhigh level properties of the system such as synchronicity and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase=\r\n relations that are useful for gait generation, producing the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advan=\r\ntages I listed above.  As a result, evolutionary search can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bias=\r\ned to discover robust and effective gaits more easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ref=\r\nerences:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several papers by Stewart, Golubitsky a=\r\nnd others on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory of coupled cell systems and how they can be=\r\n used to model\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animal gaits.
