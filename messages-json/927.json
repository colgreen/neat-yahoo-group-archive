But \n&gt; I guess you still need a stopping criterion in case\n&gt; the network \n&gt; never says it&#39;s ready.  Also, the complexity of\n&gt; representing what it \n&gt; means to be &quot;ready&quot; may be almost as difficult to\n&gt; discover as the \n&gt; solution itself, in which case its value would be\n&gt; questionable.  But \n&gt; I don&#39;t know that to be the case so it&#39;s definitely\n&gt; worth trying.\n\nYes, you do need a backup stopping criteria in case\nthe network doesn&#39;t acheive &quot;ready&quot;.  Those would be\nlow fitness networks, but there will be many of them. \nWhat I do is count the internal cycles, and I enforce\na maximum, usually 16.  Also, I include a small\npenalty for excessive cycling in the fitness function,\nto favor those nets that come to a decision with few\ncycles.  If a net reaches the limit of 16 cycles I\ngive it a very low fitness score.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
