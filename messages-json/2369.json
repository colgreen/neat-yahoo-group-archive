The current board state is just an input vector 64 entries\n&gt;long, and each space is either 1/0/-1 for friendly/unoccupied/enemy,\n&gt;which is fine.  What I&#39;m quibbling with is that they want each program\n&gt;to evaluate all possible board states 1ply deep.\n&gt;\n&gt;Why not just pass the board state to the player each time step and\n&gt;return a suggested move (e.g., a 64-long input vector with zeros for\n&gt;non-moves and a 1 for the suggested move?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suppose the reason is that this is a tradition within machine learning \ncircles - whereby you throw a load of board states at an eval function \nand pick the one that rates as being the strongest position. I agree \nthat ideally the competition eval scheme would take a board state and \nsuggest a move. It would then be up to the entrants to decide how they \nwish to generate a move, the above scheme being just one possibility.\n\nOn the other hand if you open up the competition too much then it \nbecomes much harder to oversee and ensure that no-one is cheating, e.g. \nif submissions are made in some obscure language you are unfamiliar \nwith. Also the limited formats make analysis of the functionality easier.\n\nIan said:\n\n&gt;Given the difficulty we are having with TTT, I \n&gt;thought Othello was a little out of our league for the moment.\n&gt;\nYeh. Although I don&#39;t think we, or at least I, have tried this 1-ply \nlook-ahead approach. All my experiments to date have had 9 outputs, one \nfor each possible response. Your eval function did evaluate all possible \nboard states, so it&#39;s like 1-ply look-ahead, but how many outputs are \nyou using?\n\nBTW I&#39;m working towards a new code release and right now I&#39;m working on \nfeed-forward only networks just in case I decide to have a go. Hopefully \nit will be easy enough to generate an s-expression from a network in \norder to create a submission for the online leagues.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
