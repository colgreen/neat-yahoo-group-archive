It has been tried a \nlittle to m=\r\ny knowledge, but not extensively.

I am researching using NEAT for time \nseries\n&gt; prediction.\n&gt; \n&gt; I h=\r\nave been lurking in the group for the past few months. I&#39;ve got \na\n&gt; few qu=\r\nestions/suggestions that I&#39;ll post as three separate \nmessages. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am =\r\nwondering if anyone has tried using a variable mutation rate?\n&gt; Basically i=\r\nf the system determines that overall the fitness rate\n&gt; change has gone bel=\r\now a threshold value. Then increase the chance \nof\n&gt; new nodes being added =\r\nand increase the range of weight variations\n&gt; until the fitness begins to i=\r\nmprove again. Then lower the system \nwide\n&gt; mutation rate back down again o=\r\nnce there has been an improvement.\n&gt; \n&gt; The way I see it when the system be=\r\ngins to stagnate. Instead of\n&gt; continuing to fine tune the system. Start ma=\r\nking some much more\n&gt; radical changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another way to do this might be=\r\n too increase the number of species\n&gt; based of the rate change of fitness. =\r\nEssentially start with many\n&gt; species then lower the overall number of spec=\r\nies and increase their\n&gt; populations when you want to fine tune the solutio=\r\nns. But if there\n&gt; hasn&#39;t been any improvements for a significant amount of=\r\n time start\n&gt; increasing the variety of topologies (ie increase the number =\r\nof\n&gt; species) until there are some improvements.\n&gt; \n&gt; I searched the archiv=\r\nes but didn&#39;t find any topics exactly matching\n&gt; this. Sorry if it has been=\r\n discussed ad nauseum. Please point me in\n&gt; the right direction if this top=\r\nic has been flogged to death!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shane Ryan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
