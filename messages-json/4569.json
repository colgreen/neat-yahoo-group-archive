I=\r\nt has proven extremely helpful and Buckland is to be \ncommended for his com=\r\nments and consistancy.\n\nThere is a small section of code in the CGenome::Ad=\r\ndLink function \nthat as far as I can determine serves no purpose and may be=\r\n an \nartifact from when it was originally written:\n\n      if (ID_neuron2 =\r\n=3D=3D 2)\n      {\n        continue;\n      }\n\nWhat possible reason would it =\r\nmatter if this statement were true or \nfalse?\n\nAlso, Buckland&#39;s sigmoid fun=\r\nction is written as:\n\n//------------------------------------Sigmoid functio=\r\nn----------------\n//\n//----------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n\nfloat Sigmoid(float netinput, float response)\n{\n\treturn (=\r\n 1 / ( 1 + exp(-netinput / response)));\n}\n\nwhere &quot;response&quot; is the dActivat=\r\nionResponse value which one can \nchoose to mutate.\n\nI understand that this =\r\nchanges the slope of the sigmoid curve.  \nWouldn&#39;t it be better to multiply=\r\n &quot;netinput&quot; by &quot;response&quot; so a case \nof dividing by zero does not ever occu=\r\nr?\n\nThanks\n\nRaymond\n\n\n\n"}}
