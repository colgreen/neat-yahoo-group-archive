This is not really an argument\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; with anything you=\r\n said, but mainly a commentary on the meaning of &quot;objective&quot; that I\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; think draws a useful distinction.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree wit=\r\nh the spirit of your argument but it&#39;s just a\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; gut feeling at this po=\r\nint so I&#39;ll have a go at clarifying my thoughts\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; a bit further and ma=\r\nybe I can home in a bit more on where I&#39;m\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; disagreeing (if at all).\n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; By &#39;survive&#39; I mean - execute some strategy that results in s=\r\nurvival.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So find food and shelter, avoid danger, etc. Good survival =\r\nstrategy\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; for the domain =3D&gt; good chance of surviving, bad strategy =\r\n=3D&gt; lower\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; chance.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In an EA that survival *strategy* =\r\nis &#39;do well on the fitness metric&#39;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; (aka objective) - because the onl=\r\ny way to survive is to get selected\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; by the EA&#39;s selection criteria. =\r\nSo I think we can clarify the argument\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; by drawing a distinction betw=\r\neen surviving/reproducing and\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; /strategies/ that lead to surviving an=\r\nd reproducing. I think perhaps\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; we (or I) have conflated the two. Sur=\r\nvive/reproduce is the high level\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; [implicit] objective that is always=\r\n present, and survival /strategy/\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; is what we normally refer to as ob=\r\njective or goal in EC.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; So far there&#39;s no distinction between=\r\n nature/biology and EC. To my\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; mind nature has found complex /strateg=\r\nies/ for survival because:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; A) Vastly more computational reso=\r\nurce (or equivalent) [per unit time].\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; B) Vastly more time.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; C)=\r\n Vastly more complex domain.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It&#39;s this latter point that I f=\r\neel has tended to be overlooked. If you\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; consider every living thing =\r\nalive today and trace back through all of\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; their ancestors, then ever=\r\ny single one of those zillions of organisms\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; executed a successful st=\r\nrategy that lead to survival. Considerably\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; more organisms not on tha=\r\nt family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; world does try out uns=\r\nuccessful strategies, but only for one\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; generation at a time, it does=\r\nn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; those poor strategies in the=\r\n hope of finding something better. What\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; does happen though is that s=\r\ntragies are so complex (for creatures with\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; large brains anyway) that=\r\n they can incorporate successful parts (find\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; food) and yet waste muc=\r\nh time on poor sub-strategies (effectively\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; stragey efficiency). Evol=\r\nution will select for efficiency but unlike\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; survival it&#39;s not a bina=\r\nry yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; more like the small low=\r\n scoring species in NEAT (from fitness\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; sharing).\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It&#39;s=\r\n perhaps those poor side strategies that fit your idea of\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; searching =\r\nwith no objective, they piggy back on for the ride and very\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; occasion=\r\nally become useful. Where EC tends to fall short IMO is that\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; the dom=\r\nain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; there&#39;s les=\r\ns opportunty for exploring variations in strategy -\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; branching off in=\r\nto multiple successful branches and sub-branches\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; without a major los=\r\ns in fitness on the objective. Put another way, the\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; natural world&#39;s =\r\nfitness landscape is dominated by smooth undulations\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; in all dimensio=\r\nns, whereas EC objectives tend to have a few\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; sharp/steep local maxim=\r\na.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Nature also provides a gentle selection pressure towards =\r\ncomplex\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; strategies by providing resources that require increasingly =\r\ncomplex\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; strategies to reach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until =\r\nyou evolve\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; legs ang lungs. And you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without=\r\n evolving\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; good eyes and fast/strong muscles, etc. but the plants and=\r\n meat were\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; there as an untapped resource until that first legged cre=\r\nature and\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; first carnivore came along. So we can see now that framing=\r\n the\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; survival as being an objective that&#39;s been achieved on day one =\r\nmisses\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; a lot of the key dynamics that drive evolution. Surviving is =\r\nthe high\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; level implicit objective, some species have not moved on fr=\r\nom floating\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; in the sea eatign CO2 and sunlight, but other strategies=\r\n were evolved\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; to tap into new previously untapped resources - and th=\r\nat climb from\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; simple to complex resources utilisation continues to t=\r\nhis day.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Colin.\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n      \r\n--0-426871424-1302065044=:4932\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005=\r\n463bodyDrftID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspa=\r\ncing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv94005463drftMsgContent&quot; style=3D&quot;font-st=\r\nyle: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inh=\r\nerit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-family: arial;=\r\n font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005463bodyDrft=\r\nID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv94005463drftMsgContent&quot; style=3D&quot;font-style: inheri=\r\nt; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-=\r\nsize-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size:=\r\n 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005463bodyDrftID&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;t=\r\nr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv94005463drftMsgContent&quot;\n style=3D&quot;font-style: inherit; font-=\r\nvariant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adj=\r\nust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005463bodyDrftID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv940=\r\n05463&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv94005463drftMsgContent&quot; style=3D&quot;font-style: inherit; font-variant: =\r\ninherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inhe=\r\nrit; font-stretch: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005463bodyDrftID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot; =\r\nborder=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv94=\r\n005463drftMsgContent&quot; style=3D&quot;font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; =\r\nfont-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font=\r\n-stretch: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv9400=\r\n5463&quot;&gt;&lt;table id=3D&quot;yiv94005463bodyDrftID&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv94005463&quot; border=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot;\n cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=3D&quot;yiv94005463drft=\r\nMsgContent&quot; style=3D&quot;font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weigh=\r\nt: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: =\r\ninherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Hello Ken,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these =\r\nopen ended evolution algorithms have been applied to &quot;wherever you want&quot; ou=\r\ntside\n alife, for a long time now[1].

So we can run novelty search on traditional machine learning domains lik=\r\ne biped robots, mazes, pole-balancers, etc., and thereby unlock our interes=\r\nt in open-ended discovery from the exclusive province of artificial life.  =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe other significant difference is that novelty search explicitl=\r\ny drives evolution towards novelty, while the pressure in alife worlds is i=\r\nmplicit, which means it is harder to control.  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nken&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- I=\r\nn &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Gene Merdock &lt;genemerdoc=\r\nk@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Both environmental complexity and Surviv=\r\ne &amp; Reproduce are aspects that have for at least a decade been explored=\r\n and written about (core wars, polyworld...).

This is not really an argument&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nith anything you said, but mainly a commentary on the meaning of &quot;objective=\r\n&quot; that I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; think draws a useful distinction.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I agree with the spirit of your=\r\n argument but it&#39;s just a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gut feeling at this point so I=\r\n&#39;ll have a go at clarifying my thoughts&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a bit further an=\r\nd maybe I can home in a bit more on where I&#39;m&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; disagreein=\r\ng (if at all).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By &#39;survive&#39; I mean -=\r\n execute some strategy that results in survival.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So find=\r\n food and shelter, avoid danger, etc. Good survival strategy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; for the domain =3D&gt; good chance of surviving, bad strategy =3D&gt; =\r\nlower&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; chance.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In =\r\nan EA that survival *strategy* is &#39;do well on the fitness metric&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (aka objective) - because the only way to survive is to get selec=\r\nted&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by the EA&#39;s selection criteria. So I think we can cl=\r\narify the argument&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by drawing a distinction between surv=\r\niving/reproducing and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; /strategies/ that lead to survivin=\r\ng and reproducing. I think perhaps&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we (or I) have confla=\r\nted the two. Survive/reproduce is the high level&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [implic=\r\nit] objective that is always present, and survival /strategy/&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; is what we normally refer to as objective or goal in EC.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So far there&#39;s no distinction between nature/bio=\r\nlogy and EC. To my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mind nature has found complex /strate=\r\ngies/ for survival because:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A) Vastl=\r\ny more computational resource (or equivalent) [per unit time].&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; B) Vastly more time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; C) Vastly more complex domai=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s this latter point that I fee=\r\nl has tended to be overlooked. If you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; consider every liv=\r\ning thing alive today and trace back through all of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thei=\r\nr ancestors, then every single one of those zillions of organisms&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; executed a successful strategy that lead to survival. Considerabl=\r\ny&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive =\r\n- so the natural&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; world does try out unsuccessful strateg=\r\nies, but only for one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; generation at a time, it doesn&#39;t c=\r\nreate offspring with variations on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; those poor strategies=\r\n in the hope of finding something better. What&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; does happ=\r\nen though is that stragies are so complex (for creatures with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; large brains anyway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; food) and yet waste much time on poor sub-strategies (e=\r\nffectively&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; stragey efficiency). Evolution will select fo=\r\nr efficiency but unlike&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; survival it&#39;s not a binary yes/n=\r\no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more like the small=\r\n low scoring species in NEAT (from fitness&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sharing).&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies=\r\n that fit your idea of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; searching with no objective, they=\r\n piggy back on for the ride and very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; occasionally become=\r\n useful. Where EC tends to fall short IMO is that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the do=\r\nmain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; there&#39;s less opportunty for exploring variations in strategy -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; branching off into multiple successful branches and sub-branches&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; without a major loss in fitness on the objective. Put ano=\r\nther way, the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; natural world&#39;s fitness landscape is domin=\r\nated by smooth undulations&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in all dimensions, whereas EC=\r\n objectives tend to have a few&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sharp/steep local maxima.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nature also provides a gentle selec=\r\ntion pressure towards complex&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; strategies by providing re=\r\nsources that require increasingly complex&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; strategies to =\r\nreach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evolve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n legs ang lungs. And you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without evolving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; good eyes and fast/strong muscles, etc. but the plants and meat=\r\n were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there as an untapped resource until that first leg=\r\nged creature and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; first carnivore came along. So we can s=\r\nee now that framing the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; survival as being an objective t=\r\nhat&#39;s been achieved on day one misses&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a lot of the key d=\r\nynamics that drive evolution. Surviving is the high&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; leve=\r\nl implicit objective, some species have not moved on from floating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in the sea eatign CO2 and sunlight, but other strategies were ev=\r\nolved&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to tap into new previously untapped resources - an=\r\nd that climb from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; simple to complex resources utilisatio=\r\nn continues to this day.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Colin.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntd&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-426871424-1302065044=:4932--\r\n\n"}}
