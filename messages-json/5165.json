On a moderately-dece=\r\nptive map, novelty search outperforms fitness search, and fitness search ou=\r\ntperforms random search. On a very deceptive map, novelty search once again=\r\n outperforms the other two methods, but fitness-based search is approximate=\r\nly equivalent to a random search.\n\nAny form random search (such as the one =\r\nyou suggest) does not exploit any sort of domain information and will likel=\r\ny perform very badly at almost any task if a large proportion of genotypes =\r\nspecify degenerate behaviors (which is likely the case for real-world domai=\r\nns; most random genomes likely encode no useful information).\n\nTo understan=\r\nd why a search for behavioral novelty may often be much different than a ra=\r\nndom search of the genotype space, it is helpful to consider the mapping of=\r\n a genotype to a behavior. This mapping is a composition of the mapping bet=\r\nween genotype to phenotype and from phenotype to behavior space. \n\nThe firs=\r\nt mapping (from genotype to phenotype) is the encoding. In neuroevolution, =\r\nthis encoding translates the genotype to a neural network. NEAT and HyperNE=\r\nAT are two potential encodings among many.\n\nThe second mapping (from phenot=\r\nype to behavior space) maps a neural network to its behavior when evaluated=\r\n in a domain (for example, the coordinate within the maze where a navigatio=\r\nnal robot with a particular brain would navigate to). \n\nIt is important to =\r\nnote that for many encodings (including NEAT and HyperNEAT), the space of g=\r\nenotypes is effectively infinite-dimensional because of genetic operators t=\r\nhat add genes. This allows NEAT to evolve ANNs of arbitrary complexity and =\r\nHyperNEAT to evolve CPPNs of arbitrary complexity. \n\nHowever, the space of =\r\nbehaviors is typically not infinite-dimensional; for example, in the maze d=\r\nomain, it is only two-dimensional. So, the space of behaviors may be signif=\r\nicantly smaller than the space of all possible neural networks. \n\nIt is als=\r\no somewhat reasonable to believe that perturbing a genotype that maps to a =\r\ncertain behavior may often generate a similar, yet slightly different behav=\r\nior. In this way, it may be more effective to explore the behavior space by=\r\n perturbing genotypes representing novel behaviors rather than exhaustively=\r\n or randomly searching through the underlying genotype space.\n\nImagine a si=\r\ntuation in which 99% of all genomes map to degenerate behaviors that do not=\r\nhing, but the remaining 1% of genomes map to behaviors that are functional,=\r\n and these 1% of genomes form a connected mesh in the search space (that is=\r\n, they are reachable from each other through mutations). In a random search=\r\n, 99% of all evaluations will be wasted, while a search for novelty will ex=\r\nploit domain information to more effectively find these non-degenerate beha=\r\nviors.\n\nIn summary, random search ignores domain information, while a searc=\r\nh for novelty (or a fitness-based search) does utilize domain information.\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Thanks all for the information.\n&gt; I looked at the articles and I am left =\r\nwith a question.\n&gt; How does novelty search compare with random search of th=\r\ne genotype space? If the task is sufficiently deceptive, random search will=\r\n actually outperform fitness directed search. It seems to me that the new a=\r\nlgorithm must be compared against both fitness directed search and random s=\r\nearch.\n&gt; Preference for simple models can be incorporated into random searc=\r\nh by giving higher probabilities to simpler models. A classic solution woul=\r\nd be to let the probability decrease exponentially with the number of nodes=\r\n in the compact description.\n&gt; Are there any theoretical or practical resul=\r\nts regarding the comparison with a random search? Do you have any estimates=\r\n or ideas on this?\n&gt; I am not saying that novelty search won&#39;t work, but I =\r\nthink this point must be cleared. I also want to try gain a better understa=\r\nnding of how and why the search works.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
