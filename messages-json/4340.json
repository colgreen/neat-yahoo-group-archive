I see some\ninteresting =\r\nbehaviors evolving, but I am curious about your own\nconclusions?  What did =\r\nyou learn from this experiment?  Did you try\ncomparing it to regular NEAT i=\r\nn the same domain?  I am not sure\nwhether the difference would be great sin=\r\nce I am not sure if this task\nis sufficiently complex to exhibit a signific=\r\nant difference between\nthe methods.  That is, there is probably only so goo=\r\nd that you can get\nbefore new skills stop really mattering in this domain.\n=\r\n\nBy the way, do you plan releasing source code for your various\nexperiments=\r\n and AI code?  It seems like you have a nice system set up\nand other people=\r\n might like tinkering with it.  I especially like the\nreal-time CPPN/substr=\r\nate displays.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know t=\r\nhat\n&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the neat \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n   File        : /HyperNEAT_PredatorPrey.exe \n&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_cherv=\r\nenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; \n&gt;   Description : HyperNEAT applied to compet=\r\netive predator-prey\ncoevolution task (with walls).  \n&gt; \n&gt; You can access th=\r\nis file at the URL:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/HyperNEAT_Pr=\r\nedatorPrey.exe \n&gt; \n&gt; To learn more about file sharing for your group, pleas=\r\ne visit:\n&gt;\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/ind=\r\nex.htmlfiles\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
