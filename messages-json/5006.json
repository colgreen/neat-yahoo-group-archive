I&#39;m getting a PhD in\nBioinformatics, and HMMs have many applications to biological sequence\nanalysis.  The HMMs used are currently built by hand and can be quite\ncomplex, and though there has been some successful research into evolving\nthem, none that I know of has attempted to take advantage of NEAT&#39;s bag o&#39;\ntricks.\n\nHMMs are very similar structurally to neural networks, and my suspicion is\nthat many of the same pathologies that confound the evolution neural\nstructures apply to HMMs.  If I&#39;m right, then NEAT seems like a very\nattractive solution.  I&#39;m hoping that I can use the NEAT algorithm almost in\nit&#39;s entirety, since almost everything seems applicable to this domain (and\nI believe Ken has said that NEAT can be thought of as a general structure\nevolving algorithm, rather than being specific to ANNs).\n\nThe first step is sorting out exactly what the canonical version of NEAT is.\n My plan is to use Ken&#39;s dissertation as the primary reference.  Is this\nwise?  Or have there been advances in the intervening years that I ought to\nknow about?  For instance, one nuance that a colleague of mine at UT\nmentioned is SharpNEAT&#39;s periodic decomplexification phase.  He suspects\nthis phase is quite useful, even though it is not part of the original NEAT\nspec.  What do you guys think?\n\nKen, if you were to set one of your students to the task of writing their\nown NEAT from scratch, which resources would you point him/her to?\n\nDaniel\n\r\n--000e0cd71eca5d9342047a80abe7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHello,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m planning this semester to investigate the=\r\n applicability of the NEAT algorithm to the evolution of Hidden Markov Mode=\r\nls. =A0I&#39;m getting a PhD in Bioinformatics, and HMMs have many applicat=\r\nions to biological sequence analysis. =A0The HMMs used are currently built =\r\nby hand and can be quite complex, and though there has been some successful=\r\n research into evolving them, none that I know of has attempted to take adv=\r\nantage of NEAT&#39;s bag o&#39; tricks.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HMMs are=\r\n very similar structurally to neural networks, and my suspicion is that man=\r\ny of the same pathologies that confound the evolution neural structures app=\r\nly to HMMs. =A0If I&#39;m right, then NEAT seems like a very attractive sol=\r\nution. =A0I&#39;m hoping that I can use the NEAT algorithm almost in it&#39=\r\n;s entirety, since almost everything seems applicable to this domain (and I=\r\n believe Ken has said that NEAT can be thought of as a general structure ev=\r\nolving algorithm, rather than being specific to ANNs).&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first step is sorting out exactly what the canonical version of =\r\nNEAT is. =A0My plan is to use Ken&#39;s dissertation as the primary referen=\r\nce. =A0Is this wise? =A0Or have there been advances in the intervening year=\r\ns that I ought to know about? =A0For instance, one nuance that a colleague =\r\nof mine at UT mentioned is SharpNEAT&#39;s periodic decomplexification phas=\r\ne. =A0He suspects this phase is quite useful, even though it is not part of=\r\n the original NEAT spec. =A0What do you guys think? =A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ken, if you were to set one of your students to the task of writing=\r\n their own NEAT from scratch, which resources would you point him/her to?&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Daniel&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd71eca5d9342047a80abe7--\r\n\n"}}
