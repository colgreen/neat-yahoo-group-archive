I&#39;ve add=\r\ned it to the to-do list but how it gets achieved is undecided - I might fol=\r\nd this into phased searching, that is, switch to simplifying mode when we h=\r\nit the upper target. Which is how SN1 works but the target is floating. So =\r\npotentially I just need a more flexible way of defining when to shift phase=\r\ns.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
