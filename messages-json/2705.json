I&#39;m a student at University of Virginia (I work\n=\r\nwith metal alloys  www.virginia.edu/ms).  \n\nAI is a brand new field to me a=\r\nnd I&#39;m trying to learn it.  I stumbled\nacross NEAT by accident when I was l=\r\nooking at implimentations of X-OR\ngate using matlab.  I&#39;m quite fascinated =\r\nby what NEAT is designed to\ndo. I apologize for the quality of my questions=\r\n, as they will not\ncontribute to the advancement of NEAT.  \n\n \n\nTo be hones=\r\nt, I understand that NEAT evolves the nn arc but I&#39;m not\nvery clear on what=\r\n the output represents.  I ran it few times and\nnoticed I get different res=\r\nults every time (now I know why) so I went\non the quest to figure it out.  =\r\nI read tutorials on ai-junkie.com\n(great tutorials, highly recommend!) so n=\r\now I think I understand\nsomething in terms of theory but not much in terms =\r\nof practice.  I was\ntrying to take the output and verify it using matlab (l=\r\nearn by\napplying), and I&#39;m not even going to show you my outputs. :) \n\nI wa=\r\ns hoping someone would point me to the right direction to figure\nout how to=\r\n interpret the output. For example if this is the output\nwhat is the correc=\r\nt architecture?\n\nINFO  Generation 77: start\nINFO  connection-&gt;neuron id map=\r\n size =3D=3D 55\nINFO  neurons-&gt;connection id map size =3D=3D 394\nINFO  spec=\r\nies count: 32\nINFO  max: id=3D9786 score=3D1.0 size=3D25\nINFO  # chromosome=\r\ns with max fitness: 1\nINFO  champ: id=3D9786 score=3D1.0 size=3D25\nINFO  Ge=\r\nneration 77: end [23:31:42 - 23:31:43] [1\nINFO  generation of first solutio=\r\nn =3D=3D 34\nINFO  champ # connections =3D=3D 15\nINFO  champ # hidden nodes =\r\n=3D=3D 6\nINFO  Run: end [23:29:59 - 23:31:44] [104531]\n\nINFO  Generation 49=\r\n: start\nINFO  connection-&gt;neuron id map size =3D=3D 37\nINFO  neurons-&gt;conne=\r\nction id map size =3D=3D 306\nINFO  species count: 36\nINFO  max: id=3D6264 s=\r\ncore=3D1.0 size=3D16\nINFO  # chromosomes with max fitness: 1\nINFO  champ: i=\r\nd=3D6264 score=3D1.0 size=3D16\nINFO  Generation 49: end [23:38:33 - 23:38:3=\r\n5]\nINFO  generation of first solution =3D=3D 48\nINFO  champ # connections =\r\n=3D=3D 9\nINFO  champ # hidden nodes =3D=3D 3\nINFO  Run: end [23:37:32 - 23:=\r\n38:35] [63188]\n\nmany thanks\nAleks\n\n\n\n\n"}}
