The\n&gt;&gt; cleverness of MoGo comes in via heuristics which encode things like\n&gt;&gt; location and rotation invariant representations and hence provides\n&gt;&gt; both a way to generalize from a small amount of experience (e.g.\n&gt;&gt; exploit symmetries) and also to bias the MC search towards &quot;more\n&gt;&gt; promising&quot; parts of the game tree (e.g. exploit heuristic knowledge  \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; ladders). These representations themselves aren&#39;t learned directly  \n&gt;&gt; (as\n&gt;&gt; far as I have seen) but the potential is of course there, and in\n&gt;&gt; particular there is nothing inherent in the UCT framework itself\n&gt;&gt; preventing this from happening. Since UCT is basically just a\n&gt;&gt; framework for performing biased random search, I don&#39;t really agree\n&gt;&gt; that its not scalable. Scalability comes from providing a stronger\n&gt;&gt; search bias. Stronger search biases are formed by generalizing\n&gt;&gt; acquired knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, they&#39;re scalable in the sense that MoGo actually plays on a\n&gt; 19x19 board, although the same player that MoGo beat on a 9x9 board\n&gt; apparently beat MoGo on a 19x19 board, even though the algorithm had a\n&gt; 9-stone handicap.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;m not very optimistic that such approaches are going to\n&gt; yield much in the way of strong, general-purpose AI. The fact that\n&gt; algorithms like UCT don&#39;t get in the way of explicitly learning\n&gt; representations doesn&#39;t seem like a very strong endorsement of the\n&gt; approach. I tend to think that explicitly learning representations is\n&gt; the key to developing strong methods that apply generally across many\n&gt; domains.\n\nWhy does it have to be either/or? You&#39;re framing the discussion as  \nrepresentation learning versus UCT.  Personally I don&#39;t see them as  \ntwo mutually exclusive, exhaustive paradigms for achieving general  \npurpose AI. Instead there are interesting bits to glean from both  \napproaches. Obviously UCT alone isn&#39;t the entire solution, but neither  \nis representation learning.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, to my main point: I think the idea of biased random search in\n&gt;&gt; UCT is actually very intuitive and useful both in enhancing the\n&gt;&gt; abilities of AI search as well as in understanding how humans play.\n&gt;&gt; The former is sort of obvious given how well UCT-based algorithms\n&gt;&gt; perform in practice and the latter stems directly from the notion of\n&gt;&gt; bias: If the heuristics we have don&#39;t provide any information about\n&gt;&gt; the value of a board-position, the only thing we can do is play\n&gt;&gt; randomly until we learn about that value. If the heuristics provide\n&gt;&gt; weak information, then we play randomly, but slightly biased by this\n&gt;&gt; weak knowledge (e.g. &quot;I know that a lot of the time this kind of move\n&gt;&gt; works pretty well.....&quot;), etc. I think this idea of degree of bias  \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; confidence in heuristic scoring really does to a large extent underly\n&gt;&gt; how humans reason about these kinds of games.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe. I tend to want to frame Go as a problem in a way that dovetails\n&gt; with most other cognitive domains, so I think of it in terms of\n&gt; learning, recognizing, and generating temporal sequences of patterns.\n&gt; This explanatory framework can apply to domains encompassing any\n&gt; modality, from object recognition to learning how to ride a bicycle.\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to conceptually map the UCT approach of biasing\n&gt; search to such domains.\n\n\nLike I said above, I doubt UCT was ever intended as a complete  \nsolution to general purpose AI, rather its just a useful framework for  \nsequential decision tasks. So that rules out object recognition (at  \nleast the one-shot classifier version) but certainly you&#39;d agree that  \nriding a bicycle has a ton in common with Go? At least abstractly? You  \nhave a set of low level decisions to make, muscle movement timings,  \netc. Then on a higher time scale you make decisions about how fast to  \ngo, where to turn, etc. And then at the highest level you&#39;re doing  \nplanning about routes and obstacle avoidance. In Go its very similar:  \nat the lowest level you play pieces in the various local contests, at  \nthe mid level you strategize about influence and control, and at the  \nhighest level you adapt your overall strategy to exploit weaknesses in  \nyour opponent.... This kind of hierarchical sequential decision task  \nis ubiquitous in AI. Even supervised learning, e.g. active learning,  \noften fits this framework.\n\n\n-- Joe\n\n"}}
