I just looked up \nGomoku here... http://www.thaistudents.com/fun/gomoku/ where it states \n&quot;it has been proven that the player who moves second can always win, if \nhe or she plays perfectly. At the Expert level, the TacTix program will \nindeed play a perfect game&quot;. If this is right then you have the option \nof evaluation against a perfect algorithm. To be honest though I think \nit would be more fun to find a game for which there exist no good \nalgorithmic players, you then have the possibility of finding a \nbest-ever player :)\n\nI have thought a little about board games. I was thinking about the \n&#39;roving eye&#39; technique which overcomes the problem of a large input \nspace and board size scalability. I wonder if it could be improved by \nproviding a further set of inputs that provide a sort of density map of \npieces (and their type, e.g. black or white) on the board. So say we \nstart with a 4x4 board, we could actually have 4x4 inputs (in addition \nto the roving eye) that describe the board state completely - but as we \nincrease the board size we keep the same 4x4 inputs, and so they \neffectively give a rough idea of where the pieces are on the board. I \nwas thinking about how a person gauges a game&#39;s state - you first look \nat the whole board and then focus in on the interesting areas.\n\nAnother less well formed idea is to think of how nature deals with the \nhigh input space from our own eyes. A large amount of image processing \noccurs which reduces the high input space information down to the \nposition and size of lines, boundaries and objects. Perhaps we could \nconvert the normal x by y grid state into a more digestable form using a \nsimilar technique. E.g. in Go lines of pieces are quite important, so \nperhaps we could provide the network with data describing where lines are.\n\n&gt;For our GECCO paper, we used direct evolution, i.e., we calculated the\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIs this the paper investigating node/connection deletion mutations? Is \nit available yet?\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
