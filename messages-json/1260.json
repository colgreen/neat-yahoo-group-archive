Do you want to implement an \nactual search engine where a search phrase is input and a load of \nresults are output? or do you want to somehow extend the results from an \nexisting search engine?\n\nColin\n\nRoger Smith wrote:\n\n&gt;Hey all,\n&gt;I am going to rephrase my question.\n&gt;I guess what I am trying to figure out is if I should\n&gt;have a SearchController which has &quot;The Brain&quot; (the\n&gt;neural net) and then when it searches it filters the\n&gt;search results through the weights to get the ranking\n&gt;OR \n&gt;does each Search result have a brain?\n&gt;Any thoughts, ideas?\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Rog\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
