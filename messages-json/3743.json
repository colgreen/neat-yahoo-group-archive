Ken Lloyd&#39;s last\ntwo messages and Kirk&#39;s last message were all held pending moderator\napproval because of suspected spam.\n\nThis shouldn&#39;t be an issue, because this list requires\nmoderator-approved membership, so I&#39;d rather spam just go through,\nwhich would simply allow me to boot any account sending spam. If\nanything, the spam filter should be very relaxed. Also, stupidly, the\nspam filter doesn&#39;t have a &quot;NOT SPAM&quot; indicator for non-spam messages,\nso it doesn&#39;t appear to have a corrective method for identifying good\nmessages.\n\nI&#39;ll see if there&#39;s anything I can do to remedy the situation, but it\njust may be crappy design on Yahoo&#39;s part. A couple of suggestions for\nposting:\n\n1) Try to limit the amount of quoted text in your messages. If\nadvertisements are hanging on the end of long strings of quoted text,\nthis may be causing problems for the spam filter.\n\n2) Avoid signatures...they shouldn&#39;t cause spam issues, but that might\nbe doing it.\n\n3) E-mail me directly at djames@... if your posted message\ndoesn&#39;t go through within 24 hours. Messages are sometimes delayed,\nbut one should never be delayed over a day.\n\nSorry for the problems...but keep up the conversation. :)\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
