Previously, the last input of every new genome was marked as &#39;bias&#39; and treated specially, like links from the bias are not split, etc. When this parameter is true, this doesn&#39;t happen anymore and all inputs are treated equal. You may still input 1.0 all the time on one node and then this would be a bias.\n  \n  * New Parameters::AllowLoops parameter and Genome::HasLoops() method. If AllowLoops is false, it is guaranteed all genomes in the population will be directed acyclic graphs, so computing the depth is straightforward and there is no recurrence. Just disabling recurrent links doesn&#39;t fix the problem of recurrence still appearing in the population in the form of looped pathways like the links A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, C-&gt;A, which is very annoying if one wants to compute the depth to ensure NN output relaxation (to activate this many times), but AllowLoops totally fixes it. I find it particularly useful with CPPNs. The way I used to query the CPPN was with activating it a fixed number of steps (~8) and hoping no longer pathways will appear in the population (and whenever they do, it results in sort of a defective phenotype as the input never reaches the output through some of the nodes). You might want to know how I keep the algorithm going with this topology constraint. It&#39;s simple: if a mu\n tation or crossover results in a genome that has loops, try again (new crossover/mutation) until it meets the constraints. I also refactored the code a bit so new constraints can be added with less effort.\n  \n  * OpenAI Gym examples. I&#39;ve been playing around with Gym for a few months now, but only recently took the time to add some examples. For most of these you&#39;ll need PyBox2D installed. I got the Lunar Lander to work, which is nice, but the indeterministic environment is a bitch and NEAT doesn&#39;t work really well with that (the same genome getting different fitness every time..), unless I average the fitness over many trials (15 seems to be good for Lunar Lander), which increases computational requirements. I&#39;d love to try those other environments with bipedal walking and stuff, but I don&#39;t have the required simulation software to run them, so it&#39;s Box2D examples for now.  \n  I&#39;m continuing to add new features and clean bugs, but it&#39;s kinda really slow paced as I need to take care of work. Something I&#39;m planning next is universal traits that can be attached to nodes and links, so it essentially becomes a library capable of evolving any graph, not just NNs. First they&#39;ll piggyback on top of current code, like just something else you can add to neurons and connections, and then stuff like weights, time constants, internal biases, activation functions, learning parameters and pretty much everything will become part of that system, so neural networks are then only one (but still the default) setup. More examples for the current code will be committed to the repo occasionally.\n  \n  Best regards,\n  \n  Peter  \n \r\n------=_Part_1619648_1694727128.1490874284382\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;\nHi all,&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have committed the followin=\r\ng new features to MultiNEAT&#39;s github repo:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;* New P=\r\narameters::DontUseBiasNeuron parameter.
