In other words, once a continuous policy is discovered that does okay, =\r\nit might be hard to break away from that mold.  On the other hand, represen=\r\ntation also plays a role in the bias of the encoding towards continuity or =\r\ndiscontinuity, so that bias will still influence the outcome even with nove=\r\nlty search.  However, it&#39;s important to note that representations that are =\r\nexplicitly designed to easily represent discontinuity are likely to be sacr=\r\nificing the ability to represent and elaborate on regularities.  That is, t=\r\nhere may be a subtle trade-off, so it is important to be careful about givi=\r\nng too much weight to the need to capture discontinuity.  We can see in Pic=\r\nbreeder that CPPNs can produce patterns with clear regional differentiation=\r\n, so the issue is certainly further complicated by the means by which evolu=\r\ntion was performed.\n\nIt is also likely that in the real world highly fractu=\r\nred problems are not solved entirely through genetics.  That is, synaptic p=\r\nlasticity probably plays a big role, complicating the issue further.  For e=\r\nxample, it is possible that the pattern of plasticity rules itself is not f=\r\nractured but that the weight pattern expressed by those synapses becomes fr=\r\nactured over the course of adaptation.  Thus the encoding itself would not =\r\nneed to express an explicitly fractured concept.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry to restar=\r\nt my previous line of questioning (and keep asking very\n&gt; basic questions),=\r\n but I was just reading into novelty search, and I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering how this a=\r\npplies to discontinuity/fractured problem domains.\n&gt; Searching through the =\r\nuser group archives I didn&#39;t find any specific\n&gt; mention of the application=\r\n of novelty search to complex problems with\n&gt; the discontinuity/fractured d=\r\nomain characteristics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand the benefit of novelty search in a=\r\nreas with &quot;deceptive&quot;\n&gt; stepping stones towards a better solution, where fi=\r\ntness-neat can get\n&gt; stuck in a local maxima solution (the maze example was=\r\n particularly\n&gt; helpful).\n&gt; \n&gt; Does novelty search work better in problems =\r\nwith discontinuity?\n&gt; \n&gt; From what I&#39;ve read, many complex/interesting prob=\r\nlems run into\n&gt; discontinuity, and standard fitness-neat performs poorly, b=\r\nut I also\n&gt; just watched Ken&#39;s talk on novelty search, and he mentioned tha=\r\nt most\n&gt; complex problems also run into deception issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Mar =\r\n25, 2011 at 12:55 PM, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; On 25 March=\r\n 2011 12:51, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Just =\r\ncurious as I&#39;ve been thinking about this a bit lately (I&#39;m new to NEAT stuf=\r\nf), as it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; seems that the micro mutations you talk about, if I&#39;m=A0inte=\r\nrpreting=A0papers right, is one of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the reasons standard NEAT doesn&#39;t h=\r\nandle fractured domain problems well. As you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; say, it can&#39;t &quot;get there =\r\nfrom here&quot;. It can&#39;t build enough structure and optimize it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performa=\r\nnce to find a better solution before that species dies out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actuall=\r\ny &quot;fractured domains&quot; wasn&#39;t a term I was aware of, however I\n&gt; &gt; just read=\r\n this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =A0 Evolving Neural Networks for Fractured Domains (2008), N=\r\nate Kohl\n&gt; &gt; and Risto Miikkulainen.\n&gt; &gt; =A0 http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downlo=\r\nads/papers/kohl.gecco08.pdf\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So fractured domains =3D discontinuity.=\r\n And yes I would say that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; definitely a major problem with NEAT (not s=\r\nure about HyperNEAT). I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; interested in their use of radial basis funct=\r\nions, which is something\n&gt; &gt; that has been mentioned before on this group b=\r\nut not something that\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve looked into deeply.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is this the pro=\r\nblem you&#39;re looking to address here? Or just a method of escaping a local\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; maxima in fitness by allowing more radical adjustments/growth to networ=\r\nk topologies in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; general?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well it&#39;s essentially the same thing =\r\nif discontinuity is the reason\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re stuck - which is very often the c=\r\nase I would say. Complex\n&gt; &gt; fitness lanscapes are almsot by definition &#39;fr=\r\nactured&#39; (As an exercise\n&gt; &gt; try and think up a complex landscape/domain th=\r\nat isnlt fractured).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing I was wondering about, and I haven&#39;=\r\nt poked around to see if anyone has done\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some research into, is fiddli=\r\nng with the species die-off parameter. I was thinking it might\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be wort=\r\nh trying (if someone hasn&#39;t done it yet), is to remove the species die off =\r\nif-hasn&#39;t-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; improved-in X generations bit if no species fitness has imp=\r\nroved in some specified\n&gt; &gt;&gt; amount of generations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t expe=\r\nct this to be a major issue where we are right now. If\n&gt; &gt; a species hasn&#39;t=\r\n improved in a long time then it&#39;s probability of\n&gt; &gt; improving in a furthe=\r\nr equally long time is low. Evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; techniques constarined by comp=\r\nuting resources are always a\n&gt; &gt; probabilities game - you try and spend you=\r\nr limited CPU time searching\n&gt; &gt; the areas of the space that have the highe=\r\nst probabilities of yielding\n&gt; &gt; good solutions. This same argument sort of=\r\n applies to the idea of\n&gt; &gt; increasing populations - from one perspective t=\r\nhe size of the\n&gt; &gt; population is irrelevant as you can only evaluate some f=\r\nixed number of\n&gt; &gt; genomes per unit of time. The main effect of pop size is=\r\n thus to\n&gt; &gt; provide a broader genetic base to drive genetic crossover and =\r\nto keep\n&gt; &gt; an as diverse as possible population of search points across th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; fitness landscape.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I think if you&#39;ve sat with the same &quot;=\r\nchampion&quot; for a large number of generations, it could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be worthwhile to=\r\n do something radical, like greatly increase mutations,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Agreed. Jus=\r\nt generally - if a search is stuck then &#39;do something else&#39;\n&gt; &gt; would seem =\r\nto be good advice :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure someone has toyed with this at s=\r\nome point. I can always use another couple\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hundred of pages of papers/=\r\ndissertations to add to my &quot;to-be-read&quot; pile going into my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thesis :)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think others have played with dynamic mutation rate. The probl=\r\nem I\n&gt; &gt; think is that there may not be any easy routes out of a local maxi=\r\nma,\n&gt; &gt; increasing mutations will sample points a little further out than\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; before but it&#39;s potentially clutching at straws in many cases. The\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nther way of looking at it is that the encoding space or the fitness\n&gt; &gt; lan=\r\ndscape (sort of teh same thing) could be changed such that there\n&gt; &gt; are ea=\r\nsier routes to the good solutions - that&#39;s essentially what the\n&gt; &gt; radial =\r\nbasis function paper above is doing - your nets can;&#39; get there\n&gt; &gt; from he=\r\nre, so use a different type of net.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Colin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
