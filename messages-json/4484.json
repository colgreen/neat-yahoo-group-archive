JNEAT is bas=\r\ned on my original \nNEAT\n&gt; C++ code, and I believe the variable names are ma=\r\ninly equivalent.  \nIf\n&gt; you are collecting stats or looking for the overall=\r\n champ, then\n&gt; &quot;orig_fitness&quot; is probably what you care about.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;matthias.linhardt&quot; &lt;faulerlennert@&gt;\n&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello everyone!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t want to start a new topic, so=\r\n I post in this existing \n&gt; &gt; thread. Here it comes:\n&gt; &gt; First of all, I&#39;m =\r\nusing the Java version of NEAT (JNEAT), maybe \nthe \n&gt; &gt; fitness variables a=\r\nre named differently in the C+ NEAT, but I \nthink \n&gt; &gt; you will all underst=\r\nand my question. It&#39;s about the difference \n&gt; &gt; between the two variables &quot;=\r\nfitness&quot; and &quot;orig_fitness&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; The way I understand this is the followin=\r\ng:\n&gt; &gt; 1a. orig_fitness is the organism&#39;s real fitness value, which is \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n determined only once, when the organism is created and evaluated.\n&gt; &gt; 1b. =\r\norig_fitness never changes.\n&gt; &gt; 2a. fitness, on the other hand, is subject =\r\nof later adjustments. \nTwo \n&gt; &gt; processes can change the value of fitness: =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 2b. First, fitness is divided among the subjects of the same \nspecies,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; meaning the more organisms in one species, the lower the fitness.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 2c. Second, age_significance allows nishing by raising the \nfitness of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; young organisms.\n&gt; &gt; 3. When deciding which organism is better than anoth=\r\ner, \norig_fitness \n&gt; &gt; is the only logic choice. Fitness is only a internal=\r\n value for \nNEAT \n&gt; &gt; and not important for me, who wants only the one and =\r\nonly best \n&gt; &gt; organism at the end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If someone could help me out a=\r\nnd tell me if all of the above \n&gt; &gt; assumptions are correct (or in case the=\r\ny are not explain to me \nhow it \n&gt; &gt; is) I would be very happy. \n&gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n a lot!\n&gt; &gt; With best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Matthias\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
