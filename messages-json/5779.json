Even if they are not=\r\n explicitly about NEAT/HyperNEAT they may touch on topics of interest here =\r\nlike plasticity.  But I wouldn&#39;t stray too much off the general issues of c=\r\noncern to neuroevolution.  Note that this group is actually run by Derek Ja=\r\nmes, who has done a great job for many years, so his view of this question =\r\nis likely the &quot;official&quot; word.\n\nGood luck on your Ph.D.,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Thanks for your reply.

In\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; my feverish excitement I thought it would be a good idea to start a blog =\r\non\n&gt; &gt; questions and issues I come across, in the hope that other active\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; researchers will want to comment on and perhaps even start a bit of\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nialogue about them (like this mailing list but more public). I know\n&gt; &gt; ano=\r\nther Ph.D. candidate who keeps a similar blog (totally different\n&gt; &gt; resear=\r\nch area, though) and it&#39;s working out great for her, so it didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; seem =\r\nlike a completely hopeless idea...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I know some of you are inter=\r\nested in the evolution of adaptive NNs, I\n&gt; &gt; read your articles as soon as=\r\n they were posted to this group! :) I also\n&gt; &gt; envisage using NEAT and vari=\r\nants in the research (I did a study of some of\n&gt; &gt; the properties of HyperN=\r\nEAT for my Honours year a year or so ago). It&#39;s at\n&gt; &gt; http://ojcoleman.com=\r\n. The first post is mostly background info (I hope I\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t get anythin=\r\ng too wrong, let me know if you think I did!) and what\n&gt; &gt; the research is =\r\nabout, but it also explains why I think the proposed\n&gt; &gt; approach is a good=\r\n idea which might provide some good controversy points\n&gt; &gt; (maybe not so mu=\r\nch among this crowd, however).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I googled around and couldn&#39;t fi=\r\nnd all that many relevant blogs. Do any\n&gt; &gt; of you keep a similar blog or k=\r\nnow of any?
