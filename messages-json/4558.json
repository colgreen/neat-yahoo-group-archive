It&#39;s another clear win for\nHyperNEAT and in an area with commercialisation opportunities I would\nsuggest.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n2009/2/15 Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt;:\n\n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n\nI think most would agree that biped is more difficult because of the\nneed to maintain balance, something which probably requires slightly\ndifferent strategies for different speeds - certainly between walking\nand running - and for acceleration and deceleration.\n\n\n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic gaits\n[...]\n&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period for a short while and it was a\n&gt; miserable failure.\n\nWas the period encoded into each genome or a global experiment\nvariable? Perhaps you could try using one of the free outputs as the\nsine wave period?\n\n\n&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n\nI suspect the need for them is reduced by your use of a PID\ncontroller. Without a hard coded PID controller on each joint the\nleaky integrators may allow the neural net to evolve that\nfunctionality, and perhaps improve on the standard PID approach.\n\nAlso if we were using a recursive neural net then leaky integrators\nshould (I think) allow the network to generate a since wave\ninternally, thus removing the need for an externally provided wave.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
