Thus I don&#39;t waste time performing 1000 tests on poor \ngenomes. \n&gt; An alternative would be to keep testing until the first failed \ntest, but \n&gt; I don;t think this is as good since the proportion of tests passed \nin \n&gt; the first 100 cases gives some idea of relative fitness between \npoor \n&gt; genomes - which is all of the genomes at the start of evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThis sounds like a good idea.  I will keep it in mind.  You know, \nultimately what we are up against is just the fact that no sample \ncan be guaranteed to perfectly represent its generating distribution.\nIt&#39;s likely there will always be extraordinary situations that were \nnot encountered in whatever training set was experienced during \nevolution.  At the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do better, \nit just means reaching exactly 100% of all possible test cases is \nunlikely for complicated problems or domains.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
