Some of these \n&gt;vehicles are quite large and heavy and the competition required them to \n&gt;move at an average of 25mph to complete the course within the alloted \n&gt;time frame. Therefore any NN in the real world would be needing to make \n&gt;decisions based on a point just ahead of the vehicle NOT the current \n&gt;position.  One of the vehicles veers towards the cameraman (safely \n&gt;behind a concrete barrier) and then brakes abruptly just before the \n&gt;barrier - the AI displayed good knowledge of the vehicle&#39;s breaking \n&gt;distance! (or perhaps just luck)\n&gt;\n&gt;I tend to think that this kind of problem can be decomposed into \n&gt;distinct layered functions:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) GPS tells us the distance and brearing of the destination point. High \n&gt;level code tells next layer down these variables. Simple traditional bit \n&gt;of software.\n&gt;2) Analysing that model and generating high level control decisions.\n&gt;3) Converting high level navigation decsisions into control signals that \n&gt;drive the steering and power.\n&gt;\n&gt;2 & 3 then can be broken down into:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) Converting sensor input into an internal model/representation of the \n&gt;real world.\n&gt;2) Anaylsis of local terrain results in a local high-level navigation \n&gt;decision - e.g. layer 1 says go north, but there is a wall in the way, \n&gt;layer 2 analysis therefore would decide to go east.\n&gt;3) Convert layer 2 output into vehicle control signals.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s my opinion that the sort of simplified models we tend to use for \n&gt;NEAT type projects are ideally suited to evolving NN based controllers \n&gt;that can be used for the high level control decisions AND the very low \n&gt;level stuff such as converting the local navigation task into control \n&gt;signals to drive the vehicle. The stuff in between such as building of \n&gt;the physical world model from sensor data is more suited to traditional \n&gt;software development, though it&#39;s also worth a try.\n&gt;\n&gt;Each of these tasks on it&#39;s own is (hopefully) a reasonably simple model \n&gt;and can be evolved/developed independently of the others - and when put \n&gt;together I see no reason why they wouldn&#39;t be applicable to the real \n&gt;world problem of controling a real vehicle.\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
