What&#39;s even more important is that fitness \nsharing in species protects innovation, and that allows  \ncomplexification that otherwise wouldn&#39;t occur.  The point is: it \ntakes longer to optimize a larger structure, so if you want larger \nstructures to get a fair chance of being used, they need to be \nprotected so that they can realize their potential.  Otherwise, in \nthe short run, they will appear inferior and get bumped out of the \npopulation.  Fitness sharing provides such protection.\n\nAnother useful thing about speciation, as I mentioned in my previous \npost, is that it prevents bloat.  It ensures that small genomes will \npersist as long as they are competitive, since they won&#39;t be mixing \nwith, and don&#39;t have to compete directly for offspring with other \nmore complex species.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
