He had an &quot;eye&quot; move\n&gt; over a\n&gt; &gt;shape to identify the shape.  I thought he had\n&gt; uploaded his\n&gt; &gt;experiments.cpp file to the files section, but it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be\n&gt; &gt;there now.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is still there, in the Files section\n&gt; (shaperecog.zip, at the bottom of\n&gt; the list), and it gave me very good results. I did\n&gt; explain in some detail\n&gt; how the experiment worked in an earlier post: I&#39;ll\n&gt; fish it out if anyone\n&gt; wants to see it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have done some more fiddling with NEAT since then,\n&gt; incidentally. I had a\n&gt; few goes at seeing if I could get NEAT to evolve a\n&gt; net which could look at a\n&gt; sequence of numbers and then generate a program in a\n&gt; simple programming\n&gt; language to generate that sequence. Results have not\n&gt; been very promising,\n&gt; mainly because I&#39;ve found it difficult to give the\n&gt; network a smooth learning\n&gt; curve. Making improvements early on seems to require\n&gt; quite a leap of\n&gt; complexity, and I&#39;m not sure how to solve it. I&#39;ll\n&gt; go into more detail\n&gt; separately if anyone&#39;s curious.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Darren\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
