Anyway this \nsituation should be resolvable by extending the trials to contain \nfurther more difficult tests or by switching completely to a more \ndifficult trial  i.e.incremental evolution.  In fact I may be able to \nrevert to my original randomized trials once a good population has been \nfound.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
