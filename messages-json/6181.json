They&#39;re lightwei=\r\nght and cheap to simulate, making them a convenient research platform.  In =\r\nthis paper, HyperNEAT combined with novelty search + local competition find=\r\ns a large variety of interesting creatures with diverse ambulation strategi=\r\nes in a single run.  \n\nOne of the coolest results of this paper is an inter=\r\nactive website where you can see a visualization of the whole space of evol=\r\nved creatures all at once (generated through PCA), and click on individual =\r\npoints to see the corresponding creature in action:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/ecal13/demo/PCA.html\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
