I don&#39;t take a lot of money there, but I like my current \njob b=\r\necause I have enough free time for working on my own stuff :)\nI&#39;m a hobbyis=\r\nt in programming since the age of 10. My interest on AI \nis significant. I =\r\ndon&#39;t make money with this whole thing, it is just \nthe passion.. you know =\r\n:) \n\nWhen I first learned about NEAT, I already had done many experiments \n=\r\nwith NNs, (never GAs). But, as I realized what in fact is NEAT, I \nstarted =\r\nto love it, seriosly. I&#39;ve read every paper you put out in \nthe Internet (a=\r\nnd many times), even the PowerPoint slides from your \nwebsite. :)\n\nSo, what=\r\n I wanted to say is, during the last year, I did a lot of \nNEAT research on=\r\n my own, like &quot;can it do this? can it do that?&quot;.. \nThat were days that I wa=\r\ns only thinking of some new stuff to put NEAT \nevolving NNs into :)\n\nI was =\r\ntweaking the code a lot, too.. Damn, I know every piece of it.. \nIt&#39;s just =\r\nthat I&#39;m lazy so I didn&#39;t write my own version of NEAT but \nuse your releas=\r\ne :)\n\nThe last papers, explaining the concept of CPPNs, opened my \nimaginat=\r\nion even more. I was even planing to make some Alife \napplications involvin=\r\ng CPPNs, but the papers for HyperNEAT were \nreleased, so I decided to repla=\r\nce NEAT with HyperNEAT on most of my \nprojects, to see what happens :) I lo=\r\nve experimenting with this \nstuff. It is in fact taking me away from work s=\r\nometimes, my boss \ntells me &quot;Check out and fix this code&quot;, but I run an evo=\r\nlution \ninstead :D\n\nI implemented HyperNEAT for a couple of hours, I didn&#39;t=\r\n write it from \nscratch, but added it to the existing NEAT code I am curren=\r\ntly \nmaintaining.\n\nI am happy to know that this had impressed you :) It was=\r\n not a lot of \nwork, really :) There is so much more to do ;)\nAnd let me te=\r\nll you that I am.. like a fan. :) I am losing patience \nto see your next pa=\r\nper and future directions of research :) And I \nwill keep you and the whole=\r\n community informed about everything new \nand/or cool, that I manage to dis=\r\ncover and/or adopt in \napplications :) \n\nCheers, \nPeter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, if you don&#39;t=\r\n mind my asking, what kind of work do you do for \na \n&gt; living?  Is your wor=\r\nk with NEAT/HyperNEAT in your spare time or \ndoes \n&gt; it have a relation to =\r\nyour job?  I&#39;m curious since you got it all \n&gt; implemented so fast that it&#39;=\r\ns impressive.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; An interesting thing to mention, yes=\r\nterday I was playing with my \n&gt; &gt; Humans experiment. I took a CPPN that pro=\r\nduces a CTRNN exhibiting \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;mexican wave&quot; behaviour. I scaled up the s=\r\nubstrate to \n&gt; &gt; approximately 200 hidden nodes. The &quot;mexican wave&quot; pattern=\r\n was \n&gt; &gt; preserved! And more, even the direction of the wave was the same!=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_cher=\r\nvenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was just thinking about =\r\nNERO. I suddenly made the connection \n&gt; &gt; between \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sensor placeme=\r\nnts and the substrates for the robot \nexperiment \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;=\r\ns paper. It is so similar. So I begin to think.. \nWhat \n&gt; &gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; NE=\r\nRO, but using HyperNEAT? The substrates can be made \n&gt; geometrically \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n similar to the.. enivonment, you know what I mean. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will try to im=\r\nplement a 2D version of something similar to \n&gt; NERO, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with =\r\nleaky integrator neurons, because there every node has a \n&gt; bias \n&gt; &gt; and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to care about where to place the bias unit in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n substrate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, I have the following idea. During evolution, in=\r\n the \n&gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generations (in the rtNEAT case, the first N minutes o=\r\nf \n&gt; evolution), \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrates will be simple, with low node c=\r\nounts. Then, given a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; threshold (num. of generations/time), the progr=\r\nam will \n&gt; &gt; automatically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; scale up the substrate to a higher densit=\r\ny. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions/ideas about that? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
