I&#39;m currently using a continuous-time\nrecurrent neural network (CTRNN) with &quot;leaky\nintegrator neurons&quot;, which has the property of\nproducing smooth rhythmic outputs.  This might already\nbe capable of doing what your oscillation nodes idea\nwould do.  I&#39;ll keep it in mind, though.  Maybe an\noscillation node could be a cheaper representation of\na whole sub-network of recurrent connections.\n\nTyler\n\n--- John Arrowwood &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On this subject, I had an idea that you may or may\n&gt; not want to consider...\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a &#39;bias&#39; input node that helps all the\n&gt; others alter their behavior \n&gt; by learning an appropriate weight.  What if there\n&gt; were other such &#39;utility&#39; \n&gt; inputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, a random input node.  Either assign it\n&gt; a random value at the \n&gt; beginning of an each activation, or have its value\n&gt; change every time it is \n&gt; read.  The network will, of course, evolve to\n&gt; minimize the weights to the \n&gt; random node.  But the presence of random\n&gt; fluctuations in the environment \n&gt; will force it to adopt a different strategy of\n&gt; execution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without it, the network could (and is likely to)\n&gt; evolve into something that \n&gt; just replays a set of motions that happen to work\n&gt; while in the fitness \n&gt; evaluation environment.  Change any factor, and it\n&gt; may completely fail.  You \n&gt; could get around that by testing it in a variety of\n&gt; environments.  Then, an \n&gt; already lengthy fitness evaluation cycle is\n&gt; magnified many times over.  But \n&gt; forcing it to evolve in the presence of noise within\n&gt; its own system will \n&gt; force it to adopt a more adaptive approach to\n&gt; accomplishing what it is being \n&gt; asked to do.  You will get a network that can\n&gt; accomodate obstacles or rough \n&gt; terrain without necessarily having to test for it\n&gt; from the beginning.  Not \n&gt; only that, but the presence of minor variations,\n&gt; imperfections within the \n&gt; gait, may make the result look more natural.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another idea is &#39;oscillation&#39; nodes.  An input node\n&gt; that returns sin(x+=n) \n&gt; where n controls how fast it oscillates.  Or a\n&gt; hidden node that does the \n&gt; same thing, but where the value of &#39;n&#39; is based on\n&gt; the inputs, so it can \n&gt; speed up or slow down depending on what the rest of\n&gt; the network indicates.  \n&gt; The oscillating input will give it a sense of time. \n&gt; The oscillating hidden \n&gt; node will give it the ability to go through cycles,\n&gt; but adapt those cycles \n&gt; as needed, and in a way that is probably more\n&gt; adaptive than a recurrent \n&gt; network could accomplish.  It might well accomplish\n&gt; more with less topology \n&gt; with the availability of such structures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such variations would be almost trivial to\n&gt; implement, and could potentially \n&gt; have far-reaching influence on the resulting\n&gt; evolutions.  Of course, the \n&gt; only way to know if the benefits outweight the\n&gt; increase in search-space is \n&gt; to actually implement them and see.  I would be\n&gt; willing to bet that the \n&gt; random input would be worth the effort for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!
