It&#39;s interes=\r\nting to that George Marsaglia&#39;s KISS \nRNG\n&gt; is given the thumbs up, I used =\r\nhis XOR shift algorithm as the basis\n&gt; for my FastRandom class in SharpNeat=\r\n. I may well switch over to \nusing\n&gt; the KISS algorithm though based on the=\r\n discussion in this article. \nOh\n&gt; and also someone made a comment on the c=\r\nodeproject page where\n&gt; FastRandom lives - &quot;Worst ever random generator!...=\r\nPasses FIPS 140-1\n&gt; with approximately 0.7 %. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure why this guy =\r\nwas so passionate about RNG&#39;s but I do intend \nto\n&gt; check out this FIPS tes=\r\nt one day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall though I don&#39;t think NEAT is going to be particular=\r\nly harmed\n&gt; by the kind of flaws inherent in some of these RNGs. For most o=\r\nf \nwhat\n&gt; we do we just want uniformly distributed numbers to mix things up=\r\n a\n&gt; bit. Any patterns in the generated sequence probably aren&#39;t\n&gt; particul=\r\narly detrimental IMHO. Interested to know if others agree or\n&gt; not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Co=\r\nlin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
