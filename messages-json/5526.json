In fact both o=\r\nur introductory papers on novelty search (ALIFE-08 and ECJ 11) include sect=\r\nions that explicitly cite prior work in open-ended evolution as an inspirat=\r\nion for novelty search.  There is no doubt that they share many principles.=\r\n\n\nCreative systems such as interactive evolution also share many principles=\r\n with novelty search, which is the inspiration for the publication at the r=\r\noot of this discussion thread.  So certainly we don&#39;t want to imply that no=\r\nvelty search is the first to explore open-endedness or creativity in evolut=\r\nion (much of my own work is even in creative evolutionary systems outside n=\r\novelty search).  In fact, we view novelty search as a complement to the wor=\r\nk in this area.  Diversity-preservation-mechanisms (such as speciation) and=\r\n coevolution also relate to novelty search in various ways.\n\nHowever, novel=\r\nty search is the only generic (i.e. domain-general) evolutionary algorithm =\r\nwe know of that explicitly rewards phenotypic novelty and only novelty with=\r\n no other criteria and no awareness of the objective whatsoever (many such =\r\nprior algorithms combine objective criteria with a drive towards diversity)=\r\n.  To our knowledge it is also the first time that such an open-ended appro=\r\nach was used to show that many problems considered objective can be transfo=\r\nrmed into non-objective problems that are actually solved better without an=\r\n objective (which remains a controversial yet useful discussion point).  \n\n=\r\nIf you would like to share another algorithm that is similar then that&#39;s gr=\r\neat (the book you cited is a survey of many systems, and I don&#39;t know of a =\r\nspecific example in that book that works like novelty search).  Of course, =\r\nafter four years of publication reviews I would be surprised to see somethi=\r\nng with the same exact mechanism that our reviewers did not catch, but it&#39;s=\r\n a big world and you never know.  However, I would not be surprised to see =\r\nmany related ideas - of course open-ended evolution and creative evolutiona=\r\nry systems share much of the same inspiration as novelty search.  Our hope =\r\nwas in effect to distill the core essence of such systems into the simplest=\r\n possible heuristic to make its study and applicability as easy and univers=\r\nal as possible.\n\nIt&#39;s probably also useful to note that the motivation for =\r\nstarting this discussion for me was not to argue that novelty search is &quot;su=\r\nperior.&quot;  Rather I think its generality and simplicity make it a useful dev=\r\nice for investigating the impact of our field&#39;s longstanding loyalty to obj=\r\nective-driven algorithms and evaluation standards, in particular in domains=\r\n that are considered &quot;objective.&quot;  If other approaches also contribute to t=\r\nhat discussion then all the better!\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ge=\r\nne Merdock &lt;genemerdock@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; But these open ende=\r\nd evolution algorithms have been applied to &quot;wherever you want&quot; outside\n&gt;  =\r\nalife, for a long time now[1].

However, the b=\r\nig difference for novelty search is that it brings open-endedness to any do=\r\nmain.  For open-ended alife, you have to create a competitive simulated wor=\r\nld and see what happens within it. With novelty search you can get open-end=\r\ned dynamics wherever you want, without needing to define an alife scenario.=\r\n  So we can run novelty search on traditional machine learning domains like=\r\n biped robots, mazes, pole-balancers, etc., and thereby unlock our interest=\r\n in open-ended discovery from the exclusive province of artificial life.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The other significant difference is that novelty search explicit=\r\nly drives evolution towards novelty, while the pressure in alife worlds is =\r\nimplicit, which means it is harder to control.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Gene Merdock &lt;genemerdock@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Both environmental complexity and Survive & Reproduce are aspects that h=\r\nave for at least a decade been explored and written about (core wars, polyw=\r\norld...).

So I think we can clarify the argument\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; by drawing a distinction between surviving/reproducing and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n /strategies/ that lead to surviving and reproducing. I think perhaps\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; we (or I) have conflated the two. Survive/reproduce is the high l=\r\nevel\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; [implicit] objective that is always present, and surviv=\r\nal /strategy/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; is what we normally refer to as objective or g=\r\noal in EC.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So far there&#39;s no distinction bet=\r\nween nature/biology and EC. To my\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; mind nature has found comp=\r\nlex /strategies/ for survival because:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A) Va=\r\nstly more computational resource (or equivalent) [per unit time].\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; B) Vastly more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; C) Vastly more complex domain.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s this latter point that I feel has tended =\r\nto be overlooked. If you\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; consider every living thing alive t=\r\noday and trace back through all of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; their ancestors, then eve=\r\nry single one of those zillions of organisms\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; executed a succ=\r\nessful strategy that lead to survival. Considerably\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; more org=\r\nanisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; world does try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; generation at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; those poor strategies in the hope of finding something better.=\r\n What\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; does happen though is that stragies are so complex (fo=\r\nr creatures with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; large brains anyway) that they can incorpor=\r\nate successful parts (find\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; food) and yet waste much time on =\r\npoor sub-strategies (effectively\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; stragey efficiency). Evolut=\r\nion will select for efficiency but unlike\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; survival it&#39;s not =\r\na binary yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; more like=\r\n the small low scoring species in NEAT (from fitness\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; sharing=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies t=\r\nhat fit your idea of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; searching with no objective, they piggy=\r\n back on for the ride and very\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; occasionally become useful. W=\r\nhere EC tends to fall short IMO is that\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the domain complexit=\r\ny is vastly lower than the natural world so\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s less opp=\r\nortunty for exploring variations in strategy -\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; branching off=\r\n into multiple successful branches and sub-branches\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; without =\r\na major loss in fitness on the objective. Put another way, the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; natural world&#39;s fitness landscape is dominated by smooth undulations\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; in all dimensions, whereas EC objectives tend to have a few\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; sharp/steep local maxima.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nature=\r\n also provides a gentle selection pressure towards complex\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\ntrategies by providing resources that require increasingly complex\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; strategies to reach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evol=\r\nve\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; legs ang lungs. And you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without=\r\n evolving\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; good eyes and fast/strong muscles, etc. but the pl=\r\nants and meat were\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; there as an untapped resource until that =\r\nfirst legged creature and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; first carnivore came along. So we =\r\ncan see now that framing the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; survival as being an objective =\r\nthat&#39;s been achieved on day one misses\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; a lot of the key dyna=\r\nmics that drive evolution.
