The candidates are expected to contribute to the=\r\n ResiBots ERC project (see below).\n\n\nABOUT THE PROJECT (ERC RESIBOTS)\nA maj=\r\nor obstacle to the widespread adoption of robots is their fragility. The tr=\r\naditional approach to damage recovery is  to diagnose the damage, then plan=\r\n a response; a promising alternative involves having robots learn by trial-=\r\nand-error appropriate behaviors in response to damage. In the ResiBots ERC =\r\nproject, we design novel learning algorithms that allow autonomous robots t=\r\no adapt to damage in a few minutes, and without requiring self-diagnosis or=\r\n pre-specified contingency plans. \n\nThe first result have been published on=\r\n the cover of Nature in May 2015:\nCully, A., J. Clune, D. Tarapore, and J.-=\r\nB. Mouret. &quot;Robots that can adapt like animals.&quot; Nature 521, no. 7553 (2015=\r\n): 503-507. [free pdf: http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3501]\n\nVideo: https://www.=\r\nyoutube.com/watch?v=3DT-c17RKh3uE\n\nThe project started in May 2015 and is a=\r\nmply funded for the next 5 years. The team is made a full-time researcher (=\r\nPI, Jean-Baptiste Mouret), 1 full-time engineer dedicated to the project, 2=\r\n PhD students, 1 engineer, and 1-2 post-docs. The official language of the =\r\nteam is English (several members of the team do not speak French at all).\n\n=\r\nABOUT THE APPLICANT\nA successful Post-doc applicant should have a strong ro=\r\nbotics and/or machine learning and/or evolutionary computation background w=\r\nith a track record of top-tier research publications, including relevant co=\r\nnferences (e.g., RSS, ICRA, IROS or ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, NIPS, GECCO, ALIFE) =\r\nand journals (e.g., AURO, TRo, IJRR or JMLR, MLJ, Neural Computation, ECJ, =\r\nTEC). \n\nA Ph.D. in Computer Science, Electrical or Mechanical Engineering, =\r\nor another field clearly related to robotics and/or machine learning is a m=\r\nust.\n  \nExpertise (and strong interest) in working with real robot systems =\r\nis a big plus for all applicants. A robotics engineer is dedicated to the p=\r\nroject, but strong C++ & ROS programming skills will be very useful.\n\nSucce=\r\nssful candidates can furthermore be given the opportunity to work with unde=\r\nrgraduate, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students.\n\nABOUT THE POSITION\nThe position is fo=\r\nr 24 months. The ``raw salary&#39;&#39; (French &quot;brut&quot;) will start at 2621 euros (2=\r\n115 euros ``net&#39;&#39;), depending on experience and qualifications. French medi=\r\ncal insurance is included.\n\nSpeaking French is not required.\n\nABOUT INRIA N=\r\nANCY-GRAND-EST \nInria is a French national research institution that focuse=\r\ns on computer science and applied mathematics. Inria employs about 600 perm=\r\nanent researchers, 1000 engineers/technicians, 600 Ph.D. students, and 200 =\r\npost-docs. Inria Nancy - Grand-Est centre is one of the eight research cent=\r\nre; it is situated near Nancy, a 1-million inhabitants (with a lot of stude=\r\nnts) in the East of France (1.5 hours from Paris by fast train).\n\nInria can=\r\n provide help for housing and visa applications (scientific resident card a=\r\nnd help for husband/wife).\n\nHOW TO APPLY\nPlease apply online here: http://t=\r\n.co/hLzJtepfOZ\n[Applications that are not submitted on the submission websi=\r\nte will be ignored].\n\nApplicants will be asked to provide:\n- a research sta=\r\ntement / cover letter;\n- a detailed CV;\n- your top 3 publications;\n- 3 refe=\r\nrences.\n\n Please ensure to include a link to your research web-site as well=\r\n as your date of availability. There is no fixed deadline: the positions wi=\r\nll be filled as soon as possible.\n\nSecurity and defense procedure : In the =\r\ninterests of protecting its scientific and technological assets, Inria is a=\r\n restricted-access establishment. Consequently, it follows special regulati=\r\nons for welcoming any person who whishes to work with the institute. The fi=\r\nnal acceptance of each candidate thus depends on applying this security and=\r\n defense procedure.\n\nINTERVIEWS\nInterviews will be conducted at IROS 2015 (=\r\nHamburg, 1st of October), by video-conferencing (e.g. Skype), and in our of=\r\nfices in Nancy.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n- http://www.resibots.eu\n- http://pages.i=\r\nsir.upmc.fr/~mouret\n\n=97 Jean-Baptiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mo=\r\nuret/\n\n=97 Jean-Baptiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/\n\n\n"}}
