As Mitchell\npointed out, no one is really right or wrong when it comes to\ndefinitions.  Nevertheless, I prefer to use terminology in a way that\nis intuitive and simple, and I feel that Derek&#39;s definition of\nevolution, though arguably technically sound, does not fit my\nintuitions and is therefore potentially misleading.  (Misleading\nbecause only someone who knew Derek and his reasoning would be able to\nappreciate his assumptions.)  The problem I have is that evolution to\nme includes the central notion of &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; and\nDerek&#39;s &quot;evolution with pure drift&quot; has no notion of fitness at all,\nmaking it quite in contrast to my intuitions.  Of course, there is no\nright answer, but when I think of evolution, I think of competition.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
