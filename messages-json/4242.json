There is one =\r\nshort\nquestion. In the file NetworkEvaluator.cs (for example\nSkirmishNetwor=\r\nkEvaluator.cs), in the method\nthreadSafeEvaluateNetwork(INetwork network, S=\r\nemaphore sem):\n\nCan I just use the network, for example with network.SetInp=\r\nutSignals\nand so on, or will I have to use the Semaphore?\n\nCan I Call SetIn=\r\nputSignals in all Threads simultaneously or will this\nraise problems?\n\nI lo=\r\noked at the source code and it seems you have added this semaphore\nfor deco=\r\nding genomes things. But when i don&#39;t need them, can I ignore\nthis semaphor=\r\ne?\n\nWill every thread get a new, own network to evaluate?\n\nThank you in adv=\r\nance,\n\nChristian\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambr=\r\no84@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian,\n&gt; \n&gt; If you would like to use HyperSharpNEAT=\r\n to just evolve neural networks\n&gt; with different activation functions you s=\r\nhould implement everything I\n&gt; said, but do not run your genomes through th=\r\ne substrate class.  In\n&gt; fact you should not use the substrate class at all=\r\n.  So in the network\n&gt; evaluator where I use the substrate, that&#39;s where yo=\r\nu should be\n&gt; evaluating the performance of your networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck w=\r\nith your work.  Let us know how it turns out,\n&gt; David\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
