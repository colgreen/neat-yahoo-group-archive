Of course, species only tend to get very large if they \nhave high fitness, which is what fitness sharing keeps in check.  If \na species gets too large, it won&#39;t be able to keep expanding, \nthereby allowing other species a chance to explout their own niches.\n\nBut you are right that the correct fitness value to use for \nidentifying the champion is the *raw* fitness.  Once fitness is \nadjusted, it&#39;s just an internal number used by NEAT to assign \noffspring.  It is no longer useful for knowing who was the objective \nbest.  So use unadjusted (raw) fitness for determining the champion.\n\nIt should be noted that there are equivalent formulas for fitness \nsharing that involve a slightly different process than I used in my \nversion of NEAT (and other version of NEAT may be based on how I did \nit).  These alternative forumulations actually do exactly the same \nthing, but they just involve a different set of steps.  You can \nrefer to the question, &quot;Is there another way to do fitness sharing?&quot; \nin the NEAT FAQs on the NEAT Users Page at:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n\nThis question answers a slightly different question, but it notes \nthat the following formula is equivalent to adjusting fitnesses and \ndoing what I did in my NEAT code, even though there is no adjustment \nstep:\n\nOffspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / \nTotal_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss) * PopulationSize \n\n\nBy the way, do you plan to open your version of NEAT to the public?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a quick intro to myself.  I have been &#39;playing&#39; around with \nNN&#39;s\n&gt; and GA for a few years now and came accross NEAT through Mat\n&gt; Buckland&#39;s excellent book.  I have implemented my own version (as\n&gt; that&#39;s what I am good at) in Java.  Been reading the posts for the\n&gt; last few days and there is obviously a wealth of talent and\n&gt; information out there, hopefully I can use it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using NEAT to predict FTSE 100 movement and weather \nforecasting.\n&gt;  I have tested my implementation with XOR and it works just fine. \n&gt; Obviously, the domain(s) that interest me are somewhat more \ncomplex.\n&gt; \n&gt; My biggest confusion is about speciation.  I understand the\n&gt; compatability metric, but what I haven&#39;t grasped is the role of\n&gt; fitness sharing and its effect on a specie/population.  Ken&#39;s paper\n&gt; says that the fitness is reduced by the size of the specie.  Is \nthat\n&gt; meant to be a penalty to more populous species?  My fitness \nfunction\n&gt; currently tends towards zero for more fit memebers.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I save (to disc) the best from each genration it is important \nthat\n&gt; I save the correct best member.  i.e. the one with the best raw\n&gt; fitness or the one with the best shared fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry if this is rambling, but I want to clear this in my own mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n\n\n\n\n"}}
