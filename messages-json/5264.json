It was very well-written and a fun read.=\r\n Congrats on\nthe results!\n\nI second Ken&#39;s interest in videos if you have th=\r\nem. I would love to see what\nyour gaits look like. It is hard to visualize =\r\nthem from the screen shots.\n\nYour paper prompted a few questions in my mind=\r\n:\n\n1) Why did you use the &#39;habituation&#39; model for inputs (where you only\nge=\r\nnerate inputs values for new stimuli)? Did you only try this after the\nmore=\r\n traditional way of doing it (just feeding the raw range-finder inputs\ninto=\r\n the network) did not work?\n\n2) I really liked your idea of having a defaul=\r\nt behavior (controlled by the\nbiases in the output layer), with the rest of=\r\n the ANN only getting non-zero\ninputs when objects are sensed. Did you evol=\r\nve the biases too, or hand code\nthem in some way? If you evolved them, what=\r\n method did you use (what were\nthe coordinates of the source/from node fed =\r\ninto the CPPN when querying for\na bias value)?\n\n3) You say that the fact th=\r\nat some of the lines are different in figure 9\nindicates that the ANN modul=\r\nes are different (in their wiring and function).\nBut wouldn&#39;t you see diffe=\r\nrent lines even with identical controllers in each\nmodule because different=\r\n modules are getting different inputs (e.g. when one\nleg moves close to a w=\r\nall)?\n\n4) Did you see any symmetry (e.g. left-right) or other form of regul=\r\narity in\nthe gaits (like I see in my HyperNEAT-evolved gaits)?\n\nOverall I l=\r\noved the work and look forward to more. Thanks again for the kind\nacknowled=\r\ngement.  \n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State =\r\nUniversity\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: evertwh2004 &lt;ever=\r\nt@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@...=\r\nm&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri, 04 Jun 2010 15:00:34 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] New paper =E2=80=9EHyperNEAT for Loco=\r\nmotion Control in Modular Robots=E2=80=B0\n&gt; \n&gt; We are very pleased to annou=\r\nnce our new  publication &quot;HyperNEAT for Locomotion\n&gt; Control in Modular Rob=\r\nots,&quot; which will appear in the proceedings of the 9th\n&gt; International Confe=\r\nrence on Evolvable Systems (ICES 2010).
