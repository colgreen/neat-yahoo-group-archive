It appears I am unli=\r\nkely to see the \n&gt; &gt; deeper connection so perhaps it is not important to be=\r\nlabor it \n&gt; &gt; further.  It is very possible others have internalized your p=\r\noint \n&gt; &gt; better and that your efforts at promoting your view will therefor=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; lead to productive explorations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case, at least we a=\r\nre agreed that challenges remain in all \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; machine learning, includ=\r\ning for HyperNEAT.  The exciting \n&gt; opportunity \n&gt; &gt; is to meet these chall=\r\nenges with new ideas.  Perhaps novel \n&gt; &gt; hybridizations will answer some c=\r\nhallenges; perhaps in other cases \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; will be something else.

Second, not intending any \n&gt; &gt; disrespe=\r\nct, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external appearances, your efforts appear =\r\ndirected in \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions than that of addressing your=\r\n self admitted \n&gt; areas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concern.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From a review of literature on the subject, there is a \n&gt; &gt; com=\r\nmon \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding that EA is computationally expensive and \n=\r\n&gt; slow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; converge, but robust for global search in p=\r\nroblem domains \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiple local minima.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It really just depends who you are talking ab=\r\nout whether \n&gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;common understanding&quot; abo=\r\nut anything in AI.  It also \n&gt; depends \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we ar=\r\ne talking about the past or the future.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For exam=\r\nple, it&#39;s often said that &quot;neural networks get \n&gt; caught \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; local\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optima&quot; (and there is indeed a &quot;common understanding&quot; =\r\nthat \n&gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but when people say that they are a=\r\nlmost always only \n&gt; talking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; backprop, which is =\r\njust one single neural network learning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\nBackprop is not the only way a neural network can learn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that when we talk about methods in machine \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nearning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often confuse whether we are talking abou=\r\nt a *field* or a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method.  In the case of EA=\r\ns, you seem to be talking about \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; existing methods that h=\r\nave been analyzed (often by people \n&gt; who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; even aware of the most modern approaches) in the past.   \n&gt; For \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; example,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the old-fashioned bit-string based simple EA ha=\r\ns been \n&gt; analyzed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extensively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet as=\r\n a field, EAs themselves are evolving.  Problems \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identified in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the past are actively being addressed in the present and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fu=\r\nture. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modern approaches completely overturn the=\r\n assumptions and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the past (and =\r\nof course introduce their own new problems).  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Check \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Estimation of Distribution Algorithms and the CMA-ES:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_distribu=\r\ntion_algorithm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I look at EAs, or any research area for that matter, I \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think about what they *could* be, rather than wha=\r\nt they \n&gt; are.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researcher, I try =\r\nto make them what they could be.  To me, \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exciting thing about research: At its best, it overturns \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; dogma.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like to view a limitation as a challenge=\r\n rather than as a \n&gt; &gt; brick \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wall.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An=\r\nd that is from people who are working &quot;hard&quot; problems \n&gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n multi-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discipline, multiobjective, non-linear inequality \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; constraints, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at government laboratorie=\r\ns and Fortune 100 defense firms. \n&gt; &gt; Not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dancing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n rag-dolls and computer-aided art.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFirst, while you often cite multiobjective optimization as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;hard=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem&quot; for EAs, in fact some of the most effective \n&gt; &gt; algo=\r\nrithms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiobjective optimization are EAs.  EAs ar=\r\ne naturally \n&gt; &gt; suited \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintaining a pareto front be=\r\ncause a pareto front requires a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; population to hold it.  There i=\r\ns vast literature on pareto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimization in EAs, both in multio=\r\nbjective optimization \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coevolution.

Our group has \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indeed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently produced a number of works in interacti=\r\nve \n&gt; evolution,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including dance, art, music, and particle effe=\r\ncts.  Perhaps \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem a somewhat lighthearted=\r\n departure from more serious \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subjects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ye=\r\nt the implications of this work are as serious as any in \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vie=\r\nw. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of that work is a probe of the ubiquity of patterns and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regularities, in particular through the theory of CPPNs.  \n&gt; T=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeper\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lesson in that body of work is that the very=\r\n same encoding \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; able \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produce patter=\r\nns appropriate to what would otherwise appear \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n disparate domains.  The idea is to develop a theory of \n&gt; &gt; generic \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; pattern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generation and to show that patterns are interchan=\r\ngeable \n&gt; &gt; across \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; domains.  That insight leads t=\r\no the idea of HyperNEAT, \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; takes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again the very=\r\n same encoding that is producing art and \n&gt; music \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it to produce a large-scale neural pattern.  Therein it \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbecomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serious, because the hard problems you like to focus on=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; almost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involve patterns and regularitie=\r\ns.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is no accident that in building a theory o=\r\nf pattern \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generation, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; number of interactive evolutio=\r\nnary computation experiments \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be=\r\n performed because understanding the capabilities of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pattern\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generator require *exploring* the space of possibilities \n&gt; &gt; rath=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply optimizing, and humans are much better =\r\nexplorers than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers.  The theory would never have gotten o=\r\nff the \n&gt; ground \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had stuck to more tradit=\r\nional optimization problems.   \n&gt; &gt; Indeed, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funny as =\r\nit sounds, the whole idea began to materialize \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolved a spaceship in Mattias Fagerlund&#39;s DelphiNEAT.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To put it starkly, without that exploration in genetic art,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have been no HyperNEAT.  And in fact even m=\r\nore new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theories \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical implication=\r\ns are coming (not yet published) \n&gt; because \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena t=\r\nhat became apparent through Picbreeder.  So you \n&gt; &gt; see, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; building a new algorithm or a new theory with practical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nmplications,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often traditional problems are exactly the wrong v=\r\nehicle to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because they perpetuate the same=\r\n dogmatic perspectives that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeate the field=\r\n to begin with and cause it to be staying \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nplace.   Thus all of these applications are chosen with \n&gt; &gt; careful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scrutiny with a sincere belief in their practical \n&gt; &gt; ramifications.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not to mention the fact that interactive evolutio=\r\nn itself \n&gt; has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical potential to change the wa=\r\ny we do engineering in \n&gt; &gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cases.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Can you ima=\r\ngine Picbreeder for furinute instead of \n&gt; &gt; pictures?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cars?  Someday that may be how we create highly customi=\r\nzed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; artifacts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    In fact, some of the problems to w=\r\nhich you are referring \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nonlinear and multi-obj=\r\nective) may only be possible to \n&gt; solve \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inter=\r\nactive evolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How many times has NEAT, as a =\r\nmonolithic approach, been \n&gt; &gt; cited \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successful=\r\nly applied by government laboratories and \n&gt; Fortune \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 100 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; defense firms for these type of &quot;hard&quot; problems?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can refer to the paper on high-energy physics at \n&gt;=\r\n FermiLab \n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;re interested, but I still think there is=\r\n a bigger \n&gt; &gt; &gt; picture.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In some ways, as resea=\r\nrchers in AI, what practitioners are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; using \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nolve hard problems is exactly what we *don&#39;t* want to \n&gt; use.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aft=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, how is anything ever going to become more powerful if \n=\r\n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look to practitioners to show us what method=\r\ns we should be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researchers, it i=\r\ns our job to give the practitioners *new* \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; options,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not=\r\n the other way around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Practitioners are often sev=\r\neral steps behind algorithm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developers, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n with good reason.  They often can&#39;t afford to take big \n&gt; risks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something practical in the here and now.   You=\r\n will \n&gt; therefore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that most cutting-edge algorit=\r\nhms are not in use in \n&gt; industry \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tools in =\r\nother scientific disciplines at the very moment \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cutting-edge.  Yet someone has to be developing the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; algorithms \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
