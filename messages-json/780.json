I figure that this would be an interesting \nthing to learn, since when an agent is not It they will be trying to run \naway from It, and when they are It they will try to run towards another \nagent. i want to use competitive co-evolution and NN controllers \n(eventually using neat, although i&#39;m using a simple crossover+mutation GA \nwith binary tournament selection right now). fitness is the average \ndistance from the target over a certain number of time steps.\n\nmy first task was just for agents to follow around a moving target, where \ntheir input is a bearing to the target and their outputs is a change to \ntheir current x and y velocities - this is basically evolving sin and \ncosine in the network. with a population size of 10, with 5 new offspring \neach turn, it readily solves this problem within a couple hundred \ngenerations. even though ive done all sorts of evolutionary algorithms, \nits still DAMN cool to see the little dots start out moving randomly and \nthen over time start swarming around the target ... hehe this stuff is so \ncool. anyway, i then changed their output to be their new heading and \nvelocity, and they also learn how to follow the target fairly easily, \nalthough now that i think about it since one of the inputs is the bearing \nthey pretty much just need to learn to turn to the bearing.\n\nanyway, my question is this: what do you use as inputs for something \nlike the tag \nproblem? i mean \ni guess \ntechnically i could have an input which gives the bearing for each other \nagent and then a binary input whether or not they are It. i don&#39;t really \nlike this, though, because you have to change the number of inputs based \non the current number of agents in the simulation. other ideas ive had \nwere to divide the circle around the agent into a discrete number of arcs \nand then flag the inputs that have something in their field of vision ... \nhas anyone tried anything with that kind of thing?\n\n--\n\na separate question, what is the best solution for a light-weight, drop-in \nwith as little change as possible c++ implementation of neat? hehe no \noffense, \nKen, but i saw your code a few years ago - hope you cleaned it up since \nthen :) if there isn&#39;t an existing implementation that has a very clean \ninterface, are there any plans to develop one?\n\nanyway, i really should be studying for my exams, but i&#39;ve convinced \nmyself that this really is revision -- which, actually, it is, since \nmonday&#39;s exam is neural computation and tuesday&#39;s is nature inspired \ndesign, so i&#39;m actually using concepts from both of those classes in this \nlittle system.\n\ncheers,\n-KB-\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------\n k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n msc natural computation : the university of birmingham \n http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/             \n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
