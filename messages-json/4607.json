Did you see the price for Nao ($15,000)? I assume if you are going to\n&gt; keep research in the realm of a simulated environment, that is not relevant.\n&gt; But us home researchers are most assuredly out priced on this robot. I would\n&gt; rather spend the cash on E-Bay and buy an Aibo.\n\nI did see that. But I read somewhere else that they were about to come out\nwith one around 3-4k. That&#39;s still a lot, but at least the price is coming\ndown.\n\n&gt; I see your point with the inaccuracy of the simulation. But, if the network\n&gt; is evolved to handle the simulated environment, its adaptability should\n&gt; allow for minor deviations between simulation and physical, right? I think\n&gt; this would be even more effective if some of your inputs are the current leg\n&gt; positions. Hmm.. I am going to play with this and see what shakes out.\n\nIf you have any luck please let me know. I am very interested in whether it\nworks for you. \n\nAs to your question, I am not evolving my robots with noise in the system,\nso they may have evolved gaits that rely on that precision. My guess is that\nthe evolved gaits would not immediately work in the noisy world. If you\ncontinued to evolve on the actual robot you may see evolution figure out how\nto move well in the real world, but that would require many trials on your\nactual robot. The best plan is to try to have the simulator very accurately\nreflect the real world before evolving the controller and transferring it.\n\n&gt; Please forgive my moronic assumptions here. I am far more used to\n&gt; programming my quad with straight forward code, and only recently started\n&gt; planning on implementing something similar to the work you did. And thanks\n&gt; for that by the way. It re-sparked the project for me.\n\nNo problem. Glad to hear you liked it. Please keep us updated on your\nproject.  \n\nCheers,\nJeff\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jeff\n&gt; Clune\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 24, 2009 4:20 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Evolving Coordinated Quadruped Gaits with the\n&gt; HyperNEAT Generative Encoding\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Erik-\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the suggestion. I have read that it takes a lot of work to make a\n&gt; simulator accurate. My guess is that without that substantial investment,\n&gt; controllers evolved in simulation would not work very well on the actual\n&gt; robots. It continues to surprise me that no robots exist with simulators.\n&gt; Hopefully someone will put one out soon. The Aldebaran Nao, which is\n&gt; replacing the Aibo for RoboCup, has two simulators, but I do not know if\n&gt; they are accurate.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I appreciate you keeping an eye out. Let me know if you see any\n&gt; that have simulators.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@... &lt;mailto:jclune%40msu.edu&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; From: Erik &lt;erikcss@yahoo. &lt;mailto:erikcss%40yahoo.com&gt; com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com&quot;\n&gt; &lt;neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Date: Mon, 23 Mar 2009 00:22:58 -0700\n&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com&quot;\n&gt; &lt;neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: RE: [neat] Re: Evolving Coordinated Quadruped Gaits with the\n&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT Generative Encoding\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jeff,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You may want to take a look at the Quad from crustcrawler.com.

I&#39;m just thinking broadly of the commercial viability of a cheap\n&gt;&gt;&gt; leg based locomotion controller. Wheels are of course really good for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; many situations in the modern world, but legs still win in all but the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; most artificial (roads and level floors) situations. I expect there\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are military and commercial applications for small to large scale\n&gt;&gt;&gt; legged vehicles for carrying payloads e.g. up a mountain/hillside,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; through boggy land, stuff like that. I just see it as an area with a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; large short term commercial potential in comparison to some of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other typical EC problem domains we all know and love.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I fully agree with you. I wonder how long it will be before we see such\n&gt;&gt; robots carrying gear around for us. Big dog certainly implies that it\n&gt; won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; be that far off.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you know of any robots that can be bought and have a high-fidelity\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simulator (preferably in ODE)?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry no.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I continue to be shocked by this. I feel like there have to be lots out\n&gt;&gt; there, but at this point I have asked the NEAT community and the ODE\n&gt;&gt; community, and searched a ton on Google, and no one seems to know of any.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Has anyone out there used Webots? I think they have a simulation of a\n&gt;&gt; Bioloid quadruped in there that you can buy. At least, I think you can buy\n&gt;&gt; the building blocks and assemble it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not getting any clear thoughts on why the period would evolve to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be so slow. The only suggestion I have is that maybe the CPPNs weren&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt; able to effectively coevolve these two disparate features - a gait\n&gt;&gt;&gt; controller and a single wave period value. Using the CPPN in this way\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is probably just a cheap and easy way of evolving a period value, with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the ideal solution being a completely independent period value bolted\n&gt;&gt;&gt; onto the NEAT genome.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I agree with you. I have thought many times that it is the fact that I am\n&gt;&gt; asking the CPPN to do two different things which is causing the problem. I\n&gt;&gt; like your suggestion, and have had it on my to do list for a while\n&gt; (bolting\n&gt;&gt; an extra, one allele, real value genome onto each CPPN genome and see how\n&gt;&gt; that works). However, given how far away the CPPN coordinates I am asking\n&gt;&gt; for the period are from the joint inputs/outputs, I am surprised it is\n&gt;&gt; difficult for the CPPN to deal with the separate objectives. But your\n&gt;&gt; suggested experiment will test these issues and should be performd. I&#39;ll\n&gt; let\n&gt;&gt; you know when I get around to it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks (again) for the suggestions.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
