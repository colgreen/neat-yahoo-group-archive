In other words, if it asks to zoom, make it zoom a little\n&gt; more or a little less than it asked (i.e. add some noise).  If it\n&gt; asks to rotate, have a probability of slight over or under\n&gt; rotation.  Faustino Gomez from our group has shown that model noise\n&gt; (noise added to actions) is more effective than noise added to\n&gt; sensors. \n\nThat&#39;s interesting, but counterintuitive.
