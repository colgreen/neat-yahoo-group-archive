I have also\nheard, though don&#39;t know if it is true, that the main reason for bloat is\nbecause the trees are trying to lower their effective mutation rate (if 1%\nof nodes get mutated, and there are more nodes, the good one are less likely\nto be affected by mutation).\n\nDo you guys generally see this happen in NEAT? Do the networks get\nridiculously large when smaller networks would do?\n\nI notice in HyperNEAT that the config files used in the papers typically\nonly have an add node mutation rate operator (the demolish node probability\nis set to zero). This seems to me like it would add to the upward pressure\nto create bloated networks.\n\nIn most of my experiments so far with HyperNEAT (like the ones in the paper\nI recently posted here), the CPPN networks did not explode in size, which\nsurprised me. However, in some new experiments I am doing I am seeing the\nnetworks get large (e.g. ~200 nodes). This is happening even when I make the\ndemolishNode probability the same as the addNode probability.\n\nIf you are seeing bloat, how do you combat it? Do you generally have to set\nthe demolishNode prop to be much higher than addNode? Or do you give a\nfitness penalty for larger networks?\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
