To date, however, generative\nrepresentations have not been tested on irregular problems. It is unknown\nhow they will fare on problems with intermediate and low amounts of\nregularity. This paper compares a generative representation to a direct\nrepresentation on problems that range from having multiple types of\nregularity to one that is completely irregular. As the regularity of the\nproblem decreases, the performance of the generative representation degrades\nto, and then underperforms, the direct encoding. The degradation is not\nlinear, however, yet tends to be consistent for different types of problem\nregularity. Furthermore, if the regularity of each type is sufficiently\nhigh, the generative encoding can simultaneously exploit different types of\nregularities.\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
