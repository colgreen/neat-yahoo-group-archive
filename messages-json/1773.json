It looks like not enough could be happening in\nthat time to warrant a phase switch.  Does fitness really stagnate in\njust 20 or 30 seconds?  We thought maybe you&#39;d expect to see the first\nphase of the run stay in the complexifying mode for a long time before\ngoing to pruning, since it doesn&#39;t usually stagnate right off the\nbat?  \n\nI guess the overall question is what is really going on and how is\nthat graph staying so stable?  Maybe it would be useful to see a graph\nof *champion* complexity over time, rather than mean.  Then you might\nsee where pruning was really paying off.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
