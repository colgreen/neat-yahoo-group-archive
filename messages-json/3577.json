We&#39;re aware\nof NEAT&#39;s FAQ and some old topics on that matter. But basically our\npoint is that if we keep innovation numbers for the entire simulation\nwe don&#39;t really need them!\n\nWhile crossing over or measuring genotypes distance all it takes to\nwork is aligning connections that links the same neurons. It is the\nvery same effect when using &quot;universal&quot; innovation numbers, isn&#39;t it?\n\nTwo or more mutations that results in the same connection genes\nduring evolution plays the same role? Maybe not. I don&#39;t know.\n\nCesar\n\nOn 10/3/07, petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Carolina,\n&gt;\n&gt;  Basically you can either keep the list of innovation numbers for the\n&gt;  current generation only or keep it forever. Try to experiment with\n&gt;  each and then see what is best for your system.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Perhaps searching for some older threads where the same issue is\n&gt;  discussed will help you.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carolina Feher da Silva&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;mirrorballu2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It&#39;s been just a few months since I&#39;ve started studying NEAT and I&#39;m\n&gt;  &gt; sorry if my question is very basic or has already been asked a lot\n&gt;  of\n&gt;  &gt; times before (I&#39;ve searched the group archive). I&#39;ve been discussing\n&gt;  &gt; this with my friend and we don&#39;t understand how innovation numbers\n&gt;  are\n&gt;  &gt; assigned to mutations.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Suppose a mutation links node n to node m. If another mutation\n&gt;  linking\n&gt;  &gt; these nodes occurs in the same generation, they are both assigned\n&gt;  the\n&gt;  &gt; same innovation number, this part was clear. But what if a mutation\n&gt;  &gt; linking the same nodes occurs 100 generations later? Is it assigned\n&gt;  &gt; the same innovation number or a different one?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve read Stanley&#39;s original C++ code and it seems that the new\n&gt;  &gt; mutation is assigned a new innovation number, which makes sense to\n&gt;  me,\n&gt;  &gt; because the two genes are not homologous and tracking homology among\n&gt;  &gt; genes is the whole point of innovation numbers, right? But looking\n&gt;  at\n&gt;  &gt; a Python and a Java implementation, both have a global list of\n&gt;  &gt; mutations and will assign the same innovation number to a mutation\n&gt;  &gt; linking the same nodes. In this case, don&#39;t innovation numbers\n&gt;  become\n&gt;  &gt; useless? All we need to know to align genes for reproduction is\n&gt;  which\n&gt;  &gt; nodes are getting linked by a certain mutation. Also we could be\n&gt;  &gt; aligning genes that have completely different roles in completely\n&gt;  &gt; different network architectures. It seems wrong to me.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; So does anyone know how this should be done and why?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks,\n&gt;  &gt; Carolina\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                   \n\n"}}
