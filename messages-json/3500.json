Every picture is the \nresult of nothing more than one or mor=\r\ne people selecting images they \nliked from a group of candidates.  So no, t=\r\nhey do not start from any \ngiven pictures.  \n\nI believe this point deserves=\r\n emphasizing.  To me, it&#39;s pretty \namazing that all of these pictures start=\r\ned from nothing.  There was \nnever an artist and no initial designs.  It&#39;s =\r\na genuine testament to \nthe power of evolution to produce complex results. =\r\n In fact, it is \none of the few demonstrations of this supposed evolutionar=\r\ny \ncapability (i.e. towards higher complexity and organization) that is \nac=\r\ntually intuitive to the naked eye.  For example, check these out:\n\nhttp://w=\r\nww.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/picbreeder_collage.png   \n\n(press &quot;zoom&quot; in your br=\r\nowser to see it at highest quality- browsers \ndefault to a worse resolution=\r\n)\n\nFurthermore, it shows the power of CPPN encoding that it could be \nsteer=\r\ned to such a variety of recognizeable objects through nothing \nbut what is =\r\nin effect a pop-15 greedy GA.\n\nOf course the reason it was possible is beca=\r\nuse humans are doing the \nevaluation- which yields another lesson: The fitn=\r\ness function in most \nevolutionary computation is a liability against getti=\r\nng to high-level \ncomplexity.  There are deep reasons that human evaluation=\r\n is actually \nmore analogous to what happened over natural evolution than a=\r\nny other \ntype of evaluation scheme we run on computers.  We are often misl=\r\ned \ninto believing that interactive evolution is less &quot;natural&quot; than \nnorma=\r\nl EC.  Actually, the opposite is true.\n\nThe exciting thing is that this exp=\r\neriment just started.  Who knows \nwhere it is going to go?  We didn&#39;t know =\r\nwe&#39;d be seeing cars and \nsunsets but the system and its users (who deserve =\r\na lot of credit) \noffer constant surprises.  Hopefully people will branch f=\r\nrom some of \nthe deepest lineages (i.e. most complex, having been through t=\r\nhe most \ngenerations) to go even farther down the path that they are going.=\r\n\n\nken  \n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThis is pretty neat!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ...both puns intended. :-p\n&gt; \n&gt; Do these th=\r\nings start from a picture (e.g. a car)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Congrats on pulling this off. =\r\nVery cool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan S=\r\ntate University\n&gt; Visiting Researcher, Instituto de Biolog=EDa Molecular y =\r\nCelular de \nPlantas,\n&gt; Valencia, Spain\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; 34 679 921 530  (m=\r\nobile in spain)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Re=\r\nply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Wed, 01 Aug=\r\n 2007 23:29:04 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Picbreeder: World&#39;s Largest Collaborative \nInteractive\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Evolution Experiment\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am pleased to an=\r\nnounce the opening of Picbreeder, a massive\n&gt; &gt; experiment in collaborative=\r\n interactive evolution, which happens \nto\n&gt; &gt; be based on NEAT:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ht=\r\ntp://picbreeder.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder is a unique online service that all=\r\nows users with no\n&gt; &gt; artistic experience to evolve pictures in collaborati=\r\non with each\n&gt; &gt; other. The technology behind Picbreeder is a novel NEAT-ba=\r\nsed \nGenetic\n&gt; &gt; Art applet that is integrated into a massive growing &quot;tree=\r\n of \nlife&quot;\n&gt; &gt; that never ends. Anyone who evolves a picture they like can =\r\n\npublish\n&gt; &gt; it to the world and thereby permanently add their creations to=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; ever-expanding tree of life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What makes Picbreeder partic=\r\nularly powerful and unique is that you\n&gt; &gt; can *branch* from the published =\r\nwork of any other user that has \ncome\n&gt; &gt; before.  In other words, you do n=\r\not have to begin from scratch.\n&gt; &gt; Instead, for example, if you want to a e=\r\nvolve a face, you can \nbranch\n&gt; &gt; from one of the many published faces and =\r\nexplore an infinite \nnumber\n&gt; &gt; of variations from that starting point.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps most intriguing is that we do not know what is possible to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; evolve.  As lineages are built upon lineages, complexification in\n&gt; &gt; NEA=\r\nT means that images can theoretically become more and more\n&gt; &gt; complex.  Th=\r\nus, in theory, anything is possible.  In this sense\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder&#39;s users =\r\nare pioneers, exploring collectively a space \nthat\n&gt; &gt; has never been exhau=\r\nstively explored and discovering together\n&gt; &gt; creations that no one of us c=\r\nould have discovered alone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope that you will decide to join us=\r\n on Picbreeder as we explore\n&gt; &gt; this space.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
