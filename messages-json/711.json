I am on a windows\n&gt;system, and would like some help in getting all the correct packages\n&gt;and version etc. in order to compile and run the NEAT experiments.\n\nI have a working version of the NEAT source which will compile under Cygwin\nusing an ordinary make, if you&#39;d like me to send it to you. I think you just\nneed to get hold of the latest SWIG. (The usual Cygwin setup program will\nhandle this for you.) I have, however, removed all of the graphics code,\nsimply because I didn&#39;t really need it and it just simplified the porting\nprocess. If you do need NEAT&#39;s graphics output, you&#39;ll have to sort that out\nyourself.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
