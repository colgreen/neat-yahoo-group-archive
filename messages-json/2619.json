I\n&gt; decided to focus on a particular aspect of indirect\n&gt; encoding in the context\n&gt; of NEAT, specifically bilateral symmetry.  Most\n&gt; animals exhibit a high\n&gt; degree of bilateral symmetry in their overall body\n&gt; plan, as well as their\n&gt; neural systems.  It seemed like a logical starting\n&gt; point for a foray into\n&gt; indirect encoding.\n\nI think you are correct in the general idea, but I\nhave to qualify the idea that animals have bilateral\nsymmetry in their neural systems.\n\nClearly at a very broad level vertibrates do have\nbilateral neural symmetry, but the different functions\nof the left and right hemispheres would seem to\nsuggest than the symmetry does not extend into their\nfine detail.\n\nAnd any neural net that we can practically construct\ntoday, is necessarily only equivalent to some fine\ndetail from a vertibrate brain.\n\nOTOH, very simple creatures, C. elegans and hydra, for\nexample, do have nets on a similar scale to yours, and\nI that some of them do exhibit symmetry (e.g. I think\nC elegans has bilateral symmetry.  Hydra are not\noverall symmetric (having buds) but each sub-section\nmay have radial symmetry?)\n\nJust something you might want to bear in mind when you\nare defending your work...\n\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m interested in several theoretical\n&gt; questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; To what extent is bilateral symmetry in an agent&#39;s\n&gt; neural system necessary?\n\nI&#39;m a little cautious with the phrasing of that.\n\nI would say that it is not at all &quot;necessary&quot;.\n\nThe proper question should be:\n\n&quot;What if any, advantages can bilateral symmetry give\nto an evolving agent?&quot;\n\nAnd that has to be taken in the context of whether the\ntask domain has symmetry or not.\n\n&gt; And for what kinds of cognitive tasks?\n\nNote that there are different ways that the domain\nsymmetry could be relevent:\n\nno symmetry\nbilateral symmetric agent in asymetric world (most\ncommon)\nbilateral symmetric agent and world\nhigher symmetry in agent and/or world\n \n&gt; To what extent is contralateral connectivity\n&gt; (connections which cross the\n&gt; midline of the neural system, i.e., are\n&gt; interhemispheric) important, as\n&gt; opposed to ipsilateral connectivity (connections\n&gt; which do not cross the\n&gt; midline, i.e., are intrahemispheric)?\n\nPresumably it is totally necessary, otherwise you have\ntwo separate neural nets...?\n\n&gt; To try to start answering some of these questions,\n&gt; we extended NEAT in the\n&gt; following ways:\n\n[snip]\n\n&gt; When constructing the initial network, all\n&gt; asymmetrical neurons will default\n&gt; to the &quot;left&quot; of the network.  So the network now\n&gt; has a spatial structure,\n&gt; whereas before it was arbitrary.\n\nConceptually, I guess it is of no consequence where\nthe asymmetrical neurons are considered to be.  But\npersonally I would find the system more intuitive if\nthey were imagined to be &quot;in the middle&quot;...\n\n&gt; So all neuron genes now have a symmetry attribute,\n&gt; and all connections have\n&gt; 2 new attributes, symmetry and lateralization\n&gt; (indicating whether they cross\n&gt; the midline or not).\n\nI&#39;m a little confused here, how can connections have a\nsymmetry attribute that is different from the nodes\nthey like.  e.g. what would it mean to put a symmetric\nlink between two asymmetric neurones, or vice-versa?\n\nShouldn&#39;t they just &quot;inherit&quot; the symmetry of the\nnodes?\n\nI guess when you have symmetric inputs and outputs,\nyou could imagine you have three cases: lateral,\ntranslateral and both.  But wouldn&#39;t the last case be\nachieved by having two connections between those two\nnodes (one lateral and one translateral)?\n\n&gt; asymmetric.  If the mutation occurs on top of a\n&gt; symmetric connection, the\n&gt; new resulting neurons and connections will have the\n&gt; same symmetry and\n&gt; lateralization attributes of the connection gene\n&gt; they replaced.\n\nIsn&#39;t this last sentance a bit odd, e.g. if you insert\na node into a translateral connection, then if the two\nnew connections are both translateral, the overall\neffect is lateral (connecting right-&gt;left-&gt;right)?\n\n&gt; Add connection mutations are fairly complicated. \n&gt; There are 2 new mutation\n&gt; rates, which control the amount of symmetry and\n&gt; lateralization in the newly\n&gt; mutated connections.  First, the add connection\n&gt; mutation rate determines how\n&gt; many new connections should be added.  Of those, the\n&gt; symmetry rate\n&gt; determines the ratio that are symmetric.  Of each of\n&gt; those two ratios, the\n&gt; lateralization rate determines the ratio of new\n&gt; contralateral/ipsilateral\n&gt; connections.\n\nPlease read my terms &quot;lateral&quot; and &quot;translateral&quot; as\nipsilateral and contralateral respectively :)\n\n&gt; For a mutation between 2 symmetrical neurons, \n&gt; there are four actual neurons in the resulting \n&gt; network, and we allow 6 possible types of \n&gt; connectivity to mutate:\n\nsymmetrical/ipsilateral    ||\nsymmetric/contralateral    X\nasymmetric/ipsilateral left   |-\nasymmetric/ipsilateral right   -|\nasymmetric/contralateral left  /\nasymmetric/contralateral right  &#92;\n\nAh!  I see the answer to my previous question, so if I\nread you correctly, you are specifying the nodes in a\n&quot;pre-symmetry&quot; format, and then adding symmetry during\nnetwork creation according to the symmetry flag on the\nnode-gene.  But for the connections you are specifying\ntheir source and target neurons from the post-symmetry\npool?\n\nThat seems like a very odd choice to me.  I had\nassumed up to this point that the node and connection\ngenes were both &quot;pre-symmetry&quot; and that you were\ncreating the symmetry of the connections are network\ncreation time as well.\n\n\nWith regard to your current scheme, suppose you have\ntwo nodes:\n\n\n1 - hidden, symmetric\n2\n - hidden, symmetric\n\nat network creation time these become:\n\n1left\t\t1right\n\n\n2left\t\t2right\n\nAnd connection genes can separately specify that they\nare 1left to 2left, or 1right to 2right...\n\nBut not 1 left to 2right? err, actually I don&#39;t get\nwhat you mean, there seems to be some ambiguity in how\nthe connection gene targets and flags interact...\n\nMaybe you could explain some more?\n\n--\n\nOn the whole, however, I like the scope and direction\nof this project a lot.  I spent some time last year\nthinking about symmetry in evolving systems, and\nparticularly about how systems might discover it for\nthemselves.\n\nI didn&#39;t get that thought to a state of completion, \nbut a project like this, where you gift the system\nwith som symmetry, seems like an ideal starting point.\n\nNot so different from my SLEAT stuff, except in for\nthat my symmetry is the squares of a TicTacToe\nboard...\n\n\n\tIan\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
