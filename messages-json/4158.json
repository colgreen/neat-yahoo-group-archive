I&#39;m much\nmore =\r\ncomfortable with Python than C++.  With the new release of\nHyperSharpNEAT 2=\r\n.0 (http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html), there is a\nsubstantial code bas=\r\ne to draw from.\n\nAlso, I&#39;d be interested to extend NEAT Python with Paralle=\r\nl Python\n(http://www.parallelpython.com/) to allow evaluations on multiple\n=\r\ncores and machines.\n\nI&#39;ve never worked with GPUs, but nVidia&#39;s CUDA capabil=\r\nities look\npromising.  PyStream (http://code.google.com/p/pystream/) isn&#39;t =\r\nbeing\nsupported anymore by Tech-X.  Their new GPUlib\n(http://www.txcorp.com=\r\n/technologies/GPULib/index.php) supports\nmultiple languages.  Again, this w=\r\nould be for evaluating fitness\nfunctions.  Any experience or thoughts here?=\r\n\n\n--Todd\n\n\n"}}
