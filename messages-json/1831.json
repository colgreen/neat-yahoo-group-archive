That is the two\n&gt;specific\n&gt; &gt; symmetries:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) that the world retains the same nature as you translate the\n&gt;viewpoint around\n&gt; &gt; 2) that the world retains the same nature as you rotate the view\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       (one could call these &quot;relativities&quot; &#39;cos they are just like the\n&gt; &gt; assumptions underpinning relativity...)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       The egocentric eye does not have full exploitation of them,\n&gt;however,\n&gt; &gt; because for any situation that requires considering the situation at\n&gt;two\n&gt; &gt; points (or orientations) it is as badly off as the global viewpoint.\n&gt;  What\n&gt; &gt; this means is, if a piece of learning requires the consideration of\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; properties of more than one &quot;position&quot; -- for example a position#1\n&gt;where\n&gt; &gt; the prey could not see me, and a position#2, where I could eat the\n&gt;prey --\n&gt; &gt; then the eye can move to one of the positions, and get free\n&gt;&quot;relative&quot;\n&gt; &gt; processing, but it has no way of performing any simultaneous\n&gt;calculations\n&gt; &gt; at a second position, except by evolving its own understanding of\n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; symmetry the hard way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just to be devil&#39;s advocate, are you sure it couldn&#39;t all just be done\n&gt;by a roving eye with memory?  Maybe you never really do make\n&gt;simultaneous computations for this type of thing.  Maybe it&#39;s all\n&gt;sequential: look at the first perspective, remember it, then transform\n&gt;the view and look at the second.  In memory, perhaps both views are\n&gt;stored in some kind of normalized reference frame so they can be\n&gt;thought of at once.\n\nHi,\n\nAbsolutely!  This is a way in which it can be done, but the discussion was \nalready long and complex without adding yet another consideration.\n\nHowever, using memory in this way does not really alter the case, because \nfor memory to do this, especially in conjunction with a general purpose \n&quot;symmetrical transforms&quot; system, it would still need to somehow pass data \nabout between general (memory, transformation) and specific (prey-capture \nor chess) modules, again implying some sort of &quot;data bus&quot;.\n\nNot that I&#39;m saying I believe that real brains work that way, I&#39;m just \nholding up a set of phenomena:\n\n         - natural brains can learn a concept once and then apply it as a \nmodule within multiple other learned behaviours\n\nAsking how they do it and then holding this idea of &quot;data busses&quot; passing \ninformation around between remote parts of the network as a working \nhypothesis.  Note however, that if you have a data bus then storing \nsomething in a memory module and pulling it back later is vary simple.\n\nNote also, however, that for a data bus to work _at_all_ there needs to be \na consistent format for the data in both the sending and receiving \nmodules.  Which is the competing conventions problem with a vengeance.\n\nHowever, it does give us a different perspective of the definition of a \nmodule.  e.g. in a really nicely OO sort of way a module is 50% defined by \nthe data formats in its &quot;interface&quot;...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
