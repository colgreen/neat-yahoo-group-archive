There were slug-like things in our ancestry, \n&gt;but they are a _LOT_ further back, e.g. back at the point where \n&gt;multicellular organisms were being invented.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI could have phrased that better. Yes the slug thing is a *very* distant \nrelative, I got this from some natural histroy documentray. This slug \nthing was believed to have evolved some important characteristic that \nwas key to it&#39;s descdendents being so successful. Umm maybe it was a \nredamentray lung, something like that.\n\nAnyway the main point was that the fossil record shows explosions of \nbiological diversity at certain points in history, sometimes possibly \ncaused by a mass extinction event, and other times by the discovery of \nsome novel feature. I realise this is basic stuff for the biologists \namongst you, I&#39;m just trying to draw analogies with with the natural world.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
