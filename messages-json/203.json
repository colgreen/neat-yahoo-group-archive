I am trying to\n&gt; alter the windows version\n&gt; to do some color recognition.  Primarily, my goal is\n&gt; to be able to use the\n&gt; algorithm.  After I feel comfortable with the code,\n&gt; I will apply it to board\n&gt; games.  I am hoping to create a neural network that\n&gt; will act as a heuristic\n&gt; function.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -Chris Christenson (afro)\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Derek James [mailto:blue5432@...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 12, 2003 11:43 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Roll Call\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt; \n&gt; People have been steadily trickling in to the group\n&gt; for the past few weeks, so I just wanted to\n&gt; officially\n&gt; welcome those who&#39;ve recently joined.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering who is now actively working with NEAT,\n&gt; or a close variant, and then, if you&#39;re not\n&gt; currently,\n&gt; who might be interested in working with NEAT in the\n&gt; future.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who haven&#39;t scoured the archives yet, I&#39;m\n&gt; Derek James, the moderator of the group.  Philip\n&gt; Tucker (also on this list) and I are working on a\n&gt; Java\n&gt; implementation of NEAT that we hope to opensource in\n&gt; the near future.  We&#39;re primarily interested in\n&gt; board\n&gt; game domains, specifically the Gomoku/Renju/Go class\n&gt; of games, but also to a lesser degree, other game\n&gt; domains and real-time robot control.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, chime in if you like, and let us know what\n&gt; you&#39;re up to, or what you&#39;re thinking about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Derek James\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
