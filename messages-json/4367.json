We want to release\nthe gam=\r\ne before publishing a paper because it will be a multiplayer\nonline game an=\r\nd we want to be able to talk about how people play it in\nthe paper itself. =\r\n So we wanted to get the word out a little before\nthe game is actually rele=\r\nased to help attract potential players by the\ntime it is released.  We&#39;re h=\r\noping to make it genuinely fun and more\n&quot;mass-market&quot; than NERO in the sens=\r\ne that it&#39;s more action-oriented\nand less a thinking-and-waiting type game.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; This looks very interesting!
