You may indeed see over-fitting to the \neasier/supported task and this can result in a non-champion solution \nperforming better than a champion when the support is removed. Also if \nyou seed a new population from a champion you will lose population \ndiversity, some of which may still be useful. Nice work/website BTW.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
