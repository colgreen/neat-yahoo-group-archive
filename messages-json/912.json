It&#39;s possible that\neither neutral, or even maladaptive, structure could be coopted at a\nlater point and made useful.  Ken says he&#39;s seen jumps out of stagnant\nstretches and seems to attribute it to this dynamic.  I guess I\nhaven&#39;t worked with NEAT enough to experience this phenomenon, but\nthere certainly could be other explanations.  For example, speciation\ncould be key in kicking out of stagnant stretches.\n\nThere was a discussion here not long ago about not allowing species\nwhose fitness hasn&#39;t increased in some time to reproduce.  It was\nnoted that this was an important dynamic.  Those jumps out of fitness\nplateaus could be a result of the extinction of an old stagnant\nspecies, making way for more innovation, and the introduction of a new\nspecies.  I don&#39;t know...but it would be interesting to analyze the\npopulation dynamics around such jumps and try to figure out what&#39;s\nreally going on.  This is just one possible explanation.  But without\nsome data to back it up, I&#39;m somewhat skeptical about attributing\njumps out of local minima to the coadaptation of excess topology.\n\nBut if this proved to be the case, this seems counter to the\nmethodology of incrementally adding features and testing them along\nthe way.  If we have good reason to think that excess raw material\nthat&#39;s not adaptive now will become so at some point, and that this is\nimportant to kicking out of stagnation, then why start minimally?\n\nWhy not start with a fair amount of junk?\n\nOn Sat, 29 May 2004 20:42:29 -0000, Kenneth Stanley\n&lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; To the extent\n&gt; that your &quot;bloated&quot; solution works, you probably couldn&#39;t have\n&gt; gotten it to work in that larger space if you&#39;d started in it\n&gt; directly, but now here you are in a more promising part of that\n&gt; space.  \n\nBut how do you know you&#39;re in a more promising part of the search\nspace?  It could be that all that excess neutral topology could become\nadaptive at some point, but there&#39;s a greater likelihood that it will\nnot.\n\n&gt;  It even brings up a\n&gt; question which Derek, Philip, and I have talked about in email,\n&gt; which is whether the nice results for blended runs also apply in\n&gt; very complex domains.\n\nWell, this may depend on the gradient of the fitness function.  I\nthink Shimon&#39;s notion of task decomposition addresses this. \nBasically, you wouldn&#39;t want to try to evolve a robotic soccer team\nagainst a high-performing hand-coded team, based just on\nwins/losses/ties.  Your evolving controllers will just lose every\ntime.  But if you can successfully decompose the problem (which real\nsoccer players do), into distinct objectives (dribbling, passing,\nshooting) you can incrementally build up skills and hopefully combine\nthem to solve holistic goals, such as winning a game.\n\nIt seems to me that an incremental approach to improving fitness\ncorrelates with the notion of incrementally adding topological\nfeatures and testing them along the way.\n\nThe other extreme might be to allow all sorts of non-adaptive topology\nto pile up, and hope that it can be coopted for very complex\nbehaviors, like winning a soccer game.  So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s\nnecessarily the complexity of the domain, but the approach to fitness\nalong the way.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
