(Look at individual 3).\n\nWhen I hit the evaluate button on the be=\r\nst performer (number 3), it\nindicated a percent wrong of 46.13.\n\nThe struct=\r\nures in generation 300 were quite complex and were a mix of\ndifferent activ=\r\nation functions.  I assume no recurrence was\nallowed--correct?\n\nWhere did I=\r\n go wrong?\n\n--Todd\n\n\n\n"}}
