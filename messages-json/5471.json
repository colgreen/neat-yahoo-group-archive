Perhaps some kind\n              of =\r\ndata preprocessing, which makes geometrical sense,\n              should hel=\r\np. I personally have tried time series\n              prediction with HyperN=\r\nEAT and had no better results than\n              regular NEAT, even worse. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Peter&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n        =\r\n      --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dneat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv16951=\r\n96908moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:kstanley@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dkstanley@...&quot;&gt;&lt;kstanley@...&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n =\r\n             &gt; Peter, you could use any version of HyperNEAT\n           =\r\n   currently available for your task, but the main question\n              i=\r\ns whether the geometry (or regularities) of the time\n              series c=\r\nan somehow be made an advantage to HyperNEAT\n              through the conf=\r\niguration of the substrate. It is not\n              immediately clear why H=\r\nyperNEAT in particular is\n              advantageous for time series proble=\r\nms, though it is\n              possible it can be leveraged in some way tha=\r\nt is helpful.\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;=\r\n As an alternative, you could also try regular NEAT as\n              well. =\r\nAlso, if you search through the archives of this\n              group you wi=\r\nll find a number of discussions on time series\n              prediction.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; ken&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n              &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dneat%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              &quot;Peter&quot; &lt;blackprinzze@&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Hi&lt;br&gt;\n   =\r\n           &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently trying to d=\r\nevelop HyperNEAT for\n              Time series forecasting (Stock &amp; com=\r\nmodity)&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; 1, Is ther=\r\ne a current version of HyperNEAT\n              available that my be suited =\r\nfor this task?&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; 2, =\r\nIf not can you please point me in the right\n              direction, explai=\r\nning how this can be achieved. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n          =\r\n    &gt; &gt; 3, Forecast should behave, similar to that of a\n             =\r\n Moving average, with forecast plots one period or more\n              into =\r\nthe future. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Thank=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Peter&lt;br&gt;\n      =\r\n        &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n           =\r\n &lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n          \n      \n      \n    &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n  \n\n\n\n   =\r\n &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1381374155-1297735889=:66396--\r\n\n"}}
