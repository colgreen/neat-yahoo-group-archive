Note that the eplex website is not=\r\n supposed to block anyone from downloading papers, whether or not they have=\r\n an account.  All papers should be freely accessible to anyone on the inter=\r\nnet.\n\nSo there should be no need to obtain an account.  We don&#39;t give accou=\r\nnts to anyone except immediate members of the group.  So if the site told y=\r\nou that you need an account to access a publication on the site, the site m=\r\nay be broken in some way.  That&#39;s why I was wondering which papers you are =\r\nfinding that you can&#39;t download?\n\nIf anyone else is unable to download pape=\r\nrs from the eplex site that would also help us to track down any problems w=\r\nith the site.\n\nThanks,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Rob Marsden &lt;rob@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t have account so click &quot;Create an accou=\r\nnt&quot; link which takes me to:\n&gt;      http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/user/registratio=\r\nn\n&gt; I fill in the form under user registration (all fields are required)\n&gt; =\r\nand click the &#39;Register&#39; button which attempts to take me to:\n&gt;      http:/=\r\n/eplex.cs.ucf.edu/user/registration.register\n&gt; which reports &#39;404 Not Found=\r\n&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it was my HTML, I&#39;d probably be looking at full stop before regi=\r\nster :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rob Marsden\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
