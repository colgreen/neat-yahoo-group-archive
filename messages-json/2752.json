Some of the links from those pages may help.\n\nMy first thought is that maybe you need to determine ranges on the \noutput function that correspond to activation levels. So for eaxample \nyou could very simply have a threshold model of:\n\nLow activity:  0&gt;x&lt;0.25 \nMid activity: 0.25&gt;x&lt;0.5\nHigh activity: 0.5&gt;x\n\nWhere x is the output from a sigmoid function that outputs over the \nrange 0 to 1.\n\nSo if you have two neurons that are both in the high activity band then \ntheir connection(s) is/are strengthened. If one is high and the other \nlow then the connection is weakened, and ultimately the weight should \nbecome negative so that the highly active neuron suppresses the inactive \none. The problem arises of how a low activity neuron could suppress or \nactivate another neuron, which makes me think that maybe hebbian \nlearning only works if you have an activation function with 0 in the \nmiddle of its output range with positive outputs being excitory and \nnegative being inhibirory, this instead of the terms active and inactive \nwhich maybe where I/we are getting confused.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
