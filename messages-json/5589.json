Something makes=\r\n me think this may be a mistake and I&#39;m missing something.  However a Conne=\r\nction is defined by the two nodes it connects - and a Node is defined by it=\r\n&#39;s position in a 0-1 x 0-1 2d space.  This means that nodes are considered =\r\nthe same if they occupy the same space (x,y) - there is no concept of a uni=\r\nque NodeID.  When a Node is created during a mutation it is given the X,Y p=\r\nosition half way between nodes defining the connection it is splitting.  It=\r\n is possible that in the future I will add other attributes to Nodes which =\r\nwill be taken into account for Node equality too - but for now it is just X=\r\n,Y.\n\nSo I have two questions:\n\n1)  When a Connection is disabled and then r=\r\ne-enabled in the future from crossover - if this connection is subsequently=\r\n split again by a new node mutation - my implementation effectively looses =\r\nthis mutation because the new node and connections have already been added =\r\nto the genotype in the original mutation.  So all that happens is the conne=\r\nction is disabled - again.  Mat&#39;s book mentions this and implies that a new=\r\n innovation should be created - which i guess means the network ends up wit=\r\nh an additional node?  I couldn&#39;t see where this explicitly happened in Ken=\r\n&#39;s code.\n\n2) Is the approach of defining a node by its position flawed? \n\n\n=\r\nThanks for your help\n\ncheers\nPhill\n\n\n\n"}}
