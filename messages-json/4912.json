Parameters should be explained in detail, for example: Which impact h=\r\nas the parameter Treshold, which impact has WeightRange, etc.? How are the =\r\nvalues for each parameter determined, what is taken into account when you s=\r\net the values? There are so many unanswered questions for those who are new=\r\n to HyperNEAT and I think most people (including me) have a really great in=\r\nterest in this topic, but not the time to read (and understand) all the tec=\r\nhnical papers. So any tutorial should target beginners and explain things t=\r\nhat have become self-evident for intermediates. \n\nI think one such &quot;officia=\r\nl&quot; tutorial that explains every step in detail should be enough, more will =\r\nsurely follow from the growing community.\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n\n--- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Andrei, which version o=\r\nf HyperNEAT are you interested in and what references have you looked at so=\r\n far?  We can potentially improve the documentation based on your comments =\r\n(and a tutorial is a good idea), but first I want to understand which &quot;comm=\r\nent-less examples&quot; you are referring to.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that several experiments=\r\n with complete source code are available in two existing HyperNEAT releases=\r\n of which I am aware.  These and a variety of publications from several gro=\r\nups are linked from the HyperNEAT Users Page, which also provides a brief i=\r\nntroduction:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I understand you may have already been through this site and its associate=\r\nd software and papers, but I wanted to point it out in case you had not bee=\r\nn aware of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to make the algorithm as accessible as possible=\r\n so your comments are appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone please recommend some =\r\nHyperNEAT documentation, a tutorial, diagram, some clue, or anything that d=\r\noes not mean reverse engineering the comment-less examples ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank=\r\ns!
