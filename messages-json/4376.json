I do not evolve 3D shapes\n&gt; yet. Just 2D. I am actually working on a new project that does much\n&gt; better than the previous one. Imagine the CPPN picture as a vector\n&gt; field, where you query the CPPN for the velocity of a vertex in a\n&gt; space. It is like you inflate a balloon in space. This way whole 3D\n&gt; meshes can be built with CPPNs. It is actually very similar to the\n&gt; work of Erin Hastings, where he uses CPPNs to control particle\n&gt; systems. I need some more time before I release that thing. But I\n&gt; appreciate your interest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Petar-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I cannot get this to run on the two windows machines I have tried it\n&gt; on. Is\n&gt;&gt; there any way you could post a video of this as well as a video of\n&gt; your app\n&gt;&gt; where HyperNEAT creates 3d creatures?
