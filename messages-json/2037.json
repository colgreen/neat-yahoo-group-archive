They \n&gt; think &quot;how hard can it be?&quot;  And the answer is &quot;far harder than \nyou \n&gt; imagine&quot;, and they come up with some horrible effort with clunky \n&gt; interfaces, unusable controls, manual install procedures, flat-\nshaded \n&gt; graphics which poke through walls, etc etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tBut Nero completely turns this experience around.  It is \n_very_ cool.  I \n&gt; just ran it last night and was up and running within a minute.  \nThere is \n&gt; even a tutorial!  Which is _necessary_ for any complex game these \ndays but \n&gt; usually gets missed out.  The menus all make sense, training the \nteams is \n&gt; easy.  There&#39;s a sound-track and sound effects and the graphics \nare OK (not \n&gt; quite up to commercial grade but that would probably be over the \ntop in \n&gt; this context).\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNice one Ken!\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNow I just need a longer day so there&#39;s time to play with \nit :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; \n&gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________ \n&gt; Yahoo!
