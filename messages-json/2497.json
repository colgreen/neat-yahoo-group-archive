For the\nusual robots that we are familiar with it is usually\ntoo slow to go through the 100&#39;s or 1000&#39;s of\ngenerations required.  However, this might be perfect\nfor nanobots.  If there is some kind of tiny robot\nneeding software, it may very well be practical to\nmake several hundred of them and have a real\npopulation.  There would have to be a way of rapidly &\nrepeatedly loading data into them, so that fitness\ntesting and survival of the fittest could be\nimplemented.\n\nI expect this will become practical, perhaps not\ntoday, but at some time in the future. \n\nDoes anyone have a tiny robot needing software?\n\nMitchell Timin\n\n--- Derek James &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Well, it doesn&#39;t require simulation, but simulation\n&gt; lets you do a whole lot\n&gt; more runs in a whole lot less time.\n&gt; \n&gt; At a conference presentation at GECCO, Dario\n&gt; Floreano talked about some\n&gt; robotics experiments in which the candidate ANNs\n&gt; were uploaded into the same\n&gt; robot one at a time for a given task (navigating a\n&gt; small environment, I\n&gt; think).  So if you have a population size of 100,\n&gt; you&#39;re uploading them one\n&gt; at a time and testing each.  Plus, you have to have\n&gt; some way of measuring\n&gt; progress...if the robot has a particular sensor for\n&gt; how far it is from a\n&gt; given goal state, then that could feed back into the\n&gt; software that&#39;s\n&gt; handling the evolutionary algorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Floreano also had some experiments with extremely\n&gt; small robots (sugar cube\n&gt; size).  If you could upload the candidate ANNs into\n&gt; 100 robots at a time,\n&gt; that would speed things up too...of course, most\n&gt; places don&#39;t have 100 cheap\n&gt; robots and the means to upload ANN controllers on\n&gt; the fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are advantages to both simulation and\n&gt; uploading directly into\n&gt; hardware.  Simulations are a pain to implement from\n&gt; scratch, and there&#39;s\n&gt; always, always performance issues when transfering a\n&gt; controller from a\n&gt; simulated environment to a real one...so\n&gt; hardware-only mitigates that.  But\n&gt; of course it&#39;s excruciatingly slow, and the task is\n&gt; going to have to be\n&gt; relatively simple and quick or you&#39;ll be doing runs\n&gt; that last years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/17/06, Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- tomoljack &lt;thomasjack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently writing an implementation of NEAT\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ruby. When I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finished, I plan to evolve neural nets to\n&gt; control a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CYE robot, taking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; input from a roving eye on the (dynamic) video\n&gt; input\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the robot&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; video camera, and outputting data about how to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; move/zoom the roving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eye and how to change the robots speed and\n&gt; heading.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I can&#39;t decide how I will go about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evaluating the networks&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitnesses. I would think it would be impractical\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; robot run using each neural net from every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; population (and it would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; involve lots of extra code to manage\n&gt; automatically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guiding the robot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back to its charging station when its batteries\n&gt; run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; low).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the robot will eventually use the\n&gt; champion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; network to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually perform a task, so the networks will\n&gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to learn how to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process dynamic video data and respond\n&gt; accordingly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I can&#39;t think of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way to simulate this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought maybe I would run the robot manually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through a number of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideal courses, recording the video, and compare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; networks&#39; responses to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the necessary responses for those courses, but\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not sure that will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work, as the responses during simulation would\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; affect the video\n&gt; &gt; &gt; data. The final net&#39;s responses will actually\n&gt; move\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the robot and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore affect the video data.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone else tried anything like this, or\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone have any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas about how to evaluate these networks&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitnesses?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m afraid that neuroevolution requires a computer\n&gt; &gt; simulation of the system to be controlled by the\n&gt; ANN.\n&gt; &gt; If there is any other way of doing it I would be\n&gt; very\n&gt; &gt; interested in knowing about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Using a simulation instead of the real system\n&gt; allows\n&gt; &gt; you to evaluate the fitness of thousands of\n&gt; candidate\n&gt; &gt; ANNs.  This is required to accomplish evolution. \n&gt; Of\n&gt; &gt; course if the simulation is not an accurate\n&gt; &gt; representation of the real system, the the ANN\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; does a good job controlling the simulation may not\n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; as well controlling the real system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; &gt; http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Tired of spam?
