I do have a couple questions/comments:  \n\nThe subculture idea is i=\r\nnteresting but did you consider aligning the subcultures with the NEAT-dete=\r\nrmined species divisions?  It seems strange that a &quot;subculture&quot; could cut a=\r\ncross species, though I suppose the existence of dogs and cats in human hou=\r\nseholds is sort of analogous.  On the other hand when you can actually &quot;lea=\r\nrn&quot; to be almost identical to another species (as you can when you are just=\r\n a neural network) maybe it doesn&#39;t really matter that much what species yo=\r\nu started from.\n\nOn a more philosophical level, it&#39;s interesting that teach=\r\ning in general is a kind of convergent force towards conformity.  Obviously=\r\n some of that is necessary in society, but it raises the question of whethe=\r\nr societies transmit creativity through teaching (or at least can avoid dam=\r\naging creativity when teaching).  This question is a bit abstract, but it d=\r\noes relate to novelty search - the kind of divergent proliferation of stepp=\r\ning stones seen in non-objective search is potentially inhibited in a socia=\r\nl learning society.  So it raises the question of whether you can actually =\r\nhave both social transmission and non-objective divergence together.  Inter=\r\nestingly, human society seems to have both ingredients working very effecti=\r\nvely together.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m proud to announce my first GECCO paper!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nTitle: Accelerating Evolution via Egalitarian Social Learning\n&gt; Authors: We=\r\nsley Tansey, Eliana Feasley, and Risto Miikkulainen\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; Social=\r\n learning is an extension to evolutionary algorithms that enables\n&gt; agents =\r\nto learn from observations of others in the population.\n&gt; Historically, soc=\r\nial learning algorithms have employed a student-teacher\n&gt; model where the b=\r\nehavior of one or more high-fitness agents is used to\n&gt; train a subset of t=\r\nhe remaining agents in the population. This paper\n&gt; presents ESL, an egalit=\r\narian model of social learning in which agents are\n&gt; not labeled as teacher=\r\ns or students, instead allowing any individual\n&gt; receiving a sufficiently h=\r\nigh reward to teach other agents to mimic its\n&gt; recent behavior. We validat=\r\ne our approach through a series of experiments\n&gt; in a robot foraging domain=\r\n, including comparisons of egalitarian social\n&gt; learning with baseline neur=\r\noevolution and a variant of student-teacher\n&gt; social learning. In a complex=\r\n foraging task, ESL converges to near-optimal\n&gt; strategies faster than eith=\r\ner benchmark approach, outperforming both by\n&gt; more than an order of magnit=\r\nude. The results indicate that egalitarian\n&gt; social learning is a promising=\r\n new paradigm for social learning in\n&gt; intelligent agents.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paper page:=\r\n http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D127157\n&gt; \n&gt; Github repository=\r\n for all source code:\n&gt; https://github.com/tansey/social-learning\n&gt; \n&gt; A co=\r\nuple of things to note here that I believe will be very helpful to\n&gt; anyone=\r\n using SharpNEAT in general:\n&gt; \n&gt; - If you&#39;re looking to do Lamarckian evol=\r\nution, it turns out to be very\n&gt; easy: https://gist.github.com/2410490\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n - We implemented backpropagation through time for the FastCyclicNetwork.\n&gt;=\r\n Using the SharpNeatV2 that is in the github repo, you can perform\n&gt; superv=\r\nised learning on a NEAT network very easily, enabling online learning\n&gt; alg=\r\norithms to be incorporated into SharpNEAT experiments:\n&gt; https://gist.githu=\r\nb.com/2410545\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin, I&#39;d love if you could take a look at the backprop=\r\n implementation and\n&gt; potentially integrate it into a future release of Sha=\r\nrpNEAT. Outside of our\n&gt; hacking of the FastCyclicNetwork class, it only re=\r\nquired changing\n&gt; permissions on a few properties here and there.\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\ncaveats here are that the backprop implementation requires you reset\n&gt; the =\r\nnetwork state at every activation to be correct. If you&#39;re doing\n&gt; somethin=\r\ng where recurrent networks that maintain state between calls are\n&gt; required=\r\n, then the performance of this method is not guaranteed to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If an=\r\nyone has any comments or questions on the paper, I&#39;m happy to discuss\n&gt; it!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
