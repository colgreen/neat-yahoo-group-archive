Break each space up into much smaller areas \nand assign e=\r\nach cluster to a specific area. Since you are doing this \nin 2D it would me=\r\nan a simple check of 9 areas per area (a 3x3 matrix \nof areas, with the cur=\r\nrent area being checked in position 5, the \ncenter). BTW, I haven&#39;t read th=\r\ne entire thread so you may already \nhave mentioned this...\n\nThis is used qu=\r\nite often in 3D games to reduce the number of objects \nbeing rendered and a=\r\nlso to reduce the number of interaction checks \nneeded (as in collisions).\n=\r\n\nLS\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s a speciation/clustering method that may by useful for\n&gt; speciatin=\r\ng initial populations or respeciating when the number of\n&gt; species deviates=\r\n from the target number, e.g. because of an old\n&gt; species has been culled.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Step 1) Assign genomes randomly to a cluster.\n&gt; Step 2) For each genom=\r\ne calculate its mean distance from the genomes\n&gt; in each cluster. Move the =\r\ngenome to the cluster it is closest to (if\n&gt; necessary).\n&gt; Step 3) Goto Ste=\r\np 2 until no more re-assignments are necessary or \nthe\n&gt; number of re-assig=\r\nnments falls below some low threshold number.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some graphs in=\r\n my blog of an experimental run using points\n&gt; in 2D space, see http://the-=\r\nlocster.livejournal.com/43595.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Following this we can probably get =\r\na reasonably good initial number\n&gt; for the compatibility threshold by measu=\r\nring the distance between\n&gt; genomes in clusters; since clusters will be rou=\r\nghtly spherical in\n&gt; shape (hyperspheres) we can take the largest distance =\r\nbetween any \ntwo\n&gt; genomes in a cluster as being an approximation of each s=\r\npheres&#39;\n&gt; diameter, and thus the compatibilityy threshold should be about h=\r\nalf\n&gt; this figure.
