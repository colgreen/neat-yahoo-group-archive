Do you work in Matlab, Python or something else?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith =\r\na colleague, we work on a model that implements structural plasticity, hete=\r\nrogeneous conduction delays and STDP in spiking neurons (we use the Izhikev=\r\nich neuron and everything is implemented in Matlab). Synapses are build dep=\r\nending on the activation level of the neuron and its projection kernel. I t=\r\nhink, the projection kernel could be something that can be encoded by a CPP=\r\nN. Having this kind of super-gun, we are now facing the question: how to se=\r\ntup an appropriate fitness-function, which runs a bit into the discussions =\r\nwe had here the last weeks. :-)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest,&lt;br&gt;\nMartin&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(255,255,255);min-heigh=\r\nt:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--f46d04428eb6ddd98204d82fdbec--\r\n\n"}}
