If \nyou&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt;connecting nodes A & B, then=\r\n start with B and traverse the net \nto see\n&gt; &gt; &gt;if you connect to A.  If yo=\r\nu do, disallow the connection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks, this is an option I&#39;l=\r\nl keep in mind if I decide to \nattempt the\n&gt; &gt;Othello comp. Of course this =\r\napproach will probably start eating \nCPU\n&gt; &gt;cycles as the genomes become mo=\r\nre complex so it&#39;s something I&#39;d \nprefer\n&gt; &gt;to leave out of the code base i=\r\nn the long term - being somewhat \nobsessed\n&gt; &gt;with optimisations as I am :)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;One possible optimisation is to keep a list of a genome&#39;s neurons \n=\r\nin the\n&gt; &gt;order that they are connected, so that again we can safely assume=\r\n \nthat\n&gt; &gt;making a connection between some neurons with some index to some =\r\n\nhigher\n&gt; &gt;index in the list is OK. Elsewhere though I have code that assum=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt;neurons are in innovation ID order, as this allows finding of \nneuron=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;with a binary search over the list - so probably the solution is \nto\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;maintain two lists.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;          You might already be thinking thi=\r\ns, but one cheap way to \ndo \n&gt; this is to keep a &quot;depth parameter&quot; in each =\r\nneuron.  Depth is \ndefined \n&gt; as zero in the input layer, and for any other=\r\n neurone is the \nhighest \n&gt; depth amongst its inputs plus one.  All you nee=\r\nd do then is (i) \nnever \n&gt; connect from higher to lower depth (equal is OK)=\r\n and (ii) scan the \n&gt; neurones recalculating the depth after any connection=\r\n change.  \nThis \n&gt; is a simple form of dynamic programming....\n&gt; \n&gt;        =\r\n  Ian\n&gt; \n\nI believe the depth-parameter way is the most efficient way to do=\r\n \nit, althougn my code (like Derek and Philip&#39;s) uses loop-checking.  \nI&#39;m =\r\npretty sure Mat Buckland&#39;s version of NEAT keeps track of depth \nand does t=\r\nhings that way so you might refer to his code, or even his \nbook, which exp=\r\nlains how he did it.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
