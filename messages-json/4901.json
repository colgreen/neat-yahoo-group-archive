There are .NET Extensions for Parallel Processing if\nyou wish to stay with .NET and object-oriented approaches, say for\nSharpNEAT.  Intel has its Parallel Studio, and gives good insight into C++\nHyperNEAT.\n \nThe whole issue of partitioning of tasks and data for parallel processing is\ninteresting when applied to NEAT - or any genetic-inspired computation. I&#39;ve\nbeen experimenting on various fabrics for massively parallel computation (on\nGPUs, for example) for HyperNEAT. So far, I&#39;ve had some successes, but\nsometimes absolute failures, too. \n \nI&#39;ve been pulled off my neuroevolution projects for more mundane (read:\nmoney making) tasks.  Hopefully, I can get back to them very shortly.\n \nKen Lloyd\nWatt Systems Technologies Inc.\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jeff\nHaynes\nSent: Thursday, November 19, 2009 12:56 PM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [neat] F# NEAT\n\n\n  \n\nHi, I&#39;ve been quiet on this group for a long time although I&#39;ve kept my\nsubscription so I remember to play with NEAT once I have free time\n(presumably retirement).  I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea in my head for\nsome time of doing an implementation of NEAT in F#.  For the uninitiated, F#\nis MS&#39;s functional .NET solution to the manycore system.  It is completely\ninteroperable with C#/VB and can use the .NET framework.  I&#39;m still getting\ncompletely ramped up on it but it seems like it might be very well suited to\nNEAT.  I was wondering what people think about this.  Waste of time?  Maybe\nNEAT would be better suited to hadoop or something like that.  Maybe\nsomething like this has already been done.  Anyway, I welcome thoughts.\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\n-- \n...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\ninteresting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in,\nfits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well,\nmust have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful idea that as\nthe sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle\ngets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically hanging on to the notion\nthat everything&#39;s going to be alright, because this world was meant to have\nhim in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches\nhim rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the\nwatch out for.\n\n-- Douglas Adams\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00CD_01CA691C.5E975FE0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18852&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D0=\r\n78581820-19112009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;Hi Jeff,&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D078581820-191120=\r\n09&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D078581820-19112009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D=\r\n#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;F#&nbsp; tends to be declarative, which is f=\r\nine if that \nparadigm&nbsp;is more comfortable for you.&nbsp; There are .NE=\r\nT Extensions for \nParallel Processing if you wish to stay with .NET and obj=\r\nect-oriented \napproaches, say for SharpNEAT.&nbsp; Intel has its Parallel S=\r\ntudio, and gives \ngood insight into C++ HyperNEAT.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D078581820-19112009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000=\r\n0ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D078581820-19112009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 fa=\r\nce=3DArial&gt;The whole issue of partitioning of tasks and data for parallel \n=\r\nprocessing is interesting when applied to NEAT - or any genetic-inspired \nc=\r\nomputation.
