You can keep\n&gt;a list of innovations as well if you want the same connection or\n&gt;node to get the same innovation number in a separate mutation.  None\n&gt;of this is very expensive.\n&gt;\n&gt;There is the one slight problem of crossover when having two\n&gt;connections with different numbers connecting the same nodes in\n&gt;different genomes.  But this is easily taken care of just by\n&gt;checking during crossover if there is already a connection between\n&gt;the two nodes so you don&#39;t have more than one.\n&gt;\n&gt;The idea of a massive superhistory, such as John proposes below,\n&gt;sounds very expensive in terms of space.  You realize these\n&gt;populations take up a lot of room so if you plan to keep track of\n&gt;everything that ever happened and everyone it happened to, that&#39;s a\n&gt;very large record.  It would have to be kept on disk.  On the other\n&gt;hand if you have the space, I suppose why not do it.\n\nWhere it would prove useful is in evaluating different tunings or different \nideas (like deletions), you can (perhaps) tell by the history what role that \nfeature had.  Turn it on for simple experiments and then try different runs \nwith different settings and then look at the historys to see what avenues \nthe search took.  That would give you definite data to work with (or be \nswamped with) to determine the effect of a proposed change to the algorithm.\n\nAnd then, when you just want a network that does the job, you turn it off. \n:)\n\n\n\n"}}
