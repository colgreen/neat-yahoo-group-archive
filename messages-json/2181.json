I think *time* might be another dimension of physical \nneurons.  In other words, there are likely nuances in a physical \nneuron&#39;s firing and the *timing of the receptivity* of a \nrelated/connected neuron that had some level of influence on the \nevolution of the neurons and organ.  And therefore, likely have a \nreasonable influence on the emergent effects produced.  Which in turn \neffected the further evolution of both the neurons and organ.  A strange \nloop, so to speak.\n\nAs you mention later, the neurons which are modeled in the ANNs we have \nbeen using in NEAT are very simple compared to physical neurons.  The \nidea that *all* the neurons activate in sequence (activation wave) \nbefore another activation wave begins is not very similar to nature at \nall.  However, the amount of computing capacity required to simulate the \nhighly parallel, massively distributed and mildly chaotic (inherent \nnoise) nature of physical neurons means it is much more difficult to \nsimulate their behavior than the simple approach currently used.\n\nHaven&#39;t some experiments been done where they added the time component \nto the model and then were able to do some very sophisticated learning \nwith very few neurons, compared to the simpler activation wave method?\n\n\nJim\n\n\nColin Green wrote:\n\n&gt; Philip Tucker wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) I&#39;m sure real neural networks have clusters.  It&#39;s debatable\n&gt; &gt; whether this is a necessary feature or simply a byproduct of biology -\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s much easier for two neurons in close spatial proximity to be\n&gt; &gt; connected than those farther apart.  But do neural networks have hubs?\n&gt;\n&gt; Not sure but I thought I&#39;d add that the clusters in mammalian brains are\n&gt; arranged in columns. The neural column is, I think, the basic unit of\n&gt; repetition, and interconnections within a column have been observed to\n&gt; be far more numerous than those between columns.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) The NEAT paradigm is not biased toward either of these network\n&gt; &gt; features.  Any node has an equal chance connecting to any other node\n&gt; &gt; (excepting the initial connections between input and output nodes).\n&gt;\n&gt; Which would be more like the case /within/ a neural column, for example,\n&gt; which contains far more neurons (approx. 100k is a figure I recall) than\n&gt; any NEAT evolved ANN I&#39;ve ever seen. If clustering is a strategy for\n&gt; dealing with complexity, and our ANN&#39;s don&#39;t get very complex then it&#39;s\n&gt; not clear that it would be a useful strategy to engineer into NEAT. On\n&gt; the other hand clustering may happen at numerous levels, so e.g.a neural\n&gt; column may contain sub-clusters, some of which may contain very small\n&gt; groups similar in size to our ANN&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Despite this lack of bias in the evolutionary model, do clusters or\n&gt; &gt; hubs emerge?  If they are crucial features of an effective network,\n&gt; &gt; should we build such biases into the evolutionary process?  For\n&gt; &gt; example, the likelihood of a connection being added between two nodes\n&gt; &gt; could be proportional to the connectivity distance between the two\n&gt; &gt; (this could be based on a unidirectional or bidirectional traversal of\n&gt; &gt; connections).  Or, the weight could be proportional to this distance. \n&gt; &gt; As an alternative to connectivity distance, we could give the nodes a\n&gt; &gt; spatial layout, perhaps on a 2-dimensional surface, and have\n&gt; &gt; connection mutation be relative to that spatial distance.\n&gt;\n&gt; As an aside, laying neuron&#39;s out in a grid space, 2D, 3D or otherwise\n&gt; (why not 4D or more?) is something I&#39;ve considered when thinking about\n&gt; indirect encodings. &#39;growing&#39; neurons within a limited space is one way\n&gt; of preventing an indirect encoding from growing ANN&#39;s too large to\n&gt; simulate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually when I started out doing work on neuro-evolution my first\n&gt; instinct was to use grid layouts (I used hexagonal grids) and the\n&gt; question of how many dimensions I should use came up. It occured to me\n&gt; that real world neural nets exist in 3D due to physical constriants -\n&gt; there are only 3 spacial dimensions! - and this presents a limit to the\n&gt; amount of connectivity a biological neural net can achieve, because of\n&gt; the physical size of neurons and their connections and the limited space\n&gt; available. Therefore it makes sense to connect more to your neighbours\n&gt; than to distant neurons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course the ANN&#39;s in NEAT are effectively dimensionless, any neuron\n&gt; can connect to any other without any limits or concept of relative\n&gt; distance and the lack of this restriction is one of the benefits we have\n&gt; over biology. Perhaps though clustering is not just a strategy for\n&gt; dealing with physical limitations, but actually has other positive side\n&gt; effects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Trying to engineer some kind of clustering factor into NEAT is an\n&gt; interesting idea. I don;t think it&#39;s a substitute for the  existing\n&gt; modular NEAT approaches because there is no repetition of\n&gt; clusters(unless maybe you can identify them), but it may be a more\n&gt; efficient way of evolving small ANN&#39;s in general.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Expanding on the 4D comment above - when I started out with\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Philip\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; Philip Tucker\n&gt; &gt; ptucker@... &lt;mailto:ptucker@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
