The challenge\n&gt; with encodings is not only for them to theoretically express all\n&gt; possible procedures, but also to induce a nicely coupled (smooth)\n&gt; search space. It seems that the space induced by a strictly modular\n&gt; and hierarchical encodings is unlikely to be smooth, leading to\n&gt; brittleness. You can have things like a massive new module being\n&gt; doubled in one shot (which would usually be a mess, like being born\n&gt; with two heads) or a change at one level of the hierarchy breaking the\n&gt; rest of it entirely.\n\nAnd yet if evolution stumbles upon a module whose usefulness stems\nfrom multiple occurrences, how else would this be accomplished? If we\nwant artificial encodings to be able to produce something like a\nmammalian brain, aren&#39;t they necessarily going to incorporate\nhierarchy and modularity?\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
