In fact we&#39;ve done XOR runs before where the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nstarting topology is completely disconnected (i.e., 0 connections)\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nit is able to find a solution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Philip\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your reply,=\r\n Phillip.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a practical matter, is setting all connections to zero (i=\r\nncluding\n&gt; input connections) somthing that I set through the properties fi=\r\nle or\n&gt; is it something I need to code?  Thanks again.\n\nIf, by input connec=\r\ntions, you mean connections incoming to the input\nlayer,  those don&#39;t have =\r\nweights, they serve only to pass the input\nvalues to the input neurons.  Th=\r\ne initial input values to the network\nwould be dependant on the fitness fun=\r\nction.\n\nAll genes, including connection genes, are set to random initial\nva=\r\nlues in the following call path:\ncom.anji.neat.Evolver() constructor \n  org=\r\n.jgap.Genotype.randomInitialGenotype() \n    org.jgap.ChromosomeMaterial.ran=\r\ndomInitialChromosomeMaterial()\n      org.jgap.Gene.setToRandomValue()\n\nThe =\r\n4 best alternatives I see offhand for accomplishing what you want:\n\n1) Chan=\r\nge the ConnectionGene.setToRandomValue() method to initialize\nthe weight to=\r\n 0.  That would cause all newly added connections, not\njust those of the in=\r\nitial population, to start out with a 0 weight.\n2) Change ChromosomeMateria=\r\nl.randomInitialChromosomeMaterial() so that\nit does not call Gene.setToRand=\r\nomValue().  The weight in\nConnectionGene objects defaults to 0, and\nNeuronG=\r\nene.setToRandomValue() doesn&#39;t do anything (although it will\nwhen we make n=\r\neurons genes more complex, for example to have different\nactivation functio=\r\nns).\n3) Have the Evolver constructor loop through all ConnectionGenes,\nimme=\r\ndiately after the call to Genotype.randomInitialGenotype(), and\nexplicitly =\r\nset the weights to 0.\n4) The only way to do it without code changes would b=\r\ne manually to\ncreate an initial population of chromosomes.  You can hand-co=\r\nde the\nXML files (giving all the connections weights of 0) and save them in=\r\n\nthe db/chromosome directory, and reference them from a run.xml file in\nthe=\r\n db/run directory.  Then, when you start a run specify the run.xml\nfile wit=\r\nh the &quot;previous.run&quot; property.  The initial population will be\nseeded from =\r\nthose chromosomes.\n\nI hope that helps!\n\n- Philip\n\n"}}
