Our paper, &quot;Evolving the Placement and Density of\n&gt; Neurons in the HyperNEAT Substrate,&quot; which will be presented at GECCO this year\n\nNice work, I really like the approach. I agree with the discussion at\nthe end regarding quad/hyper-trees not necessarily being the last\nword, that was one of my first thoughts. And that ties in to some\nextent with the issue about number of nodes being generated being more\nthan was strictly required - perhaps variant approaches could be more\nconservative in how many nodes they produce, although there are\npruning params already that influence this. The image of the evolved\nANN was interestingly asymetric as well I thought, it had a natural\nlook to it.\n\nOverall though I think the obvious approach to evolving substrate is\nto co-evolve it independently, so it was nice to (A) show an\nalternative which probably will spark a range of news ideas, and (B)\ndemonstrate the independently co-evolved substrate might actually be\ninferior to an ES-NEAT like approach.\n\nIt will be interesting to see this approach develop and be applied to\nprogressivley more difficult tasks.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
