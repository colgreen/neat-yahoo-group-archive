If you can code \nin C++ you can do the other two. C# even has pointers.\n\n2) Nasty build problems are largely elminated by Java/.Net - if you get \nthe correct JDK/framework version you&#39;re almost there. In fact with \nSharpNEAT there are no external dependencies outside of the cour \nlibrary. I&#39;m not 100% sure if this is true of the Java NEATs, but I \ndon&#39;t recall having any problem building ANJI a while back.\n\n3) .Net is language agnostic and there exist, amongst many others, \ncompilers for Java, C++ and C# that target the .Net CLR (The equivalent \nof the Java Virtual Machine). Classes can be definend in one language, \nsub-classed in another and instantiated in yet another, it&#39;s so easy I \nfelt like crying when I first used it, surely it must be a trick? :)\n\nSo you could write an experiment in C++ and plug it into SharpNEAT. On \nthe other hand with a few minor syntactic alterations your C++ will \ncompile as Java and you can plug it into ANJI - obviously how you attach \nan experiment to our frameworks differs a bit, but not by much I would \nexpect.\n\n&gt;\tMy coding style tends towards object-based approaches, templated \n&gt;utilities, small classes, inheritance only for clearly defined interfaces, \n&gt;STL containers (but not generally streams), lots of asserts and code \n&gt;designed to crash rather than vaguely paper over errors....\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJava has an assert keyword, .Net just has a Debug.Assert method in the \nframework. But since they run in managed runtime environments you won&#39;t \nget any nasty pointer errors, corruption of memory or anything like that \nanyway.\n\n&gt; OTOH, I would be quite happy to start with a written \n&gt;specification and write it myself.  I find this is usually the fastest way \n&gt;to get into understanding all the dirty details...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, absolutely agree there.\n\n&gt;\tWhat do people recommend?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell obviously I&#39;m biased so all I will say is that if you do want to \ntry out SharpNEAT then all you need is the SDK from microsoft (free \ndownload). On top of that you really want a nice IDE and SharpDevelop \nshould do nicely there(again, free) - it has support for C++ coding as \nwell as C# and others. The only other issue is that there has been \nanother code re-org since the version on sourceforge and I&#39;ve been \nhanding out versions to people as and when requested until I get round \nto doing a proper release. The re-org was specifically done to support \nco-ev experiments!\n\nFor ANJI you need the Java SDK (free!) and for a free IDE I would \nsuggest IBM Eclipse. Actually Eclipse has support for and is integrated \nwith all kinds of systems these days, e.g. I strongly suspect you could \nuse it for developing in C++ and C# as well.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
