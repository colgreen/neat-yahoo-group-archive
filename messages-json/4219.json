OK well think of the bias like a shift of the \nfunction. The grap=\r\nh doesn&#39;t have to be centered around the X=3D0 \nvertical axis. It may be sh=\r\nifted left or right. This is what the bias \ndoes. It is possible to find a =\r\nfunctioning neural network without \nusing any bias, depending on the domain=\r\n, of course, but I think in \nmost cases it is essential, at least it speeds=\r\n up the search towards \nfinding a solution. There is evidence that evolutio=\r\nn can use even \nregular inputs as bias values, when they are just being the=\r\n same all \nthe time (I refer to the Automobile Crash Prediction System that=\r\n Ken \ndeveloped, using visual images as input instead of laser \nrangefinger=\r\ns). \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Correy Allen Kowall&quot; \n&lt;coolbeans=\r\nkowall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; How about Gaussian activation function?\n&gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nYou refer to the bias value that is usually present in the NN \nnodes in \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; most models. In NEAT there is a bias input which has a constant \nvalue \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; of 1.0. There is clear advantage for using it, otherwise the \n&gt; &gt; hyperp=\r\nlanes that the nodes represent would all cross the origin \nof the \n&gt; &gt; hype=\r\nrspace, which is limiting the possible behaviors the NN can \nhave. \n&gt; &gt; But=\r\n not all nodes in NEAT have a connection to the bias node. \nEvolution \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nconnects nodes to it when only when it is useful. In this way the \n&gt; &gt; sear=\r\nch space is further minimized, NEAT does not have to search \nfor a \n&gt; &gt; pro=\r\nper bias on every node. \n&gt; &gt; However, in HyperNEAT substrates, it is better=\r\n to have a bias in \nevery \n&gt; &gt; neuron anyway, then the biases will be &quot;draw=\r\nn&quot; by the CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stig=\r\n.bergestad&quot; &lt;stig.bergestad@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wo=\r\nndering if the original NEAT(c++) used/uses threshold \nvalues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for nod=\r\ne activation?
