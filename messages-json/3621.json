It is hard to tell you why, but.. maybe the population size is \ntoo sma=\r\nll? If the population size is too small and there are many \nspecies, there =\r\nis not enough room for mating, I mean the mating pool \nis too small and the=\r\n space is not searched very efficiently. \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ps=\r\nyphiroth.nebu&quot; &lt;psyphiroth.nebu@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your kindness, =\r\nbut, well, I actually know what these \n&gt; parameters mean, but *don&#39;t* know =\r\nhow to decide the parameter \nvalues \n&gt; in a specific problem. I noticed tha=\r\nt in different experiments \nthere \n&gt; are different parameter values, but I =\r\ndon&#39;t know why, though they \nare \n&gt; found experimentally, there should be s=\r\nomething that tells you the \n&gt; range of a parameter in a certain experiment=\r\n. \n&gt; Back to my problem, I used the same parameter setting as DPM, but \n&gt; c=\r\nould not get a satisfied answer, and I thought the output I need \nwas \n&gt; si=\r\nmilar to DPM. Could you tell me why? I had not expected that you \n&gt; would r=\r\neply so fast, morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot;=\r\n \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well basically you need to understan=\r\nd how two genotypes (NNs) are \n&gt; &gt; compared so that it is determined whethe=\r\nr they are in the same \n&gt; &gt; species or not. \n&gt; &gt; The total number of excess=\r\n and disjoint genes is counted, as well \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; the average weight diffe=\r\nrence of matching genes. These 3 values \nare \n&gt; &gt; then multiplied by their =\r\nimportance factors and summed up to \n&gt; produce \n&gt; &gt; the distance value. If =\r\nthat distance value is less than the \n&gt; &gt; compatibility threshold, then the=\r\n genotypes are in the same \n&gt; species, \n&gt; &gt; else they are in two separate s=\r\npecies.\n&gt; &gt; So what you need to adjust is the importance factors and the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; compatibility threshold. \n&gt; &gt; There is no general rule on how to adjust =\r\nthe importance factors, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; notice that if you set them all to 1.0,=\r\n this basically means that \na \n&gt; &gt; weight difference of 1.0 is as important=\r\n as one excess or one \n&gt; &gt; disjoint gene. (I assume that the numbers of exc=\r\ness/disjoint \ngenes \n&gt; &gt; are absolute, they are not divided by genome size)=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; You can also make the compatibility treshold dynamic, that is, \n&gt; ch=\r\noose \n&gt; &gt; a target number of species and alter the compatibility threshold =\r\n\n&gt; each \n&gt; &gt; generation, if there are too many species, raise it, or lower =\r\nit \nif \n&gt; &gt; there are too few.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
