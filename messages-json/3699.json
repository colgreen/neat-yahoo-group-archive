This wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily be a big deal, but in general .NET Remoting is much better than Java\n&gt; RMI from a design level. Also, GUI development in Java is a horrendous ordeal\n&gt; compared to VS and the resulting front end has a tendency to look like an OS/2\n&gt; program.\n\nYes the GUI side of things concerns me, and I think some of the GUI\nstuff is important - it&#39;s not just the core NEAT code I&#39;m thinking of\nhere - visualisation matters.\n\nI hadn&#39;t considered remoting API&#39;s, but that&#39;s another good point.\n\n\n\n&gt; On the other hand, I agree that Java is the preferred language for most research\n&gt; nowadays, and the cross platform compatibility is a big plus.\n\nWith regards to cross platform support there is Mono and dotGNU, and\nthen on the IDE front you have MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop, so it&#39;s\nnot a complete dead-end, but regardless of these acceptance of .Net/C#\nin academia is an important aspect to consider.\n\n\n\n&gt; Personally, I&#39;d say if you can do it without requiring too many changes to the\n&gt; API, go for it. At the end of the day, SharpNeat is a means to an end for most\n&gt; people, not the end itself. Whether it&#39;s C# or Java, I think what most people\n&gt; are interested in is really just the XML ANN that it produces.\n\n\nYes and no. In my experience it takes a lot of tweaking and rethinking\nof fitness functions before you get to a useable ANN. Being able to\nvisualise the speciation, networks, progress graphs is really useful\nin tracking what is going on, what is going wrong, etc. It&#39;s an\niterative process that leads you to a good fitness function and the\nright NEAT parameters.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Oh and the other issue is that of support for generics/templates. Both\n&gt; &gt; Java and .Net have this now but in the Java world generics are still\n&gt; &gt; just language level constructs -\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath on that happening.\n\n\nFrom a quick google it seems that it is being discussed for Java 7,\nbut yeh, I won&#39;t hold my breath there. see\nhttp://tech.puredanger.com/java7#reified\n\n\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, all that you&#39;re going to lose from\n&gt; an efficiency standpoint is having to call CHECKCAST in the bytecode a few\n&gt; times. That&#39;s not a big deal.\n\n\nWell, potentially a few million CHECKCAST&#39;s per second :) But no it&#39;s\nnot a *big* deal.\n\n\nThanks for the feedback, I&#39;m going to have a look at VS 2008 as you\ncan d/load 90-day trial versons for free right now. Also I&#39;ll have a\nlook at using a standalone SVN/CVS tool such as TortoiseSVN (or indeed\nEclipse).\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
