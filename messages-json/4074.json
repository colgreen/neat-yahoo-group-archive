As some of you know from experience,\nevolving black and whi=\r\nte pictures with CPPN-like representations is\nfairly straightforward, but a=\r\ndding color is a major challenge.  Thanks\nin large part to Nick Beato, who =\r\ndid the actual implementation on the\napplet after many group discussions, w=\r\ne now have an intuitive and fun\ncolor evolution system that actually works.=\r\n  An important aspect of\nour color system for the continuity of the site is=\r\n that it allows you\nbegin with one of the preexisting black and white image=\r\ns (if you want)\nand it will evolve color into it seamlessly.  So all the ex=\r\nisting\nimages can now be colorized!\n\nWe&#39;ve just begun to start publishing s=\r\nome color images, which you can\nsee under our Newest Images category:\n\nhttp=\r\n://picbreeder.org/imagedisplay.php?type=3DCREATED&page=3D0\n\nBy the way, in =\r\ncase you did not know, Picbreeder also allows anonymous\npublishing, so you =\r\ndon&#39;t need an account to play with and even publish\ncolor pictures.\n\nken\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
