If not, I&#39;m seriously \n&gt; confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; The NEAT FAQ question you refer to says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Each node adds up the activation from all incoming nodes from the \n&gt; previous timestep.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But you just said: &quot;...you don&#39;t need to keep activation in memory \n&gt; from the previous timestep.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; How are these two statements compatible?\n&gt; \n\nI see....I had thought from Colin&#39;s comment on what you were saying\nthat you *only* keep activation in memory when there is a recurrent\nconnection involved, which implies something different.  However, if\nit&#39;s just that all the previous activations are collected as mentioned\nin the FAQ, we are doing things the same way.\n\nProbably it is a good idea to check with Philip to be safe.  It may\nturn out to be semantics as you say.\n\nken\n\n&gt; &gt; It sounds like what Derek and Philip are doing is trying to send\n&gt; &gt; activation all the way through the network by traversing the \n&gt; network\n&gt; &gt; on each activation.  \n&gt; \n&gt; To be honest, I need to check with Philip about exactly how we are \n&gt; handling recurrent activation.  I could be misstating how we have\nit \n&gt; working.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
