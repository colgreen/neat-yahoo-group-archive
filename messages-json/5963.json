We will al=\r\nso run into software compatibility issues right away when such a thing gets=\r\n started. And there are domains in which the software is almost useless, li=\r\nke in robotics when you test stuff on hardware that probably nobody else ha=\r\ns or it is used in specific environments. \n\nI think a better idea is to hav=\r\ne a common software infrastructure for simulations. Much like standard benc=\r\nhmarks, a piece of software that brings results we can all agree upon. \n\nPe=\r\nter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken Lloyd&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken Stanley,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent point.  The aspects of a) validating existing experiment=\r\nal data,\n&gt; and 2) extending experimentation on priors into new realms, is m=\r\nessy,\n&gt; humbling business.  Often, it is akin to exposing your dirty laundr=\r\ny to\n&gt; others.  For most of us, it merely shows us how much we don&#39;t know, =\r\nand the\n&gt; need further work to find out.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Eventually, if we have=\r\n something meaningful to contribute, hopefully we will\n&gt; publish it so othe=\r\nrs can further the cause.  The problem with application of\n&gt; an approach in=\r\n new domains is:  You find yourself having to explain all the\n&gt; inferential=\r\n steps, what they mean and how they work (Yudkowsky - Expecting\n&gt; Short Inf=\r\nerential Distances).  Strangely enough, you might be able to encode\n&gt; a hom=\r\nology of chain complexes in something like a hyper-dimensional, CPPN to\n&gt; d=\r\no just that .\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Ken Lloyd\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yahoogroups.com =\r\n[mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ken\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 18, =\r\n2013 1:21 AM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Open science =\r\nsoftware/experiment repository\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m all for releas=\r\ning code and our group tries to do that with our own\n&gt; research, but I woul=\r\nd be hesitant about the idea of using scholarly\n&gt; organizations to require =\r\npeople to do it. Like many well-intended rules, I\n&gt; can imagine a lot of na=\r\nsty unintended consequences.

More practically, it will mean that\n&gt; reviewers will sta=\r\nrt rejecting papers based on supposed code glitches in\n&gt; required code subm=\r\nissions. That will give reviewers a whole new\n&gt; justification for completel=\r\ny ignoring the main of idea of the paper. \n&gt; \n&gt; Students will also become o=\r\nverwhelmed with code emergencies (since\n&gt; publication will depend now upon =\r\nstrangers running your code) and code\n&gt; cleanups demanded by random strange=\r\nrs who may themselves be at fault or\n&gt; simply ignorant. Furthermore, in a f=\r\new years we will have massive\n&gt; repositories of junk code (think of the hun=\r\ndreds of papers published only at\n&gt; GECCO in one year) that is so out of da=\r\nte that it requires deprecated\n&gt; compilers and computing platforms even to =\r\nrun. But we will be required to\n&gt; maintain these repositories, which will b=\r\necome increasingly ignored, simply\n&gt; to maintain the appearance of rigor.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;d prefer just to leave it voluntary and concentrate on making it easi=\r\ner to\n&gt; find code from people who actually want to share it and keep it up =\r\nto date. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com  , Oliver Coleman\n&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, you make a lot of good points.

In my opinion, having a website with many sub-field=\r\ns means\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most people in these sub-fields will not be aware of t=\r\nhe website, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they will use their own solutions and, overall, that=\r\n the site will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly empty. As a consequence, people will not thi=\r\nnk about this website\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as _the_ place to check and to submit. Put diff=\r\nerently, I think that\n&gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a general website has a high probability=\r\n of being a &quot;ghost website&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without enough inhabitants to survive. It=\r\n&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; to program a website,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s much harder to make it alive and=\r\n successful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s why we tried to do something for our own, s=\r\nmall sub-field: our\n&gt; goal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is to be one of the reference pages (and e=\r\nven this is hard!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only way I can envision a successful ge=\r\nneral website is if it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mandatory to publish a paper. For instance,=\r\n GECCO could require the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; submision on a specific website of the sourc=\r\ne code of every accepted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, many journals=\r\n in biology now require that the authors of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted papers put their=\r\n data (and potentially their source code) on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dryad repository (=\r\nhttp://datadryad.org/). I hope the evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computation field wil=\r\nl be able to do the same!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [Dryad could be used by the EC commun=\r\nity but it does not accept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; GPL-licensed source code -- only creative =\r\ncommons --, whereas I think\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many EC frameworks are distributed=\r\n with a GPL-like license]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- JBM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http=\r\n://people.isir.upmc.fr/mouret/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
