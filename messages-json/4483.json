JNEAT is based on my original NEAT\nC++ =\r\ncode, and I believe the variable names are mainly equivalent.  If\nyou are c=\r\nollecting stats or looking for the overall champ, then\n&quot;orig_fitness&quot; is pr=\r\nobably what you care about.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;matthias.=\r\nlinhardt&quot; &lt;faulerlennert@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t want=\r\n to start a new topic, so I post in this existing \n&gt; thread. Here it comes:=\r\n\n&gt; First of all, I&#39;m using the Java version of NEAT (JNEAT), maybe the \n&gt; f=\r\nitness variables are named differently in the C+ NEAT, but I think \n&gt; you w=\r\nill all understand my question. It&#39;s about the difference \n&gt; between the tw=\r\no variables &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;orig_fitness&quot;. \n&gt; The way I understand this is t=\r\nhe following:\n&gt; 1a. orig_fitness is the organism&#39;s real fitness value, whic=\r\nh is \n&gt; determined only once, when the organism is created and evaluated.\n&gt;=\r\n 1b. orig_fitness never changes.\n&gt; 2a. fitness, on the other hand, is subje=\r\nct of later adjustments. Two \n&gt; processes can change the value of fitness: =\r\n\n&gt; 2b. First, fitness is divided among the subjects of the same species, \n&gt;=\r\n meaning the more organisms in one species, the lower the fitness.\n&gt; 2c. Se=\r\ncond, age_significance allows nishing by raising the fitness of \n&gt; young or=\r\nganisms.\n&gt; 3. When deciding which organism is better than another, orig_fit=\r\nness \n&gt; is the only logic choice. Fitness is only a internal value for NEAT=\r\n \n&gt; and not important for me, who wants only the one and only best \n&gt; organ=\r\nism at the end.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone could help me out and tell me if all of the=\r\n above \n&gt; assumptions are correct (or in case they are not explain to me ho=\r\nw it \n&gt; is) I would be very happy. \n&gt; Thanks a lot!\n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; =\r\nMatthias\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
