There currently exists a problem in the genome \n&gt; &gt;&gt;crossover code that allows multiple connections to accrue \nbetween \n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Why not just check during crossover whether any connection you \nare \n&gt; &gt;adding to the offspring genome is already there under a different \n&gt; &gt;number?  Crossover code has almost no effect on overall \nperformance \n&gt; &gt;regardless of how much you optimize it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I take the point about performance of the NEAT code. I tried \nmeasuring \n&gt; the my gene comparison/compatibility code a while agoand it was \nnot \n&gt; measurable for a single generation (less then 1ms).\n&gt; \n&gt; I was trying to kill two birds with one stone, by keeping \ninnovations \n&gt; matched throughout a population A) I think this is a better \napproach \n&gt; then just keeping track of new innovations and B) It solves the \nproblem \n&gt; with crossover. But since it&#39;s not going to work with distributed \nNEAT \n&gt; and also if say you load a seed population that already has \nmatching \n&gt; connections. I think I will have to do as you say - and maybe try \nand \n&gt; maintain innovation numbers across the population as well if I can.\n&gt; \n\nSomeone once pointed out to me that it would be possible to run NEAT \nwithout any global control at all by assigning random innovation \nnumbers.  The chances two genes would actually get the same number \nby accident would be so low it wouldn&#39;t matter.  Of course then you \nwould lose the nice ordering of genes and knowing which came first.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
