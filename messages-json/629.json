Do I\n&gt; have to specify integer \n&gt; coordinates that correspond to pixels?  Or can I\n&gt; just put real numbers in \n&gt; for coordinates and specify a viewport that\n&gt; encompasses the whole thing?\n\nThere are no pixels in SVG...its a vector graphic\nformat.  Otherwise, I&#39;m not sure I understand your\nquestions.\n\nBasically, though, if you&#39;re interested in using SVG\nas a graphical layout tool (and even though I&#39;m an\nadvocate of its use for dynamic graphical generation\nand cross-platform utility, it is by no means the best\nor only way to graphically represent data), then you\ndon&#39;t want to be coding it by hand.\n\nThe power of SVG comes from leveraging data stored in\nXML format.\n\nYou have part of a document stored like this:\n\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;16&quot; type=&quot;in&quot; hint-layer=&quot;2&quot;\nhint-position=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;\n\nThen you use an XSL style sheet, which might have a\ncode like this:\n\n&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;neuron&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;neuron_position&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;position()&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;/xsl:variable&gt;\n   &lt;circle cx=&quot;{75*$layer_number}&quot;\ncy=&quot;{50*$neuron_position}&quot; r=&quot;10&quot; fill=&quot;blue&quot;\nstroke=&quot;black&quot; stroke-width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;\n\nWhich then generates the viewable SVG file.\n\nI got the idea from the Adobe SVG Demo site.  This\ndemo showed molecular diagrams generated from CML\n(Chemical Markup Language), an XML standard for\nchemists:\n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/svg/demos/devtrack/chemical.html\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in learning how to use SVG, you\nprobably want to start by deciding upon a good XML\nformat for the data you want to represent and\ngraphically display.  The Adobe website is a good\nplace to start, and there are also plenty of good\nreferences on the net.  I&#39;m happy to answer any\nquestions as well.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
