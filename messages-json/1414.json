Sloppy C++ \n&gt;will run slower than well written C#. Also consider the neural network \n&gt;code optimizations I worked on recently, the code was clear, well \n&gt;written and (I thought) nice tight optimal code - which it was. But I \n&gt;was able to achieve an 8x speed increase by considering Ian Badcoes \n&gt;suggestions about CPU caches and re-ordering the sequence of execution.\n&gt;\nerr, it just occurred to me that this might be interpreted as a slur on \nWindowsNEAT (or other NEAT implementations), which of course it was not! \nIt&#39;s a general observation mostly derived from observations in the \ncommercial world where quality, clarity, maintainability, etc are not \nalways the main goals, often resulting in &#39;rats nest&#39; type code that is \ncompletely unfathomable!\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
