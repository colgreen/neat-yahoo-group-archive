It&#39;s=\r\n a nice idea.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterbe=\r\nrrington@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the informative response Ken. Actually,=\r\n someone sent me a\n&gt; link to this website earlier and I found it surprising=\r\nly relevant:\n&gt; http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/\n&gt; It&#39;s Tyler Streeter=\r\n&#39;s page, I believe he posts here as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the projects page, there =\r\nis a picture of a blue face which leads to\n&gt; the Somatopic Map project page=\r\n. It looks like there is actually a lot\n&gt; of exploiting geometry going on i=\r\nn our own motor systems and the\n&gt; method Tyler has devised for unwrapping a=\r\n 3d model into a 2d map while\n&gt; preserving its topology sounds like it woul=\r\nd make the perfect\n&gt; candidate for hyperneat. Although it might not be appl=\r\nicable for\n&gt; joints with &gt;1 degrees of freedom, my current ragdoll rig skir=\r\nts that\n&gt; issue by only using hinge joints, places at opposing angles/offse=\r\nts in\n&gt; order to emulate the ball-socket joints we have in our arms/legs. \n=\r\n&gt; It would obviously make more sense if there was a touch sensor like\n&gt; ski=\r\nn on this model and that was incorporated into the dynamics, but it\n&gt; still=\r\n sounds like it could work if you just mark the physical\n&gt; locations of inp=\r\nuts on the unwrapped map.\n&gt; Perhaps you could unwrap a virtual creature of =\r\nany shape using that\n&gt; method, and mark the location of inputs which have a=\r\n physical location\n&gt; on the surface of the creature. That would allow a ver=\r\ny flexible way\n&gt; of approaching this task for almost any creature morpholog=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, how to represent the geometry of a rag doll in the substrat=\r\ne is\n&gt; &gt; an open question right now with a lot of possible answers.  The\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; easiest part of the answer is probably just that the inputs and\n&gt; &gt; outpu=\r\nts should be in a configuration that is projected from the shape\n&gt; &gt; of the=\r\n body, and both inputs and outputs should have correlated\n&gt; geometry.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; However, the little questions are the hard ones, like what to do when\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; there are multiple degrees of freedom at the same location (such as a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; hip).  It seems erroneous to simply squeeze such different directions\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n arbitrarily into the same area. Perhaps more useful would be to have\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nultiple input and output layers, each with a map of the joints of the\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nody that rotate along a certain axis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The multiple layers could be=\r\n joined together on a 3rd dimension, or\n&gt; &gt; effectively completely separate=\r\nd by making them separate inputs or\n&gt; &gt; outputs (i.e. by having multiple se=\r\nts of inputs or outputs).  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To simplify the problem, you might sta=\r\nrt out for practice with a robot\n&gt; &gt; that only has a single degree of freed=\r\nom at each joint.  That way, you\n&gt; &gt; could just have a single input map and=\r\n a single output map without any\n&gt; &gt; difficult conceptual issues.  If it wo=\r\nrks out well, you could expand\n&gt; &gt; from there to more complex representatio=\r\nns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like I said, this research area is an experiment in progress, =\r\nbut I do\n&gt; &gt; believe we will eventually have some standard practices for ho=\r\nw to\n&gt; &gt; project a body onto a substrate.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n anything you find out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words,=\r\n how do you configure a substrate for hyperneat for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list of inputs =\r\nthat correspond to joint angles and velocities and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list of outputs =\r\nthat correspond to the desired joint state (i.e.\nhold,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relax, extend,=\r\n or contract)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vinod K. Valsalam wrote an excellent paper on m=\r\naking modular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subnetworks in order to take advantage of a symmetrical=\r\n\nconfiguration\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of legs, as in a quadruped trot, bound, pace or &quot;pronk=\r\n&quot;. This sounds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like a good idea, but in the case of a biped or humano=\r\nid\ncreature (for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, the ragdoll rig I&#39;m currently working on ha=\r\ns 20 1-dof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints), I&#39;m not sure I want to limit myself from explorin=\r\ng behavior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that isn&#39;t strictly modular with respect to the limb. Symm=\r\netry\nis only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bilateral in a humanoid, you won&#39;t achieve as dramatic a=\r\n\nreduction in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search space as you do with 4 or more symmetrical limbs=\r\n by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compartmentalizing it that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So the question is, =\r\nhow do I lay out my ragdoll model in the\nsubstrate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if I want to take =\r\nadvantage of the geometric relationship\nbetween the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints in the bod=\r\ny?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
