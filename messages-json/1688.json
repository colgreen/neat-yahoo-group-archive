Do you see nice smooth curves where a small change in a \nparameter means a small change in the # of needed generations, or do you \nget some big jumps?  Also, do any of the curves have multiple extrema? \nI did a series a while back with varying the mutation rate and noticed \ntwo local maxima, although with a single run needing a day or so, I lost \npatience with it quickly once a clearly-best rate emerged.\n\nSounds like interesting stuff.\n\nBrian\n\nColin Green wrote:\n&gt; Mitchell Timin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;Choosing a good set of parameter is a problem for me\n&gt;  &gt;also.  I would be interested in the details of your\n&gt;  &gt;method.  Have you posted any information about that?\n&gt;  &gt;I don&#39;t remember seeing it.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; Hi Mitchell,\n&gt; \n&gt; I started out wanting to search for optimal connection weight mutate\n&gt; schemes, and I did post an explanation of how I was going to do that a\n&gt; not long ago. In the end though I decided to expand the idea to search\n&gt; for all parameters, e.g. initial population size, initial connection\n&gt; proportion, selection proportion, mutation rates, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea is a simple one, create a population of parameters and for each\n&gt; one run the NEAT algorithm and average out the performance of each run.\n&gt; This gives a fitness that I then use to select the children of the next\n&gt; generation of parameters. I also wrapped up the parameters in a seperate\n&gt; class that incorporates mutation functions - crossover I haven&#39;t yet\n&gt; implemented.\n&gt; \n&gt; The result is an evolution algorithm that sits on top of NEATs evolution\n&gt; algorithm and takes a heck of a long time to run, since each individual\n&gt; evaluation is a NEAT run.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re interested in more details then let me know and I&#39;ll try and\n&gt; put something together on the SharpNEAT web site.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n\n\n-- \nBrian Dexter Allen\nhttp://www.luminousbeings.com/\n\n"}}
