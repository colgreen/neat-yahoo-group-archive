Selection will have different effects in different \ndomains.  Therefore, it is possible in one domain that those that do \nbetter tend to be simpler because of some property of the fitness \nfunction (i.e. the domain) and therefore the complexity will go \ndown, whereas in a more difficult domain only more complex \nindividuals are able to improve fitness and therefore complexity \nwill go up.  In other words, the direction that complexity moves is \nnot completely determined by the parameters or rates of adding \nstructure.\n\nThat said, to me most of what Colin is saying makes sense.  His \nexplanation of why fitness would drop makes sense too.  Of course, \nit depends on what you do if the top species is stagnating.  In my \nNEAT implementation, I decided that if the best species is \nstagnating that instead of deleting it I would delete all except the \ntop 2 species so I could &quot;zoom in&quot; and focus on them, but what Colin \nis doing is removing the top species if it hasn&#39;t improved for some \ntime, which is certainly valid, and would result in a drop in \nfitness if all the other species are stagnant as well.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Thu, 19 Aug 2004 22:05:44 +0100, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yes the parameters are all correct and I agree that it seems \ncounter\n&gt; &gt; intuitive. Actually I think you answered this question yourself \nin your\n&gt; &gt; response to John -  crossover. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, this still doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  How are you handling\n&gt; crossover?  ANJI works as the original NEAT paper described--when \ntwo\n&gt; individuals mate, the topology of the fitter individual is used, \nwhile\n&gt; weight values for common connections have a 50/50 chance of coming\n&gt; from either parent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if you&#39;re handling it another way, it still doesn&#39;t seem to \nmake\n&gt; sense.  Our mutation rates for blended runs for Tic-Tac-Toe were :\n&gt; \n&gt; add neuron: 0.005\n&gt; add connection: 0.01\n&gt; remove connection: 0.02\n&gt; \n&gt; They were roughly balanced, and as a consquence, the average\n&gt; complexity for most runs remained steady.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your subtractive mutation rates were triple your additive ones, so\n&gt; average complexity should be decreasing each generation.  Does your\n&gt; method of crossover always take the topology of the more complex\n&gt; individual or something?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I truly beleive that this is down to species culling, and the \nphased\n&gt; &gt; search graph backs up the idea. SharpNEAT employs elitism at the \nspecies\n&gt; &gt; level, that is, each species&#39; keeps at least it&#39;s 1 best genome \nand in\n&gt; &gt; the experiments actually kept the best 20%,.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry...I still don&#39;t understand the explanation.  But if \nyou&#39;re\n&gt; using Ken&#39;s basic NEAT implementation and population fitness is\n&gt; steadily *decreasing* throughout the run, it certainly seems that\n&gt; something is wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken?  Have you looked at the fitness graphs on Colin&#39;s page?  Does\n&gt; this make sense to you?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have a look back in the archives, I think species culling was \ndiscussed\n&gt; &gt; some time ago when I poitned out that quite often a jump in \nfitness can\n&gt; &gt; be seen shortly after culling the fittest species. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, I remember the discussion and thought it made sense at the \ntime\n&gt; as a way of enhancing the performance of a run.  I don&#39;t see how it\n&gt; should be *degrading* the performance of traditional or blended \nNEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
