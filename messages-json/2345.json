It should=\r\n be \nable to find an appropriate level of network complexity (i.e. \ntopolog=\r\ny and # of hidden neurons) for your problem.  There are \nseveral ways you c=\r\nould use NEAT for this task:\n\n1.  Use NEAT for everything:  Evolve with NEA=\r\nT directly both weights \nand topology to best learn the training data.\n\n2. =\r\nCombine NEAT with backpropagation:  In this case, you evolve with \nNEAT, bu=\r\nt each network is evaluated by applying backpropagation on \nthe training se=\r\nt to see how good the results are.  Networks \nreproduce that work best with=\r\n backprop.  In this case, you would a \nsemi-optimal backprop topology.  I k=\r\nnow people who&#39;ve done similar \nthings with NEAT in the past.\n\nI hope this =\r\nhelps provide some insight.  If you feel uncertain about \nthe proper neural=\r\n network topology for a problem, NEAT is a viable \noption for addressing th=\r\nat concern.   Note however that NEAT has not \nbeen shown to be superior to =\r\nother methods in regular classification \ntasks.  It *may* be better in some=\r\n cases, but most experiments with \nNEAT have not focused on classification =\r\nfrom training data (rather, \nNEAT is usually used for control or sequential=\r\n decision-making), so \nwe do not have a substantial record to refer to in t=\r\nhis area.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sathya Krish&quot; \n&lt;sathya.kris=\r\nhnamurthy@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everybody\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish to know of experienc=\r\nes in using NEAT for static NN models. \nBy \n&gt; this I mean, I perform severa=\r\nl experiments using design of \n&gt; experiments. Using the results I build a n=\r\neural network model, \nmost \n&gt; of the times guessing what the appropriate si=\r\nze and parameters of \n&gt; the network should be. \n&gt; \n&gt; I do not build the mod=\r\nels incrementally, rather I build them as an \n&gt; one-time affair. The proble=\r\nms I face are the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the number of inputs (x) and the nu=\r\nmber of outputs (y) and \nthe \n&gt; size of the training set,I have trouble est=\r\nimating what is the \n&gt; appropriate parameters for building the network? (li=\r\nke learning \n&gt; rate, size of network, what kind of algorithm etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Do =\r\nthe experts feel that NEAT will be able to answer such queries \n&gt; for me ? =\r\nor can I use NEAT to build models without having to worry \n&gt; about the netw=\r\nork parameters? or Do I have it completely wrong \nabout \n&gt; NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns for your suggestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sathya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
