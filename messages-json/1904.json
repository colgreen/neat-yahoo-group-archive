Philip and I reimplemented NEAT in Java (ANJI\nis our implementation), and we learned quite a bit from this process. \nEven though Ken did a great job explaining his algorithm in his\ninitial paper, it is nearly impossible to cover every implementation\ndetail.  We had LOTS of questions for Ken, and he helped immensely.\n\nBut one of the more important things I think we got out of it is that\nmany of the implementation details are simply not crucial.  I think\nKen did a good job with the ablation experiments to verify the\nimportant aspects of NEAT, but we&#39;ve found that as along as it\nincludes the main components, some of the more detailed implementation\naspects don&#39;t really impact performance all that much.\n\nYou might want to go back and read some of the messages around #1205,\nwhere we indicate that with ANJI, we didn&#39;t implement stagnation\npenalties at all!  We still haven&#39;t done so.  We also don&#39;t cap the\nnumber of species in the population (I&#39;m not sure if the\nimplementation you&#39;re working on does this).  And there is quite a bit\nof turnover in the population, and older species dying off as they&#39;re\nreplaced by fitter ones.\n\nAnd we&#39;ve had very good success in all but the most difficult domains\nwe&#39;ve tried.\n\nAgain, if you&#39;re saying that the algorithm is working reasonably well,\nI wouldn&#39;t get hung up on trying to implement NEAT down to every last\ndetail.  It&#39;s a pretty robust algorithm, and as long as you&#39;ve got the\ncore, you&#39;ll probably do fine.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
