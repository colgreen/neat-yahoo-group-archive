But I think \n&gt; interactive evolution has a lot of potential in the future.\n\nAnd it&#39;s good fun. I used to have a web site were users could evolve\nonline, but that died and I lost most of the source.\n\nActually, GP is better suited for this kind of thing - NN produces nicer\nimages faster, but GP can do color way better. The reason GP can evolve\ncolor better is that it can evolve programs that work with quartenions -\nwhich in turn means that R G and B are tightly co-related. With NN I can\nuse three output nodes (R G and B or H S and V), but ultimately, the\noutput nodes are to un-related for the images to have any impact.\n\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m wondering, are your networks recurrent, in which case \n&gt; the order in which you present coordinates would matter in a kind of \n&gt; strange way?  \n\nI allow recurrent networks and I perform a few iterations for each pixel.\nBut I flush the network before each new pixel because otherwise the image\nbecomes chaotic.\n\n&gt; An idea your project brought to my mind was maybe a &quot;roving eye&quot;-\n&gt; like artist could be evolved: It could start out in the middle and \n&gt; just decide on its own which directions to draw in and how much ink \n&gt; to drop at each step.  You could feed it coordinates as well, but it \n&gt; would decide on the order it to visit them.  \n\nThat&#39;s an idea. Perhaps something for the roving eye people?\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
