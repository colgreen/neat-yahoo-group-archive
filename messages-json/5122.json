I am not an expert on it and did not study it extensively=\r\n, but I had trouble seeing a substantive insight that makes it work better =\r\nthan other such stochastic search technologies (like GAs).  It didn&#39;t seem =\r\nto address the problems of dimensionality, representation, or search space =\r\nin any new way.  There are some nice demos, especially of music, on their s=\r\nite, but I can&#39;t find any specifics on how exactly the music was represente=\r\nd, so I am not sure if the talent behind it was ultimately with the develop=\r\ner rather than the Creativity Machine itself.  All in all, I am not sure if=\r\n the Creativity Machine is really doing that much different from any other =\r\nstochastic search.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ker_31_toluca&quot; &lt;ker_=\r\n31_toluca@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; i recently found this:\n&gt; www.imagination-en=\r\ngines.com\n&gt; \n&gt; do you think HyperNEAT can evolve it&#39;s own type of Creativit=\r\ny Machine?
