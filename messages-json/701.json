Even this \n&gt; flailing body on the ground is alternating its legs, albeit in an \n&gt; unproductive way.  But how can that alternation be present at \n&gt; generation 0?  Obviously they somehow forced it that way.  I think \n&gt; it&#39;s pretty exciting because I doubt they have the same quality \n&gt; neuroevolution technology as NEAT, which suggests that the problem \n&gt; actually isn&#39;t that hard given the right constraints, which implies \n&gt; Tyler could possibly evolve even more sophisticated behaviors than \n&gt; these guys have.  \n\nOne method I&#39;ve looked at a method that was extremely simple, yet \nproduced some astonishing results. ( \nhttp://www.ventrella.com/GenePool/gene_pool.html ). It uses a far \nsimpler body model that what we&#39;re looking at here, but the method goes \nsomething like this; the entire body has a central sine wave, each body \npart decides what motor action to take from that one sine wave. The body \nparts evolve a wave offset, an amplitude and a base angle. So the angle \nof the joint of a body part is;\n\nang = BaseAngle + Amplidute * sin(BaseWaveAngle + AngleOffset)\n\nNow NEAT far more capable than this, but that also means that evolution \ntakes longer. One idea to take away from this might be to supply a base \nwave for the body, but have it offset by 180 degrees from the right side \nto the left side of the body. Use the wave as an input for the nets.\n\nalso, only evolve behaviour for one side of the body and then use a \nmirror of that for the other side of the body. forced symmetry.\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n\n"}}
