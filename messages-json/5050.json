It suggests that lung cells know to become\nlung cells based on the air passing back and forth over them. It is\nintriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows that sometimes\nnature does not use geometric position (provided by complex protein\npatterning) to make differentiation decisions, but uses environmental cues.\nOf course, HyperNEAT could create the same end product just with positional\ninformation, but it might be easier to accomplish this with simple\nenvironmental-based tricks like this one. Thoughts?\n\nNew Scientist\nBreath of fresh air transforms stem cells\n\n14:32 09 November 2009 by Andy Coghlan\nFor similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\nMimicking the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough to\ntransform stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physical&quot;\ntechniques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth factors\nalone aren&#39;t enough.\n\nLindsey Van Haute of the Free University of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium and\ncolleagues spread human embryonic stem cells onto a porous membrane. The\ncells were fed from beneath by nutrients and from above by a fluid that\nencouraged them to multiply. Removing two chemicals from the growth fluid\nkickstarted differentiation.\n\nFour days later, the team removed the fluid covering the cells, leaving them\nopen to the air while still being sustained and supported from below, as\nthey would be in the trachea. After 24 days the cells had developed surface\nproteins that identified them as specific types of lung cell, including\nalveolar cells, which allow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\nbacteria and dirt.\n\nPhysical influence\n\n&quot;Our study proves differentiation into lung cells is influenced by physical\nforces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have been made to\ndifferentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different growth factors,\nbut Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n\n&quot;Physical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung lining to be\nfully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London, who has made\nalveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth factors alone. &quot;But I find\nit difficult to believe that raw stem cells would differentiate through to\nthese uncommon types of cells solely in response to physical forces.&quot;\n\nHaute&#39;s team plans to use the cells they created to study lung diseases,\nsuch as cystic fibrosis. Such cells might one day be used to treat people\nwith damaged lung tissue, but only if the cells can be made from a person&#39;s\nown tissue. This could be done by converting the cells first into induced\npluripotent stem cells.\n\nJournal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI: 10.1186/1465-9921-10-105\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
