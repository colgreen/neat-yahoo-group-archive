It may just be\nthat\n&gt; the network needs a bias (i.e. an input with a constant value) in\n&gt; order to solve XOR.\n\nNo I haven&#39;t but it&#39;s a good idea, thank you. As for biases thay are\ndefined in run-time. &quot;Hang&quot; neurons (that don&#39;t have inputs) can\nappear but as log-sigmoid activation function is used then their\noutput is not zero and constant. Although solutions without biases\nare also possible.\n\n&gt;  Also, did it work without x3, with only 2 inputs?\n\nYes it worked without x3.\n\n\n"}}
