I remember now that this is why I \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;suggested \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;pruning only after a period of stagnation... the theory being that \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;you just \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;leave the neutral structure and continue searching in the higher \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;space while it \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;is still working. If you then reach a point of stagnation *then* \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;prune your way \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;back to the lower search space - which could be quite a bit lower \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;for the first \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;prune.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Of course if you did this and still stagnated then you wouldn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;want to trigger \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;off another prune phase, there would be no point. So perhaps if we \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;set a flag \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;that tells us that pruning is an option, and which gets set to \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;true whenever an \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;improvement is found. So when stagnation does occur we check the \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;flag first \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;before deciding to prune.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s an interesting idea:  Do your pruning idea on a per-species \n&gt;basis instead of on the whole population.  In other words, see if a \n&gt;species has improved, and then if the species is stagnant, set a \n&gt;flag inside the species saying mutations for the while should be \n&gt;pruning mutations.  That way, different species can be in different \n&gt;phases out of phase with each other.\n&gt;\nOK yes, I think I will try this. Of course I will have fot it in with \nthe current strategy of lowering a species&#39; fitness afetr a period of no \nimprovements - which amounts to culling stagnant species. I think this \nculling is important because it ultimately allows us to give up on a \nspecies and allocate search time to the remaining species. So I will \ntrack # of generations since last improvement, when it reaches some \nthreshold, if the &#39;ok to prune&#39; flag is set then enter a prune phase, \notherwise cull the species.\n\nSo during the pruning phase we should track, say, the average number of \nconnection and neuron genes in the species. If this does not drop for \nsome fixed number of generations (say 3 or 4) then the pruning phase is \nover, we set the pruning flag to false ( so that it wont happen again). \nAnd now if we reach the stagnation threshold again, then the species \ngets culled.\n\nWhat I would like to do then is try this out on a new problem domain, \none that is fast to simulate but difficult enough to pose a challenge to \nNEAT as it stands. Any suggestions? Perhaps the tic-tac-toe domain would \nbe good, because the limited number of game moves means the simulations \nwon&#39;t take up too much CPU time as the search progresses.  Another \npossibilty that I think I mentioned before is character recognition. \nIdeally a &#39;sexy&#39; domain would be good too for PR purposes :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
