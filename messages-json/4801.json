The best\ncontroller is the one that manages to take Mario jumping, shooting and\nrunning through as many levels as possible. This is a challenging\nproblem, and we expect that learning and optimization algorithms (such\nas evolutionary computation and TD-learning) will be useful in\ncreating a winning controller. But we welcome controllers of any type,\nincluding completely hand-coded controllers, as long as they can\ninterface to the Java software provided with the competition.\n\nThe competition is being run in two phases, each in association with\nan IEEE conference: the Games and Innovation Conference (and ICE-GIC)\nand the Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG).\nSessions will be held at both conferences presenting the results of\nthe competition phase, where authors of winning controllers will be\ninvited to present their contributions.\n\nCash prizes will also be awarded to the authors of the best\ncontrollers submitted in time for each conference. At ICE-GIC, the\nthree best controllers will be awarded USD 200, 100 and 50\nrespectively; at CIG, the winner will be awarded USD 500. (The prize\nmoney will be awarded to the best contributor that has registered at\nand attends the conference; however, it is possible to win the\ncompetition phase and receive a certificate for this without attending\nthe conference.)\n\nThe deadline for submitting a controller to the ICE-GIC phase of the\ncompetition is August 18, and the deadline for the CIG phase is\nSeptember 3. It is possible to enter each phase of the competition\nseparately, but controllers entered to the ICE-GIC phase will by\ndefault also be entered into the CIG phase; competitors will have the\nopportunity to update their submissions after the results of the first\nphase are announced. At the end of the full competition, source code\nof all controllers will be published on the competition website.\n\nFour source code, sample controllers and further instructions see:\nhttp://julian.togelius.com/mariocompetition2009\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7\n2300 Copenhagen  S\nDenmark\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
