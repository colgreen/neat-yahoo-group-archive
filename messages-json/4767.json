I have been traveling a lot=\r\n lately.\n\nFor a long time I thought I was using a larger set of activation =\r\nfunctions\nin HyperNEAT, and wrote that up in some of my publications, but I=\r\n discovered\nrecently that there is an obscure line of code in an unrelated =\r\nsection of\nthe code base that actually reduced my function set to the follo=\r\nwing:\n\nSigmoid\nGaussian\nLinear\nSine\n\nSo, those are what I have been using i=\r\nn all of my papers. I will update the\nonline versions of these papers on my=\r\n website to reflect this fact. Sorry\nfor any confusion. \n\nAs for other pape=\r\nrs,\n\nI believe that Jason&#39;s papers used the following:\n\n    =80    sigmoid\n=\r\n    =80    Gaussian\n    =80    sine\n    =80    linear \n\nAnd David&#39;s papers =\r\nused these:\n    =80    sigmoid\n    =80    Gaussian\n    =80    sine\n    =80 =\r\n   absolute value\n\nHowever, I also think that Jason once told me that Dave =\r\nonly uses nodes with\npositive outputs, so his absolute value might actually=\r\n reduce to a linear.\nIs that right David?\n\nI think it would be interesting =\r\nto see comparisons of HyperNEAT with\ndifferent activation functions. As Ken=\r\n said, this area remains mostly\nunexplored.  Please let us know if you do a=\r\nny tests.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Unive=\r\nrsity\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 30 =\r\nJun 2009 23:07:59 +0100\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [neat] HyperNEAT Activation Functions\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wo=\r\nndering what are currently considered to be the standard set of\n&gt; CPPN acti=\r\nvation functions.
