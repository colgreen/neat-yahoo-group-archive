Im really interested to know\nmore abo=\r\nut the coevolution setup K. Stanley used in the paper\n&quot;competitive coevolut=\r\nion through evolutionary complexification&quot;.\n\nIt was mentioned that a host p=\r\nopulation is evolved against an evolving\nparasite population. 4 best specie=\r\n champions and 8 samples from the\nHoF are selected to be opponents for each=\r\n individual in the host\npopulation.\nNow, what i find unclear is when did u =\r\nget the specie individuals&#39;\nfitness. \n\nIs it A?\ngen 1: all host fight again=\r\nst all parasite \ngen 2: all host fight against 4 champ from prev gen & 8 Ho=\r\nF\ngen 3: repeat gen 1\ngen 4: repeat gen 2\n..repeat pattern\n\nHowever, too co=\r\nmputationaly expensive\n\nIs it B?\ngeneration 1: for each specie in parasite =\r\npopulation, compete each\nindividual against one another, in order to calcul=\r\nate fitness. Then\nfor each host, fight against 4 champ & 8 HoF.\ngen 2: repe=\r\nat gen 1\n.. repeat pattern\n\nor i&#39;m both wrong :D\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nBtw, what if there is only 1 organism in =\r\na specie? That means it is\nthe fittest in that niche, so who does it mate w=\r\nith? Single forever?\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
