Some other thoughts:\n\n - Are you sure the arm jointt force is strong enough (relative to the\ngravity) to move the arm. Did you drop a decimal place somewhere.\n - I don&#39;t think you need to scale to degrees and then back to [-1,1].\nThat is just the same as scaling directly from radians to [-1,1],\nunless I&#39;ve misunderstood. Also the input scale doesn&#39;t have to match\nthe scaling applied to the outputs, you can pick completely different\nscalings and units for the outputs, it makes no difference because the\nweights in the neural net will evolve to whatevever scalings you use.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
