There\nare man=\r\ny considerations, and although I may not hit all of them, I\nthink in genera=\r\nl it can be refuted:\n\nGenerally, I think HyperNEAT (i.e. NEAT with CPPNs) a=\r\nlready\napproximately follow the scenario that you outline:  It discovers ke=\r\ny\nmotifs (whether they be skin or something else) early in evolution and\nth=\r\nen as the overall body plan is deformed, the original motifs are\noften pres=\r\nerved (which again includes skin).  The main idea is that\nskin is like a ki=\r\nnd of surrounding motif for the overall shape, and if\nthe pverall shape is =\r\nwarped through some kind of mutation in the\ninternal CPPN, then however the=\r\n shape is surrounded will naturally\nwarp in the same way.\n\nIn fact, you can=\r\n see this happen consistently in Picbreeder.  It is\npossible to consider th=\r\ne simple black outline of many of the color\nfigures as a &quot;skin.&quot;  You can n=\r\notice that it is special by noting that\noften the outer band is black but e=\r\nverything structure inside is\ncolor.  Then, if the shape of the overall ima=\r\nge warps, so does the\nouter membrane.\n\nHowever, you might say that such a &quot;=\r\nskin&quot; is not complex enough to be\nconvincing.  Perhaps skin should have mul=\r\ntiple parts, i.e. its own\nspecial structure.  In fact, if you look closely,=\r\n you can find many\nsuch examples.  For example, there are often double-laye=\r\nr outer\nmembranes that form, such as in this image:\n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/=\r\nsearch/showgenome.php?sid=3D317\n\nThere is a clear outer structure that surr=\r\nounds the complex curvature\nof the object.\n\nOr, perhaps more interestingly,=\r\n you can get several layers of color\nbands, but only on the outer membrane,=\r\n such as in this image that ends\nin a light blue that becomes green, then b=\r\necomes yellow, before\nsinking into the inner-body color of orange:\n\nhttp://=\r\npicbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4227\n\nTo show that the outer mem=\r\nbrane warps easily and naturally regardless\nof shape changes (even complex =\r\nones), I further evolved that image to\nget a new shape, and you can see tha=\r\nt the outer membrane has the same\nmotif nevertheless, nicely warped to acco=\r\nmmodate the new overall shape:\n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php=\r\n?sid=3D5635\n\nIt is also important to note that outer membranes in nature ar=\r\ne not\nuniform covers and often transition into something else on the\nsurfac=\r\ne.  For example, consider lips and eyes.  Or perhaps even more\nimportantly,=\r\n consider fingernails, where the outer cover actually\nfalls *under* somethi=\r\nng else (i.e. the nail), violating the covering\nrule.  I point these except=\r\nions out because in Picbreeder you also\noften see almost consistent outer m=\r\notifs that are broken in a couple\nplaces.  While these locations often are =\r\narbitrary, the point is that\nsuch a capability could be exploited if it act=\r\nually mattered.\n\nMoving from 2-D to 3-D should not matter in the case of sk=\r\nin, just as\nmoving CPPNs from 2-D to 4-D continues to allow all the same\nre=\r\ngularities.  So when you see examples in 2-D, they are also possible\nin 3-D=\r\n for the same reasons.\n\nMost of these outer skin motifs can arise early whe=\r\nn the shape is\nsimple and are then easily preserved.  However, they are not=\r\n always\npreserved.  For example, the multicolor skin above evolved into a\nd=\r\nifferent multicolor skin in one lineage:\n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/show=\r\ngenome.php?sid=3D4228\n\nThis phenomenon is expected from the analogy with na=\r\nture, just as\nscales can evolve into fur, or fur into uncovered skin, all s=\r\ntill\nserving the role of outer membrane.\n\nI think it&#39;s important to note th=\r\nat skin or an outer membrane is not\nreally any different from any other CPP=\r\nN-generated motif, in that it\ncan be preserved, warped, or changed in its i=\r\nnternal structure.  So I\ndon&#39;t think there is really anything special going=\r\n on in the argument\ncompared to the discovery of symmetry or other conventi=\r\nons.\n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken has challenged us all many times to think about whethe=\r\nr there is any\n&gt; need for a process of development. The identity of cells i=\r\nn\ndevelopmental\n&gt; processes is determined by local contextual information w=\r\nhereas Ken\n&gt; advocates skipping that by letting cells determine their ident=\r\nity\nvia giving\n&gt; them their objective coordinates. The question is whether =\r\nwe lose\nanything\n&gt; important to the evolution of complexity by skipping thi=\r\ns step.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it is a fascinating question and, unable to come up wi=\r\nth a good\n&gt; reason why development matters myself, but wanting to give the\n=\r\nargument a\n&gt; rigorous evaluation, I have been asking many people in our fie=\r\nld whether\n&gt; they can describe something unique that a developmental proces=\r\ns\nprovides. No\n&gt; one has come up with  a reason that compels me, so I have =\r\nbecome a\nstrong\n&gt; advocate of the lack of a need for an unfolding process.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in the course of watching a keynote on development in natural=\r\n\n&gt; systems at this year&#39;s gecco, an argument in favor of development\noccurr=\r\ned\n&gt; to me that may have merit. I am interested to hear what y&#39;all think\nof=\r\n it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The argument is this: it might be easier to evolve certain large-=\r\nscale\n&gt; properties when the organism is simple and small and then scale/gro=\r\nw\nthem\n&gt; up, rather than incorporating them into an already complex phenoty=\r\npe. I\n&gt; think an example illustrates the point best. Imagine evolution\nfigu=\r\nring out\n&gt; how to put a coat of skin on an organism. It is not that hard to=\r\n\nfigure out\n&gt; what the shape of that skin should be when the embryo has onl=\r\ny a few\ncells.\n&gt; Once that simple and small coat of skin has formed, it can=\r\n follow\nthe simple\n&gt; rule of keeping the layer of skin the same thickness, =\r\nand adding cells\n&gt; within that layer to grow to cover any arbitrary shape t=\r\nhat the\nphenotype\n&gt; becomes. This simple rule could produce a skin shell fo=\r\nr a bat or a\njaguar.\n&gt; Now consider how hard it would be for 3D hyperneat t=\r\no create a skin\nshell\n&gt; for a bat or a jaguar. The mathematical function to=\r\n create such\noutlines is\n&gt; very complex (although it is less so if it is a =\r\ncomposition of other,\n&gt; already created functions that produced the rest of=\r\n the body). Still, it\n&gt; seems that this task might be harder for hyperneat =\r\nthan following\nthe simple\n&gt; developmental rules outlined above.\n&gt; \n&gt; What d=\r\no you think? I would happily be convinced that this argument is\n&gt; without m=\r\nerit, so please let me know if you see any problems with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers=\r\n,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; j=\r\nclune@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
