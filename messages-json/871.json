Iterate until output stabilizes or N iterations \nhave been performed. (N=10 or 100) \n\n2. Same as 1 but if it doesn&#39;t stabilize by N \niterations set output to the maximally wrong value.\n\nFor the XOR problem if I use the first method the best\n\nnetwork tends to have this structure:\n\n0       1        2\n&#92;       |       /\n &#92;      |      /\n  &#92;     |     /\n   &#92;    |    /\n    &#92;   |   /\n     &#92;  |  /\n      &#92; | /\n       &#92;|/\n        3--&#92;\n\t|  |\n\t&#92;--/\n\n(ie bias + inputs directly connected to output + \nrecurrent connection from output to output)\n\nThis is only &quot;correct&quot; by the accident of choosing N \n(I think)\n\nThe problem with option 2 is for some domains it is \nhard or impossible to define &quot;maximally wrong&quot;\n\nAnyone care to discuss their thoughts or how they \nhandle it. (I&#39;m still reading code to figure out what \nother implementations do)\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo!
