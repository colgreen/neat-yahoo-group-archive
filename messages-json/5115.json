We hope to have a publication with =\r\nformal results based on those experiments soon.  In general though, we do f=\r\neel that this approach is superior to the one discussed in the previous mul=\r\ntiagent HyperNEAT paper and would recommend anyone who wants to work with m=\r\nultiagent HyperNEAT to use the z-based substrate.\n\nI&#39;ll respond in detail t=\r\no the remaining points.\n\n4.  Way back when I first converted SharpNEAT to H=\r\nyperSharpNEAT I tried a number of values and found that there wasn&#39;t a larg=\r\ne difference between them, although 20% seemed to be slightly better.  For =\r\nany new domains I&#39;ll try a few values to see if they make any difference, b=\r\nut I haven&#39;t found any where the elitism value made a significant differenc=\r\ne.\n\nI will say that I&#39;ve never tried just saving the best organism.  One re=\r\nason is that the SharpNEAT speciation code isn&#39;t really designed to only sa=\r\nve one genome.  The other is that I think saving at least the best genomes =\r\nin your best species would help prevent promising species from accidentally=\r\n dying off too early.  On the other hand, I know you have several successfu=\r\nl HyperNEAT experiments, so I guess I&#39;ll turn the question back on you: Hav=\r\ne you found saving just the best genome to generally be better than saving =\r\nmore?  I&#39;m certainly willing to give it a try if you&#39;ve seen much better re=\r\nsults.\n\n5.  The answer to whether we renormalize the sheets or insert the n=\r\new sheets between the old is technically both.  In general we renormalize, =\r\nthat is however many agents there are, they are evenly spaced between -1 an=\r\nd 1.  While it may seem like a good idea to leave the original sheets where=\r\n they were and insert the new ones among them, in most cases it is difficul=\r\nt to determine where the new sheets should go.\n\nFor example, if there were =\r\n5 agents located at z=3D{-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1} and the team needed to be sca=\r\nled to 7 agents, where should the two new agents go?  There are two agents,=\r\n but four spaces (-0.75, -0.25, 0.25, 0.75) to put them and no real reason =\r\nto choose any of the spaces over the others.  By redistributing the agents =\r\nevenly we eliminate such ad hoc decisions.  However, if the 5 agent team we=\r\nre to be scaled up to 9 agents, they would be placed at z=3D{-1, -0.75, -0.=\r\n5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1}.  Thus, even though we&#39;re renormalizing, th=\r\ne placement works out the same as if we had inserted the new agents among t=\r\nhe old.\n\n6.  The sign function simply returns the sign of the node&#39;s activa=\r\ntion: -1 if the activation is negative, 0 if it is 0, and 1 if it is positi=\r\nve.  The reason for this function and the starting structure is to establis=\r\nh a team with mirror symmetry i.e. the ANN of the agent at z=3D 1 is the ho=\r\nrizontally flipped version of the agent at z=3D-1 and so on.  We found that=\r\n team mirror symmetry was beneficial in both domains that were tested in th=\r\nis paper, so it was logical to allow it to start with symmetry (which can b=\r\ne broken or ignored with mutations).\n\nI hope I&#39;ve answered your questions,\n=\r\nDavid\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Con=\r\ngrats on this paper. It features a lot of nice results.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few question=\r\ns/comments:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The issue of interpolation is extremely interesting. In=\r\n this paper you\n&gt; explicitly discuss how it would be beneficial to add new =\r\nagents, and have\n&gt; their roles be intermediate versions of other agents (e.=\r\ng., adding a 12th\n&gt; soccer player between the forwards and the midfielders =\r\nwould create a player\n&gt; that was a hybrid of the two roles). It would also =\r\nbe cool to see if teams\n&gt; can gracefully re-divide the strategy-space when =\r\nthey lose agents. For\n&gt; example, in soccer/futbol, after a few red cards ar=\r\ne assigned, each player\n&gt; does not play the usual role that they would play=\r\n on a team of 11, but\n&gt; instead re-divide the space up amongst the fewer pl=\r\nayers. For example, after\n&gt; the red cards their may be a left and right for=\r\nward instead of a left, right\n&gt; and center forward. It would be cool to see=\r\n if you can see such a result\n&gt; using your method. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2) You mention the=\r\n benefits of interpolated roles, but do you have any\n&gt; evidence that such i=\r\nnterpolation is occurring? One cool way to test this\n&gt; would be to compare =\r\ntwo different treatments: T1) take your original N\n&gt; agents and multiply th=\r\nem to achieve the desired scaled-up number of agents\n&gt; (e.g., 9, 25, 100, 1=\r\n000). If you start with 10 agents, and scale to 1000,\n&gt; you thus get 100 id=\r\nentical copies of agent 1, 100 identical copies of agent\n&gt; 2, etc. Compare =\r\nthe performance of this treatment to T2) interpolate 1000\n&gt; agents into the=\r\n z coordinate range, so you have 1000 slightly different\n&gt; agents. The diff=\r\nerence in performance between these treatments will help you\n&gt; figure out w=\r\nhether you are seeing a boost due to interpolation. If the\n&gt; performance in=\r\ncrease due to scaling is not different between T1 and T2, then\n&gt; you know y=\r\nour performance boost was simply due to having more agents, not\n&gt; due to in=\r\nterpolation (you note something similar when you say &quot;adding more\n&gt; agents =\r\nthat all do the same thing will eventually cause a pile-up&quot;...my\n&gt; suggesti=\r\non is a way to test this claim).\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Why do you feel this new technique=\r\n is better than your old technique? Is\n&gt; it possible to compare the two exp=\r\nerimentally? Have you done so?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) I notice you mention that you use 20=\r\n% elitism. I usually only save the\n&gt; best organism. Have you found 20% to w=\r\nork a lot better, generally?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) When you add new agents, do you leave =\r\nthe previous sheets in the same\n&gt; place, and interpolate new sheets between=\r\n them, or do you renormalize all of\n&gt; the sheets such that it may be the ca=\r\nse that no new agent is in the exact z\n&gt; coordinate of one of the original =\r\nagents? It might be interesting to try\n&gt; both and see which tends to work b=\r\netter.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) What is the &#39;sign&#39; function you mention in Figure 2? In gene=\r\nral, I am\n&gt; having trouble figuring out what this means: &quot;The starting stru=\r\ncture of the\n&gt; initial heterogeneous CPPN (Figure 2b) includes some additio=\r\nnal structure to\n&gt; start evolution with knowledge of mirrored team symmetry=\r\n; in particular, the\n&gt; sign function of z connected to multiplication opera=\r\ntors on the x-axis means\n&gt; that the CPPN knows which side of the team is wh=\r\nich and can opt to reflect\n&gt; one side across the midline.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Congrats ag=\r\nain on this nice work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evoluti=\r\non Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2010 02:59:22 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Multiagent Hyp=\r\nerNEAT Revisited\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Our 2008 GECCO paper by David D&#39;Ambrosio and myse=\r\nlf introduced the idea that a\n&gt; &gt; single HyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of=\r\n neural networks (instead of just\n&gt; &gt; one) that represent a pattern of poli=\r\ncies for an entire team.  Since then a\n&gt; &gt; few people have asked about the =\r\nway we laid out the team on the substrate and\n&gt; &gt; whether alternatives migh=\r\nt be better.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am happy to announce, with my co-authors David D&#39;Am=\r\nbrosio, Joel Lehman, and\n&gt; &gt; Sebastian Risi, that we have extensively teste=\r\nd such an alternative\n&gt; &gt; z-axis-based encoding and published the results t=\r\no appear in AAMAS 2010,\n&gt; &gt; available here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Direct Link: http://epl=\r\nex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We believe this z-based=\r\n substrate layout is superior to the previous one,\n&gt; &gt; particularly for sca=\r\nling the size of the team, and should open up the field of\n&gt; &gt; multiagent l=\r\nearning further to HyperNEAT.
