Try to experiment wit=\r\nh \neach and then see what is best for your system. \n\nPerhaps searching for =\r\nsome older threads where the same issue is \ndiscussed will help you. \n\nPete=\r\nr\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Carolina Feher da Silva&quot; \n&lt;mirrorballu2@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s been just a few months since I&#39;ve started studying NEAT =\r\nand I&#39;m\n&gt; sorry if my question is very basic or has already been asked a lo=\r\nt \nof\n&gt; times before (I&#39;ve searched the group archive). I&#39;ve been discussin=\r\ng\n&gt; this with my friend and we don&#39;t understand how innovation numbers \nare=\r\n\n&gt; assigned to mutations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose a mutation links node n to node m. I=\r\nf another mutation \nlinking\n&gt; these nodes occurs in the same generation, th=\r\ney are both assigned \nthe\n&gt; same innovation number, this part was clear. Bu=\r\nt what if a mutation\n&gt; linking the same nodes occurs 100 generations later?=\r\n Is it assigned\n&gt; the same innovation number or a different one?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve =\r\nread Stanley&#39;s original C++ code and it seems that the new\n&gt; mutation is as=\r\nsigned a new innovation number, which makes sense to \nme,\n&gt; because the two=\r\n genes are not homologous and tracking homology among\n&gt; genes is the whole =\r\npoint of innovation numbers, right? But looking \nat\n&gt; a Python and a Java i=\r\nmplementation, both have a global list of\n&gt; mutations and will assign the s=\r\name innovation number to a mutation\n&gt; linking the same nodes. In this case,=\r\n don&#39;t innovation numbers \nbecome\n&gt; useless? All we need to know to align g=\r\nenes for reproduction is \nwhich\n&gt; nodes are getting linked by a certain mut=\r\nation. Also we could be\n&gt; aligning genes that have completely different rol=\r\nes in completely\n&gt; different network architectures. It seems wrong to me.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; So does anyone know how this should be done and why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Car=\r\nolina\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
