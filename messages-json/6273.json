The benefit of this new approach is\nthat the initial seed can be evolved further to accelerate the\nself-organizing process and to bias it towards a specific target\nconfiguration. An interesting implication is that enabling HyperNEAT to\ncapture this key feature of natural systems might now allow us to evolve\narchitectures resembling deep learning networks, SOMs, or other\nself-organizing processes that also rely on unsupervised learning processes.\n\n*Abstract: *An important phenomenon seen in many areas of biological brains\nand recently in deep learning architectures is a process known as\nself-organization. For example, in the primary visual cortex, color and\norientation maps develop based on lateral inhibitory connectivity patterns\nand Hebbian learning dynamics. These topographic maps, which are found in\nall sensory systems, are thought to be a key factor in enabling abstract\ncognitive representations. This paper shows for the first time that the\nHypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) method\ncan be seeded to begin evolution  with such lateral connectivity, enabling\ngenuine self-organizing dynamics. The proposed approach draws on\nHyperNEAT&#39;s ability to generate a pattern of weights across the\nconnectivity of an artificial neural network (ANN) based on a function of\nits geometry. Validating this approach, the afferent weights of an ANN\nself-organize in this paper to form a genuine topographic map of the input\nspace for a simple line orientation task. Most interestingly, this seed can\nthen be evolved further, providing a method to guide the self-organization\nof weights in a specific way, much as evolution likely guided the\nself-organizing trajectories of biological brains.\n\nCheers,\nSebastian\n\n--\nDr. Sebastian Risi\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen, Room 5D08\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark\nemail: sebastian.risi@..., web: www.sebastianrisi.com\nmobile: +45-50250355, office: +45-7218-5127\n\r\n--001a113ab3ec15ff0604f817353b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kenneth Stanley and I are pleased to announce our new GECC=\r\nO paper (to appear), &quot;Guided Self-Organization in Indirectly Encoded a=\r\nnd Evolving Topographic Maps&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PDF: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://epl=\r\nex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco14.pdf&quot;&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_=\r\ngecco14.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;This paper introduces the idea that HyperNEAT can b=\r\ne seeded with a lateral inhibitory connectivity pattern, which then allows =\r\nthe weights from the inputs to the hidden layer=C2=A0of an ANN to self-orga=\r\nnize to form a genuine topographic map of the input=C2=A0space.
