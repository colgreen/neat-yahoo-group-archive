I&#39;m using Ken&#39;s\n&gt; original source, but in a cross-platform way... so I\n&gt; can&#39;t use the GTK stuff.\n\nI&#39;ve been meaning to ask Ken more details about how he produced the\nspeciation graphs in his papers.  Is that speciation visualization\nbuilt into your release, Ken?  Is this what Tyler&#39;s referring to?\n\n&gt; I noticed a good speciation picture in the Yahoo group\n&gt; photos section.  How was that generated?\n\nYup, that&#39;s mine.\n\nIt was generated from XML specifying informaiton about the run.  It\nsounds like this would be a good option for you to use.\n\nPhilip and I have talked about breaking out the visualization tools\nwe&#39;re using as a separate entity, since they&#39;re\nimplementation-independent.  Currently we&#39;ve got style sheets that\ngenerate visual output for:\n\n--network layout\n--fitness per generation throughout run\n--complexity per generation throughout run (based on # of genes)\n--species distribution throughout run\n\nThe last three style sheets all generate graphics based on run output\nXML, so if you just wanted to use those tools, all you&#39;d need to do is\neither spit out your run data into an XML file that looked something\nlike this:\n\n&lt;?xml version = &quot;1.0&quot; encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE run SYSTEM &quot;run.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;run id=&quot;1&quot; timedatestamp=&quot;120403&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;parameters&gt;\n    &lt;pop_size&gt;100&lt;/pop_size&gt;\n    &lt;num_generations&gt;500&lt;/num_generations&gt;\n    &lt;neuron_mut_rate&gt;0.1&lt;/neuron_mut_rate&gt;\n    &lt;connect_mut_rate&gt;0.1&lt;/connect_mut_rate&gt;\n    &lt;weight_mut_rate&gt;0.2&lt;/weight_mut_rate&gt;\n    &lt;survival_rate&gt;0.2&lt;/survival_rate&gt;\n  &lt;/parameters&gt; \n  &lt;generation num=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;fitness&gt;\n      &lt;max&gt;9875&lt;/max&gt;\n      &lt;min&gt;10&lt;/min&gt;\n      &lt;avg&gt;4520&lt;/avg&gt;\n    &lt;/fitness&gt;\n    &lt;species id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;count&gt;100&lt;/count&gt;\n      &lt;fitness&gt;\n        &lt;max&gt;9875&lt;/max&gt;\n        &lt;min&gt;1752&lt;/min&gt;\n        &lt;avg&gt;4520&lt;/avg&gt;\n      &lt;/fitness&gt;\n    &lt;/species&gt;\n        &lt;species id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;count&gt;50&lt;/count&gt;\n      &lt;fitness&gt;\n        &lt;max&gt;9875&lt;/max&gt;\n        &lt;min&gt;1752&lt;/min&gt;\n        &lt;avg&gt;4520&lt;/avg&gt;\n      &lt;/fitness&gt;\n    &lt;/species&gt;\n  &lt;/generation&gt;\n\nOr spit it out in some other format, but have some code that\ntranslates into the format above.\n\nColin has put together some samples of XML in the Files section.  Are\nyou using these formats for your implementation, Colin?  Have they\nchanged at all?  We hashed out a common XML format for networks...it\nwould be good to do the same for the run output.\n\nI&#39;ll work on getting a website and repository up for the visualization\ntools, and I&#39;m working on a decent user guide as well.  But in the\nmeantime, if you want to start using what we&#39;ve got in its current\nstate, just let me know and I&#39;ll send you what you need or post it to\nthe File section.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
