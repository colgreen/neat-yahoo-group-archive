Submissions not accepted for talks will a=\r\nlso be considered in the poster sessions.\n\nSSBSS 2017 will focus on advance=\r\ns in the science and technology emerging from the fields of synthetic biolo=\r\ngy, systems biology, genome synthesis and genetic engineering. \nThe School =\r\nand the Workshop will highlight new tool development, as well as the applic=\r\nation of these tools to diverse problems in biotechnology, computational me=\r\ndicine, molecular biology including therapeutics, industrial chemicals and =\r\nbiofuels, natural products, and agriculture.\n\nIf you are engaged in above c=\r\nited topics that you believe can impact the state of the science and techno=\r\nlogy you must consider submitting.\n\n\nGOAL\nGiven the rapidity with which thi=\r\ns field moves, it is challenging for both newcomers and experts alike to st=\r\nay updated with all of the latest advances. \nThe goal of this summer school=\r\n and workshop is to bring together scientists from academia and industry wi=\r\nth diverse but relevant expertise in a setting \nconducive to discussion of =\r\nnew results and potential collaborative efforts. \nInvited talks will cover =\r\na wide range of topics ranging from fundamental basic science through to ap=\r\nplications. \nAttendees of this workshop will have the opportunity to hear a=\r\nbout the latest findings in this fast-paced field and to establish collabor=\r\nations with scientists who have complementary expertise.\n\n\nTOPICS\nSessions =\r\nintegrate the recent achievements made in the fields of synthetic biology, =\r\nsystems biology, biochemical engineering, synthetic enzyme, evolutionary en=\r\ngineering, \nintegrated omics, tools and methods, and emerging techniques, h=\r\nealthcare, biofuels, chemicals and materials, biologics, microbial and mamm=\r\nalian systems, and other disciplines and applications.\n\nSubmissions should =\r\nbe related to the following areas of synthetic biology, systems biology, ge=\r\nnome and genetic engineering:\n\nApplications of Synthetic & Systems Biology\n=\r\nBiological Design Automation\nComputational/Mathematical Modeling and Design=\r\n \nComputer Aided Design \nDirected Evolution \nDesigning and Writing Genomes\n=\r\nDNA Synthesis, Assembly, and Sequencing  \nHigh Throughput Design Space Expl=\r\noration \nIndustrial Applications of Synthetic & Systems Biology \nMammalian =\r\nSynthetic Biology\t\nMetabolic Engineering \nMicrobial Synthetic Biology / Mic=\r\nrobiome Engineering \nMolecular Programming \nOmics Science and Synthetic & S=\r\nystems Biology \nPedagogical/Educational Tools \nPlant Synthetic Biology \nPro=\r\ntein Engineering \nSynthetic & Systems Biology for Cell Culture and Medical =\r\nApplications\nSynthetic & Systems Biology of Industrial Microorganisms\n\n\nCOM=\r\nMITTEE\nYaakov (Kobi) Benenson,  ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland\nLeonidas Ble=\r\nris,  The University of Texas at Dallas, USA\nDomitilla Del Vecchio,  MIT, U=\r\nSA\nDiego Di Bernardo, Telethon Institute  & University of Napoli &quot;Federico =\r\nII&quot;, Italy\nBarbara Di Camillo, University of Padova, Italy\nBarbara Di Ventu=\r\nra, BioQuant/DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany\nSimone Furini, University of Siena, =\r\nItaly\nEmanuele Domenico Giordano, University of Bologna, Italy\nJ.
