The sensors have been tried a few different ways.  They  \nare arranged around the robot as described in the paper.  If there is  \nno food item in the arc of the sensor, it is input to the network as  \n0.  Otherwise, since I have a 100x100 grid constraining the space of  \nthe objects, the sensor is set to 200-d where d is the distance to the  \nnearest food item in that sensor arc. Other was that sensors was  \nimplemented was as a count of the number of food items that the sensor  \ncould detect. The outputs are rate of left turn, rate of right turn (I  \njust take the difference to determine which way to turn) and the  \nforward speed of the robot.\n\nThis is related to a larger experiment I have been running over the  \nlast couple years (at 1.5 months time per run, it took a while,  \nparticularly to debug a late run memory corruption).  That involved  \ntrying to fly airplanes along a random course.  My hunch there was  \nthat the complexity of the environment and controlled entity left a  \nrelatively naive (in the sense that it just took position and attitude  \nas input, and generated control settings as output) neat approach  \nunable to discover a suitably complex control function.  Now Im not as  \nsure.\n\nTo Anthony&#39;s questions: 8 environments are generated for each  \ngeneration, and each network is tested on all 8 environments.   \nMultithreading isn&#39;t an issue, since Im keeping it single threaded for  \nthe moment.\n\nMark Ahlstrom\nOn Nov 10, 2009, at 5:42 PM, Ken wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Mark, which food foraging experiment are you implementing?

My  control  \n&gt;&gt; experiment (i.e. the one I think should definitely give a solution)  \n&gt;&gt; is a re-implementation of the food foraging problem.  The fitness  \n&gt;&gt; function is the same.  So doing nothing nets a fitness of 32, and  \n&gt;&gt; max fitness is 60.  Instead what Im seeing is a small improvement  \n&gt;&gt; to average best fitness of about 35, and then almost every  \n&gt;&gt; generation I have a couple outliers with a fitness around 40-45.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is all using rtNeat.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, my question is whether or not I likely have some parameters  \n&gt;&gt; tuned badly (not unlikely) and if so, what the likely culprits  \n&gt;&gt; would be.  I&#39;ve tweaked those several times to no avail.  Or,  is  \n&gt;&gt; it likely just my implementation of the food foraging world?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mark Ahlstrom\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
