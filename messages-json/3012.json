They mentione=\r\nd that people\nare using the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in high end vi=\r\ndeo cards\nfor doing highly parallelized processing of data.\n\nI did some res=\r\nearch and NVIDIA has released a library called CUDA for\ninterfacing with th=\r\neir cards and doing non-graphics specific work. It\nis aimed at people doing=\r\n simulations or anything that requires (or\nbenefits from ) a high degree of=\r\n parallelization. It works under both\nLinux and Windows. It allows Sparse M=\r\natrix Multiplication (SMM).\nApparently ANN&#39;s can be represented as a matrix=\r\n then evaluated with SMM. \n\nThis could allow us to do highly parallelized e=\r\nvaluation of networks.\nAll on one machine without a cluster. Or you could u=\r\nse this in\nconjunction with a cluster to get some really amazing performanc=\r\ne\nincreases. From talking to my colleagues and discussing the problem\nthey =\r\nfigure if implemented right I could gain a 20 fold improvement in\nthe perfo=\r\nrmance of evaluating larger networks (100+ neurons). For\nsmaller networks t=\r\nhere would be few performance gains.\n\nI would love to work on this problem =\r\nwith anyone else who is\ninterested. I want to produce a C++ library that co=\r\nuld be called from\nthe C# or other c++ implementations for evaluating ANNs =\r\nin a highly\nparallel fashion.\n\nAnyone want to work on it with me? It is a l=\r\nittle more than I have\nenergy to take on all by myself right now. I am jugg=\r\nling a few other\nballs (who isn&#39;t).\n\nThanks,\n\nShane\n\n\n"}}
