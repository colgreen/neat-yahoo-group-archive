As you\n&gt; say, it can&#39;t &quot;get ther=\r\ne from here&quot;. It can&#39;t build enough structure and optimize it&#39;s\n&gt; performan=\r\nce to find a better solution before that species dies out.\n\nActually &quot;fract=\r\nured domains&quot; wasn&#39;t a term I was aware of, however I\njust read this:\n\n   E=\r\nvolving Neural Networks for Fractured Domains (2008), Nate Kohl\nand Risto M=\r\niikkulainen.\n   http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/kohl.gecco08.pdf\n\n=\r\nSo fractured domains =3D discontinuity. And yes I would say that&#39;s\ndefinite=\r\nly a major problem with NEAT (not sure about HyperNEAT). I&#39;m\ninterested in =\r\ntheir use of radial basis functions, which is something\nthat has been menti=\r\noned before on this group but not something that\nI&#39;ve looked into deeply.\n\n=\r\n&gt; Is this the problem you&#39;re looking to address here? Or just a method of e=\r\nscaping a local\n&gt; maxima in fitness by allowing more radical adjustments/gr=\r\nowth to network topologies in\n&gt; general?\n\nWell it&#39;s essentially the same th=\r\ning if discontinuity is the reason\nyou&#39;re stuck - which is very often the c=\r\nase I would say. Complex\nfitness lanscapes are almsot by definition &#39;fractu=\r\nred&#39; (As an exercise\ntry and think up a complex landscape/domain that isnlt=\r\n fractured).\n\n&gt; One thing I was wondering about, and I haven&#39;t poked around=\r\n to see if anyone has done\n&gt; some research into, is fiddling with the speci=\r\nes die-off parameter. I was thinking it might\n&gt; be worth trying (if someone=\r\n hasn&#39;t done it yet), is to remove the species die off if-hasn&#39;t-\n&gt; improve=\r\nd-in X generations bit if no species fitness has improved in some specified=\r\n\n&gt; amount of generations.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t expect this to be a major issue where=\r\n we are right now. If\na species hasn&#39;t improved in a long time then it&#39;s pr=\r\nobability of\nimproving in a further equally long time is low. Evolutionary\n=\r\ntechniques constarined by computing resources are always a\nprobabilities ga=\r\nme - you try and spend your limited CPU time searching\nthe areas of the spa=\r\nce that have the highest probabilities of yielding\ngood solutions. This sam=\r\ne argument sort of applies to the idea of\nincreasing populations - from one=\r\n perspective the size of the\npopulation is irrelevant as you can only evalu=\r\nate some fixed number of\ngenomes per unit of time. The main effect of pop s=\r\nize is thus to\nprovide a broader genetic base to drive genetic crossover an=\r\nd to keep\nan as diverse as possible population of search points across the\n=\r\nfitness landscape.\n\n\n&gt; I think if you&#39;ve sat with the same &quot;champion&quot; for a=\r\n large number of generations, it could\n&gt; be worthwhile to do something radi=\r\ncal, like greatly increase mutations,\n\nAgreed. Just generally - if a search=\r\n is stuck then &#39;do something else&#39;\nwould seem to be good advice :)\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m =\r\nsure someone has toyed with this at some point. I can always use another co=\r\nuple\n&gt; hundred of pages of papers/dissertations to add to my &quot;to-be-read&quot; p=\r\nile going into my\n&gt; thesis :)\n\n\nI think others have played with dynamic mut=\r\nation rate. The problem I\nthink is that there may not be any easy routes ou=\r\nt of a local maxima,\nincreasing mutations will sample points a little furth=\r\ner out than\nbefore but it&#39;s potentially clutching at straws in many cases. =\r\nThe\nother way of looking at it is that the encoding space or the fitness\nla=\r\nndscape (sort of teh same thing) could be changed such that there\nare easie=\r\nr routes to the good solutions - that&#39;s essentially what the\nradial basis f=\r\nunction paper above is doing - your nets can;&#39; get there\nfrom here, so use =\r\na different type of net.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
