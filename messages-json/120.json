It would simply mean that the input to\n&gt; the\n&gt; ANN would be two board positions each turn, rather\n&gt; than all of the board positions. \n&gt; \n&gt; To keep inputting 000 for every empty space every\n&gt; turn\n&gt; is an inefficiency (albeit a small one with only a\n&gt; six-card game...but when the number of cards is\n&gt; increased, efficiency becomes more important).  \n\nI guess I didn&#39;t understand your proposal; I&#39;m not\nsure I do now.  Are you suggesting that we only inform\nthe ANN of changes to the tablaeu of card?  This is a\nnew idea; maybe it has merit.  I can&#39;t see right away\nwhat the results would be.  It certainly would greatly\nreduce the number of input signals.  We could start\nwith a fixed or random first move, and then we tell\nthe player what is different.  It seems like we would\nbe increasing the memory burden, but maybe this would\nwork.  \n\nDo I understand you correctly now, that the idea is to\ntell the ANN all the changes that occur, instead of\nthe current state of the table?\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
