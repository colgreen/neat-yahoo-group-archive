That might make it easier for us to consider your domain than reading=\r\n code specifically.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jan van der Lugt &lt;ja=\r\nnlugt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; \n&gt; For a while now I have tried to make a=\r\n HyperNEAT experiment to do\n&gt; classification tasks, but I can&#39;t seem to get=\r\n it learning right. The\n&gt; accuracy just does not improve beyond a certain v=\r\nalue 0.655222, which is the\n&gt; percentage of benign tumors in the dataset. E=\r\nssentially, the algorithm is a\n&gt; ZeroR classifier... Can anybody spot my mi=\r\nstake? Hope so!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Jan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
