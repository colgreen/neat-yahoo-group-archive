Whereas in NEAT the\n&gt; &gt;genes always remain in the order they were added to the genome (this\n&gt; &gt;makes comparison nice and fast), but perhaps we are loosing some\n&gt; &gt;important properties by doing this - namely, crossover could be allowed\n&gt; &gt;to re-arrange genes into functionaly dependent groups. Hey I like this\n&gt; &gt;idea a lot Ian.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;I just had another idea. If I remember correctly, in nature genes are\n&gt;usually marked out with certain short sequences of DNA. Perhaps we could\n&gt;introduce the concept of a marker gene into the NEAT genome. We could\n&gt;then implement a multipoint crossover technique that is marker aware and\n&gt;hopefully genes would become re-ordered into functionaly dependent\n&gt;groups far more efficiently than using plain old random multipoint\n&gt;crossover.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course I am assuming that nature uses the markers during crossover as\n&gt;well as during expression of the genes. Actually it might not matter, if\n&gt;crossover ignores the markers then the genes will still form functional\n&gt;groups during expression. There may be a great deal of junk either side\n&gt;of the markers if crossover is ignoring them - but then there is all\n&gt;that &#39;junk&#39; DNA isn&#39;t there.\n\n\nI guess you are talking about the common, short repetitive sequences found \nin the Junk DNA?\n\nThey are not used as labels.  It&#39;s purely position on the chromosome and \nhomology between the two chromosomes which determines their alignment \nbefore crossover (they are physically lined-up next to each other).  There \nis (used to be) some talk that repetitive sequences increase the \nprobability of sequence duplication (which happens by misaligning the \nchromosomes before crossover, and leads to one output with two copies of a \nsection, and one with none).\n\nYou can easily reason that repetitive sequences create themselves in this \nway, in a &quot;selfish DNA&quot; manner, without affecting the individuals fitness.\n\n--\n\nDon&#39;t let that stop you, however, we don&#39;t need to take every idea from nature.\n\n--\n\nWhat you are describing is what I call an Arbitrary Label System \n(ALS).  It&#39;s part of a body of proposed research that I am slowly writing \nup as a position document.  I will announce the document here when I get it \ndone.  (I&#39;m not claiming to have invented the idea, I don&#39;t know where I \ngot it from.)\n\nAn ALS works as follows:\n\n1) some sort of &quot;entities&quot; (genes, networks, channels) have labels\n2) labels are subject to mutation along with the rest of the genome\n3) connections between entities are established using label compatibility\n\nThat&#39;s deliberately vague, because the idea has several applications.  The \nbroad idea is that label values co-evolve with the content of the entities \nthey are attached to.  The labels thus provide the &quot;weak binding&quot; required \nfor evolvability (in one body of theory, at least).\n\nFor example, to support modular neat:\n\n1) use multiple (different) networks in the individual -- code each network \non a different &quot;chromosome&quot;\n2) label each input to the individual\n3) label each input to a network\n4) label each output from the individual\n5) label each output from a network\n\nWhen the individual is instantiated, bind each input to the output with the \nmost-closely matching label.\n\nThus, for example, if one of the networks evolves as (say) a feature \nextractor, then it will also evolve a label which will come to mean \n&quot;feature extractor #1&quot;.  Chromosome duplication can add a second copy of \nthe same feature extractor.  Initially it binds the same, is labelled the \nsame, and functions the same.  Labels (and thus bindings) and function can \nnow drift between the two copies, until we have a different feature \nextractor, with a label meaning &quot;feature extractor #2&quot;.\n\nMy list of uses for ALS is:\n\n1) label the individuals inputs and outputs (as above)\n2) label connection points in a multi-component phenotype (needs #1, also \nas above)\n3) gene labels for crossover (your point)\n4) labels on working data stored in an individual (networks _can_ store \ndata internally, but I don&#39;t plan to only use ANN)\n5) label individuals to define relatedness for crossover\n\n--\n\nAn ALS might have features:\n\nMatching by similarity, or, matching by complementarity (A matches A vs A \nmatches ~A).\n\nLabels are split into &quot;sockets&quot; and &quot;pugs&quot; or all labels bind one another.\n\nLabels optionally also carry a &quot;specificity&quot; parameter determining how \nclose a match must be.\n\nLabel values can be single numbers, character sequences, vectors, sets...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
