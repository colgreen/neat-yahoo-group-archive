You\n&gt; note that players evolved using &quot;strict&quot; evaluation are easily\n&gt; defeated by a sub-optimal player (such as a random player).  Why then\n&gt; did you use &quot;strict&quot; evaluation as your primary mode of evaluation?\n&gt; Time?  Computing resources?\n\nMainly this was for consistency of evaluation. If a network recieved a\nscore of 90% once, it should score 90% again on the next trial. I forget\nexactly why this was important (something to do with the data collection).\nAlso you are right, it takes less time to compute, and when I was using\nthe tic-tac-toe domain I was more concerned about just getting evolution\nto occur, rather than evolution of something useful.\n\n\n&gt; &quot;This example network solves tic-tac- toe, only missing one game out\n&gt; of 10 against the perfect opponent (the genetic algorithm converged\n&gt; on the perfect solution 200 generations later).&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; You say that the network &quot;solves&quot; Tic-Tac-Toe, but it&#39;s only being\n&gt; evaluated against a perfect player.  And by &quot;missing one game out of\n&gt; 10&quot;, I&#39;m assuming that you mean the evolved player lost 1 and tied 9\n&gt; against the perfect player.  Is that right?\n\n&quot;Solves&quot; is used very loosely here. It solves tic-tac-toe in the sense\nthat it cannot get much better playing against the strict opponent. You\nare right it loses one out of 10 games.\n\n&gt; My main question is, if a network can tie 90% of its games against an\n&gt; optimal player, would we say it has solved Tic-Tac-Toe?  What if the\n&gt; same network loses 85% of its games against a random player?\n\nIt depends on what your goal is. Mine was to demonstrate that Modular NEAT\nactually evolved things. Truly solving tic-tac-toe I think would require\nalways tying the perfect player (in all of the perfect game trees), and\nalways playing to win against non-perfect players.\n\nThe Pollack paper you mentioned seems like a good idea, but really the\nbest would be to have it play against all of the possible combinations of\nopponents moves and calculate its fitness from that.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
