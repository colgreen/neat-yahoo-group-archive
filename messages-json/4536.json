This ties in with my\nrecent post about genome compatibilty metrics and =\r\neuclidean/manhattan\ndistance.\n\nIn sharpneat v2 I&#39;m trying to make the code =\r\nbase more abstract and\nre-usable, e.g. I&#39;m separating the NeatGenome and Ev=\r\nolutionAlgorithm\nclasses from being dependent on each other and also using =\r\ngenerics so\nthat we can plug in new genomes or algorithms with minimum effo=\r\nrt.\nThus my previous discussion resulted in my creating an\nICompatibilityMe=\r\ntric&lt;TGenome&gt; interface which can be plugged in to the\nNeatEvolutionAlgorit=\r\nhm.\n\nLooking at speciation again I see that at the outset I simply assign\ng=\r\nenomes to species if they are within some distance and if not then I\nplace =\r\nthe new genome in its own species. Independent of this I also\nadjust the co=\r\nmpatibility threshold once per generation in an attempt\nto keep the species=\r\n count between some limits (which has its own\nproblems and is another email=\r\n in the making). A possible problem with\nthis approach is that the first at=\r\ntempt at speciation will probably\njust assign the first N genomes in the po=\r\npulation as being the first\ngenome in each species - these genomes then bec=\r\nome [temporary]\nexemplars for the species, that is, the remaining genomes a=\r\nre compared\nagainst them and if they are close enough to an exemplar they a=\r\nre\nassigned to that species.\n\nAs an alternative approach I was thinking of =\r\ntaking the discussion\nabout compatibility (or distance) metrics a step furt=\r\nher and actually\nexplicitly representing where genomes are in the encoding =\r\nspace with\nsomething like an IEncodingSpace interface, the idea being that =\r\nI take\nthe total number of unique connection IDs in the whole population as=\r\n\nbeing the number of spacial dimensions, I then define the location of\neach=\r\n genome in each dimension as being the connection weight for that\nID (using=\r\n 0 if a genome doesn&#39;t have a connection for agiven ID). From\nhere I can fi=\r\nnd the range/limits of locations (weights) in each\ndimension, which effecti=\r\nvely defines an enclosing hypercube that the\ncurrent population is inside. =\r\nI can now divide up the hypercube into\nequally sized sub-cubes in order to =\r\nfind clusters of genomes that are\nclose together and use this as the basis =\r\nof my initial set of species.\n\nIn addition to all that I suspect it makes s=\r\nense to keep the exemplar\nfor each species consistent throughout the life o=\r\nf the species - so a\ngenome (representing a point in space) we keep to one =\r\nside, that may\nhave been removed from the population long ago. This keeps e=\r\nach\nspecies &#39;anchored&#39; in space and prevents it from drifting. We then\nhave=\r\n the choice of keeping a FIFO buffer of dead species as an\nindicator of par=\r\nts of the search space that have recently been\nsearched - avoiding these sp=\r\naces when creating new genomes. This is an\nidea I raised a few years ago an=\r\nd which I think is known as novelty\nsearch.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
