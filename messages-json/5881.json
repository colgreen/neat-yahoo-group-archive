I want to develop a netw=\r\nork (with certain properties and constrains) that learns a sequence (or mul=\r\ntiple sequences) during its lifetime. I think I will start with supervised =\r\nlearning, that is, the sequence is presented to the network (one or several=\r\n times) and the network should be able to reproduce the sequence when the b=\r\neginning of the sequence is presented. Of course the problem can be defined=\r\n in various ways and specified in more detail when sequence learning in an =\r\nagent simulation or in a concrete problem domain is considered. \n\nTherefore=\r\n, I would like to know which are the common problem domains that has been u=\r\nsed in previous studies to investigate sequence learning during the lifetim=\r\ne of the network. \n\nBest,\nMartin \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;ksta=\r\nnley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Martin, could you provide a little more info =\r\non what you mean by sequence learning?  Do you mean evolving a network to p=\r\nerform a sequence of actions, or perhaps evolving a network that learns a s=\r\nequence during its lifetime, or something else (such as learning the predic=\r\nt the next value in a sequence)?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;martin_pyka&quot; &lt;martin.pyka@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would ask the community for =\r\ngood sequence learning problems that can be used to train neural networks. =\r\nI think, a maze-navigation problem is probably a good starting point to stu=\r\ndy sequence learning.
