I have a\nfew thoughts on the subject that I&#39;d like to express, some more well\nformed than others :)\n\nFirstly, there is of course an objective driving evolution in the\nnatural world albeit a very broad one, that is, being able to survive\nand for long enough to reproduce (and anything else you can do towards\nincreasing the chances that your offspring will survive and\nreproduce). It just so happens that the natural world has an incredily\ncomplex structure that allows for many different ways (niches) of\neking out a living with a wide range of strategies from the relatively\nsimple (e.g. single celled algae floating in the sea) to the more\ncomplex (e.g. writing software for a living). It also just so happens\nthat the sub-environments and niches have significant overlap in terms\nof the strategies that work in one can sort of work in many others. As\nsuch there are many routes for evolution to take from simple to\ncomplex life, not just a series of stepping stones but complex\noverlapping and criss-crossing paths.\n\nEvolution discovered eyesight independently multiple times over\nbecause it was a recurring &#39;problem&#39; in all of these evolutionary\nniches and one for which a solution was &#39;nearby&#39; in the encoding space\nof biological genetics, the same is true for other phenomenon (flight\nhas been discovered independently, e.g. insects, birds, bats). This\nkind of shows that the biological encoding space is perhaps less\nsusceptible to getting stuck than NEAT (but it does have a lot more\nspace-time to play with, so perhaps not that much better)\n\nSo for me the main lesson from nature is that if you wish to evolve\nagents with complex strategies then you probably need to a complex\nenvironment (fitness space) that provides a wide range of overlapping\nniches and stepping stones all the way from the simple through to the\ncomplex. So from this perspective the miracle of life on earth is due\n50% to the mirace of evolution and 50% due to the miracle of the\nstructure of the natural world. Evolution did need large numbers to\nwork with (e.g. vast oceans of microscopic single celled creatures and\n3.5 billion years) to make all the leaps required to get where it is,\nbut each of those leaps was possible because of the overlapping nature\nof the available niches.\n\nIt&#39;s perhaps this latter 50% of the miracle that is generally\noverlooked in evolutionary computing circles, we&#39;ve tended to see the\nprocess of evolution as the solution but have overlooked the\nabsolutely pivotal role of deep complexity in the fitness space.\nWithout that complexity probably the best you can do is to make one of\nthose small leaps - essentially searching a local space.\n\nThe problem with objective based search then, as I see it, is that the\nobjectives we have tended to focus on are too focused and rigid.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
