This could alternatively have been done by \ninputing a\n&gt; f=\r\nifth posotion input node (making the five x1,y1,x2,y2 and \nPosition, call\n&gt;=\r\n it method 1b), which would also have allowed the genotype-&gt;phenotype\n&gt; con=\r\nversion to implement different phenotypes for different roles. \n&gt; \n&gt; My sug=\r\ngestion was simpler still, to implement the same phenotype \nfor each\n&gt; posi=\r\ntion, but adding an input node (at the phenotype) specifying \nposition\n&gt; (c=\r\nall it method 2). This input could be used to inhibit or excite \nthe\n&gt; func=\r\ntioning of nodes within the phenotype, depending on position. \nThis\n&gt; would=\r\n also allow roles to evolve, but using a different method.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a compr=\r\nehensive investigation, which might be well beyond the \nscope of\n&gt; the rese=\r\narch - the paper did demonstrate a very successfull test, \nI&#39;d\n&gt; personally=\r\n like to see all three methods implemented. 1a and 1b are \nvery\n&gt; similar i=\r\nn reality and genotype-&gt;phenotype conversion has all the\n&gt; information requ=\r\nired to switch between 1a and 1b internally, though\n&gt; supplying the informa=\r\ntion explicitly as per 1b _might_ be more \npowerful\n&gt; for evolving. \n&gt; \n&gt; w=\r\nith regards,\n&gt; mattias\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a=\r\n.carl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2008 16:26:47 -00=\r\n00\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Another New Paper:  Multiagent HyperNEAT\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ju=\r\nst for the record, and for the benefit of the group, isn&#39;t \nthe &quot;r\n&gt; &gt; (x) =\r\nmethod&quot; just a mechanism employed within the current \n&gt; &gt; infrastructure li=\r\nmitations, to map multiple agents within the \n&gt; &gt; substraite and generalize=\r\n the CPPN to the presence of the \nmultiple \n&gt; &gt; agents?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
