Since the\nsolution does not involve the network having to comp=\r\nute the velocities\nitself.\n\nBut if it were a real-world system we wouldn&#39;t =\r\ncare what the network\ndid or didn&#39;t have to compute, right?  If anything, i=\r\nf it could solve\nthe problem more effectively without extra computation, th=\r\nat&#39;s a good\nthing.\n\nOne of the real-world constraints we *do* care about is=\r\n the amount of\nenergy the system uses.  In Risto Miikkulainen&#39;s Evolving Ne=\r\nural\nNetworks workshop at GECCO this year he showed one of the resulting 2d=\r\n\npole balancing solutions that solve the problem, but would have\nconsumed e=\r\nnormous amounts of energy if it were actually implemented in\na real-world c=\r\nontroller.\n\nSo wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to penalize the amount of moveme=\r\nnt of\nthe cart?  Wouldn&#39;t this be not only a simpler penalty to implement,\n=\r\nbut be functionally very close to what you want to achieve?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
