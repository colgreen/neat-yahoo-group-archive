I&#39;ll attempt to respond to\nall o=\r\nf the questions/points in one email...\n\n\nStefano - good to hear your resear=\r\nch has broadly similar findings. Do\nyou have links to one or two specific e=\r\nxamples?\n\n\nKen - SELUs. I didn&#39;t encounter them in my recent brief survey o=\r\nf\npossible candidates to look into, but that does look intriguing. I was\nac=\r\ntually thinking of trying something similar to leaky ReLU but with a\ncurve =\r\ninstead of a hard threshold; the idea being that I think the\nhard threshold=\r\n may not be conducive for control tasks where\nintuitively I feel that a con=\r\ntinuous relationship between inputs and\noutputs will generally be superior.=\r\n E.g. I briefly applied ReLU to\nsingle pole balancing and the solutions wer=\r\ne all ones where the pole\nwiggled back and forth, rather than just being al=\r\nmost dead vertical &\nstationary.\n\nSo yes I&#39;ll definitely look into it. The =\r\nuse of exp() for negative\ninputs may affect performance of course, but defi=\r\nnitely worth\ninvestigating.\n\nAlex - Re. heterogenous activation functions (=\r\nHA-NEAT). Yeh would be\ninteresting to see how your HA-NEAT implementation p=\r\nerforms on the two\nbenchmark tasks I&#39;ve been using. I see you ran to 3000 g=\r\nenerations,\ni.e. held the number of gens constant, whereas I&#39;m holding cloc=\r\nk time\nconstant. Probably to be a fair comparison on the underlying techniq=\r\nue\nI&#39;d have to hold gens or evaluation count constant (as per Jeff&#39;s\ncommen=\r\nts). Thanks for the paper, and good luck with the GECCO\npresentation.\n\n\nPab=\r\nlo - Re. the tiny slope on the leaky ReLU based functions. I did\nuse a tiny=\r\n gradient of just 0.001. Given how tiny this is it seems\nlikely to me that =\r\nthere would be no qualitative difference between\nthis and a non-leaky ReLU.=\r\n I&#39;m happy to try it though just to be sure\n(Jeff seconded that question).\n=\r\n\nI used leaky ReLU because I was keen for there to be at least some\nkind of=\r\n gradient to follow, and at the time I though it would reduce\nthe chance of=\r\n random weight mutation drifting to very large values.\nBut of course follow=\r\ning a shallow fitness gradient could also lead to\nvery large weights - I on=\r\nly just realised that. It should prevent\nrandom weight drift though, in pri=\r\nnciple that shouldn&#39;t matter because\nthere&#39;s no gradient, but some future n=\r\network mutation could bring that\nweight back into a part of the fitness lan=\r\ndscape with a gradient, so\nmaybe my instinct on this is reasonable.\n\nRe. th=\r\ne &#39;Proportional&#39; activation function, that&#39;s in an older code\nbase I think,=\r\n but yeh was just y=3Dx with the output y clipped to [0,1],\nI guess you&#39;d c=\r\nall that non-leaky SReLU nowadays.\n\n\nJeff -\n\n&gt; Would you mind letting us kn=\r\now how these figures look holding the number of\n&gt; evaluations constant?\n\nYe=\r\ns I&#39;ll have a go. I agree that would be useful. I have my reasons\nfor choos=\r\ning clock time as I was focused on overall speed of finding\nsolutions, but =\r\nI agree it&#39;s useful to understand the relative\nperformance of these functio=\r\nns independent of execution speed. In real\nworld practical applications the=\r\nre&#39;s a balance to be had, but we need\nthe raw results/science to understand=\r\n that balance.\n\n\n&gt; we=E2=80=99d love to see these same results on more/hard=\r\ner problems.\n\nSure. Do you have any in mind? I&#39;m happy to discuss this furt=\r\nher. It&#39;s\ntrue that my tasks are sort of &#39;toy&#39; tasks, but again this was a\n=\r\nconscious choice. These tasks are non-trivial, or certainly more\ncomplex th=\r\nan XOR (say), but don&#39;t require much CPU time to evaluate.\nThis results in =\r\nNEAT being run to some quite high generation and\nevaluation counts within e=\r\nach one minute run, so we get to see lots of\ncumulative mutations, some lar=\r\nge networks forming, and a general\nstress testing of the SharpNEAT code bas=\r\ne.\n\nBy distributing out to more CPUs/nodes we can perhaps look into slower\n=\r\nto evaluate but more interesting tasks, but still keep total\nexperiment tim=\r\ne reasonable.\n\n\n&gt;  I can volunteer the computing resources from U. Wyoming =\r\nto give you the ability to\n&gt; conduct a larger study\n\nCool, thanks. In princ=\r\niple it should be possible to run the core\nSharpNEAT algorithm on .NET Core=\r\n on unix/linux with minimal effort,\nassuming it&#39;s a *nix cluster with x86/6=\r\n4 CPUs(?). It&#39;s certainly worth\nconsidering.\n\n\nThanks again,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
