Then for each other neurons a shortest distance to the input neurons is calculated. If, for instance, given neuron connected with input one then it has layer index 1, or if given neuron connected with no input neurons but with neurons with layer indices 2, 4, and 5 then its layer will be 3 (minimum possible). Thus it&#39;s easy to determine for each connection whether its recurrent or not. We&#39;re just need to substract finish neuron layer index and start neurons layer index. If it&#39;s positive then connection is direct, if not then we have a reccurent connection.\n\nSorry for my English.:)\n\n\n"}}
