(my simpl=\r\ne understanding of them is that they model some sort of simple memory of th=\r\ne networks last activation, so multiple network activations would destroy t=\r\nhat concept anyway)\n- does my simplification keep the normal behavior of th=\r\ne network, esp. if it&#39;s only strict forward?\n\nI use the whole simplificatio=\r\nn of the activation for some evaluation speed ups, by creating a separate c=\r\npp file for the current population, compiling that one into a shared librar=\r\ny with a little help of cmake. This library, created at runtime, is then us=\r\ned for fitness evaluation.\nMy first experiments with that show some major s=\r\npeed increase for complex domains (in my case it&#39;s a khepera robot navigati=\r\nng in a maze with objective to explore most areas of the maze without crash=\r\ning into walls).\nAs you can see, there are lots of network activations need=\r\ned so the time to generate and compile the library has almost no weight in =\r\ncontrast to the speed gain of the network activation.\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any c=\r\nomments on this and experience some of you could share.\n\nRobin\n\n\n\n"}}
