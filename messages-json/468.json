That is, if I am\n&gt;understanding correctly, your code on its own does evaluations until\n&gt;it establishes that there have been enough to send the resulting\n&gt;fitness values to NEAT to create the next generation.  Is this the\n&gt;right idea?\n\nYep.  I might ask NEAT to get involved in figuring out if it is &#39;enough&#39; or \nnot, or I may just duplicate that code within the experiment.  Whichever is \nmost convenient.\n\n&gt;So the point of the algorithm below is just to make sure evaluation\n&gt;has stabilized after some # of iterations, at which point you would\n&gt;put on the breaks and send it to NEAT, right?\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt;I think the idea makes sense...assuming that noise in the statistics\n&gt;does not make this methodology return misleading results.  For\n&gt;example, a network might get the first 10 right and the remaining\n&gt;10,000 wrong, whereas its peers may get the first 10 wrong and the\n&gt;remaining 10,000 right, in which case, if say 5 iterations of no\n&gt;change was your stopping criteria, you would assess the significantly\n&gt;worse network as better.\n\nYep.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing to mitigate that:\n\n1.  Filtering of the available input data.  I &#39;hash&#39; the input sample to a \n27-bit value such that physically similar &#39;shapes&#39; of input map to the same \nhash value.  Then I include only one sample per hash value in the training \ndata.  Thus, each &#39;shape&#39; is equally represented.\n\n2.  This training data is then randomized so that &#39;common&#39; and &#39;uncommon&#39; \nshapes are evenly mixed together.\n\n3.  Whenever a network is evaluated against a sample, it is actually \nevaluated on the sample and 15 other versions of that sample.  Rotated, \nflipped, and negated versions.  The single evaluation is an average of all \nof those sub-evaluations.  This will (most likely) favor &#39;symetry&#39; in the \nnetwork.\n\nNow, combined with a minimum &#39;no-change&#39; threshold of 10 iterations, that \nmight be enough to make sure that everything settles down enough before \nmoving on to the next generation.  But my instinct is telling me that \n&#39;might&#39; isn&#39;t good enough.  That I need to be SURE before I stop evaluating. \n  So it seems to me that I need some other &#39;exit&#39; criteria.  Something that \nif it isn&#39;t met, the evaluation will not stop.  But what?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions, please share.\n\nIn the mean time, I created an Excel spreadsheet to help me visualize a \nworst-case scenario.  Column A is &#39;=rand()*rand()&#39;.  Column B is \n&#39;=average(A$1:Ax)&#39;.  Column C is some function to try to smooth out the data \nand figure out when it is safe to quit.  I graph the first as a line chart \nwith no lines, points only, and the other two as line charts without points \n(lines only).  The shapes of the graphs change with every refresh.  Quite \ninteresting.  Difficult to see a good stopping function, though.  But I&#39;ll \nkeep working on it. :)\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStore more e-mails with MSN Hotmail Extra Storage ï¿½ 4 plans to choose from! \nhttp://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"}}
