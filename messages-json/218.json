Although one \npoint I would like to make is that this only works for direct encoding \nschemes, NEAT is ok because a NEAT chromosome is a direct encoding of a \nNN. If you start to consider indirect encoding (as in biology) then you \nfind that small changes in the genetic make up can result in large \nchanges in the phenotype. The solution is to compare phenotypes - which \nis something I didn&#39;t take into a account in my own code which IS does \nuse indirect encoding.\n\n&gt;Yes, Ken talks about dynamic thresholding in the NEAT\n&gt;Users FAQ.  This seems like a reasonable approach, but\n&gt;leads to a couple of points.\n&gt;\n&gt;The philosophy behind speciation then shifts from:\n&gt;\n&gt;--species are subgroups that vary topologically by a\n&gt;particular amount\n&gt;\n&gt;to:\n&gt;\n&gt;--a species is not defined as much by topological\n&gt;difference as by the number of species threshold\n&gt;\n&gt;That is, in the second case, a given species could\n&gt;have much more or much less topological difference\n&gt;between its individuals.  This approach seems less\n&gt;desirable to me, since it seems less\n&gt;biologically-inspired.  You&#39;re enforcing an arbitrary\n&gt;division of the population, rather than defining\n&gt;species primarily by a distance function.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;If you do use dynamic thresholding and define a set\n&gt;number of species, this approach then leads to the\n&gt;question: What is a good number of species for a\n&gt;population?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;And should the number of species allowed then be\n&gt;proportional to the population size?  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAfter reading this and having a think I do agree with you on this. So \ngoing back to your original email, it&#39;s interesting that Ken used a \nfixed N=1, or was this because the chromosome never became larger than \n20 in length? Either way the use of N=1 when size&lt;20 seems like an \nunnatural step, perhaps we need an equation that increases the \ncompatibility value for small chromosomes (as ken has done) but that \ndoesn&#39;t have that unnatutal step at length=20.\n\nConsider what happens when N becomes 20. Chromosomes that were \npreviously in seperate species may now be classed as being in the same \nspecies, because although they have large values for D and E , these are \nreduced by the now large N=20. This sudden reclassification of all \nmembers in the population is surely a bad thing.\n\nSo we are being pulled by Ken&#39;s work on one hand - which works well but \nonly covered the ground where length&lt;20 and N=1. And on the other hand \nwe want to go beyond length=20 (with normalization) but avoid the nasty \nstep.\n\nI should like to ask Ken if the his chromosomes actually approached a \nlength of 20, since we can alleviate the problem by reducing the step \npoint and/or having more than one step point. E.g.\n\nfor length&lt;5,  N=1\nfor 5&gt;=length&lt;10,  N=5\nfor 10&gt;=length&lt;15, N=10\nfor 15&gt;=length&lt;20, N=15\nfor length&gt;=20, N=length\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
