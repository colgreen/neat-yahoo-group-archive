I would like to\n&gt; &gt; try and implement NEAT+Hawkins(On Intelligence) ideas on how the\n&gt; &gt; brain works.  This requires more complex structures that allow, for\n&gt; &gt; instance, for recurrent connections back to *input* nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, outputs are inputs.  It&#39;s all a big loop.  But it&#39;s more than\n&gt; just that...  When the &#39;expected&#39; input (which is an output of an\n&gt; &#39;expectation&#39; circuit) doesn&#39;t match the input, you get one result. \n&gt; When it does, you get another.  But that kind of thing is VERY\n&gt; different than NEAT.\n&gt; \n\nWell, NEAT doesn&#39;t address this specifically but I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re\nsaying here.  It&#39;s certainly &quot;handled&quot; by NEAT as well as anything else\n(seemingly better in some cases).\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; there is also a strong temporal aspect to this according to\n&gt; &gt; hawkins.  incorporating both the feedback and temporal aspects into\n&gt; &gt; a net raises the level of complexity quite a bit.  Hawkins team has\n&gt; &gt; implemented a fixed structure hierarchy that is not really a NN.  It\n&gt; &gt; uses bayesian probabilities throughout the feedback mechanism.\n&gt; &gt; Their early tests show some real promise in invariant visual\n&gt; &gt; recognition...but I feel their structure is too constrained and\n&gt; &gt; would like to see if NEAT can be applied with his concepts\n&gt; &gt; incorporated.  It may not work or may be too complex...I dunno...\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think NEAT is what you want.  I think you want a dynamic\n&gt; network that grows during the life of the organism.  Which means you\n&gt; need a set of rules governing that growth.  Evolution might best be\n&gt; applied to those rules, rather than to the structure itself.\n&gt; \n\nI disagree.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing NEAT would excel at. \nAny time you have recurrency, there are &quot;temporal aspects&quot; but it&#39;s just a\nhigher order of topology.  In fact, NEAT is evolving rules for building\nstructure, just not at the same level you&#39;re suggesting here (a la cellular\nautomata).  Growth over the life of the organism is interesting and something\nI&#39;m not experienced with.  When our brains &quot;grow&quot; is that out of necessity or\nopportunity?\n\nAs for Bayesian networks, I believe it&#39;s just another spin on the same\nproblem.  Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe anything that can be\ndone by a bayesian network can in theory be done with a NN.\n\nRegards,\n\njeff\n\n\n"}}
