That one can choose whether =\r\nto have\nthreshold values in the nodes or a bias node, i.e they serve the sa=\r\nme\nfunction?\n\nWhen I read literature on neural networks, some mentions this=\r\n\nthreshold value when explaining the input and weight summation\ncalculation=\r\n for a node, i.e. not the: activationFunction((sum(W*I)))\nbut the: activati=\r\nonFunction((sum(W*I)-Threshold)). \nBiological neurons have thresholds so pe=\r\nrhaps its used to more closely\nmodel this behaviour, in conjunction with a =\r\nfire-not fire output model\nfor the nodes?\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\npetar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gaussian function f=\r\nits just as well as all other possible \n&gt; activation functions. OK well thi=\r\nnk of the bias like a shift of the \n&gt; function. The graph doesn&#39;t have to b=\r\ne centered around the X=3D0 \n&gt; vertical axis. It may be shifted left or rig=\r\nht. This is what the bias \n&gt; does. It is possible to find a functioning neu=\r\nral network without \n&gt; using any bias, depending on the domain, of course, =\r\nbut I think in \n&gt; most cases it is essential, at least it speeds up the sea=\r\nrch towards \n&gt; finding a solution. There is evidence that evolution can use=\r\n even \n&gt; regular inputs as bias values, when they are just being the same a=\r\nll \n&gt; the time (I refer to the Automobile Crash Prediction System that Ken =\r\n\n&gt; developed, using visual images as input instead of laser \n&gt; rangefingers=\r\n). \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Correy Allen Kowall&quot; \n&gt; &lt;=\r\ncoolbeanskowall@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How about Gaussian activation function?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You refer to the bias value that is usually present in th=\r\ne NN \n&gt; nodes in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; most models. In NEAT there is a bias input which ha=\r\ns a constant \n&gt; value \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of 1.0. There is clear advantage for using it,=\r\n otherwise the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hyperplanes that the nodes represent would all cross =\r\nthe origin \n&gt; of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hyperspace, which is limiting the possible beha=\r\nviors the NN can \n&gt; have. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But not all nodes in NEAT have a connectio=\r\nn to the bias node. \n&gt; Evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; connects nodes to it when only when=\r\n it is useful. In this way the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; search space is further minimized, NE=\r\nAT does not have to search \n&gt; for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proper bias on every node. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; However, in HyperNEAT substrates, it is better to have a bias in \n&gt; every=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuron anyway, then the biases will be &quot;drawn&quot; by the CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stig.bergestad&quot; &lt;st=\r\nig.bergestad@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering=\r\n if the original NEAT(c++) used/uses threshold \n&gt; values\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for node a=\r\nctivation?
