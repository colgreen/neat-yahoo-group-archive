This force / output is given to the simulator, which \nreturns then t=\r\nhe resulting new joint angles.\nI thought it to be crucial to allow the arm =\r\nto move at maximum speed, \nif desired. But if I interpret your post right, =\r\nthis could be a \npotential problem. Would it be better to allow only small =\r\nforces (but \nlarge enough to fight against gravity) in order to increase th=\r\ne \nnumber of timesteps (and therefore the amount of data) per moving \ndista=\r\nnce?\n\nWith best regards,\nMatthias\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth S=\r\ntanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Matthias, I may have missed it in the lon=\r\ng thread, but did you say\n&gt; your output is in degrees?  Is it a delta reque=\r\nst, i.e. is it a\n&gt; requested change, or is it an absolute angle that is req=\r\nuested?  \n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is to allow outputs to request only very small=\r\n\n&gt; incremental changes in angle, such as &quot;move one degree up&quot; or &quot;move\n&gt; on=\r\ne degree down&quot; at maximum.  If there are enough time steps per\n&gt; second, th=\r\nen it should move to the correct angle in reasonable time.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, pe=\r\nrhaps I misunderstood how your output works.  If so, how\n&gt; are you interpre=\r\nting the output?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\n\n"}}
