The dynamics of NEAT \nare still =\r\npreserved though, but in this case you can consider the \nnetworks evolved a=\r\ns a genotype of ..well, a genotype of something :) \nPlease read the papers =\r\nfor an introduction to CPPNs. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;titan_=\r\nex3&quot; &lt;thomas.p.grant@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, all. My idea for using NEAT/rtNEAT=\r\n is for my honours project at\n&gt; uni where I, hopefully, will be using NEAT/=\r\nrtNEAT in a game. One major\n&gt; idea I have had though is to possibly extend =\r\nNEAT to control every\n&gt; aspect of a virtual organism, i.e. using the neuroe=\r\nvolution to create\n&gt; intelligent creatures, and extend the evolution to all=\r\now a visual\n&gt; representation of each organism, where crossover and mutation=\r\n would\n&gt; effect the physical attributes of an organism. \n&gt; Thanks \n&gt; Tom.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
