Thr reason for this is that using fully conected genomes does not \ngive good results (as you observed), whereas starting awith no structure \nseemed to work well. You could also try starting with a small proportion \nof connections, just set the conncetion proportion value accordingly \nwhen you create the population.\n\nActually in the long run any excess structures will be removed in the \nfirst pruning phase, but witha fully connected population that first \nphase can take a few minutes to come around.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
