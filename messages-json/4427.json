I do not have a (non-HyperNEAT) NEAT package around.\nCan you let me know if your NEAT implementation is different than what I\nreport below?\n\nI am using Jason&#39;s HyperNEAT 2.5 package available here:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html\n\nIf you download the package, the key file is:\nHyperNEAT/NEAT/src/NEAT_GeneticIndividual.cpp\n\nI am attaching it, but I don&#39;t know how that works with the yahoo group.\n\nCrossover occurs in this constructor:\n\n    GeneticIndividual::GeneticIndividual(shared_ptr&lt;GeneticIndividual&gt;\nparent1,shared_ptr&lt;GeneticIndividual&gt; parent2,bool mate_multipoint_avg)\n\nThe following line occurs outside of the loop that goes through each link:\n\n bool chooseFirstParent = (randomChoice&lt;=parent1-&gt;getFitness());\n \nThen, inside the loop for each link:\n\n                    if (chooseFirstParent)\n                    {\n                        addLink(GeneticLinkGene(*link1));\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        addLink(GeneticLinkGene(*link2));\n                    }\n \nSo, it seems that *all* the links will be grabbed from one parent or the\nother. Is that how it works in other versions of NEAT?\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sun, 09 Nov 2008 20:14:32 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Crossover doing anything in HyperNEAT and PNEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Jeff, \n&gt; \n&gt; Well I don&#39;t know about the exact implementations of HyperNEAT you are\n&gt; using (note that P-NEAT is just NEAT with additive mutations\n&gt; disabled), but in principle crossover should choose genes randomly\n&gt; from both parents as it builds the offspring genome, the child. In\n&gt; HyperNEAT the crossover is different, there you actually do a regular\n&gt; NEAT evolution of networks that build other networks based on the\n&gt; substrate configuration. That is, you only mate and mutate the CPPNs.\n&gt; But in the case you get lots of individuals with equal fitness, I\n&gt; guess these individuals are clones. Perhaps the code frequently\n&gt; chooses the same individuals for mating? You can try to avoid this by\n&gt; introducing a loop in which you try candidates for a &quot;father&quot; that are\n&gt; not compatible with the mother, that is, when their compatibility\n&gt; distance is 0.00, try again. There is another possibility, simply\n&gt; every mutation disturbs the CPPN and therefore the produced network is\n&gt; changed in such a magnitude that is has no chance for survival and is\n&gt; discarded. Even though there is speciation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Does crossover do anything in PNEAT and HyperNEAT?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; PNEAT:\n&gt;&gt; If I am reading the code correctly, during crossover, if the\n&gt; substrates are\n&gt;&gt; the same (i.e. all links have the same ID), which is always the case\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; P-NEAT, *all* of the link values are taken from either parent1 or\n&gt; parent2.\n&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t it more normal when crossing over to take some from parent1\n&gt; and some\n&gt;&gt; from parent2? Why grab all from just one?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This means that in PNEAT crossover does nothing, right? It will\n&gt; always grab\n&gt;&gt; the substrate of parent1 or the substrate of parent2.  If I track\n&gt; parent and\n&gt;&gt; offspring fitness, 100% of the time the child has the exact same\n&gt; fitness as\n&gt;&gt; one of the two parents.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On to HyperNEAT:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I tracked the fitness of each parent and the resulting offspring.\n&gt; The odd\n&gt;&gt; thing is that the organisms that are crossed only (i.e. they are\n&gt; never\n&gt;&gt; mutated) have the *exact* same fitness of one of their parents\n&gt; 98.88% of the\n&gt;&gt; time. In 20 runs, that was only 136 orgs out of 12257 that were\n&gt; crossed over\n&gt;&gt; and not mutated. That seems wrong, doesn&#39;t it? Why would these new\n&gt; links\n&gt;&gt; have such a small impact? It turns out that this is because nearly\n&gt; every\n&gt;&gt; time that there is an extra link that gets placed in the child, the\n&gt; parent\n&gt;&gt; that donated that link is also the parent whose weights are being\n&gt; grabbed,\n&gt;&gt; meaning that the crossover is only copying the parent (hence the\n&gt; same\n&gt;&gt; fitness). It seems to me that crossover should be much more\n&gt; disruptive, no?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As a final test, I did a set of hyperneat and pneat runs with the\n&gt; default\n&gt;&gt; &#39;MutateOnlyProbability&#39; parameter set to .25, so 25% of orgs never\n&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; candidates for crossover. I then ran experimental treatments\n&gt;&gt; hyperneat-noCross and pneat-noCross where the MutateOnlyProbability\n&gt;&gt; parameter was set to 1, so no orgs were crossed over. Despite my\n&gt; comments\n&gt;&gt; above, Hyperneat (with cross) did beat HyperNEAT-noCross, however\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; difference was not tremendous (although it does seem to be\n&gt; statistically\n&gt;&gt; significant). For p-neat, the reverse was true. Nevertheless, this\n&gt; is not a\n&gt;&gt; perfect test of whether crossover pays dividends, because if\n&gt; crossover does\n&gt;&gt; nothing most of the time, and I increase MutateOnlyProbability from\n&gt; .25 to\n&gt;&gt; 1, I have effectively raised the mutation rate (only 80% of crossed\n&gt; orgs are\n&gt;&gt; also mutated).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Are these the intended consequences of crossover, or am I missing\n&gt; something?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\r\n--B_3309092666_14454309\r\nContent-type: application/octet-stream; name=&quot;NEAT_GeneticIndividual.cpp&quot;\r\nContent-disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;NEAT_GeneticIndividual.cpp&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--B_3309092666_14454309--\r\n\n"}}
