I look forward to seeing your ideas on evo=\r\nlving adaptive ANNs, which is clearly essential to the ultimate goals of ne=\r\nuroevolution.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;olivercoleman04&quot; &lt;oliver.=\r\ncoleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just started a Ph.D. with a topic=\r\n around neuroevolution, online-learning, adaptive NNs (via synaptic plastic=\r\nity and/or similar). In my feverish excitement I thought it would be a good=\r\n idea to start a blog on questions and issues I come across, in the hope th=\r\nat other active researchers will want to comment on and perhaps even start =\r\na bit of dialogue about them (like this mailing list but more public). I kn=\r\now another Ph.D. candidate who keeps a similar blog (totally different rese=\r\narch area, though) and it&#39;s working out great for her, so it didn&#39;t seem li=\r\nke a completely hopeless idea...\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some of you are interested in =\r\nthe evolution of adaptive NNs, I read your articles as soon as they were po=\r\nsted to this group! :) I also envisage using NEAT and variants in the resea=\r\nrch (I did a study of some of the properties of HyperNEAT for my Honours ye=\r\nar a year or so ago). It&#39;s at http://ojcoleman.com. The first post is mostl=\r\ny background info (I hope I didn&#39;t get anything too wrong, let me know if y=\r\nou think I did!) and what the research is about, but it also explains why I=\r\n think the proposed approach is a good idea which might provide some good c=\r\nontroversy points (maybe not so much among this crowd, however).\n&gt; \n&gt; I goo=\r\ngled around and couldn&#39;t find all that many relevant blogs. Do any of you k=\r\neep a similar blog or know of any? I could mostly only find generic newsy A=\r\nI ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
