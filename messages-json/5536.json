You seem to be equating scale of\nreproduction (e.g. zillions of bacteria) with fitness, hence the\nconclusion that bacteria are fitter than whales on the only metric\nthat matters - reproduction.\n\nThe central issue here is how we define fitness. I think the the root\nof your logical error is in considering fitness as a simple metric\nwhere we can take any two organisms/agents and state that one is\nfitter than the other based on reproductive efficiency and overall\npopulation size. I believe this view of fitness as a simple linear\nmetric is wrong and thus any conclusions we build from this assumption\nare on shaky ground.\n\nA critical aspect of natural evolution is variation and adaptability.\nIf you occupy some minority niche then there&#39;s a chance that you&#39;re\noffspring will become more numerous in future because, e.g. there&#39;s\nanother much larger niche that leads on from there that simpler\nspecies can&#39;t get too (human ancestors fit this pattern) or some\nchange in environment causes previously dominant species to die out or\nbecome the minority and/or your niche becomes much larger/widespread.\nYou could argue that a changing environment (e.g. natural disaster or\noxygenation of the atmosphere) represent different fitness functions,\nspecies A was optimal at time t, species B was optimal at time t+1M\nyears. But even that still leaves the first argument that minority\nniches may lead to large uncolonised environments.\n\nSo my argument in a nutshell - reproductive efficiency != fitness.\nReproduction is a /pre-requisite/ to evolutionary fitness (without it\nyou&#39;re a non-starter) but it should not be considered a simple linear\nmetric of fitness even within the context of a static fitness\nfunction/landscape. If the landscape is complex then minority\nstrategies may lead to dominant strategies in the future and you can&#39;t\nknow which strategies today will lead to the successful ones in the\nfuture. This is not entirely the same as novelty search but it can be\ndepending on what the novelty metric is. So I would say that novelty\nsearch can be considered a means of adding complexity to the simple\nfitness landscapes defined by narrow objective functions (because\nselecting based on novelty or a mix of novelty and fitness defines a\nfitness landscape distinct from the simple target objective - there is\nstill an objective function, but one that is a modified version of the\nprimary objective).\n\nI was going to respond to some of your other points but I&#39;ll leave it\nthere as I believe the above focuses on the essential underlying\nissue(s).\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
