NEAT normally would not show decreasing champion fitn=\r\ness if elitism is in place, but I don&#39;t know exactly how the MATLAB version=\r\n is implemented, so there could be something I don&#39;t know.  But it seems li=\r\nke you might have to do some digging to see what is happening to champions =\r\nthat have low error at the start - are they being removed with having offps=\r\nring for some strange reason?  You probably need to do a little debugging t=\r\no find out.\n\nAlso, note that most versions of NEAT do not work with negativ=\r\ne fitness, so if you are literally using -mse, maybe that&#39;s somehow related=\r\n to the problem.  That is, if you literally use negative numbers for fitnes=\r\ns, for most implementations the algorithm&#39;s behavior is unpredictable but a=\r\nlmost certainly bad.   The reason is that fitness is used in speciation equ=\r\nations, and those equations assume positive numbers or else they don&#39;t come=\r\n out right.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ivalcky&quot; &lt;ivalcky@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I used NEAT to fit my training data.\n&gt; The fitness function i=\r\ns minus MSE, like fitness =3D -mse.\n&gt; Hopefully the mse of the champion wil=\r\nl become smaller in each upcoming\n&gt; generation, which means it fits the tra=\r\ning data better.\n&gt; I used the MATLAB vertion, and the parameters is the sam=\r\ne as the\n&gt; original setting.\n&gt; The result seems quite confusing, for the -m=\r\nse value increases in the\n&gt; beginning 20 generation, and it descrases then.=\r\n\n&gt; The draft below shows the approximate result, the horizontal axis is the=\r\n\n&gt; generation, and the vertical axis is the minus MSE.\n&gt; |\n&gt; |             =\r\n                  *\n&gt; |                        *                *\n&gt; |      =\r\n               *                           *\n&gt; |                 *         =\r\n                           *\n&gt; |              *                            =\r\n               *\n&gt; |           *                                           =\r\n        *\n&gt; |         *\n&gt; |        *                                       =\r\n                      \n&gt; *\n&gt; |       *\n&gt; *\n&gt; |      *\n&gt; *\n&gt; |     *\n&gt; *\n&gt; |=\r\n     *\n&gt; |    *\n&gt; |   *\n&gt; | *\n&gt; |\n&gt; |______________________________________=\r\n___________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; The results is averaged over about 30 runs=\r\n, in each single run, the\n&gt; trend is similar, it increases in the beginning=\r\n and decreases after\n&gt; about 20 to 30 generation.\n&gt; However, I expected the=\r\n minus MSE should be increase along with the\n&gt; generation increases.\n&gt; Can =\r\nanyone give me any hints about this pheomenon?\n&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
