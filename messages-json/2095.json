What is your affiliation with UT?  Are \nyou a grad student?  I&#39;m surprised I hadn&#39;t heard about what you&#39;re \nuy to before.\n\nA few comments..\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ashot_Petrosian&quot; &lt;ashot@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \tI have implemented a Python version of NEAT myself which is \n&gt; feature-complete and has been successfully tested on XOR and \ndouble \n&gt; pole balancing, and which I&#39;m using now to evolve controllers for \nsome \n&gt; simple soccer playing bots.  I should say that my version is not a \n&gt; carbon copy of the original in implementation and is in fact \ndifferent \n&gt; in a few areas by quite a bit (although I think functionally \nmostly \n&gt; equivalent).  The three biggest differences that I can think of \nare \n&gt; that speciation is done continuously without distinct species \n&gt; (individuals get fitness modifications depending on how new and \nhow \n&gt; rare their innovations are, and probablistically mated based on \n&gt; similarity), there is no genotype - crossover and mutation is just \n&gt; done directly, and links don&#39;t have their own innovation ids \n(instead \n&gt; its a tuple of the innovation ids that they connect).   I can \ndescribe \n&gt; these in more detail, but I don&#39;t think they are very interesting. \n&gt; Suffice it to say that I can&#39;t guarantee that this will work \n&gt; identically to original NEAT on every problem, although it has \ndone \n&gt; well thus far.\n&gt; \n\nThe continuous speciation idea is interesting.  People have \nspeculated on doing something like that for a long time actually, \nbut I don&#39;t know of anyone who actually did it before.  It would be \nan interesting study in its own right to see if doing that improves \nthe algorithm.  One thing it makes me wonder about is that when you \nhave discrete species you can set a target # of species and \nuse &quot;dynamic thresholding&quot; to hold that number stable.  Since you \ndon&#39;t have an actual # in your implementation, you can&#39;t set a \ntarget in the same way.  This brings up what the benefit of setting \ntargets is.  One benefit is that it allows you to make sure you \ndon&#39;t get explosions in the # of species, which would lead to a lack \nof diversity within each species.  In other words, the whole \npopulation could end up separated from each other.  Another nice \nthing is it allows several themes to totally diverge from each other \nover long periods of time.  In your scheme, it seems possible that \nbecause there is no particular guard in place keeping any two \nindividuals from mating, over time you might get more uniformity and \nconvergence.  Not sure about this though, of course it depends on \nyour parameters...but I wonder how things compare.\n\n\n&gt; \tAlso, I have implemented a module to save and retrieve \nnetworks and \n&gt; evolutionary runs to and from a mySQL database, a module to \nvisualize \n&gt; arbitrary parameters from the database, a 3d network visualizer, \nand a \n&gt; soccer domain with a monitor.  I ported the network evaluation \ncode to \n&gt; Pyrex (C) to speed up the simulations some as well.  If Tom or \nanyone \n&gt; else is interested in any this the code it is relatively simple \n(the \n&gt; part that implements NEAT is ~500 lines), it will be here soon \n(once \n&gt; I&#39;m finished cleaning it): \n&gt; \n&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neat\n&gt; \n&gt; \t(at the moment you can see a screenshot and some videos of \nevolved \n&gt; behaviour)\n&gt; \n\nLet me know when you are done with this and I will link it off my \nsites.  I really like the 3D visualization of the network.  I \nthought about doing something like that a long time ago but never \ngot around to it.  It&#39;s pretty fun to see the network being \nmanipulated.\n\nI&#39;m curious though, what is the meaning of the &quot;species&quot; sizes if \nthere are no discrete species in the system?  Do you do a post-hoc \nspeciation just for graphing purposes?\n\n \n&gt; \tJoe (or anyone really) - I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at \nyour code \n&gt; yet, but I am curious to know how you kept the GA and the network \n&gt; seperate and still had innovation numbers?  I found that this was \nthe \n&gt; most difficult thing to deal with and essentially made any sort of \n&gt; strict meaningful OO seperation difficult to impossible. \n&gt;  \n\nI&#39;m actually not sure why this is difficult...I will leave it to OO \nexperts to consider...\n\n&gt; \tAlso, when I was first looking over Ken&#39;s code as a \nreference I \n&gt; massaged his comments into Natural Docs format, in case someone \nfinds \n&gt; this useful it is here:\n&gt; \n&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neatdoc\n&gt;  \n\nWow...it&#39;s cool to see it so well laid out.  Let me know if I can \nlink this from the NEAT pages and I will do so...it would be helpful \nto people I have a feeling.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
