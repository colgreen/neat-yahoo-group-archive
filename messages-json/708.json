Consider one is solving a neural control task and his network has some &quot;significant&quot; (by their weights) connections. Then even slight change of input parameter can lead to significant change of network outputs. I.e. network seems to be easy to disbalance.\n\nAn interesting question appears. Described above problem is concerning correlation level amidst i/o signals. Is there any way to evaluate this parameter and whether its possible to use it in networks evolution? And more is there any way to check network stability and quality? It can be useful because it will be possible to search for solution with some apriory defined charactersitics which seem to be more significant then total network complexity or something of this kind.\n\n\n"}}
