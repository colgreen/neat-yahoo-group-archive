It hops t=\r\no another species.\n\nFor example:\nGenome 1 is the exemplar for Species 1.\nGe=\r\nnome 6 is the exemplar for species 4.\nAfter several epochs, Genome 15 now b=\r\necomes the new exemplar for species 1.  \nWhen Genome 6 is compared to 15, i=\r\nt is now placed in Species 1 instead of 4.\n\nIs this acceptable or should I =\r\nprevent it? \n\n\n"}}
