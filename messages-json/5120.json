So in my expe=\r\nriments the top 20% of each species will be preserved.  Given my target spe=\r\ncies size, this probably works out to be about 2 individuals per species mo=\r\nst of the time.  So, in answer to your question Jeff, my elitism is probabl=\r\ny a bit more than twice yours.  I say a bit more because SharpNEAT also doe=\r\nsn&#39;t have a minimum species size to qualify for elitism.  I&#39;d be curious ab=\r\nout the effects of setting a hard limit of 1 genome per species and minimum=\r\n species size requirement though.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;ksta=\r\nnley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I just wanted to comment on the elitism discussi=\r\non that has been part of the broader discussion of multiagent HyperNEAT.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In my NEAT implementation, elitism is not a percentage.  Rather, the cha=\r\nmpion of each species is copied into the next generation as long as the spe=\r\ncies is at least some minimal size (otherwise the species would never chang=\r\ne).  Jason&#39;s SmallestSpeciesSizeWithElitism variable is about that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ke=\r\neping the champion of each species makes sense because it means the species=\r\n will all remember their best solution yet, rather than only the champion o=\r\nf the top species.

No problem. Thanks for the=\r\n answers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In response to comments 1-3, we&#39;ve actually run severa=\r\nl preliminary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments with the intent of answering the questions =\r\nyou&#39;ve asked.  We hope\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to have a publication with formal results base=\r\nd on those experiments soon.  In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general though, we do feel that this=\r\n approach is superior to the one discussed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the previous multiagent=\r\n HyperNEAT paper and would recommend anyone who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wants to work with mu=\r\nltiagent HyperNEAT to use the z-based substrate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cool. I look forw=\r\nard to seeing the paper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.  Way back when I first converted Sha=\r\nrpNEAT to HyperSharpNEAT I tried a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; number of values and found that th=\r\nere wasn&#39;t a large difference between them,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; although 20% seemed to be=\r\n slightly better.  For any new domains I&#39;ll try a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; values to see i=\r\nf they make any difference, but I haven&#39;t found any where the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; elitism=\r\n value made a significant difference.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will say that I&#39;ve nev=\r\ner tried just saving the best organism.  One reason is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the Sharp=\r\nNEAT speciation code isn&#39;t really designed to only save one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; genome.  =\r\nThe other is that I think saving at least the best genomes in your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\nst species would help prevent promising species from accidentally dying off=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too early.  On the other hand, I know you have several successful Hy=\r\nperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments, so I guess I&#39;ll turn the question back on you: H=\r\nave you found\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saving just the best genome to generally be better than=\r\n saving more?  I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly willing to give it a try if you&#39;ve seen =\r\nmuch better results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have never changed these parameters. But no=\r\nw that we are discussing it I\n&gt; &gt; am realizing I don&#39;t actually know how mu=\r\nch elitism I am using. I think I am\n&gt; &gt; using the same parameters from Jaso=\r\nn&#39;s experiments. I was focusing on this\n&gt; &gt; parameter, which is why I said =\r\nI keep only the best org:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ForceCopyGenerationChampion 1.0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n But I now also see these parameters in my experiment config files:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; SmallestSpeciesSizeWithElitism 5.0\n&gt; &gt; MutateSpeciesChampionProbability 0=\r\n.0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do I figure out my % elitism, so I know how my number compa=\r\nres to your\n&gt; &gt; 20%?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5.  The answer to whether we renormalize =\r\nthe sheets or insert the new sheets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; between the old is technically bo=\r\nth.  In general we renormalize, that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; however many agents there are=\r\n, they are evenly spaced between -1 and 1.  While\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it may seem like a =\r\ngood idea to leave the original sheets where they were and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; insert the=\r\n new ones among them, in most cases it is difficult to determine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wher=\r\ne the new sheets should go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, if there were 5 agent=\r\ns located at z=3D{-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1} and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; team needed to be scal=\r\ned to 7 agents, where should the two new agents go?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are two age=\r\nnts, but four spaces (-0.75, -0.25, 0.25, 0.75) to put them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and no re=\r\nal reason to choose any of the spaces over the others.  By\n&gt; &gt; &gt; redistribu=\r\nting the agents evenly we eliminate such ad hoc decisions.  However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nif the 5 agent team were to be scaled up to 9 agents, they would be placed =\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; z=3D{-1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1}.  Thus, even th=\r\nough we&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; renormalizing, the placement works out the same as if we h=\r\nad inserted the new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agents among the old.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That makes sense, =\r\nand seems like the right way to do it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6.  The sign function sim=\r\nply returns the sign of the node&#39;s activation: -1 if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the activation i=\r\ns negative, 0 if it is 0, and 1 if it is positive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The reason \n&gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nor this function and the starting structure is to establish a team with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mirror symmetry i.e. the ANN of the agent at z=3D 1 is the horizontally =\r\nflipped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; version of the agent at z=3D-1 and so on.  We found that team=\r\n mirror symmetry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was beneficial in both domains that were tested in t=\r\nhis paper, so it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; logical to allow it to start with symmetry (whic=\r\nh can be broken or ignored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with mutations).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ok. I get it. Th=\r\nanks for clarifying.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope I&#39;ve answered your questions,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; You did.

In=\r\n this paper you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explicitly discuss how it would be beneficial to add=\r\n new agents, and have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their roles be intermediate versions of other =\r\nagents (e.g., adding a 12th\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; soccer player between the forwards and t=\r\nhe midfielders would create a player\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that was a hybrid of the two ro=\r\nles). It would also be cool to see if teams\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can gracefully re-divide=\r\n the strategy-space when they lose agents. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; example, in soccer/fu=\r\ntbol, after a few red cards are assigned, each player\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; does not play =\r\nthe usual role that they would play on a team of 11, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; instead re-=\r\ndivide the space up amongst the fewer players. For example, after\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\ne red cards their may be a left and right forward instead of a left, right\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and center forward. It would be cool to see if you can see such a re=\r\nsult\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; using your method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2) You mention the benefits o=\r\nf interpolated roles, but do you have any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; evidence that such interpo=\r\nlation is occurring? One cool way to test this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; would be to compare t=\r\nwo different treatments: T1) take your original N\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; agents and multipl=\r\ny them to achieve the desired scaled-up number of agents\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (e.g., 9, 2=\r\n5, 100, 1000). If you start with 10 agents, and scale to 1000,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you t=\r\nhus get 100 identical copies of agent 1, 100 identical copies of agent\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; 2, etc. Compare the performance of this treatment to T2) interpolate 100=\r\n0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; agents into the z coordinate range, so you have 1000 slightly diff=\r\nerent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; agents. The difference in performance between these treatments=\r\n will help you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; figure out whether you are seeing a boost due to inte=\r\nrpolation. If the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; performance increase due to scaling is not differe=\r\nnt between T1 and T2, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you know your performance boost was simpl=\r\ny due to having more agents, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; due to interpolation (you note some=\r\nthing similar when you say &quot;adding more\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; agents that all do the same =\r\nthing will eventually cause a pile-up&quot;...my\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suggestion is a way to t=\r\nest this claim).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 3) Why do you feel this new technique is be=\r\ntter than your old technique? Is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it possible to compare the two expe=\r\nrimentally? Have you done so?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 4) I notice you mention that y=\r\nou use 20% elitism. I usually only save the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; best organism. Have you =\r\nfound 20% to work a lot better, generally?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 5) When you add n=\r\new agents, do you leave the previous sheets in the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; place, and i=\r\nnterpolate new sheets between them, or do you renormalize all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the=\r\n sheets such that it may be the case that no new agent is in the exact z\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coordinate of one of the original agents? It might be interesting to t=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; both and see which tends to work better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 6) What i=\r\ns the &#39;sign&#39; function you mention in Figure 2? In general, I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; havi=\r\nng trouble figuring out what this means: &quot;The starting structure of the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; initial heterogeneous CPPN (Figure 2b) includes some additional structu=\r\nre to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; start evolution with knowledge of mirrored team symmetry; in p=\r\narticular, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sign function of z connected to multiplication operat=\r\nors on the x-axis means\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that the CPPN knows which side of the team i=\r\ns which and can opt to reflect\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one side across the midline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Congrats again on this nice work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Universi=\r\nty\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2010 02:59:22 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nTo: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] M=\r\nultiagent HyperNEAT Revisited\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Our 2008 GECCO paper by Davi=\r\nd D&#39;Ambrosio and myself introduced the idea that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; single H=\r\nyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of neural networks (instead of just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\none) that represent a pattern of policies for an entire team.
