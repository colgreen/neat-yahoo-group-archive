Hello to everyone!\n\nI&#39;ve just released a small software package for free download.  It \ncontains a simplified physics model of a sailboat, and a means of \ncontrolling it.  There is a goal, to sail around a circular island.  \nThere is randomly varying wind.  The package includes one example of \na controller that can do a fair job.  The purpose of all this is to \ninvite someone to produce a better controller.  Any software \ntechnology is acceptable, but someone in this group may want to apply \nNEAT.  My own controller is an ANN, produced by more conventional \nneuroevolution.  (If there is such a thing as conventional \nneuroevolution!)  \n\nIt&#39;s written in C.  You can get it from \nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net.\n\n\n"}}
