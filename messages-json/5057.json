The question is, as you point out, whether we\nshould take the hard view that such information is the only thing that\nevolution needs. \n\nThinking along these lines, there are two related but importantly distinct\nquestions: \n\n1) Can evolution produce all desired forms only with geometric information?\n2) Does evolution have an easier time if you combine both geometric\ninformation and environmental information?\n\nMy post was more getting at the second question. My hunch is that it may in\nsome cases be easier to base heuristics off of environmental information\nthan to make the same distinction only using geometric information. But,\neven if that is true, it does not undermine the huge advance of your CPPN\nwork that shows how much easier development is if we provide global\ngeometric information (and evolve increasingly complex coordinate frames\nfrom it). \n\nSo we are in full agreement about this statement:\n\n&gt; Yet I believe such functionality can complement and extend CPPNs without\n&gt; replacing their central role in encoding neural structures.\n\nI also agree with you that we need to get learning working in conjunction\nwith evolution to produce intelligent neural networks.
