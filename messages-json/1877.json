NERO is the novel video\n&gt;game we are developing based ona real-time version of NEAT.  NERO\n&gt;has a lot of features that are interesting even if you aren&#39;t into\n&gt;gaming:  you can basically set up neuroevolution experiments and\n&gt;change the fitness function dynamically in real-time, watch your\n&gt;whole population evolve at once, and even interact with them as they\n&gt;evolve.  And you don&#39;t need to understand anything about GAs, NEAT,\n&gt;neuroevolution, or anything technical in order to play with it.  If\n&gt;you are curious about its progress, the website is being updated at:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://nerogame.org\n&gt;\n&gt;There are new screenshots and movies.  You can also go directly to\n&gt;movies at movies.nerogame.org.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are hoping to release the game in a few months so that people can\n&gt;play on the internet.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
