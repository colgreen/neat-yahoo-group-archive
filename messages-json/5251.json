The manuscr=\r\nipt is available here:\n\nhttp://www.few.vu.nl/~ehaasdi/papers/Modular-Locomo=\r\ntion.pdf\n\nIn this paper we introduce the idea of modular differentiation wi=\r\nth HyperNEAT: we use a HyperNEAT encoding to generate homogeneous (in the l=\r\niteral sense) but varying neural network controllers for individual robot m=\r\nodules that are linked together into a larger `organism.&#39; These controllers=\r\n allow the multi-robot to locomote purposefully and even somewhat reactivel=\r\ny.\nThis paper constitutes a proof of concept and we hope to expand on this =\r\nwork to allow HyperNEAT-based control in arbitrary and ultimately developin=\r\ng multi-robot organisms.\n\nWe would like to thank Jeff Clune for pointing Hy=\r\nperNEAT out to us and everyone on this list  - Ken Stanley especially - for=\r\n the fruitful discussions.\n\n\n"}}
