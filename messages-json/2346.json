I&#39;ve \n&gt; introduced some pretty nasty bugs into code in the name of\n&gt; optimisation, \n\nFor Delphi Neat, I used an &quot;optimized&quot; version of exp, because it was\nsignificantly faster. What I didn&#39;t know was that it wasn&#39;t as accurate.\nThat exp function totally killed the effectiveness of NEAT, and it took me\ndays before I realized it was the exp function that was causing the\nproblems...\n\n&gt; Hence my train of thought moves \n&gt; to hebbian learning based algorithms - the idea of connection hardness \n&gt; gives us something like that. \n\nHardness, is that resistance to mutation, like preventing weight mutation\nand connection splitting? I could see potential benefits to that. Would\nhardness be related to connection age, or evolved as a separate value,\nalong with the connection weight? \n\nOne interesting solution would be to initialize all new connections with a\nhardness of zero, then let the hardness evolve freely. Evolution should\nmake essential connection hardened because mutations to them would\ndecrease the survivability of the species/individual...\n\nToday, evolution fumbles blindly, changing everything around &quot;trying&quot; to\nmake improvements instead of focusing on the weak parts of the current\nnetwork. Perhaps hardness would be a way around that?\n\nI&#39;ve often wondered what would happen if you &quot;locked&quot; nodes and\nconnections after they reached a certain age, focusing evolution on coming\nup with new structures to tweak old behaviours instead of evolving all of it. \n\nIs there any research on these topics that I could look at?\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
