AI and neural-inspi=\r\nred learning methods are clearly a work in progress, so a lot of the excite=\r\nment is in the ideas and where they may lead, rather than a particular appl=\r\nication.\n\nAlso, when it comes to finance, perhaps neurological accuracy is =\r\nnot the best basis for mastering it.  After all, most people are not able t=\r\no look at a graph of financial activity and know what will happen next, yet=\r\n they are great at tying their shoes.  Of course, in the context of the rec=\r\nent financial meltdown, it&#39;s not clear that anything or anyone is really go=\r\nod at finance.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
