I will be starting a lab there in\n&gt; &gt; January, and I would like to en=\r\ncourage readers of the NEAT email list that\n&gt; &gt; are interested to apply to =\r\njoin my lab. I will continue to work with\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT, CPPNs, NEAT, neuro=\r\nevolution, etc. in my new lab. One overarching\n&gt; &gt; focus will be on evolvin=\r\ng large-scale, structurally organized neural\n&gt; &gt; networks (i.e. networks wi=\r\nth millions of connections that are modular,\n&gt; &gt; regular, and hierarchical)=\r\n. I am also interested in combining neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; with learning algori=\r\nthms, including neuromodulation. In short, my lab will\n&gt; &gt; focus on exactly=\r\n the sorts of research topics we discuss on this list. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please als=\r\no help me find talented students & postdocs by forwarding this\n&gt; &gt; email to=\r\n those with similar interests. Thank you very much for your help.\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n----------\n&gt; &gt; Two fully funded Ph.D. positions are available in any of the=\r\n following\n&gt; &gt; areas, especially in combinations of them: evolving artifici=\r\nal intelligence,\n&gt; &gt; neural networks, robotics, and deep learning. Postdoct=\r\noral positions are\n&gt; &gt; also available, but under different funding arrangem=\r\nents (please email\n&gt; &gt; jeffclune@... &lt;mailto:jeffclune%40cornell.edu&gt; for d=\r\netails).\n&gt; &gt; Positions ideally start January 2013, but applications will be=\r\n reviewed\n&gt; &gt; until the positions are filled. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I (Jeff Clune) am s=\r\ntarting up a new lab at the University of Wyoming and am\n&gt; &gt; seeking two pe=\r\nople interested in earning a Ph.D. in computer science. The\n&gt; &gt; lab focus i=\r\ns on evolving artificial intelligence by producing artificially\n&gt; &gt; intelli=\r\ngent robots, including physical robots and agents in simulated\n&gt; &gt; worlds, =\r\nsuch as video games. The lab will also study other bio-inspired AI\n&gt; &gt; tech=\r\nniques, such as deep learning. Part of these efforts will involve\n&gt; &gt; inves=\r\ntigating how evolution produced the complex, intelligent, diverse life\n&gt; &gt; =\r\non this planet by trying to computationally recreate it. Please see my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwebsite (http://JeffClune.com) for example publications, press articles\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n about the work, videos, etc. Here are some keywords that describe related\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; fields: evolutionary algorithms (also known as genetic algorithms or\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; evolutionary computation), neural networks (including evolving neural\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n networks, having them learn, deep learning, and computational neuroscience=\r\n),\n&gt; &gt; robotics, artificial intelligence, and research into the evolution o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; intelligence, complexity, evolvability, and diversity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If yo=\r\nu are interested in joining the lab or would like more information\n&gt; &gt; abou=\r\nt the positions, please follow the instructions at\n&gt; &gt; http://jeffclune.com=\r\n/positionsAvailable.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The University of Wyoming is located in L=\r\naramie, a college town in the heart\n&gt; &gt; of the Rocky Mountain West.
