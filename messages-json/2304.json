That is, it &#39;learns&#39; the rules, it develops a strategy,\n&gt;and some of what is &#39;learned&#39; in one game is transferrable to another\n&gt;game.\n&gt;\n&gt;Or is that not the ultimate goal?\n\nYes it is.  _An_ ultimate goal anyway :)\n\nIf you refer to the work that Derek was reporting seeing at GECCO, then I \ndon&#39;t think it does directly contribute to this ultimate goal.\n\nOTOH, I do still have this in the back of my mind as an eventual objective \nof my SLEAT work.\n\nOr rather, I started with this objective in mind, and then I pruned and \nsimplified it until it became a small enough piece of work for me to start \non today...  And what I arrived at was SLEAT.\n\nTicTacToe is really only a simple test case for this approach.  A suitable \nmodel system for prototyping.  Once I have things working nicely for TTT, \nmy plan is then to try and apply the same approach to more complex games.\n\nThis might then begin to support transfer between different games.  e.g. \nthe set of intermediate boards that I generate could provide a means for \notherwise incompatible chromosomes to talk to one-another.  Things are not \nyet so abstracted that the geometry of the board can be separated from the \nrules of the game.  e.g. TTT chromosomes will transfer far better into Go \nthat chess, because TTT and Go share the concept of &quot;yours and my pieces&quot;, \nwhereas chess extends that in a more complex manner due to their being six \ndifferent types of piece on either side...\n\n&gt;What if you were to attempt to evolve a network that is capable of\n&gt;playing 10 different games?  Chess.  Checkers, Go, tic-tac-toe, and\n&gt;who knows how many others.  The search space would be impossibly\n&gt;large, and perhaps even impossible to traverse.  The only possible\n&gt;solution would be a generalized learning mechanism, wouldn&#39;t it?  But\n&gt;would we ever find it?\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
