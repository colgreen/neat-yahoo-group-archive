My mind is kind of geared in that\n&gt; &gt;direction at present.  I guess I would like to\n&gt; leave\n&gt; &gt;that option (transferring neural nets to real\n&gt; robots)\n&gt; &gt;open, so I am trying to focus on more realistic\n&gt; &gt;senses.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Hi Tyler,\n&gt; \n&gt; My concern though is that you are allowing the scope\n&gt; of your project to \n&gt; increase and encompass a lot more than can be\n&gt; achieved in one go. The \n&gt; stuff being discussed on this group about fitness\n&gt; functions and the type \n&gt; of senses needed is all good stuff and represents a\n&gt; significant problem \n&gt; and interesting piece of research in itself. By\n&gt; adding the extra factors \n&gt; of ray tracing and image analysis you are\n&gt; dramatically increasing the \n&gt; complexity of the problem. Image analysis by itself\n&gt; is a long-standing \n&gt; branch of research AKAIK and I&#39;m just thinking about\n&gt; detecting lines and \n&gt; objects in 2D images, in order to build a 3D model\n&gt; in your head you have \n&gt; to combine two 2D images (stereoscopic), you could\n&gt; do this with code \n&gt; rather than in the NN&#39;s but it is CPU intensive work\n&gt; especially if you \n&gt; include the ray tracing!\n&gt; \n&gt; Scope creep is the death of many a project. My\n&gt; advice would be to keep \n&gt; your scope focused and you can move on to the other\n&gt; stuff with a new \n&gt; project later.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope I didn&#39;t come across as *too* much like a\n&gt; nay-sayer there :)\n\nNope, not at all.  I definitely need to keep things\nsimple, especially at first.  One thing I&#39;m interested\nin is figuring out these different problems and trying\nto combine them into a single agent.  I&#39;ll be sure to\nkeep the search space size in check.\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
