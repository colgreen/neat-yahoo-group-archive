However, when I add some new\ncode, I&#39;m faced with the problem of not just setting my own new\nparameters, but potentially changing the standard NEAT parameters.\n\nMy question, then, is this: how do you set the parameters that govern\nthe NEAT system?  I&#39;ve played with mutation rates (especially\nstructural), speciation settings (including dynamic thresholding), and\nthe other odds and ends (popsize, minimum size for elitism, fraction\nof parents to reproduce, weight caps), but I&#39;m not always sure what\nI&#39;m looking for when I make changes.  What, aside from a solution, are\nthe variables to look for when evaluating the quality of a run?\n\nAnd I will provide bonus stars for anyone who has a non-ad-hoc\napproach to setting some of these variables.  :)\n\nI appreciate any thoughts or suggestions,\n\n--Bryan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
