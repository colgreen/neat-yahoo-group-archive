A=\r\nnd I have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; openly stated as much on more than one occasion. But as I =\r\nam sure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you are aware, a concept once let loose, is free to bec=\r\nome \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that what may have been originally envisioned. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I am indeed aware of the work involved in using NEAT for everyday \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; engineering tasks, and making substantial upgrades to the source \n&gt; code=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; infrastructure to unlock its potential (i.e. greater than a man-\n&gt; =\r\nyear).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m confident in the statement that each proposed updat=\r\ne \n&gt; suggested to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; date has already been accomplished (on NEAT, not H=\r\nyperNEAT). It \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be an error to assume otherwise. So I have mo=\r\nre than a concept of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; whats involved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem, if yo=\r\nu want to characterize it as such, is that my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; efforts are directed t=\r\nowards everyday engineering tasks which are \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; public in nature,=\r\n and the burden of writing papers is \n&gt; substantially \n&gt; &gt; &gt; greater than j=\r\nust the writing. The experiments are the everyday \n&gt; jobs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that need =\r\nto get done.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your efforts are not unappreciated. But when you =\r\nput something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; forward with associated claims, its reasonable to assu=\r\nme that you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have done your homework and are in a position to answer =\r\n\n&gt; reasonable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions as they relate to your claims.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAsking questions such as:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) What benchmarks against known qua=\r\nntities, have you made \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparisons against your claims, to help us u=\r\nnderstand where in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; AI landscape we should place your claims,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) What computational cost comparisons have you performed agai=\r\nnst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other known quantities, to help us understand what the costs of =\r\n\n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; claims are.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; These are not adversarial questions=\r\n. They are the normal types of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions that are routinely addresse=\r\nd in the body of a technical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper or presentation making various cl=\r\naims.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you fail to answer the questions up front in the tech=\r\nnical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; presentation/paper itself, it is reasonable to expect follow-o=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions in an attempt to nail these issues down. If you neglect =\r\n\n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; answer these questions, it is also a reasonable expectation \n&gt;=\r\n others \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will wonder why.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my opinion that the conc=\r\nept of NEAT has so much more \n&gt; potential \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than you have exercised pu=\r\nblically to date. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For whatever your reasons are, perhaps as s=\r\nimple as alignment \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research interests, you have left a lot o=\r\nn the table.

You \n&gt; express\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; impatience that every possible question has not been answered \n&gt; wit=\r\nhin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one year of the debut of a completely new methodology.  It \n&gt; v=\r\nerges on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paranoia to suggest that we are &quot;withholding&quot; information =\r\n(the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; source\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; code is released; anyone can perform any experim=\r\nent that they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wish). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose you just don&#39;t realize how m=\r\nuch effort goes into \n&gt; running\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiments and writing papers. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Notice that others in this group ask questions that are couc=\r\nhed \n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friendly discussion.  Yet you take the attitude that some=\r\none is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hiding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something from you and you are therefore &quot;dist=\r\nurbed.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You should change your tone.  Instead of attacki=\r\nng the source \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having answered every question that=\r\n you have and performed every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment that you personally believ=\r\ne we should ever perform, \n&gt; why \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put it more like, &quot;It w=\r\nould be interesting to see if...&quot;  \n&gt; or &quot;One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;d like t=\r\no perform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting \n&gt; question \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether.=\r\n..&quot; In other words, what is accomplished by your \n&gt; aggressive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; con=\r\nfrontational demeanor?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I remember hearing once, though I d=\r\no not remember the source, an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interesting quote on scientific resea=\r\nrch.  To paraphrase: &quot;Good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research answers hard questio=\r\nns.  However, the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research raises entirely new ques=\r\ntions that we never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have even asked before.&quot;  Think of=\r\n quantum physics.  The \n&gt; uncertainty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principle has led to endless =\r\ndiscussion of paradoxes and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impossibilities, with no end in sight, =\r\nbut we do not see people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accusing Heisenberg of trying to hide the =\r\n&quot;truth.&quot;  Instead, it \n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; credit to his discovery that we are n=\r\now asking such profound \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let me sugges=\r\nt to you that you change your tone and drop the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confrontational dem=\r\neanor.
