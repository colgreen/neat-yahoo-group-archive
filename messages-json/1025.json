First they wrote the f=\r\nirst version of the specification.  They then wrote hundreds of tests (whic=\r\nh in later specification versions become regression tests) against the spec=\r\nification interfaces.  Once the test suite was completed, they wrote a refe=\r\nrence implementation of the specification which was continuously pushed thr=\r\nough the test suite until it passed 100%.  These unit tests &quot;partially vali=\r\ndated&quot; the reference implementation.  Additionally, other tests were added =\r\nto the suite as &quot;ambiguities in functionality definitions&quot; became evident. =\r\n Finally, the specification, tests and reference implementation are all loc=\r\nked down into a single release.  And the process repeats with the productio=\r\nn of a new specification (as an incremental change to the current version).=\r\n  The reference implementation is &quot;feature complete&quot; and NOT efficient.  Th=\r\ne goal is to prove functionality completeness, not to generate a production=\r\n worthy version of the J2EE specification.\n\nSun then uses the resulting tes=\r\nt suite as the method upon which to &quot;logo certify&quot; other J2EE implmentation=\r\ns for a particular J2EE specification version.  If and when a &quot;logo certifi=\r\ned&quot; version of a J2EE application server either has an issue with which the=\r\n specification cannot resolve or does not behave consistenly with another J=\r\n2EE server (which is very likely as a customer can have multiple vendors fo=\r\nr J2EE app servers), then the ambiguity is first resolved by determining th=\r\ne behavior of the reference implementation.  The reference implementation i=\r\ns considered &quot;the standard&quot;.  Then, the ambiguity is addressed by adding it=\r\n to the issue pile for the coming J2EE release where the ambiguity is forma=\r\nlized in the specification and a test or set of tests are generated to ensu=\r\nre the ambiguity has been removed.\n\nI am sure you can see this kind of form=\r\nality saves HUGE amounts of time both in misunderstandings (between competi=\r\ntors) as well as reducing the amount of &quot;caught in the middle&quot; customers fe=\r\nel when a complex implementation problem arises.\n\nGiven there are now so ma=\r\nny implementations of NEAT, it might be useful to start some sort of &quot;stand=\r\nards based&quot; mechanism with which NEAT implementations become &quot;certified&quot;.  =\r\nIt could facilitate interoperability as well as efficiency...and possibly b=\r\noth at the same time (similar to what John Arrowood has been referring in h=\r\nis approach to implementing his experimental system).\n\nIt would also allow =\r\nexperimenters to focus more effectively on the goal of furthering the ideas=\r\n within NEAT as opposed to having to dink around with all the minutia in su=\r\npporting a development environment.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nJim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.=\r\n\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kenneth Stanley \n  To: neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, June 07, 2004 6:13 PM\n  Subject: [neat] Re: Bl=\r\noat\n\n\n  Derek and Philip (and others who may have used a similar \n  interpr=\r\netation),\n\n  First, anyone else who had this confusion please let me know. =\r\n (I&#39;m \n  wondering how widespread it is.)\n\n  It is probably inevitable that=\r\n in a fairly large and complicated \n  system people will interpret certain =\r\nthings that seem clear to each \n  individual in different ways.  Unfortunat=\r\nely this seems to be the \n  case here, and I&#39;m sorry about the confusion.\n\n=\r\n  Ultimately, the difference between our two systems is just in the \n  rate=\r\n of adding links and nodes.  That rate is indeed quite different \n  (unless=\r\n you made yours extremely small), but otherwise, both systems \n  are still =\r\nNEAT, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s *that* surprising that your \n  system still wor=\r\nks...it&#39;s just pumping more structure in faster. \n  Most likely that&#39;s a li=\r\nability and so your current performance can \n  be even further improved.  N=\r\not necessarily bad news!\n\n  Unfortunately, it may explain why you found ble=\r\nnded runs to be such \n  an advantage, so it may mean further experiments ar=\r\ne needed.  Not \n  terrible news, though!  It&#39;s still interesting to note th=\r\nat high \n  rates of structure adding combined with high rates of deletion \n=\r\n  together may come out fairly effective.  However, what we now need \n  to =\r\nknow is whether your blending was just compensating for an overly \n  aggres=\r\nsive structure building policy, or whether your results \n  generalize.\n\n  A=\r\ns for the points of ambiguity...\n\n  Our EC paper stated:\n\n  &quot;In smaller pop=\r\nulations, the probability of adding a new node was \n  0.03 and the probabil=\r\nity of a new link mutation was 0.05. In the \n  larger population, the proba=\r\nbility of adding a new link was 0.3.&quot;\n\n  Note that this does not use the te=\r\nrm &quot;mutation rate,&quot; which you and \n  Derek were thinking of.  Note &quot;the pro=\r\nbability of adding a link&quot; \n  would be a strange way to phrase something th=\r\nat could add more than \n  one link.\n\n  When we talked about weight mutation=\r\n, we said:\n\n  &quot;There was an 80% chance of a genome having its connection we=\r\nights \n  mutated, in which case each weight had a 90% chance of being \n  un=\r\niformly perturbed and a 10% chance of being assigned a new random \n  value.=\r\n&quot;\n\n  Note again, no use of the ambiguous term &quot;mutation rate.&quot;  It says \n  =\r\nthere is an 80% chance of any genome having its links mutated.\n\n  Neverthel=\r\ness, ambiguity is in the eye of the beholder, and if it was \n  ambiguous to=\r\n you, then that&#39;s how it is.   But I am glad now to have \n  gotten to the b=\r\nottom of this.\n\n  As for the final question of whether you can add a link a=\r\nnd a node \n  at the same time, in my system you can&#39;t.  However, it would h=\r\nardly \n  make a difference.  What makes a difference is adding big globs of=\r\n \n  structure all at once vs. adding just one or on a rare occasion two \n  =\r\npieces.\n\n  ken\n\n  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Philip Tucker&quot; &lt;ptucker@g..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; Ah, we may have hit on a reason for some of our disagreemen=\r\nts!  \n  The \n  &gt; &gt; add_connection mutation rate is the probability that an =\r\n\n  *individual \n  &gt; &gt; genome* might have a single connection added.  In oth=\r\ner words, \n  in a \n  &gt; &gt; population of 100 individuals and a 0.02 rate, you=\r\n would expect \n  to \n  &gt; &gt; get on average 2 new connections over the entire=\r\n population in a \n  &gt; &gt; single generation.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Wow.  Yeah, that&#39;s a pr=\r\netty friggin&#39; big difference!  Weird that \n  our \n  &gt; results were as simil=\r\nar as they were give such a significant \n  &gt; discrpency in implementation. =\r\n Of course, doing it our way with \n  lower \n  &gt; topological mutation rates =\r\nmight wind up doing about the same \n  thing \n  &gt; anyway.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; So, let m=\r\ne make sure I have this clear: &quot;mutation rate&quot; means \n  &gt; something differe=\r\nnt in the context of topological mutations from \n  &gt; weigth mutations, righ=\r\nt?  Weight mutation rate is the percentage \n  of \n  &gt; connection *genes* th=\r\nat will have their weights tweaked.  Add \n  &gt; connection and add neuron rat=\r\nes are the percentage of \n  *chromosomes* \n  &gt; that will be modified.\n  &gt; \n=\r\n  &gt; I guess we were biologically inspired in our interpretation.  \n  &gt; Typi=\r\ncally, a mutation rate is a function of the genetic material, \n  &gt; right?  =\r\nA given gene has a certain chance of being modified each \n  &gt; generation.  =\r\nAnd there&#39;s nothing stopping 2 mutations from \n  occurring \n  &gt; in the same=\r\n individual.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; In addition, it is also true that only one add conn=\r\nection \n  mutation \n  &gt; &gt; can happen to a single individual in a generation=\r\n.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Can both happen; i.e., can a chromosome have 1 connection and 1 =\r\n\n  node \n  &gt; added in the same generation?  If so, can the node be added on=\r\n the \n  &gt; new connection, or a connection be added to the new node?\n  &gt; \n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; It seems to me that your interpetation was that the mutation rate\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n is on a &quot;per empty slot&quot; basis.  That&#39;s radically different than \n  my \n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; NEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at\n  &gt; &gt; all..=\r\n.is that how ANJI has been working?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Indeed it is.

In the \n  &lt;BR&gt;larger population, the probability of adding a new lin=\r\nk was \n  0.3.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Note that this does not use the term &quot;mutation rate,&quot;=\r\n which you \n  and &lt;BR&gt;Derek were thinking of.&nbsp; Note &quot;the probability o=\r\nf adding a link&quot; \n  &lt;BR&gt;would be a strange way to phrase something that cou=\r\nld add more than \n  &lt;BR&gt;one link.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When we talked about weight mutati=\r\non, we \n  said:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;There was an 80% chance of a genome having its conn=\r\nection \n  weights &lt;BR&gt;mutated, in which case each weight had a 90% chance o=\r\nf being \n  &lt;BR&gt;uniformly perturbed and a 10% chance of being assigned a new=\r\n random \n  &lt;BR&gt;value.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Note again, no use of the ambiguous term &quot;mut=\r\nation \n  rate.&quot;&nbsp; It says &lt;BR&gt;there is an 80% chance of any genome havi=\r\nng its links \n  mutated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nevertheless, ambiguity is in the eye of th=\r\ne beholder, and if \n  it was &lt;BR&gt;ambiguous to you, then that&#39;s how it is.&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; But I am glad \n  now to have &lt;BR&gt;gotten to the bottom of this.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for the final question \n  of whether you can add a link and a node=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;at the same time, in my system \n  you can&#39;t.&nbsp; However, it would h=\r\nardly &lt;BR&gt;make a difference.&nbsp; What \n  makes a difference is adding big=\r\n globs of &lt;BR&gt;structure all at once vs. adding \n  just one or on a rare occ=\r\nasion two &lt;BR&gt;pieces.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ken&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In \n  neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ph=\r\nilip Tucker&quot; &lt;ptucker@g...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  Ah, we may have hi=\r\nt on a reason for some of our disagreements!&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n add_connection mutation rate is the probability that an \n  &lt;BR&gt;*individual=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; genome* might have a single connection \n  added.&nbsp; In ot=\r\nher words, &lt;BR&gt;in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; population of 100 \n  individuals and a 0.=\r\n02 rate, you would expect &lt;BR&gt;to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; get on \n  average 2 new conn=\r\nections over the entire population in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; single \n  generation.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Wow.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#39;s a pretty friggin&#39; big \n  differen=\r\nce!&nbsp; Weird that &lt;BR&gt;our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; results were as similar as they \n  we=\r\nre give such a significant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; discrpency in implementation.&nbsp; Of =\r\n\n  course, doing it our way with &lt;BR&gt;lower &lt;BR&gt;&gt; topological mutation ra=\r\ntes \n  might wind up doing about the same &lt;BR&gt;thing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; anyway.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  So, let me make sure I have this clear: &quot;mutation rate&quot; means=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  something different in the context of topological mutations fr=\r\nom &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  weigth mutations, right?&nbsp; Weight mutation rate is the p=\r\nercentage &lt;BR&gt;of \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; connection *genes* that will have their weight=\r\ns tweaked.&nbsp; Add \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; connection and add neuron rates are the pe=\r\nrcentage of \n  &lt;BR&gt;*chromosomes* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that will be modified.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; I guess we \n  were biologically inspired in our interpretation.&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Typically, a \n  mutation rate is a function of the genetic mater=\r\nial, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; right?&nbsp; A \n  given gene has a certain chance of being mo=\r\ndified each &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  generation.&nbsp; And there&#39;s nothing stopping 2 mu=\r\ntations from &lt;BR&gt;occurring \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the same individual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; In addition, it is also \n  true that only one add connection &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nmutation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can happen to a \n  single individual in a generation=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can both happen; i.e., can \n  a chromosome have 1 connec=\r\ntion and 1 &lt;BR&gt;node &lt;BR&gt;&gt; added in the same \n  generation?&nbsp; If so, =\r\ncan the node be added on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new connection, \n  or a connection be=\r\n added to the new node?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems to me \n  that your i=\r\nnterpetation was that the mutation rate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is on a &quot;per \n  empty =\r\nslot&quot; basis.&nbsp; That&#39;s radically different than &lt;BR&gt;my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  =\r\nNEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n =\r\n all...is that how ANJI has been working?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Indeed it is.&nb=\r\nsp; \n  Time for me to go change the API doc ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; - \n  Phili=\r\np&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00BA_01C44CC0.060D1910--\r\n\n"}}
