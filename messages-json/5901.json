But my point is more =\r\nabout how a regularity (or irregularity) was *preserved* as opposed to how =\r\nit was *achieved*.  No matter how a particular organizational principle com=\r\nes about (now I&#39;m being more careful to avoid suggesting it&#39;s more or less =\r\nregular than before), the problem is that there is no reason for evolution =\r\nto reward and thereby preserve it in an objective setting when it&#39;s first d=\r\niscovered.  So whether or not bilateral symmetry comes from a reduction in =\r\nregularity or an increase in regularity, if the first bilaterally symmetric=\r\n individual does not look very close to the final objective (and it most li=\r\nkely does not) then it is likely to be selected out and lost by an objectiv=\r\ne-driven search.\n\nYou also make an interesting point in the sense that conc=\r\nentrating too much on the word &quot;symmetry&quot; in discussing these matters misse=\r\ns the fact that there is a risk of losing conventions of any type, whether =\r\nor not they increase regularity.  In fact, the change from radial symmetry =\r\nto bilateral symmetry is not simply a story of reduced organization because=\r\n the new asymmetric axis in bilaterally symmetric organisms itself is still=\r\n organized in the sense that it represents a gradient from head to tail.  T=\r\nhat gradient is a fundamental organizing principle as much as the bilateral=\r\n symmetry.  The word &quot;irregular&quot; can cause us to forget how important such =\r\nnon-symmetric principles are in organizing body plans as well.\n\nken\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;martin_pyka&quot; &lt;martin.pyka@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In n=\r\non-objective search, on the other hand, often a regularity is preserved bec=\r\nause it offers something fundamentally new (i.e. neither good nor bad) and =\r\nthen later becomes the basis for endless elaboration (like bilateral symmet=\r\nry).  You can&#39;t establish something like symmetry early in an objective sea=\r\nrch because symmetry on its own looks nothing like the final objective, eve=\r\nn if theoretically it would be helpful in principle in finding it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlthough I generally agree with this, I am wondering whether bilateral symme=\r\ntry is an appropriate example for it. For example, when evolution starts wi=\r\nth spherical symmetry, radial and bilateral symmetry more represent a reduc=\r\ntion of regularity. From this perspective evolutionary development *is* abo=\r\nut adding irregularity to patterns rather than establishing regularity?!\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
