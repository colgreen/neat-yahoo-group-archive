Just playing with this as an inital test of sharpneat 2&#39;s\nhyperneat support. It takes a while to solve, and so, I provided a\nsubstrate connection length input to the CPPN as explained in the\nrelevant paper. Result? Problem solved perfectly by one of the initial\ngenomes!\n\nI have to say that this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected, I figured it was\ngoing to be a much simpler task.\n\nThis leads me back to a thought that&#39;s been rattling around my head\nfor some years now, which is that although traditional ANNs with\nsigmoid activation function /can/ approximate any function, in reality\nthey&#39;re pretty bad at comparison and multiplication - the two major\noperations required to calculate length (euclidean distance between\ntwo points).\n\nOf course none of this invalidates the observation that hyperneat\nhandles large arrays of geometrically arranged input and output nodes\nfar better than NEAT. On the contrary, it very much reinforces that\nnotion.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
