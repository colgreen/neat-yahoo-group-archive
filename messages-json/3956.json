It would be interesting to see if the z approach does better than\nthe two output approach, and what would happen if direct links and\nrecurrence were allowed.\n\nHave you guys done any tests of the HyperNEAT evaluator vs. Blondie24? How\nabout vs. leading checkers AI programs?  I just browsed around and could not\n(quickly) find out if xCheckers uses what would be considered a leading edge\nboard evaluator. \n\nYou mention below that it is difficult to evaluate your program against\nhuman players, but why not start by evaluating them against leading AI\ncheckers programs? I know this comparison was not necessary for the point\nyou were getting at in this paper, but it would be very interesting to know\nhow the HyperNEAT evaluator fares against the current best AI evaluators. I\nam not sure what constitutes an exhaustive comparison between two checkers\nevaluators (all possible opening move sets?), but I gathered from your paper\nthat the test you conducted was more narrow than what I imagine would be\ninvolved in a true head to head comparison of evaluators.\n\nFinally, while it is cool that your program beats you guys at checkers, it\nmight not solely be because of the HyperNEAT-driven AI. The program is also\nusing alpha-beta and the like. I&#39;ll bet a rather poor position evaluator\nplus Alpha-Beta with a decent amount of lookahead could beat me at checkers,\neven if I was better at evaluating board positions on average.\n\nThanks again, it was a very enjoyable read. I also think it is great that\nyou guys have decided to try to reposition this stuff to make inroads back\ninto mainstream AI.\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Jason Gauci &lt;jgmath2000@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2008 17:40:00 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New HyperNEAT Paper in the Domain of Checkers\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Stephen,\n&gt; \n&gt; Great questions!  We&#39;ll have to think about some of them for awhile\n&gt; but here&#39;s a few answers:\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I chose to use a separate output for each connection\n&gt; layer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is because I wanted to\n&gt; separate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D CPPN method,\n&gt; then the two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;z&#39;.\n&gt; Because I&#39;m only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\n&gt; layer did some unique processing.  If there was only one output, it\n&gt; would be harder for the connection layers to distinguish themselves as\n&gt; they would be too dependent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs are\n&gt; not used and the two layers are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\n&gt; empirical tests on which method is better so I do not have any\n&gt; evidence to back my claim, but it&#39;s my intuition.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents other than Xcheckers.  I have\n&gt; had my friends and people in the lab play against the HyperNEAT\n&gt; opponent and it is definitely better than all of us :-).  I would like\n&gt; to release a binary version so people can play the opponents at\n&gt; different generations and see the change in performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; One active area of interest is to figure out how good a HyperNEAT\n&gt; player is in a global sense.  In Chellapilla & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\n&gt; played human opponents in checkers on MSN Gaming Zone online and got\n&gt; an expert rating on that game server.  The problem with this is that\n&gt; it is very time consuming to play games by hand. It would not be\n&gt; feasible for me to test several individuals in this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have experimented with coevolution, but I need to solve the\n&gt; aforementioned problem before I can say anything about the performance\n&gt; of the evolved individuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with you new results with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt;&gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural to me?\n&gt;&gt; * Was more than one CPPN configuration tried?
