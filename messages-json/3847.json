All\n&gt;  libraries I found so far either assume layered networks or only feed-\n&gt;  forward ones.. I am confused. Is there any source code that might help\n&gt;  me? Any back-prop implementation that can work on NEAT networks such\n&gt;  that it can easily be integrated. Or maybe some papers on the topic?\n&gt;  I appreciate any help from the community.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
