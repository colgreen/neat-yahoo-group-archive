In Golem the goal is to ambulate and cover distance.  That&#39;s\n&gt; a pretty specific goal set up by an experimenter .  I don&#39;t see how it\n&gt; differs from any other TBE-type goal?  Or do you mean to say that all\n&gt; evolution is in effect TBE?\n\n\nI guess I was trying to point out that it is probably more of a continuous\nspectrum than a binary attribute. Nature and good alife is one end of the\nspectrum, Golem is somewhere in the middle, and matching a complex picture\npixel for pixel is on the other end.\n\nSo, if the problems you outline with TBE are right (and I think many of them\nare), then it might make sense to say something like &quot;the more you move away\nfrom TBE, the less you will have these problems.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
