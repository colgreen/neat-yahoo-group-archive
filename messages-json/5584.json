It does sound like you ha=\r\nve a workable idea for integrating novelty search into competitive coevolut=\r\nion.  Of course, I&#39;d be particularly careful on the way behavior is measure=\r\nd because it is the key to identifying novelty.  One tip is to make sure yo=\r\nu don&#39;t only include raw outputs or raw inputs as part of the behavior char=\r\nacterization, because what matters most is what an agent actually does, as =\r\nopposed to what it wants to do.  For example, if an agent spend 100 timeste=\r\nps trying to run through a wall, we would want to characterize its behavior=\r\n as being stalled rather than as moving forward.\n\nAlso, one of the big chal=\r\nlenges in competitive coevolution (and alife in general) is to create a dom=\r\nain that is open-ended enough to support something interesting arising.  Th=\r\ne robot duel was my attempt to do that, but perhaps it could be enhanced to=\r\n support more open-endedness, though I don&#39;t know how off-hand.  But the ri=\r\nsk you always have in these domains is that even if you have a fantastic al=\r\ngorithmic setup that in principle could discover amazing behaviors, it is a=\r\nlways possible that the domain itself only supports a limited range of stra=\r\ntegies.  For example, it is hard to imagine strategies in the robot duel th=\r\nat go very far beyond the one shown here: \n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/=\r\nnn/pages/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif  \n\nIn any case, overall I think you=\r\nr idea can make a good experiment.  You mention that you need to write some=\r\nthing up for graduation - what degree are you working on?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I think I get what you&#39;re saying about categorizing parasites (or, thei=\r\nr\n&gt; behavior) into classes. I&#39;m thinking in particular about the robot duel=\r\n from\n&gt; your paper &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary Complexi=\r\n=EF=AC=81cation&quot;.\n&gt; Instead of categorizing the parasite behavior, I was th=\r\ninking break out\n&gt; meaningful classifications of sensor inputs. Classificat=\r\nion of behavior of\n&gt; the host would based on it&#39;s movement vector and speed=\r\n (moving away,\n&gt; towards, fast/slow, going after food, etc). Of course, thi=\r\ns is a dynamic\n&gt; environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; So for each time the classification of i=\r\nnputs changes, the behavior of the\n&gt; host is classified and checked for nov=\r\nelty. These individual novelty\n&gt; measurements are all added up at the end o=\r\nf the run, and divided by the\n&gt; number of class of input changes to normali=\r\nze things.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still spit-balling here.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as making it real &quot;com=\r\npetitive coevolution&quot;, of course a record of\n&gt; who won is essentially a fit=\r\nness measure, so there&#39;d have to be a hybrid\n&gt; novelty/fitness in there som=\r\newhere, because measuring who won is not a\n&gt; novelty measure.\n&gt; \n&gt; I still =\r\nthink novelty search brings a lot of benefits to the table. My\n&gt; current sp=\r\nit-ball is that there is an added parameter for population growth\n&gt; allowan=\r\nce for the host group. Instead of a fitness function, a novelty\n&gt; metric is=\r\n used (assuming one can be made, obviously that&#39;s tricky). The host\n&gt; popul=\r\nation remains the hosts until their population has grown the specified\n&gt; am=\r\nount. I&#39;m hoping that will encourage a nice broad range of strategies to\n&gt; =\r\nbe evaluated. Once that max population % has been hit, a &quot;cataclysmic event=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; occurs (cataclysm-neat? rapture-neat? Harold Camping-neat?)  to wipe ou=\r\nt the\n&gt; extra population, and only the best performing hosts are kept, whic=\r\nh would\n&gt; be how it integrates into the competition side of things. .\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThen the parasites and hosts flip. Essentially novelty is used to explore\n&gt;=\r\n differing behaviors up until the cataclysmic event, then performance is us=\r\ned\n&gt; to prune the population back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but if I =\r\ncan\n&gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gonna give it a wh=\r\nirl.\n&gt; Gotta write up something interesting to graduate I suppose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any=\r\n thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Drew\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, May 28, 201=\r\n1 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I j=\r\nust wanted to echo that I think combining novelty search with\n&gt; &gt; interacti=\r\non between evolving agents is very interesting, if only we can find\n&gt; &gt; a w=\r\nay to characterize behavior generally enough to overcome the inherent\n&gt; &gt; n=\r\noisiness of interaction. Of course, you have clearly been thinking about\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; that, and it may be possible to make progress following your line of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nreasoning. Maybe if parasites could be categorized into classes and novelty=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; was a concatenation of behaviors across all known classes it could mak=\r\ne more\n&gt; &gt; sense of the behavior space than just a raw behavior characteriz=\r\nation. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; sure there are many other ways to think about it too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; One other thing to note is that it may not really be &quot;competitive&quot;\n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nevolution per se if you implemented such an experiment.
