I also observed poor results, \nalthough \n&gt; the OCR domain has a lot more input and output nodes than your \ndigital \n&gt; display domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I raised a number of issues in the write-up which I can&#39;t \nreally \n&gt; do justice here so I would recommend you have a read and see what \nyou \n&gt; think. From my experiments with Simple-OCR and knowing that your \ndigital \n&gt; display domain problem has far fewer inputs and ouptuts, I am \nfairly \n&gt; confident that this could be solved in SharpNEAT in it&#39;s current \nstate. \n&gt; I am willing to implement it and make another release if there are \nany \n&gt; doubters :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh the URL for the write-up is \nwww.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/phasedsearch.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
