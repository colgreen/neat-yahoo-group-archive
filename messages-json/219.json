Although \none \n&gt; point I would like to make is that this only works for direct \nencoding \n&gt; schemes, NEAT is ok because a NEAT chromosome is a direct encoding \nof a \n&gt; NN. If you start to consider indirect encoding (as in biology) then \nyou \n&gt; find that small changes in the genetic make up can result in large \n&gt; changes in the phenotype. The solution is to compare phenotypes - \nwhich \n&gt; is something I didn&#39;t take into a account in my own code which IS \ndoes \n&gt; use indirect encoding.\n\nThat&#39;s a good point.  In the real world, chromosomes don&#39;t have sex, \norganisms do.  So the speciation mechanism for an indirect encoding \nscheme would probably need to base speciation on phenotype.\n\n&gt; &gt;That is, in the second case, a given species could\n&gt; &gt;have much more or much less topological difference\n&gt; &gt;between its individuals.  This approach seems less\n&gt; &gt;desirable to me, since it seems less\n&gt; &gt;biologically-inspired.  You&#39;re enforcing an arbitrary\n&gt; &gt;division of the population, rather than defining\n&gt; &gt;species primarily by a distance function.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Agreed.\n\nWell, I say it seems that way, though I haven&#39;t tested any of this \nexperimentally.\n\nDoes anyone else here have any thoughts on this?\n\n&gt; After reading this and having a think I do agree with you on this. \nSo \n&gt; going back to your original email, it&#39;s interesting that Ken used a \n&gt; fixed N=1, or was this because the chromosome never became larger \nthan \n&gt; 20 in length? \n\nRight.  I&#39;m especially interested to hear from those who&#39;ve actually \nimplemented their own version of NEAT and experimented with it.\n\nMat Buckland implemented NEAT with a minesweeper domain.  The \nbook &quot;AI Techniques for Game Programming&quot; restates the speciation \nfunction, and the compatibility threshold, exactly as it is in Ken&#39;s \npaper(s).  Mat, do chromosomes grow larger than 20 genes in a typical \nminesweeper experiment?  If so, does your code adjust the \ncompatibility threshold?\n\nJoseph Reisinger experimented with Tic-Tac-Toe and a modular version \nof NEAT.  Did you normalize for chromosome size in your experiments, \nJoseph?  Or was N always set to 1 and the compatibility threshold \nvalue always set to either 3.0 or 4.0?\n\nAnd Ken...in some of your other experiments, especially in the robot \ncontrol domains, chromosomes grew to lengths greater than 20, didn&#39;t \nthey?  Did you ever normalize for chromosome length in any \nexperiments, or was N always equal to 1?  If so, wouldn&#39;t populations \nwith larger chromosomes tend to have a much greater increase in the \nnumber of species?  Any thoughts on how the number of species affects \nthe effectiveness of the algorithm?\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
