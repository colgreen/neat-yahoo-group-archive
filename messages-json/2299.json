That is, it &#39;learns&#39; the rules, it develops a strategy,\n&gt;&gt;and some of what is &#39;learned&#39; in one game is transferrable to another\n&gt;&gt;game.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Or is that not the ultimate goal?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well the *ultimate* goal is a race of sentient machines that usurp and\n&gt;enslave us, but in a nice sort of way. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPerhaps then we should work on a race of *super* sentient machines to \ndefeat these other machines and... oh no, hold on. As is oft said on \nslashdot, I for one welcome our new [insert technology under discussion] \noverlords.\n\n&gt;Seriously, a very general game playing system that is able to be\n&gt;taught the rules of nearly any board game and learn strategies through\n&gt;incremental play...now *that* I do think is currently beyond the state\n&gt;of the art.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis requires understanding of the games being played, which in turn \nrequires sentience, err probably, I think. Or do I mean conciousness? On \nthe other hand if you have super fast CPU&#39;s available that can play all \n[board] games by employing minimax or whatever then you don&#39;t need to \nunderstand the game and you don&#39;t have to evaulate your opponent &#39;on the \nfly&#39;. In fact all games then become pointless as the outcome is always \npredetermined. Of course some games (e.g. Go) have such a large number \nof possible paths that must be evaluated that it&#39;s unlikely any computer \nwould ever be able to play in such a deterministic way.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
