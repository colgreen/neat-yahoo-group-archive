My  control experiment (i.e. the one I t=\r\nhink should definitely give a solution) is a re-implementation of the food =\r\nforaging problem.  The fitness function is the same.  So doing nothing nets=\r\n a fitness of 32, and max fitness is 60.  Instead what Im seeing is a small=\r\n improvement to average best fitness of about 35, and then almost every gen=\r\neration I have a couple outliers with a fitness around 40-45.  \n\nThis is al=\r\nl using rtNeat.\n\nSo, my question is whether or not I likely have some param=\r\neters tuned badly (not unlikely) and if so, what the likely culprits would =\r\nbe.  I&#39;ve tweaked those several times to no avail.  Or,  is it likely just =\r\nmy implementation of the food foraging world? \n\nMark Ahlstrom\n\n\n"}}
