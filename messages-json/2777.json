I was pleasantly surprised \nto see a significant performance improvement under .Net 2.0 independent \nof the new hardware.\n\nIf we take the NextDouble() routine - which is the one most heavily used \n- running on .Net 2.0 on the new hardware the performance is now 185m \ncalls/sec on one core, so lets say roughly 370m calls/sec overall. This \ncompares to just 87m*2=174m for System.Random (the built in random \nnumber generator class). The old figures for an Athlon 2400+ on .Net 1.1 \nare 87m and 50m calls/sec.\n\nOverall improvement in performance then, taking into account all \nfactors, has gone from 50m to 370m calls/sec or 7.4x faster. Which is \nfairly impressive.\n\nI should point out that the new hardware is an Intel Core 2 Duo E660 \n2.4Ghz overclocked to 3.11Ghz. Despite overclocking the CPU temp is \nfairly low at about 48C and overall PC power consumption is about 120W \nat 100% CPU (both cores). And finally SiSoft Sandra reports \n28,888MIPS/19,654MFlops versus 6,603MIPS/3357MFlops for my old workhorse \nAthlon 2800 shuttle PC, so overall a pretty handy little system if \nyou&#39;re looking for more CPU power for your NEAT experiments.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
