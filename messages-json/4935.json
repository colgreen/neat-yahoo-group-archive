In f=\r\nact, most of my recent experiments are run on Linux clusters, so breaking M=\r\nono compatibility isn&#39;t really an option (although with the new features in=\r\n .NET 4.0, it is tempting).  Most of the time I compile in Windows and run =\r\nin Linux, but compiling and running HyperSharpNEAT in Linux shouldn&#39;t be to=\r\no hard.  With Ubuntu 9.10 you should be able to just do the following:\n\n1. =\r\n Install the latest Mono runtime and MonoDevelop from the package manger.\n\n=\r\n2.  Run MonoDevelop and choose to open the HyperSharpNEAT.sln file in the s=\r\nrc directory.\n\n3.  The solution should now be imported, and you should be a=\r\nble to build and run the projects.  For example you can right click the Ski=\r\nrmishVisualization project and select &quot;Set as startup project&quot; then right c=\r\nlick the solution and click &quot;Run item&quot; and it should pop up a new window wi=\r\nth a zero in the upper left corner.\n\nIf you want to do things strictly from=\r\n from the command line, I don&#39;t have much experience there, but I can look =\r\ninto it for you.  Thanks for pointing out that my current Linux build instr=\r\nuctions are somewhat lacking, I&#39;ll add this more detailed set to the next r=\r\nelease. If you have any problems, don&#39;t hesitate to email me.\n\nThanks,\nDavi=\r\nd D&#39;Ambrosio\nddambro@...\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Thomas John=\r\nson &lt;thomas.j.johnson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As long as you guys are talking about=\r\n integrating new code, can I request\n&gt; that someone includes a step-by-step=\r\n of how to build on a modern Linux\n&gt; system with mono? A lot of scientific =\r\ncomputing takes place on Linux these\n&gt; days, but the HyperNEAT C++ code is =\r\nvery difficult to build due to the way\n&gt; the CMake configuration is set up =\r\nand the weird dependencies (TinyXMLDLL?!).\n&gt; The HyperSharpNEAT code is muc=\r\nh better, but it&#39;s not clear to me how to\n&gt; build it on Linux.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun,=\r\n Nov 29, 2009 at 7:18 AM, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yeh the SN2 code is essentially a complete re-write with a p=\r\nrimary\n&gt; &gt; goal being a more flexible, general-purpose EC framework. There =\r\nwere\n&gt; &gt; perhaps some forgotten corners in SN1 and this is addressed by the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; re-write. Now that the core code is settled I&#39;ve been re-reviewing it\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; all as a whole before progressing further, fixing the odd bug,\n&gt; &gt; refa=\r\nctoring a few sections that were tagged with FIXMEs, TODOs, and\n&gt; &gt; ENHANCE=\r\nMENTs (some of these remain as they are low priority) and\n&gt; &gt; ensuring the =\r\ncomments (XML and in-line) are meaningful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Performance in SN1 was a=\r\n primary design goal and is pretty good I\n&gt; &gt; think. I ran it through a pro=\r\nfiler and homed in and rewrote some of\n&gt; &gt; the less efficient sections - ne=\r\nural net decoding and activation being\n&gt; &gt; the main areas I can recall, oh =\r\nand genome comparison was sped up 100x\n&gt; &gt; or so at one point. SN2 hasn&#39;t b=\r\neen through a profiler yet but I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been writing pretty tight code IMO =\r\nand taking lessons and code from\n&gt; &gt; SN1. Even so it always pays to run cod=\r\ne through a profiler in case\n&gt; &gt; something has been missed or some unintend=\r\ned things are going on - new\n&gt; &gt; thinsg like k-means algorithm migth need e=\r\nxtra work (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; multithreading).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There probably are a few point=\r\ns where events would make sense and this\n&gt; &gt; is something that can be layer=\r\ned on now that the core code is settled,\n&gt; &gt; however, events in high freque=\r\nncy code such as mutations could hit\n&gt; &gt; performance so care should be take=\r\nn. My main aim here is to get the\n&gt; &gt; core stuff right, others can then tak=\r\ne the code and bend it to their\n&gt; &gt; particular needs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FxCop I have =\r\nused briefly. IMO the default checks aren&#39;t quite aligned\n&gt; &gt; to what I&#39;m t=\r\nrying to achieve, that is, I&#39;m not aiming for a\n&gt; &gt; fixed/pre-compiled API =\r\nfor commercial use by the masses. There&#39;s also\n&gt; &gt; some degree of personal =\r\nopinion on what checks to make - I personally\n&gt; &gt; disagree with /some/ of t=\r\nhe default checks, but its worth taking a\n&gt; &gt; fresh look at and maybe tweak=\r\ning some of the rules.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you have any more thoughts on the SN2 cod=\r\ne then let me know, IMO\n&gt; &gt; releasing source code into the wild is how good=\r\n quality code gets\n&gt; &gt; written, the more pairs of eyes the better, and at t=\r\nhe end of the day\n&gt; &gt; if people disagree strongly with the direction it&#39;s g=\r\noing then it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; open source.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope that all makes sense,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nColin\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
