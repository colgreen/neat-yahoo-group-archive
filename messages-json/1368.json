I think it &#39;minimized error&#39; by just always trying to \nreturn a value that adds up to zero.\n\n&gt;\te.g. (if I remember your plan correctly) you supply top-left and\n&gt;bottom-right coords for a rectangular area of the 9x9 input image, and you\n&gt;have produced a network which correctly answers with the average of that\n&gt;part of the image.\n\nThat is the goal, but it has not been achieved yet, because of that shortcut \nthat the network keeps taking.\n\n&gt;\tIf this is so, then that alone is very interesting, because to do that you\n&gt;must have achieved some sort of 2D multiplexor (addressing circuitry) in\n&gt;your networks.  Even a 1D multiplexor is very interesting (e.g. a network\n&gt;which, given one input between 0 and 1, selects one of N other inputs as\n&gt;the output [N being fixed and moderately large]).  A 2D multiplexor can be\n&gt;built from N+1 1D multiplexors...\n&gt;\n&gt;\tIf, as I am just starting to suspect, you were just referring to one of\n&gt;your averaging tests (was (1,1) - (9,9) the first test applied) then I\n&gt;think you may have a point about the construction of your fitness\n&gt;function.  It may be that the step between your first and second fitness\n&gt;terms is too high.  Wasn&#39;t the first one average for the whole thing, needs\n&gt;no multiplexors and the second dome other average which does need\n&gt;multiplexing?  The system cannot evolve up one of these &quot;cliffs&quot; unless\n&gt;there are reasonably spaced steps all the way.\n\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;m suspecting has been hapening.\n\n&gt;If your second term cannot\n&gt;start giving a reward at all until after some multiplexor is achieved, then\n&gt;that&#39;s probably too high a probability barrier.  Maybe if your second\n&gt;fitness term involved only a lower limit and only on one axis and only\n&gt;between two ordinate values (e.g if it required distinguishing (1,1) -\n&gt;(9,9) and (5,1) - (9,9)).  Then your third step could do the same thing on\n&gt;the other axis....\n\nHmmm....\n\n\n\n"}}
