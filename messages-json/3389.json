Me and my friend anaylze and read some books and found =\r\n\nout that AFIS system actually have a weakness which is the lack of \nintero=\r\nperability. Therefore we decided to implement another AFIS \nsystem which gi=\r\nves high-level interoperability. We proposed this \ntopic as our undergradua=\r\nte program thesis. The new \narchitecture/system is called IDAFIS (Interoper=\r\nable Distributed \nAFIS). \n\nTo enhance &quot;interoperability&quot; we implement Web S=\r\nervice (this is \nalready finished). \nTo enhance &quot;distributed&quot; concept, we i=\r\nmplement a distributed \ndatabase. \nIn general, we have different servers. 1=\r\n server is the coordinator \nserver (this server is the front-end). This ser=\r\nver is responsible \nfor &quot;fingerprint classification&quot; (yes, I was talking ab=\r\nout whorl, \ntented arch, left loop, right loop, arch) and also for exposing=\r\n \nservice (to individual client/workstation or to another external AFIS \nsy=\r\nstem). When the classification result is out, then this server will \nsend t=\r\nhe result to the back-end (matching servers). We currently have \n5 matching=\r\n servers. These servers are responsible for the fingerprint \nidentification=\r\n/matching. \nThe idea is that we want to reduce bottleneck in the mathing se=\r\nrver \nand that&#39;s why we need the classification result to determine which \n=\r\nmatching server to go to (depending on the classification patterns, \nwe can=\r\n have as many matching servers as we want). \nNow everything is already in p=\r\nlace. What we need now is a software \nthat can help us do the fingerprint c=\r\nlassification (we dont have much \ntime to implement it ourselves).\n\nAnd tha=\r\nt was when I found ANJI. \n\nI have tried the qstart.html and have evolved ot=\r\nher property which is \nthe only one to have the fingerprint classification;=\r\n the \nTEST_EYE.PROPERTIES.\nAnd after that I tried to make a simple Java cod=\r\ne to use the \nclassifation function but the result I got from the function =\r\nis \nalways 0; meaning that somehow ANJI can not recognize the pattern... \nI=\r\n have tried several other way but can not make it right.... So \nDESPERATE a=\r\nlready now. T_T\nI have also emailed Mr.James and Mr.Tucker but there werent=\r\n any reply \nand luckily I stumbled upon this group.... \n\nMr.James, thank yo=\r\nu for your willingness to guide me through \n(although it might be a bothers=\r\nome task coz I am really really new to \nANJI).... \nCan you tell me, what sh=\r\nould I do? \nI think I have to train the neural network first but I really d=\r\non&#39;t \nknow where to start......\n\nAnd about that Activision.rar , I have jus=\r\nt downloaded it but still I \nhope I can use ANJI (because my own program is=\r\n .NET C#, quite close \nto JAVA). But, really, thank you for your suggestion=\r\n. I appreciate it \nvery much.\n\nCheers,\nAlfin Rusli\n\n\n"}}
