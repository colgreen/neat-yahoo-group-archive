This is\n&gt; often combined with what I term �more-thinking�: the\n&gt; hope that more speed, more connections, more rules,\n&gt; more memory, etc., will cause disappointing results\n&gt; to transform into success.  This can be seen in\n&gt; followers of:  genetic algorithm (GA), artificial\n&gt; neural net (ANN), Bayesian reasoning, case based\n&gt; reasoning, etc.  The typical cycle observed by those\n&gt; in this field for the last couple of decades is:\n&gt; first a great deal of excitement surrounding initial\n&gt; experiments, then grandiose projections of further\n&gt; success, subsequent lack of further progress, and\n&gt; eventual lapsing into the belief that more resources\n&gt; will lead to success.And this:The current GA work\n&gt; largely ignores the complexity\n&gt;  required of the environment and fitness test for a\n&gt; meaningful application of the method (of which there\n&gt; has not been one to date).  These constraints\n&gt; dictate the possible outcomes of any GA process,\n&gt; which is merely shifting the difficult work from\n&gt; designing the processing algorithms to designing the\n&gt; environment and fitness algorithms.  Natural\n&gt; evolutionary process occurs in our complete\n&gt; environment.  Similar results are not likely unless\n&gt; a similar environment is modeled.  This is truly\n&gt; wishful thinking\n&lt;snip&gt;\nIn terms of useful, practical applications, ANNs are\nthe most successful branch of AI, IMO.  When combined\nwith GA they have produced various examples of machine\nlearning that clearly demonstrate an ability of the\ncomputer to develop a skill that it has not been\ntaught.  So I claim that such programs exhibit genuine\nartificial intelligence, although not at a level\ncomparable to an animal brain.\n\nm\n\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
