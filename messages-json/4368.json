I heard the same thing about 1000...that in ecology if a\nspecies gets under 1000 they really start to worry about the population. I\ndon&#39;t think 30 will do it, but I confess I have not read any literature on\nit recently.\n\nAnyone else know?\n\nHas anyone done any studies with NEAT on pop size to see what the plot of\npop size vs. fitness looks like?\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2008 21:33:44 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Population sizes\n&gt; \n&gt; I typically use around 150, but set the target species to 5 using a\n&gt; changing compatability threshold.  This gives a rough specie size of\n&gt; 30. I read somewhere, and I can&#39;t remember where, some article about\n&gt; Highland cattle having to have a breeding population of 30 to make the\n&gt; gene pool viable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess its also a trade off with time also.  I am evolving Torcs\n&gt; controllers for Julain Togelius&#39; CIG 2008 commpetition.  Each\n&gt; controller takes around 4 seconds to evaluate.  If I had a pop of over\n&gt; 1000, it would take a long time for my poor laptop to finish each epoch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; What population sizes to you typically use for NEAT?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; We have done experiments in the Avida digital evolution platform that\n&gt;&gt; suggest that below 1,000 org drift starts to play a role. But a lot\n&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT papers use pop sizes of 150 or so. My guess is that the\n&gt; diversity\n&gt;&gt; preserving measure (&#39;speciation&#39;) and elitism help make smaller\n&gt; populations\n&gt;&gt; effective, but I was wondering if anyone has looked at the effects of\n&gt;&gt; population size in NEAT in an effort to provide a *rough but general*\n&gt;&gt; suggestion as to how big to make the populations in NEAT.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
