(Get it...NEAT\n&gt; &gt; without the N is EAT?..ok maybe we need a better acronym!)  Anyway, it\n&gt; &gt; is in principle a general topology building algorithm, so it could be\n&gt; &gt; interesting in other domains.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I was writing that modularity overview, I thought it might be nice to\n&gt; use something along the lines of NEAT to evolve genotype-phenotype maps.\n&gt; I cited a paper by Kvasnicka where they describe a method in which g-p\n&gt; maps evolve and modularize forming solutions to the NK function. It might\n&gt; beneat to utilize NEAT there (get it), although I&#39;m not sure what\n&gt; complexification in the g-p mapping would be defined as.\n&gt;\n&gt; In general using NEAT to evolve developmental systems would be\n&gt; interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; Joseph Reisinger\n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; neat-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
