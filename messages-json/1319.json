The size and position of the\ngenerated images also vary randomly, and a certain amount of pixelated\nnoise is added to the visual field as well.  The evolved networks were\napparently able to achieve 100% accuracy in discriminating between 10\nrandom triangles and 10 random squares.\n\nA link to the paper is here:\n\nhttp://asl.epfl.ch/member.php?SCIPER=111729\n\nAnd the name of it is &quot;Coevolution of active vision and feature\nselection&quot;.  A similar approach should be feasible for OCR or other\nimaging applications, I think.\n\n&gt; Have you decided on a resolution/size for your roving eye yet?\n\nWe&#39;re in the process of trying out different sized eyes (3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\n&gt; Therefore if I was going to try and construct a\n&gt; robust OCR network I think I&#39;d tend towards a roving eye with quite a\n&gt; high resolution(good enough to distinguish all of the characters anyhow)\n&gt; that could see whole characters at a time - but then could rove (move\n&gt; and zoom in/out) in order to frame characters within the eye&#39;s field of\n&gt; view. \n\nWell, the problem is that as the size of the eye increases, the size\nof the controlling ANN increases exponentially.  We may try some very\nlarge resolution eyes, though, to see if there&#39;s a measurable increase\nin performance.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
