However, my guess (without being 100% sure) is that it will not have an=\r\n overall harmful effect, so I don&#39;t believe it will cause a major problem w=\r\nith the algorithm.  However, my main question is what advantage you see for=\r\n giving nodes an (x,y) position?  I&#39;m not sure that it adds anything useful=\r\n, in particular the x component.  While I do see a role for the y position =\r\nin identifying recurrence, I am not sure the purpose of x?\n\nIn any case, I =\r\ndon&#39;t think the issue of whether adding a new node to a previously disabled=\r\n connection is going to have major consequences regardless of exactly how s=\r\nuch a situation is handled.  If you just end up doing nothing in that case =\r\n(and then perhaps trying a different mutation instead) the system should mo=\r\nre or less function without any major problems.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Phill&quot; &lt;feelipg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi guys - great group!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve s=\r\nearched the group in case these questions have already been answered - apol=\r\nogies if I missed them!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have added my own implementation of NEAT to =\r\nmy AL framework (I&#39;m a hobbyist) - like most people who implement their own=\r\n I&#39;ve done this so I can fully understand the algorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve read Ken=\r\n&#39;s paper, stepped through the original code and also read the chapter in AI=\r\n Techniques for Game Programming along with other articles/blogs etc.  My i=\r\nmplementation seems to run pretty well - although I haven&#39;t compared it&#39;s p=\r\nerformance (in terms of efficiency at finding solutions) to any other imple=\r\nmentations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although I treat both Node Genes and Connection Genes as i=\r\nnnovations for completeness - the system doesn&#39;t make use of the innovation=\r\n IDs for nodes - as to me an innovation resulting from a new node is the as=\r\nsociated connection innovations created.  Something makes me think this may=\r\n be a mistake and I&#39;m missing something.  However a Connection is defined b=\r\ny the two nodes it connects - and a Node is defined by it&#39;s position in a 0=\r\n-1 x 0-1 2d space.  This means that nodes are considered the same if they o=\r\nccupy the same space (x,y) - there is no concept of a unique NodeID.  When =\r\na Node is created during a mutation it is given the X,Y position half way b=\r\netween nodes defining the connection it is splitting.  It is possible that =\r\nin the future I will add other attributes to Nodes which will be taken into=\r\n account for Node equality too - but for now it is just X,Y.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I have=\r\n two questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)  When a Connection is disabled and then re-enabled =\r\nin the future from crossover - if this connection is subsequently split aga=\r\nin by a new node mutation - my implementation effectively looses this mutat=\r\nion because the new node and connections have already been added to the gen=\r\notype in the original mutation.  So all that happens is the connection is d=\r\nisabled - again.  Mat&#39;s book mentions this and implies that a new innovatio=\r\nn should be created - which i guess means the network ends up with an addit=\r\nional node?  I couldn&#39;t see where this explicitly happened in Ken&#39;s code.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 2) Is the approach of defining a node by its position flawed? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThanks for your help\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers\n&gt; Phill\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
