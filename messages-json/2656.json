There may be other \nways to do this with NEAT, while still=\r\n allowing NEAT to evolve the \nweights, but I don&#39;t know enough about the al=\r\ngorithms yet - I have to \nplay with it / read for a while.\n\nThanks Again!\nM=\r\nike \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; On 7/3/06, rognorak &lt;rognorak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Hello All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nstumbled onto NEAT a short time ago, and I think its an amazing\n&gt; &gt; piece o=\r\nf work - I&#39;m not an expert on ANN&#39;s / Genetic Algorithms by\n&gt; &gt; any means, =\r\nbut decided to play around with NEAT because I have \nalways\n&gt; &gt; been fascin=\r\nated by the subjects. I have a few questions that might\n&gt; &gt; help me get sta=\r\nrted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. I&#39;ve looked around for documentation for NEAT, I see a lot=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; papers on &quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-list.php&quot; but they all seem\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; very experiment specific. Is there a paper anywhere describing \nNEAT\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in general, and the theory behind how it works?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d recommend on=\r\ne of Ken&#39;s early publications where he first lays \nout the\n&gt; algorithm, lik=\r\ne this one:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=3DPu=\r\nbID&PubID\n(Pubs)=3D114\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin can answer all your questions about Sharp=\r\nNEAT. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.
