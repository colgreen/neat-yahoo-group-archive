Issues of general interest to neuroevolution are often\n&gt; discussed here and like you said, there are not many choices for\n&gt; forums to discuss these kinds of issues. (Note that Derek James is\n&gt; the moderator, but I am guessing he would agree with me.)\n\nYes, I would. :)\n\nThis topic is highly relevant to this forum.\n\n&gt; Another part of your discussion is the de-coupling of different neural\n&gt; modules. Such mixing and matching should be possible to some extent\n&gt; but I am not confident about it. I am more confident about the idea\n&gt; of a single holistic controller that encompasses both high and\n&gt; low-level thinking, but that cannot be easily broken into distinct\n&gt; pieces. While you mention that faculties of the brain are generally\n&gt; split into distinct modules, I believe that metaphor does not capture\n&gt; the full complexity of the dependence of modules upon each other. For\n&gt; example, while face processing may exist at one location, there are\n&gt; likely ancillary modules in other locations that also play a role in\n&gt; face processing that are less obvious yet that tightly coordinate with\n&gt; the main unit. Ripping out one unit and putting in another could\n&gt; disrupt such distributed processing.\n\nWell, there are different levels of modularity as well. A neuron is a\nreusable module. At a slightly higher level of description, the\ncortical minicolumn is another module. At a much higher level of\ndescription, the primary visual cortex is another.\n\nI think Ken is right about being mindful of interdependencies between\nmodules, but on the other hand I think it is probably the case that\nsome modules are more self-contained or reusable than others. Antoan\ntalks about reusability between individuals, but I think a more\npressing issue is figuring out how reusability of modules within an\nindividual might work.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
