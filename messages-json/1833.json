It =\r\nmeans\nthat a &quot;recurrent ANN&quot; with LSTM cells is able to create Loops,\ncount=\r\ners, variables, and conditional statements in a automatic way\n(through evol=\r\nution) and besides, it is possible to perform a partial\nderivate over the p=\r\narameter of the program (ANN Weights). That concept\nis useful if you want t=\r\no perform a &quot;gradient based method&quot; to find a\nsolution (See LSTM articles o=\r\nf Schmidhuber) as it is used in LSTM\noriginal learning algorithm.\n\n  I see =\r\nyour problem as Ken suggest, it is a &quot;sequential problem&quot; more\nthan a &quot;Spat=\r\nial Problem&quot;. So:\n-\tThe mapping happen through time when the net are able t=\r\no route the\ncard or piece value to the same &quot;memory cell&quot; independent of th=\r\ne\nposition. It is a time ordering maper \n-\tThe roving eye has the property =\r\nto get the useful events and values\nand discard others, and map that&#39;s even=\r\nts and values in a useful way.\nIt exploits space if it is useful. LSTM help=\r\ns to simplify the net as\nit is a real memory and not a looping circuit keep=\r\ning a value\n(...results of the experiment a have done).\n\n  When you speak a=\r\nbout &quot;data buses&quot; I image it trying to intercept a\ngroups of connections in=\r\n my brain=85no sense would be gotten. What I\nknow about brain in the visual=\r\n cortex is that the brain tries to\nseparate different features of an image =\r\nfrom the retina. So if you try\nto see one of this features Isolated nothing=\r\n would be gotten.\nTherefore, I think it is more plausible that a &quot;concept&quot; =\r\nis a &quot;brain\nstate&quot; of useful features in several memories of the nets, and\n=\r\ntherefore I think it is not  &quot;data&quot; being transported through a &quot;data\nbus&quot;.=\r\n \n\n  Example:\n      In the &quot;balancing pole control problem&quot; with input exch=\r\nange (It\nis the balancing pole problem but at the first of simulation we\nra=\r\nndomly exchange output control signals freezing that configuration\ntill the=\r\n end of that simulation), LSTM net is able to solve this problem.\n\n  In thi=\r\ns case, we have to modes of control, at the first of the\nsimulation, depend=\r\ning of the reaction of the system, the net see what\nkinds of two configurat=\r\nions are set (feature perception). That value\nis stored in a memory (probab=\r\nly some LSTM) and is kept through the\nrest of the simulation. That variable=\r\n is a sort of context variable.\nAccording to such context variable the syst=\r\nem behaves in one of the\ntwo modes. This is other case of symmetry where th=\r\nrough an initial\nperception the system remaps the output to use the same co=\r\nntrol part\nof the net. \n\nAgain, in this example, I see that it is an iterat=\r\nion between an\ninitial perception (remember the indifferent cards position =\r\nin the 4\ncards experiment), a context signal router (but not a formal bus) =\r\n and\na common net behaviour. \n\n\nGerm=E1n.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ia=\r\nn Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At 23:59 19/01/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Re=\r\n: egocentrism etc etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       This is an email that was=\r\n a long time coming and was far\ncloser to\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current topics on th=\r\ne group when I started it but...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       I have often wondered ho=\r\nw it is that real neural networks\n(e.g. me)\n&gt; &gt;manage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to exploit the =\r\n&quot;symmetry&quot; in situations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       e.g. in the example of the egoc=\r\nentric vs the\nglobal-centric eye,\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reason the former has a easi=\r\ner time of it is that it has some\n&gt; &gt;exploitation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the symmetries o=\r\nf the situation built into it.  That is the two\n&gt; &gt;specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; symmetrie=\r\ns:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) that the world retains the same nature as you translate t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt;viewpoint around\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) that the world retains the same nature as y=\r\nou rotate the view\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       (one could call these &quot;relativities&quot; &#39;=\r\ncos they are just\nlike the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; assumptions underpinning relativity...)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       The egocentric eye does not have full exploitation of them,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;however,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because for any situation that requires considering the =\r\nsituation at\n&gt; &gt;two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; points (or orientations) it is as badly off as th=\r\ne global viewpoint.\n&gt; &gt;  What\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this means is, if a piece of learning r=\r\nequires the consideration of\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properties of more than one &quot;posi=\r\ntion&quot; -- for example a position#1\n&gt; &gt;where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the prey could not see me,=\r\n and a position#2, where I could eat the\n&gt; &gt;prey --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then the eye can =\r\nmove to one of the positions, and get free\n&gt; &gt;&quot;relative&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; processing, =\r\nbut it has no way of performing any simultaneous\n&gt; &gt;calculations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at a=\r\n second position, except by evolving its own understanding of\n&gt; &gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsymmetry the hard way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Just to be devil&#39;s advoc=\r\nate, are you sure it couldn&#39;t all just be done\n&gt; &gt;by a roving eye with memo=\r\nry?  Maybe you never really do make\n&gt; &gt;simultaneous computations for this t=\r\nype of thing.  Maybe it&#39;s all\n&gt; &gt;sequential: look at the first perspective,=\r\n remember it, then transform\n&gt; &gt;the view and look at the second.  In memory=\r\n, perhaps both views are\n&gt; &gt;stored in some kind of normalized reference fra=\r\nme so they can be\n&gt; &gt;thought of at once.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely!  This is=\r\n a way in which it can be done, but the\ndiscussion was \n&gt; already long and =\r\ncomplex without adding yet another consideration.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, using memor=\r\ny in this way does not really alter the case,\nbecause \n&gt; for memory to do t=\r\nhis, especially in conjunction with a general purpose \n&gt; &quot;symmetrical trans=\r\nforms&quot; system, it would still need to somehow pass\ndata \n&gt; about between ge=\r\nneral (memory, transformation) and specific\n(prey-capture \n&gt; or chess) modu=\r\nles, again implying some sort of &quot;data bus&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not that I&#39;m saying I bel=\r\nieve that real brains work that way, I&#39;m just \n&gt; holding up a set of phenom=\r\nena:\n&gt; \n&gt;          - natural brains can learn a concept once and then apply=\r\n it\nas a \n&gt; module within multiple other learned behaviours\n&gt; \n&gt; Asking how=\r\n they do it and then holding this idea of &quot;data busses&quot;\npassing \n&gt; informat=\r\nion around between remote parts of the network as a working \n&gt; hypothesis. =\r\n Note however, that if you have a data bus then storing \n&gt; something in a m=\r\nemory module and pulling it back later is vary simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note also, howe=\r\nver, that for a data bus to work _at_all_ there needs\nto be \n&gt; a consistent=\r\n format for the data in both the sending and receiving \n&gt; modules.  Which i=\r\ns the competing conventions problem with a vengeance.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, it does=\r\n give us a different perspective of the definition of a \n&gt; module.  e.g. in=\r\n a really nicely OO sort of way a module is 50%\ndefined by \n&gt; the data form=\r\nats in its &quot;interface&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
