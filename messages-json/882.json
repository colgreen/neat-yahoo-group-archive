Suppose you had a domain (like \nthe one I&#39;m looking at) where network activation is very much the bulk of \nthe time.  Something like that would allow the experiment to run much \nfaster.\n\nOf course, a more realistic approach is to store information about how to \nrapidly calculate a network result along with the network.  Then, you can \nactivate the network as many times as you need to, optimally.  You simply \nhave an initial overhead cost of the analysis and &#39;strategy&#39; determination.\n\nNo, such a thing is definitely overkill for xor.  But for image enlargement, \nwhere analyzing the fitness of a single network may involve billions (yes, \nbillions) of activations, every little bit will help.\n\nAnybody read anything applicable to &#39;optimized neural network calculation&#39;?  \nMaybe have some suggestions on things to read up on?  :)\n\n&gt;From: Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt;\n\n&gt;That is true, and could be useful if the method in\n&gt;NEAT was slow for some application.  One could take\n&gt;the topology and weights that were evolved, and then\n&gt;write code to implement it in a speedy manner.\n\n\n\n"}}
