Yes, there is such a problem\n&gt; but if we trained network and it DO function properly then maybe  \n&gt; it is not actually undesirable. Because ANN is often treated as \n&gt; black box, so its inner structure doesn&#39;t make much sense. The \n&gt; main point is input and output parameters interrelationship that \n&gt; we have after network training.\n\nI would agree with this except it&#39;s not just the inner structure \nthat is affected.  The *outputs* of the network will tend to all be \n0 or 1.  You might say this is ok if it works, but this can&#39;t work \nfor everything, since in some cases graded response might be \nimportant.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
