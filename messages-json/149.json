In the present case\nI can use a player who makes random moves as a\nstandard to evaluate progress.  Later, I will probably\ncode a perfect player as another standard to measure\nagainst.\n\nAt the moment I have to debug my co-evolution code. \nThe B population is not advancing at all, and the A\npopulation much slower than before.  (when there was\nonly the A population vs. a random mover.)\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
