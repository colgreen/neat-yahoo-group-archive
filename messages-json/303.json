Can \n&gt; &gt; someone remind me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, those are mine and Philip&#39;s.  They&#39;re samples of\n&gt; the two different graphical layouts of networks that\n&gt; the implementation we&#39;re working on produces.  \n&gt; \n&gt; They&#39;re screen shots of sample output.  The actual\n&gt; graphical output for everything in our implementation\n&gt; (networks, speciation statistics, fitness graphs) are\n&gt; all done in SVG, which is scalable.  I&#39;ve uploaded a\n&gt; couple more examples in the &quot;Files&quot; section, in SVG\n&gt; format.  SVG is XML-based, so we felt it would be a\n&gt; more efficient way of storing graphical experimental\n&gt; data.  You can view the .svg files with a browser,\n&gt; with the SVG plug-in:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Once the plug-in is installed in your browser, just\n&gt; double-click on the .svg file you want to view.  You\n&gt; can then right click on the image and select to zoom\n&gt; in or out.\n&gt; \n&gt; We don&#39;t know if it&#39;s practical, or even really useful\n&gt; yet, but we wanted to be able to store an image of\n&gt; each network which clearly shows all of the\n&gt; connectivity and the value of the weights on every\n&gt; connection.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have any questions, let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
