To test it, I&#39;m running\nXOR with fixed topology, but my =\r\nruns only seem to train to three of\nthe four fitness cases. Let me describe=\r\n what I&#39;m doing, and maybe\nsomeone can spot a flaw? I can also send the sou=\r\nrce code to anyone\nthat asks -- you just need ECJ.\n\nThere are three input n=\r\nodes (0, 1, 2). The first two are the inputs\n(taking values of 0.0 or 1.0) =\r\nand the third is a fixed bias node\n(always of value 1.0).\n\nThe output node =\r\nis 3, and the hidden node is 4. The connections are as\nfollows:\n\n(0, 1, 2) =\r\n-&gt; (3, 4)\n4 -&gt; 3\n\nwhich makes 7 connections in all. The activation function=\r\n of each node\nis 1/(1+exp(-4.9*x)).\n\nThe fitness function is defined as the=\r\n sum of 1.0 - abs(target -\noutput), which means that the worst individuals =\r\nhave a fitness of 0\nand the best have a fitness of 4.\n\nI initialize the pop=\r\nulation with N networks. The weights in each\nnetwork are uniformly distribu=\r\nted as [-5,+5). Initially, all networks\nare in one species.\n\nSince individu=\r\nals do not differ in topology, they always have the same\nnumber of genes, s=\r\no the delta between individuals is calculated as\nM*W/7, where M is the matc=\r\nhing factor, W is the absolute difference in\nweights, and 7 is the number o=\r\nf matching genes. I&#39;m using M =3D 2.0 for\nmy runs, since that seems to keep=\r\n around 3 species.\n\nEach generation, the individuals in each species are ev=\r\naluated, and\nordered from fitness best to worst. The best individual in eac=\r\nh\nspecies is copied into the next generation. The overall fitness of\neach s=\r\npecies is also computed taking the average fitness of the\nindividuals in th=\r\nat species.\n\nEach species is then assigned a number of new individuals to c=\r\nreate,\nwhich is proportional to the species fitness.\n\nTo create a new indiv=\r\nidual, I take one parent from the top 40% of the\nspecies, and another paren=\r\nt randomly from the species (or with 0.1%\nprobability an elite from a diffe=\r\nrent species). I cross the parents,\nwhich involves randomly selecting each =\r\ngene from each parent.\n\nThen, with probability 50%, I mutate the weights of=\r\n the result: With\n90% probability, each weight is perturbed by a gaussian o=\r\nf standard\ndeviation 2.0, and capped to +/- 5.0. Otherwise (10% probability=\r\n) the\nweights are uniformly selected from [-5, +5).\n\nOnce the individuals a=\r\nre created, each individual is compared with one\nrepresentative from the pr=\r\nevious species. If the individual matches to\nwithin 2.0, the individual is =\r\nassigned to that species. Otherwise, a\nnew species is created, with that in=\r\ndividual becoming the\nrepresentative for that species. On a typical run, th=\r\ne number of\nspecies bounces between 2 and 3, with occasional excursions to =\r\n4.\n\nThat&#39;s about it. I end up with individuals that satisfy three of the\nfo=\r\nur cases. Can any one spot an obvious flaw? Parameters that are\nobviously w=\r\nrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n--Rob\n\n\n\n"}}
