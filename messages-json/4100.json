Actually, someone sent me a\nlink t=\r\no this website earlier and I found it surprisingly relevant:\nhttp://www.vra=\r\nc.iastate.edu/~streeter/\nIt&#39;s Tyler Streeter&#39;s page, I believe he posts her=\r\ne as well.\n\nOn the projects page, there is a picture of a blue face which l=\r\neads to\nthe Somatopic Map project page. It looks like there is actually a l=\r\not\nof exploiting geometry going on in our own motor systems and the\nmethod =\r\nTyler has devised for unwrapping a 3d model into a 2d map while\npreserving =\r\nits topology sounds like it would make the perfect\ncandidate for hyperneat.=\r\n Although it might not be applicable for\njoints with &gt;1 degrees of freedom,=\r\n my current ragdoll rig skirts that\nissue by only using hinge joints, place=\r\ns at opposing angles/offsets in\norder to emulate the ball-socket joints we =\r\nhave in our arms/legs. \nIt would obviously make more sense if there was a t=\r\nouch sensor like\nskin on this model and that was incorporated into the dyna=\r\nmics, but it\nstill sounds like it could work if you just mark the physical\n=\r\nlocations of inputs on the unwrapped map.\nPerhaps you could unwrap a virtua=\r\nl creature of any shape using that\nmethod, and mark the location of inputs =\r\nwhich have a physical location\non the surface of the creature. That would a=\r\nllow a very flexible way\nof approaching this task for almost any creature m=\r\norphology\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, how to represent the geometry of a rag doll in the substra=\r\nte is\n&gt; an open question right now with a lot of possible answers.  The\n&gt; e=\r\nasiest part of the answer is probably just that the inputs and\n&gt; outputs sh=\r\nould be in a configuration that is projected from the shape\n&gt; of the body, =\r\nand both inputs and outputs should have correlated\ngeometry.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, =\r\nthe little questions are the hard ones, like what to do when\n&gt; there are mu=\r\nltiple degrees of freedom at the same location (such as a\n&gt; hip).  It seems=\r\n erroneous to simply squeeze such different directions\n&gt; arbitrarily into t=\r\nhe same area. Perhaps more useful would be to have\n&gt; multiple input and out=\r\nput layers, each with a map of the joints of the\n&gt; body that rotate along a=\r\n certain axis.\n&gt; \n&gt; The multiple layers could be joined together on a 3rd d=\r\nimension, or\n&gt; effectively completely separated by making them separate inp=\r\nuts or\n&gt; outputs (i.e. by having multiple sets of inputs or outputs).  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; To simplify the problem, you might start out for practice with a robot\n&gt; =\r\nthat only has a single degree of freedom at each joint.  That way, you\n&gt; co=\r\nuld just have a single input map and a single output map without any\n&gt; diff=\r\nicult conceptual issues.  If it works out well, you could expand\n&gt; from the=\r\nre to more complex representations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like I said, this research area is=\r\n an experiment in progress, but I do\n&gt; believe we will eventually have some=\r\n standard practices for how to\n&gt; project a body onto a substrate.  I&#39;d be i=\r\nnterested in hearing\n&gt; anything you find out.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In othe=\r\nr words, how do you configure a substrate for hyperneat for a\n&gt; &gt; list of i=\r\nnputs that correspond to joint angles and velocities and a\n&gt; &gt; list of outp=\r\nuts that correspond to the desired joint state (i.e. hold,\n&gt; &gt; relax, exten=\r\nd, or contract)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vinod K. Valsalam wrote an excellent paper on mak=\r\ning modular\n&gt; &gt; subnetworks in order to take advantage of a symmetrical con=\r\nfiguration\n&gt; &gt; of legs, as in a quadruped trot, bound, pace or &quot;pronk&quot;. Thi=\r\ns sounds\n&gt; &gt; like a good idea, but in the case of a biped or humanoid creat=\r\nure (for\n&gt; &gt; example, the ragdoll rig I&#39;m currently working on has 20 1-dof=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; joints), I&#39;m not sure I want to limit myself from exploring behavior\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that isn&#39;t strictly modular with respect to the limb. Symmetry is only\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; bilateral in a humanoid, you won&#39;t achieve as dramatic a reduction in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; search space as you do with 4 or more symmetrical limbs by\n&gt; &gt; compartmen=\r\ntalizing it that way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the question is, how do I lay out my ragd=\r\noll model in the substrate\n&gt; &gt; if I want to take advantage of the geometric=\r\n relationship between the\n&gt; &gt; joints in the body?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
