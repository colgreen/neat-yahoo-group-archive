The test domain was Nothello (a  \nvariant of Othello).\n\nOverall I think the approach is quite interesting, as GRNs capture a  \nlot of the useful aspects of indirect encoding, such as hierarchical  \nmodularity and weak-linkage, without introducing that much extra  \ncomplexity to the evolutionary model. Unfortunately (to my knowledge)  \nthere aren&#39;t any direct comparisons of hyperNEAT to GRN-based neural  \nnetwork encodings, so its still quite a big open question which  \nencoding is better for what problem.\n\n-- Joe\n\nOn Jan 31, 2008, at 3:58 PM, JT wrote:\n\n&gt; (This is my first post.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently came upon some literatures on Analog Genetic Encoding\n&gt; developed by Mattiussi and Floreano.
