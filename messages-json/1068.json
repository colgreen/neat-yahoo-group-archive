Anyway, I want to make a biological system of \nwolves and rabbits and I thought it&#39;d be cool if each agent had \na &quot;brain&quot; to guide its movement and if their brain evolved with time. \nWolves eat rabbits, rabbits eat grass, they have to go find it, if \nthey don&#39;t, they die, etc. As I said, I&#39;m very new to this so any \nadvice or referrals would be great. I&#39;m here to learn as much as I \ncan without being a burden. Thanks.\n\nTimmy\n\np.s. also please tell me if i&#39;m way over my head with this site. \nthanks\n\n\n"}}
