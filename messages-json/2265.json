(I guess Derek or you\n&gt; &gt; may be able to =\r\nanswer this question) My dynamic thresholding is\n&gt; &gt; constantly moving towa=\r\nrds a target number by moving the\n&gt; &gt; compatibility threshold, which doesn&#39;=\r\nt seem like a &quot;clamp&quot; exactly,\n&gt; &gt; so I think clamping may be a third optio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, not sure &quot;clamped&quot; is a good word either, or that I even\n&gt; un=\r\nderstood exactly what Ken&#39;s code was doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember early on when w=\r\ne were working on our implementation, and\n&gt; were specifically working on so=\r\nme of the visualization tools, I saw\n&gt; the speciation graphic in Ken&#39;s 2002=\r\n paper, and it looked like for a\n&gt; population of 150 there were something l=\r\nike 8 species.  We hadn&#39;t\n&gt; really tuned our compability threshold so we we=\r\nre getting way more\n&gt; species than this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought that in an email ex=\r\nchange Ken said that he set a maximum\n&gt; number of species (this is what I w=\r\nas referring to as &quot;clamping&quot; the\n&gt; number of species).  It sounds though, =\r\nin this discussion, that it\n&gt; actually works by restricting the maximum num=\r\nber of members each\n&gt; species can have, which would in practice would very =\r\nmuch the same way\n&gt; I would guess.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s interesting that you brought t=\r\nhis up.  We&#39;re going to be looking\n&gt; a lot more closely at our population d=\r\nynamics in the coming months.\n&gt; We&#39;ve had discussions on this list about ki=\r\nlling off stagnating\n&gt; species in order to add more dynamism to the search =\r\nalgorithm.  That\n&gt; is something else we currently haven&#39;t implemented.  So =\r\nwe&#39;d like to\n&gt; take a closer look at what&#39;s going there, but yeah, these is=\r\nsues are\n&gt; still pretty hazy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
