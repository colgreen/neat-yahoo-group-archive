Of course,=\r\n if you found that any type of completely random process consistently outpe=\r\nrforms fitness significantly in reasonable domains (as novelty does) it wou=\r\nld be a huge shock.   \n\nYou suggest that the random search that we implemen=\r\nted is worse than the kind of random search that you describe.  I could be =\r\nwrong, but I don&#39;t think there is an a priori reason to believe that any gi=\r\nven totally uninformed process is better than another.  You note that our r=\r\nandom search may be more &quot;uneven,&quot; which could be true, but there is no a p=\r\nriori reason to believe that being &quot;even&quot; is better for a given domain.  Ge=\r\nnerally, even with totally random searches you are facing a kind of no free=\r\n lunch situation.\n\nProbably the most important question underlying your cur=\r\niosity is why we would expect novelty to be better than random.  There are =\r\nmany answers to this question, but perhaps one helpful insight is that nove=\r\nlty is an informative gradient.  That is, quite the opposite of random sear=\r\nch, novelty is information-rich, which means that the novelty metric tells =\r\nus a lot about how different points in the search space relate to each othe=\r\nr.  In fact, one way to understand the relationship among random, fitness, =\r\nand novelty, is to realize that fitness actually provides less information =\r\nthan novelty, putting it between random and novelty on the scale of informa=\r\ntion-richness.  The reason fitness provides less information is that many b=\r\nehaviors that are different from each other receive the same fitness, where=\r\nas novelty search would notice their difference.  Thus, in fitness-based se=\r\narch, moving among such conflated behaviors is similar to a random search, =\r\nbecause there is no gradient among them.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Looks like I missed that =\r\npart. Sorry about that. If however I understand correctly what you did, it =\r\nis not exactly a random search. You write that you run NEAT with randomly a=\r\nssigned fitness. In such search there should be significant correlations be=\r\ntween the tested individuals, since despite the random selection, much of t=\r\nhe genetic material is inherited from past individuals. This is not at all =\r\nwhat we would want in a random search. Additionally you would get genomes b=\r\necoming larger with time(probably much faster than we would want in a rando=\r\nm search).\n&gt; I would expect these deviations from a random search to cause =\r\nan uneven exploration of the genotype space. Thus the resulting performance=\r\n should be worse than that of a random search. I don&#39;t know however if the =\r\ndifference will be significant (It depends on the specifics of the evolutio=\r\nnary algorithm).\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that it seems that novelty search will spend =\r\nless time on degenerate behaviors than a random search. Any ideas on how to=\r\n quantify this difference?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
