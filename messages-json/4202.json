The\n3D shape of a chemi=\r\ncal is a principle determining factor of its\nactivity.  On top of 3D shape,=\r\n you have different functional groups\nthat impart different properties.  Fo=\r\nr example, let&#39;s say the shape is\njust right to bind to a particular enzyme=\r\n (and prevent it from running\namok) but you need an oxygen atom at a partic=\r\nular location, or a\nnitrogen, or any atom with a hydrogen attached, etc.\n\nT=\r\nhere are two ways to get to this type of information.  First is\nhaving a la=\r\nrge collection of chemicals with a known endpoint.  For\nthis I usually appl=\r\ny the standard pattern recognition tools.  Another\nmore difficult approach =\r\nis when you don&#39;t have much data for\nchemicals, but you know the 3D structu=\r\nre of the enzyme and where you\nwant your chemical to bind.  I&#39;m wondering i=\r\nf there is an application\nfor CPPNs here.  Can the CPPN capture the shape o=\r\nf the site along with\nthe essential properties based on the protein itself =\r\nand then be used\nto assess different chemical compounds that have not yet b=\r\neen tested -\ntry to predict their activities.\n\nAny thoughts??\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kirk,=\r\n what is your idea for applying CPPNs to pattern recognition?  I\n&gt; am not s=\r\nure I followed exactly how the CPPN would be connected to the\n&gt; neural netw=\r\nork?\n&gt; \n&gt; As Peter mentioned, we have used the idea of CPPNs to represent\n&gt;=\r\n connectivity patterns rather than the spatial patterns you saw in the\n&gt; CP=\r\nPN paper.  These connectivity patterns can then be interpreted of\n&gt; neural =\r\nnetwork connectivity patterns, which means you can evolve\n&gt; neural networks=\r\n with regularities in their connectivities.  There are\n&gt; currently four pap=\r\ners on this approach to evolving ANNs with CPPNs,\n&gt; which is called HyperNE=\r\nAT.  Those papers are available from my homepage\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu=\r\n/~kstanley/\n&gt; \n&gt; or from EPlex publications:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/p=\r\nublications.html\n&gt; \n&gt; The particular papers are:\n&gt; \n&gt; -A Novel Generative E=\r\nncoding for Exploiting Neural Network Sensor and \n&gt; Output Geometry\n&gt; \n&gt; -G=\r\nenerating Large-Scale Neural Networks Through Discovering Geometric\n&gt; Regul=\r\narities \n&gt; \n&gt; -A Case Study on the Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in=\r\n Machine\n&gt; Learning\n&gt; \n&gt; -Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n A longer journal paper on HyperNEAT is also forthcoming in Artificial\n&gt; Li=\r\nfe journal.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, you can also interactively evolve your own CPP=\r\nNs images\n&gt; online at http://picbreeder.org\n&gt; \n&gt; Because spatial patterns a=\r\nnd connectivity patterns can represent just\n&gt; about anything, there are oth=\r\ner potential applications of CPPNs beyond\n&gt; representing ANNs, but currentl=\r\ny there is no publication of such an\n&gt; application that I know of.  But it =\r\nwould be interesting to see more\n&gt; work in that direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT uses CPPNs to build the neural network phenotypes (an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; evolves CPPNs). I see this as an extension. There are about 3 or mor=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; papers on HyperNEAT. It should be interesting to you, though it is\nj=\r\nust \n&gt; &gt; one of all possible applications. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve j=\r\nust read through the paper Compositional Pattern Producing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Networks: =\r\nA Novel Abstraction of Development - very interesting\nstuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAre there additional papers that extend on this?

My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhought is that if a CPPN can capture important spatial details that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nan then be evaluated by a standard NN, can the two improve on\npattern\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n recognition tasks that have a relative spatial component -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; topologic=\r\nal, geometric, higher dimensions...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Kirk\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
