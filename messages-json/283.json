In\n&gt; other words, NEAT was forced to solve the problem\n&gt; without recurrent\n&gt; connections.  That may sound impossible, but\n&gt; actually it explains why\n&gt; there are so many nodes.   The &quot;chains&quot; of nodes act\n&gt; like a memory,\n&gt; because it takes several steps for activation to\n&gt; travel all the way\n&gt; down the chain, so it is able to effectively store\n&gt; information from\n&gt; the past that does not come to the outputs for\n&gt; several iterations.  If\n&gt; I am right about this, this architecture is actually\n&gt; somewhat\n&gt; remarkable, since it implements a kind of &quot;memory&quot;\n&gt; that is hardly ever\n&gt; discussed when people talk about NN&#39;s.\n\nIn the usual feed-forward network, the MLP, updating\nstarts with the inputs and proceeds forward until the\noutputs are updated.  Hence the new input values\ncompletely determine all values throughout the net,\nobliterating any memory.  \n\nA memory such as you describe would occur if you first\nupdated the outputs, and then proceeded backward,\nfinally updating the input layer last.\n\nDoes the latter occur in NEAT?  How does NEAT decide\nwhen to update each neuron?\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
