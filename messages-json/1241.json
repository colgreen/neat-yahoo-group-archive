I use\n&gt; training wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\n&gt; center of mass moves too far) at first until they\n&gt; learn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\n&gt; remove this external help, seed a new population with\n&gt; the champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\n\nI&#39;m curious why you restart the population rather than just changing the \nfitness function in the middle of the run?  Is it that you want to \nwhittle away all but the best species?  Are the genes in the first run \ntreated differently in the second run somehow?\n\n&gt; to help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n&gt; (first oscillate legs, then worry about\n&gt; balancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\n&gt; teach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt;  &gt; block torso seems to\n&gt;  &gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt;  &gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt;  &gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt;  &gt; does the ANN\n&gt;  &gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt;  &gt; joint (which\n&gt;  &gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt;  &gt; stop)?\n&gt; \n&gt; The ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\n&gt; the thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\n&gt; rotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\n&gt; from the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\n&gt; just the two hip joints.\n&gt; \n&gt; My ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\n&gt; modified PID (proportional integral derivative)\n&gt; controller to calculate the torque necessary to\n&gt; achieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\n&gt; higher-level control system: the brain has desired\n&gt; angles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\n&gt; much force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\n&gt; the same type of controller but just have a constant\n&gt; desired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\n&gt; angle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\n&gt; swing freely. \n\nI&#39;ve been doing some similar stuff lately, same intent, but some \ndifferent specifics from Tyler&#39;s.  FWIW, NEAT is the best controller \nevolver I&#39;ve found so far. :-)  If anybody&#39;s interested, there&#39;s a \ncouple animations up now:\n\nhttp://pantarhei.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n-- \nBrian Dexter Allen\nhttp://www.luminousbeings.com/\n\n"}}
