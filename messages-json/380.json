I \n&gt; don&#39;t want to enlarge all of them, but since I want\n&gt; to be able to enlarge \n&gt; any one I want, it seems reasonable to build a\n&gt; &#39;general&#39; mechanism that \n&gt; works well for all the pictures, and hopefully for\n&gt; future ones as well.\n\nWhat was your approach in gathering a sample of test\nphotos?  Were you trying to cover as broad a spectrum\nof types of images as possible, or narrowly defining\nthe sample to similar images, under similar lighting\nconditions?\n\nI would think that the more diversity you have in the\ntraining set, the more difficult it might be to\ntrain/evolve networks for image enlargement.\n\nI would think that networks trained/evolved to\nspecialize in enlarging particular types of images\n(e.g., human faces) might be more efficient than a\ngeneralist enlarger for any and all types of images.\n\nWhat approach are you taking?\n\n&gt; Actually, it&#39;s an 8x8 input (64 nodes) and 8x8\n&gt; output, with an initial \n&gt; configuration of only the center 2x2  input nodes\n&gt; connected via a single \n&gt; connection with weight 1 to the output node that is\n&gt; in the corresponding \n&gt; location in the enlarged image.\n\nOkay...got it. :)\n\n&gt; Input node &#39;a&#39; is connected with weight 1 to all\n&gt; output nodes &#39;a&#39;.  Same for \n&gt; b, c, and d.  This corresponds exactly to a &#39;nearest\n&gt; neighbor&#39; or &#39;pixel \n&gt; enlargement&#39; algorithm.  The remaining input nodes\n&gt; are unconnected in the \n&gt; hopes that NEAT will decide for itself which nodes\n&gt; it needs and which it \n&gt; does not.  \n\nThat&#39;s an interesting approach.  It would be\ninteresting to allow inputs to evolve at any distance\nacross the entire image input, rather than a confined\ngrid.  There may be features in the lower right corner\nthat provide important information on how to enlarge\nan area in the upper left corner.\n\nWhile thinking about the domain you&#39;re interested in,\nI&#39;m also thinking about Go, and other game domains\nthat Philip, I, and others on the list are\nparticularly interested in.  We&#39;re interested in\nexperimenting with a similar approach...a mobile\nviewing window which only looks at a portion of the\nboard at a time.  We thought it would be interesting\nto allow the size and shape of the input window to\nevolve as well.\n\nAnd in Go, oftentimes there are features on one side\nof the board that affect decisions on the other side\n(e.g. ladders are sequences of moves along a path that\ncan either result in life or death for a chain of\nstones depending on whether a friendly stone may lie\nin the projected path of the ladder).\n\nIt may be that an optimal &quot;window&quot; is actually a\nnon-adjacent collection of inputs from various areas\nof the board.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if this may be the case in domains like\nimage recognition and image enlargement.\n\n&gt; Okay, I have now read all of the archives for the\n&gt; lits, so I&#39;m up to speed \n&gt; on the &#39;roving eye&#39; concept...  Yes, it is very\n&gt; similar, except it has no \n&gt; control over the roving.  It is applied successively\n&gt; to every 8x8 chunk of \n&gt; the image.\n\nI wonder how it might perform if it were given control\nover its movement.  If the window could rescan\nparticular regions and perhaps average its later\noutput values with its initial ones.  For example, if\nthe roving eye scans all the way to the lower right,\nthen decides to adjust some of the output values back\nin the upper left, it can move back up and output new\nvalues, which could either replace, or be averaged\nwith the old ones.  \n\nGranted, this would be a hell of a lot more processing\nthough.\n\n&gt; The original image is 1984x1488 pixels.  The\n&gt; enlarged image will be \n&gt; 7936x5952.  \n\nWow...those are big pics.  Might it be better to work\nwith smaller ones first?\n\n&gt;  But I felt that having \n&gt; overlap would allow me to have a &#39;degree of\n&gt; confidence&#39; in particular \n&gt; pixels.  \n\nThis overlapping approach sounds like a good idea.\n\n&gt; My biggest problem at this point is time and disk\n&gt; space. :)  For now...\n\nWell good luck with it, and keep us posted.  Did you\nsay which implementation of NEAT you plan on using?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
