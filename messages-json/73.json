Actually, I don&#39;t think I\nsaid people have tried training NEAT with backprop before.  (That I\nknow of- people can correct me if I&#39;m wrong)  What I meant to say was\nthat people have tried combining *neuroevolution* (non-NEAT methods)\nwith backprop before.  Some examples are Xin Yao, and Bin Zhang\n(separately).  Also Nolfi and Parisi have several papers about using\nbackprop during evolution to simulate a learning process anologous to\nwhat happens in nature where organisms learn during their lifetime. \nYou can find mostof this stuff through citeseer :\nhttp://citeseer.nj.nec.com/\nThat is a research index of articles.  Let me know if you have trouble\nfinding the relevant research.\n\nIf by training you just mean learning over a lifetime, rather than\nbackprop specifically, my own paper on adaptive NEAT talks about this,\nbut it&#39;s probably not what you are referring to:\n\nhttp://steam.csres.utexas.edu/nn/pub-view.php?RECO\nRD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=131\n\nIf you are having trouble adding backprop to the network classes \nin NEAT, let me know also since I may be able to help you.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
