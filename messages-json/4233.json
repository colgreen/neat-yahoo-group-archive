Ph.D. students \n&gt; here learn about backprop a=\r\nt school. Too old stuff. I wonder do these \n&gt; people have ever heard of NEA=\r\nT, HyperNEAT, Novelty Search.. Second, \n&gt; going abroad to study is difficul=\r\nt in my case because someone has to \n&gt; pay for it :)\n&gt; I prefer doing my ow=\r\nn research without going to graduate school. I \n&gt; have all the things neces=\r\nsary - a computer, information and \n&gt; imagination. Getting credited for doi=\r\nng something cool and/or \n&gt; contributing to some research is just enough fo=\r\nr me. \n&gt; But I don&#39;t know, maybe some day.. \n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. I am glad that you l=\r\nike my demos, there are more coming.. :)  \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, it&#39;s great=\r\n to hear that you&#39;ve found our work useful.  We are\n&gt; &gt; always happy to rec=\r\neive positive feedback.  We also like your demos\n&gt; &gt; and from what I&#39;ve see=\r\nn you could easily pursue a Ph.D. if you \n&gt; wanted\n&gt; &gt; to.  Have you ever c=\r\nonsidered going to graduate school for a Ph.D.?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that all the re-querying will get expensive. In fact \n&gt; =\r\nrunning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; such an evolution, in the matter of computational effort, th=\r\nat \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; come as close as exhaustive search, but I think there is=\r\n \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beatuful in the way it is done. The CPPN can be re-que=\r\nried each N \n&gt; &gt; &gt; timesteps or when some criteria in the environment is me=\r\nt. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, I actually changed my entire phylosophy about EC=\r\n since \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; last paper about NS came out. I am about to add dynam=\r\nic re-\n&gt; quering to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the CPPN-&gt;HyperNEAT substrates, while being in N=\r\novelty Search. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t really have to say too much good words=\r\n, but it is \n&gt; obvious, NS \n&gt; &gt; &gt; avoids all deception and it reaches solut=\r\nions that FS has no hope \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reach. Great work, you people over th=\r\nere in the Eplex group! \n&gt; Cheers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Ken, David, Joel and Jason! I a=\r\nm not a PhD or anything like \n&gt; that, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just a bulgarian freelanc=\r\ner but I really admire what you \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done in this area. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Peter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;ks=\r\ntanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Peter, I think re-querying the CPPN over ti=\r\nme is a great idea.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talked about it in our research g=\r\nroup but we don&#39;t have any \n&gt; ongoing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; projects with it, and I don&#39;t=\r\n know of any.  The only downside \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all that queryin=\r\ng will get expensive.  However, it&#39;s very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becaus=\r\ne it means that the learning rules themselves become \n&gt; &gt; &gt; distributed\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; in a pattern, and are &quot;made up&quot; by HyperNEAT rather than being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n preselected by the experimenter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The CPPN might also be a=\r\nble to output Hebbian parameters; \n&gt; although\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is less groundbr=\r\neaking, though it might work well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is an interes=\r\nting idea to see what if the phenotypes \n&gt; produced \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; CPPNs change over their lifetime. There are two approaches to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this=\r\n: the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN can output hebbian learning parameters to the \n&gt; conn=\r\nections or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN can be re-queried every time step, so=\r\n the connections \n&gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basically different every tim=\r\ne, depending on the environment, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be input to t=\r\nhe CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any ongoing research into this? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
