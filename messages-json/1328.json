Here&#39;s what I came up with...\n&gt;\n&gt;If you consider the origin of a (3D) cartesian coordinate system with\n&gt;vectors coming out at all angles in all 3 dimensions you have a sort of\n&gt;spikey sphere. You could then calculate the cross product of each of\n&gt;these vectors with every other vector, and this should give you a good\n&gt;enough set of examples for the neural net search to be able to\n&gt;specialize and also to cover every possible set of vectors that we might\n&gt;want to find a cross product for.\n&gt;\n&gt;By my thinking the smallest set of vectors that fits the above scheme\n&gt;would have a set of vectors all seperated by 45 degrees, e.g. if we\n&gt;think of one plane at a time, here is the x,y plane (z=0):\n&gt;\n&gt;                     View this in Courier New font if it looks a mess!\n&gt;             y\n&gt;          &#92;  |  /\n&gt;           &#92; | /\n&gt;            &#92;|/\n&gt;       ------------ x\n&gt;                              / | &#92;\n&gt;                            /   |   &#92;\n&gt;                          /     |     &#92;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here we have 8 vectors, each seperated by 45 degrees. If we then take\n&gt;this set of vectors and rotate it about the x axis by 45 degrees we get\n&gt;another set of vectors - repeat this two more times and you end up with\n&gt;26 vectors in all 3 dimensions that are evenly spread out and that form\n&gt;a spikey sphere :)\n&gt;\n&gt;If we then compare each vector against itself and all of the others this\n&gt;then makes 26*26=676 test cases. Remember that we should compare each\n&gt;vector with itself so that we can be sure the network learns to generate\n&gt;the zero vector when comparing parallel vectors.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course it might be necessary to use an even larger set of vectors to\n&gt;improve the accuracy of the evolved network - I don&#39;t know, but I think\n&gt;the set described above is an absolute minimum.\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope that was clear enough and helps out a bit,\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
