So the core of\n&gt; the\n&gt; code is from that, although it&#39;s been much expanded\n&gt; and\n&gt; changed.  \n\nAh, okay...cool.\n\n&gt; The one concern is that some simulators are not\n&gt; built for\n&gt; training, which means that they may not let you turn\n&gt; off\n&gt; the graphics or run in &quot;fast forward&quot; mode.  \n\nTeamBots does have a &quot;graphics-off&quot; mode, so it does\nlook like a good start.  I also believe that the\nSoccerBots extension allows you to parameterize the\nlength of a time-step and also allows the speeding up\nof graphical animation.\n\n&gt; To answer your second question, if NEAT is trained\n&gt; on a\n&gt; realistic simulation of a real physical robot (e.g.\n&gt; Khepera)\n&gt; then the results should be transferable.  In\n&gt; practice, the\n&gt; transfer will not be a perfect and a few extra\n&gt; generations\n&gt; of refinement evolution in the real world may be\n&gt; necessary.\n\nThat makes sense.  Does porting the evolved ANNs to\nhardware appeal to you at all? \n\nI know those robots can be a bit pricey, at least from\njust poking around on the net.\n\n&gt; I think trying your ANJI NEAT (hmm...how to say it?)\n&gt; with\n&gt; robot simulators would be great.  NEAT is known to\n&gt; be good\n&gt; in that kind of domain.\n\nWell, we&#39;re hoping to collect a nice, large set of\ndomains/fitness functions in the SourceForge\nrepository for the project.  It&#39;d be great to see\nanyone here who&#39;s interested in contributing.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
