Mr. Emile\n&gt; &gt; Richard has written an analysis of a procedural\n&gt; &gt; programming approach to this problem.  It is in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; Blog section of the ANNEvolve website.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you remind me in comparison the number of &quot;bits&quot;\n&gt; stored\n&gt; in your best neural solution?  I also wonder if\n&gt; storage capacity\n&gt; increases much if neurons are allowed to be\n&gt; continuous.\n\nMy best solution had 34 neurons, therefore 34 bits.\n\nA continuous output neuron would have a far higher bit\ncapacity, if it was properly matched to the problem. \nI have no idea how it would work for this particular\nproblem.  Hopefully, we will know some day! :)\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
