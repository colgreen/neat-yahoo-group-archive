The paper is available here:\n\nhttp://eplex.=\r\ncs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/risi.sab10.html\nDirect Link: http://eplex.cs.u=\r\ncf.edu/papers/risi_sab10.pdf\n\nThe idea introduced in this paper is that Hyp=\r\nerNEAT can encode a pattern of plasticity rules across a network rather tha=\r\nn simply encoding a pattern of static weights.  These encoded rules give Hy=\r\nperNEAT the ability to evolve networks that learn over their lifetime.  The=\r\n paper explores this idea and how it can be implemented at different levels=\r\n of generality (with a trade-off in computational cost).\n\nOf course, our ho=\r\npe is that this approach will later be applied to evolving large-scale plas=\r\ntic networks that move neuroevolution closer to evolving brain-like dynamic=\r\nal systems rather than just static (fixed-weight) networks.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
