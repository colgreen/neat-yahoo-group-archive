I&#39;m fascinated by this ability of brain regions to me=\r\naningfully\n&gt; process whatever input types they are presented with, it seems=\r\n quite\n&gt; incredible, and I think points to something fundamental about how =\r\n(at least\n&gt; some regions of) natural neural networks operate. \n\nI completel=\r\ny agree. This is also my opinion about the things we should look for when w=\r\ne develop neural networks. In my case it was the article &quot;Evolution of decl=\r\narative memory&quot; (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16881079) which outline=\r\ns the adaptiveness of the hippocampus and highlights that an evolutionary p=\r\nerspective on certain brain regions is necessary to understand their genera=\r\nl function. This and some other articles are the reason why I focus now on =\r\nlearning of sequential information. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you provide some links to pu=\r\nblications or other information about the\n&gt; &quot;Brain in a box&quot; model and the =\r\nrelated CPPN encoding?\n\nI send you an email. But I will upload this article=\r\n soon on my webpage as well.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a &quot;Software&quot; tab at the top of t=\r\nhe website, I should have been more\n&gt; specific, sorry. Direct link: http://=\r\nojcoleman.com/content/software\n\nOk, so you implemented everything in Java. =\r\nI mostly work in Matlab and Python. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also planning on using the I=\r\nzhikevich neuron model (so computationally\n&gt; fast with such rich and appare=\r\nntly realistic dynamics!). \n\nFor my latest research I programmed a lot usin=\r\ng the Izhikevich neuron and heterogeneous conduction delays (based on the s=\r\ncripts provided by Izhikevich in the Polychronization paper). Just in case =\r\nyou need more flexibility in setting up the topology of the network and cal=\r\nculating all the auxiliary variables I have solved all these problems (in M=\r\natlab ;)) and can send you the code.\n\nI was planning on\n&gt; trying out some m=\r\nodel of synaptogenesis but haven&#39;t yet got around to\n&gt; looking at models; \n=\r\n\nAre you also looking for implementing a certain function within your model=\r\n or are you more interested in the mechanisms that lead to the formation of=\r\n a network architecture? \n\n&gt; &gt; With a colleague, we work on a model that im=\r\nplements structural\n&gt; &gt; plasticity, heterogeneous conduction delays and STD=\r\nP in spiking neurons (we\n&gt; &gt; use the Izhikevich neuron and everything is im=\r\nplemented in Matlab).\n&gt; &gt; Synapses are build depending on the activation le=\r\nvel of the neuron and its\n&gt; &gt; projection kernel. I think, the projection ke=\r\nrnel could be something that\n&gt; &gt; can be encoded by a CPPN. \n\n&gt; I&#39;d be inter=\r\nested in learning more about your model (and\n&gt; why you&#39;re using that partic=\r\nular model). What is the &quot;projection kernel&quot;?\n&gt; What prompted you to look a=\r\nt synaptogenesis?\n\nThe model has been developed by Markus Butz (e.g. http:/=\r\n/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/191620729) who is interested in structural pla=\r\nsticity. Together, we extended it by heterogeneous conduction delays and ST=\r\nDP (like in the polychronization paper). The model designed by Markus is pa=\r\nrticularly suitable to model and explain experimental data from lesion stud=\r\nies (especially in visual cortices). The &quot;projection kernel&quot; is basically a=\r\n probability distribution across space that determines where potential axon=\r\ns and and dendrites build synapses. The formation of new synapses is determ=\r\nined according to this kernel and the activity level of the neurons. (maybe=\r\n I should invite Markus to join this discussion here, he can explain more a=\r\nbout it). I think the kernel is something which could be perfectly evolved =\r\nusing CPPNs.\n\nIt was mainly the work of Markus that convinced me that synap=\r\ntogenesis is an important factor in the development of neural networks and =\r\nespecially interesting for Artificial Development because having these self=\r\n-organizing mechanisms should make it easier for the encoding to generate r=\r\nobust neural networks.\n\n&gt; &gt; Having this kind of super-gun, we are now facin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; the question: how to setup an appropriate fitness-function, which run=\r\ns a\n&gt; &gt; bit into the discussions we had here the last weeks. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Are y=\r\nou looking for tasks/problems/environments to try your model on, or\n&gt; are y=\r\nou just not sure how to set up a fitness function for a task you&#39;ve\n&gt; decid=\r\ned on?\n\nWe are working on some tasks/problems for the model. Besides some p=\r\nhenomenons in the visual cortex we are looking at, I am in particular wonde=\r\nring how a model of the hippocampus might look like that is able to learn a=\r\nnd recognize sequences of information.\n\nIn your blog postings you write tha=\r\nt you are also interested in learning mechanisms. I would like to know more=\r\n about your project. Do you have already a certain task or function in mind=\r\n you are going to implement? \n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
