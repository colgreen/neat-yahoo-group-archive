As I mentioned before, by picking an entire play at\n&gt; the start of the round and using a separate network for each round\n&gt; (i.e., keeping the number of cards and betting info for the hand fixed\n&gt; to a constant size).\n\nBut wouldn&#39;t that break up the network&#39;s knowledge of what happened in\nprevious rounds? Or would the turn also have an input that says what\nhappened preflop and on the flop?\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For example, a useful data point is probably the\n&gt;&gt; probability any given hand will win at any given point in the game\n&gt;&gt; assuming homogeneous players and homogeneous strategy.  This can\n&gt; easily be\n&gt;&gt; calculated but it is work-intensive.  In fact, prohibitively so\n&gt; depending\n&gt;&gt; on how you do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed this can be very work-intensive.  However, the poker-eval\n&gt; libraries are very fast and make use of a lot of pre-computed lookup\n&gt; tables.  You can normally get around 20 million rollout predictions\n&gt; done in a fraction of a second.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Anything else will result in something\n&gt;&gt; that never, ever converges.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand why you think it has to be fast in order to\n&gt; converge?  It doesn&#39;t really make a huge difference in the long run if\n&gt; a simulation takes a day or a week.\n\nI think it is easy to get this stat. Many poker assistants provide these\nstats out of the box (e.g. expected probability of of the hand you have\nwinning given the board and the number of players). My team has coded\nimprovements over these out of the box stats which are fast enough for real\ntime play and are more realistic.\n\n&gt; However, if things do become excessively long (we can&#39;t run for 6\n&gt; months like Blondie24 did), we may need to look into a better\n&gt; strategy.  Maybe it&#39;s possible to parallelize the NEAT evaluation\n&gt; process?  We have lots of clusters here at VT that could certainly be\n&gt; used, and I think a really cool software implementation (using mixin\n&gt; layers maybe?) would be a novel contribution.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, I posted my engine on the\n&gt;&gt; NEAT groups but if someone wants it, let me know.  It is a great deal\n&gt;&gt; faster than the C# implementations and could probably be even faster.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to take a look at your engine.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; With the strong response I&#39;m getting about this project, maybe should\n&gt; all try to have an online meeting sometime and form a group?  Since\n&gt; everyone clearly has a yahoo account, we could use yahoo messenger.\n&gt; Thoughts?\n\nI think that is a really good idea. Sounds like there are a few interested\nand talented people.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
