The exact set of inputs \nhas varied widely but right now I&#39;m using close bid/offer price \n(adjusted), spread (as a proportion of the mid price), # of buy/sell \ntrades (adjusted), buy/sell volume (adjusted) + N day avergaes for \nvolume and # of trades. I also have prices for each day from 10 mins \ninto trading, this means that if a buy/sell signal is generated from a \nprevious day&#39;s close price that the evaluation routine accurately \nreflects the actual price you would have had to have paid the following \nday - which is most certainly not the same as the close price a lot of \nthe time.\n\nNow I do happen to have access to seperate buy and sell volume & trade \nfigures which contain some errors but which theoreticaly could give more \ninformation about what is going on with a specific share. E.g. \nconceivably a price can move without any (or few) trades occuring or \nvice versa, and genrally the price movements don&#39;t necessarily mirror \nthe trades that are taking place.\n\nThe reason (and this is a factor I haven&#39;t, err, factored in yet) is the \ntrading mechanism in use. The London Stock Exchange uses a variety of \ndifferent methods for trading stocks mostly depending on the size of a \ncompany and the volume of trades. SETS is the automatic system used to \nhandle the largest most liquid companies and so it might be wise to only \ntrain against SETS companies(or not!). The other main trading mechanism \nis old fashioned market makers were actual people decide on bid/offer \nprices - thus the price can move immediately on a piece of news(or \nbecause one of the market makers is bored), whereas in SETS the price \nwill react to the trades going through the system. There are other \nmechanisms that [I think] are basically hybrids of those two systems.\n\nPerformance so far is great on the training data but the jury&#39;s out so \nfar on the validation data - basically because I don&#39;t have enough data. \nThe results I do have suggest the ANNs perform about as well as a random \ntrader (e.g. a bell curve around 0ish percent), maybe very slightly \nbetter - which is potentially all you need to start making money.\n\nOne note on Emyr&#39;s message:\n\n\n&gt;Assuming that I can get a net that can give good buy / sell signals \n&gt;based on what the normalised stock graph I show it as input looks like, \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\nBe very careful not to give your ANN&#39;s *any* knowledge of the future. \nE.g. if you normalise the price of a share over the entire history then \nthe ANN can make the assumption that if it has only seen the price in a \nlow range so far that the prcie will rise at some point in the test \ndata. I went through a couple of phases early on of weeding out any \npossible routes that information about the future could be supplied in \nthe test data.\n\nRegards,\n\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
