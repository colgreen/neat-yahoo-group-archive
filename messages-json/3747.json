Most EC applications are limited in this\n&gt;  capacity.  I&#39;m not sure if NEAT is fully compatible with modularity or\n&gt;  not - thoughts?\n\nJust on this point - I would say that the ability of CPPN&#39;s to\ngenerate repeated structures and elaboratations on those repeated\nstructures means that modularity (re-use) is inherently part of the\nCPPN model.  I know this is a central part of why CPPNs were devised\nbut I&#39;m not sure that the word modularity has come up before when\ndiscussing CPPNs.\n\nAnyway it&#39;s another nice characteristic of CPPNs because it means we\nno longer have to explicitly write code to allow modularity.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
