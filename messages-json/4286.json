There is no pausing too, and it is \noften that you may mis=\r\ns a good-looking object or see it for just a \nfraction of the second. Upgra=\r\nde is coming, as I mentioned. But if you \nminimize the vizualization window=\r\n, it should run slightly faster. \nLeave it for about 1000 evaluations and c=\r\nheck out what phenotypes it \nproduces. Compare it to the genome complexity.=\r\n It is too early to \nhave any conclusions now but it is very interesting in=\r\ndeed. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, I&#39;m running it and it looks very interersting.
