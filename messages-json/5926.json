Here is =\r\na quote:\n\n&quot;[...] we advance the argument that an evolutionary approach is t=\r\nhe key to understanding the fundamental functional role of the mammalian hi=\r\nppocampus. In each mammalian species, a remarkably conserved hippocampus is=\r\n wrapped in a unique neocortex. The divergent neocortex cloaks the conserve=\r\nd hippocampal function by requiring a species-specific translation of incom=\r\ning sensory information before it reaches the hippocampus and of retrieved =\r\nassociations before they can be reflected in behavior. Thus, results from e=\r\nxperimental animals may appear incompatible with results from humans unless=\r\n the differences in neocortical organization are taken into account. Accord=\r\ning to this view, the kind of information processed by cortical areas may d=\r\niffer among species, but the intrinsic computations of the hippocampal syst=\r\nem are conserved. Thus, a computational account of hippocampal function can=\r\n best reveal and characterize hippocampal functional circuitry in a way tha=\r\nt applies equally well across species.&quot;\n\nI found this article very inspirin=\r\ng as it illustrates that the hippocampus (which is anatomically very simila=\r\nr across species) is maybe a good starting point to study the relation betw=\r\neen the anatomy ( =3D spatial relations between neurons + their projection =\r\ndirections) of a network an its functional role in learning. \n\nBest,\nMartin=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
