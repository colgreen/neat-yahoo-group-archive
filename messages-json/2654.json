I think I&#39;ll try just learning a \n&gt; string of bits (or perhaps more then 2 symbols) without the added \n&gt; complexity of flipping the bits and reversing the sequence. Or have you \n&gt; already succeeded with simpler experiments?\n\nNo, I started out with this one.  But it&#39;s prolly a good idea to try the simpler one\nfirst.  I&#39;m not sure why I skipped that step.\n\nIn my latest version I am having each ANN attempt all possible paths with number of\nsteps varying from 3 through 8.  My best ANNs get a little over 80% of the bits correct.\n So one of these ANNs, if you gave it any path picked at random, of 3 &lt;= path length &lt;=\n8,\nit will generate the bits in reverse and inverted, with expection of about 19% erroneous\nbits.\n\nI&#39;ve been using the meta-evolver to pick parameter values for evolution.\n\nThat code is now on SVN for anyone to see or download.\n\n\nMitchell Timin\n\nI&#39;m proud of http://ANNEvolve.sourceforge.net.  If you want to write software, or articles, or do testing, or research for ANNEvolve, let me know.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
