I think you mean that &quot;a hole&quot; is possible, and averaging the\n&gt; weights like that would result in a genome positioned inside the hole,\n&gt; being far from others, therefore making it not really meaningful for a\n&gt; good representative.\n\nYes and no.  Consider the outer boundary of a species defined by the\ngenomes at the extremeties. Now consider the enclosed space as a mass\nwith uniform density and calculate the center of mass; this is one\npossible definition of the center of a species. Taking the average of\nall genomes in a species gives us another possible species\ncenter/exemplar.  In both cases the exemplar may be in a sparsely\npopulated region of the species (and it&#39;s more likely using the first\nmetric using uniform density), but I don&#39;t think that is very likely.\n\nIf a species is anchored then genomes will start to cluster in regions\nof the species where the fitness landscape has peaks. If however the\nfitess landscape peaks are smooth and relatively large compared to the\nradius of a species, well then you can picture your species as\nrepresenting a ring fence of the edge of a hillside, and the genomes\nclustering around the higher edge of the fence because they are all\ntrying to climb the hill. In order to get a ring of genomes around the\nfull circumfrnce of the fence the exemplar would have to be in a\n&#39;hole&#39; or dip in the fitness space - thus the edge of the species\nrepresents fitter genomes all along its circumfrence. This could\nhappen but it&#39;s not something I would expect to be the dominant\nscenario.\n\nAnyway I think either measure of the center/exemplar is potentially\nuseful, with the average of all genomes in a species being easier to\ncalculate and more representative of ehere interest regions of the\nfitness space are.\n\n\n\n&gt; But there is one important thing to consider. If\n&gt; the importance factor for the average weight difference is high\n&gt; enough, there should be no such situation where most of the genomes\n&gt; are around the edge of the circle. Individuals on the left side and\n&gt; individuals on the right side have to be in separate species anyway,\n&gt; because their weights differ significantly.\n&gt; So in this case the circle is small enough. Its center would make\n&gt; sense to represent the entire species. I am not completely sure about\n&gt; it, though.\n\nI&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re describing here. The type of clustering\nI am describing (such as k-means), finds groups fo genomes that are\nclose together, so you won&#39;t tend to get an exemplar in an empty space\nwith two cluster of genomes on opposite far edges of the region. In\nthat case it&#39;s more likely those two distant groups will have formed\ntheir own separate species.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I like the idea of a metric function that takes 2 genomes and returns\n&gt; distance. In fact my own implementation follows that idea. So far I am\n&gt; using the traditional (Ken&#39;s) way of calculating distance plus some\n&gt; additions, like taking activation functions into account for CPPN\n&gt; evolution and the time constants and biases of matching nodes as well.\n&gt; I am planning to experiment with some other methods in the future. I\n&gt; guess I&#39;ll try yours first :)\n\nFor me it&#39;s simply a way of abstracting the speciation algorithm away\nfrom the NeatGenome class.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
