I think  what I did was quite\nsimilar to what Ken suggests: the positions are not related to the absolute\nindex in the list, but are always between a fixed range (0-1). If you have\njust 3 items, then the positions will be 0, 0.5 and 1, if you have a hundred\nelements, then 0, 0.01...0.99,1\n\nUnfortunately I did not have to much time to complete the experiment. The\ndomain was a quite tricky one anyway, so the results that I got were not too\nreassuring, especially if the size of the list had a great variance. So I\nabsolutely agree with Ken that it really has a lot of potential pitfalls.\n\nOf course it does not mean that if you have enough time it&#39;s impossible to\nachieve some better results.\n\nI also agree with him that it&#39;s really similar to changing the &quot;resolution&quot;\nand I think there would be a great potential in it (if anyone had a working\nsolution): if you eventually have really big networks, which also means very\nhigh computation cost the evolution could be speed up a bit by starting with\nlow resolution, and slowly increase it when you have some promising\nnetworks. So at the end you would probably need more generations, but less\ntime.\n\nBTW it&#39;s probably a bit easier to do then to work with the variable size\nlist, as the later one is more or less equivalent to having the already\nevolved networks (I mean the one that works on the substrate) and change the\nresolution of the substrate. At this point evolution can not help you any\nmore, that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s even harder...\n\nI think some guys did some similar experiments, I just can&#39;t remember who\nthey were and what was their results.\n\nCheers,\nSandor\n\r\n--000e0cd29280d37ac70480e14d84\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi Joel,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did some similar experiments in the past.
