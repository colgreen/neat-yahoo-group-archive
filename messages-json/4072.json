So=\r\n in effect, even if nothing is new historically,\nthe population is still re=\r\npelling itself away from where it is\ncurrently.  That means that over time =\r\nthe population will kind of\ndance around the behavior space until it hits a=\r\n stepping stone to\nsomething different.  It could take a long time, but at =\r\nleast it will\nnever just sit still and &quot;give up&quot; the way fitness-based evol=\r\nution\ntends to do when it converges prematurely.  Novelty search never\n&quot;fee=\r\nls&quot; like it has found an optimum because it is effectively\ncoevolutionary a=\r\nnd always looking to break free.\n\nThere also may be something more active w=\r\ne can do to push it out\nbeyond this inherent dynamic.  Maybe there is a met=\r\nhod of detecting\nthat things are not diversifying well anymore and then pus=\r\nhing things\nout.  Yet we would need to be careful because simply e.g. uppin=\r\ng the\nmutation rate might make things worse by knocking our population off\n=\r\nthe current set of behaviors back to something more primitive.  Still,\nsinc=\r\ne this research direction is in its infancy, I&#39;d guess there will\nend up ma=\r\nny creative ideas for dealing with various bad situations,\njust as people h=\r\nave come up with all kinds of tricks to deal with\npathologies in fitness-ba=\r\nsed search. \n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar=\r\n_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks for this great post again, =\r\nit answered many questions and it \n&gt; helped me get more insight in the phil=\r\nosophy behind NS. \n&gt; One question I have, how we could deal with stagnation=\r\n even in \n&gt; novelty search, i.e. when every new genome happens to be a know=\r\nn \n&gt; behavior?

These are likely the kinds of\n&gt; &gt; questions=\r\n we are going to face over time so it&#39;s a good chance to \n&gt; work\n&gt; &gt; on our=\r\n response.  I&#39;m going to start with a technical response but\n&gt; &gt; move to ph=\r\nilosophical.  It&#39;s a bit of an essay but hopefully worth \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; read.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your first set of questions regards the relationship between novelt=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; search (NS) and exhaustive search of behavioral space.  Do we think\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; these are effectively the same thing?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s a tricky sub=\r\nject but in the end I would not equate NS \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; exhaustive search.  Whi=\r\nle NS indeed does attempt to essentially \n&gt; visit\n&gt; &gt; every behavior in beh=\r\navioral space, the way it does it is not the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; as what is usually=\r\n meant by exhaustive search.  We usually think of \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; exhaustive sear=\r\nch as a purposeful enumeration, where if I just try\n&gt; &gt; every combination o=\r\nf something, one will be the answer.  A key \n&gt; feature\n&gt; &gt; of this type of =\r\nsearch is that it does not require or utilize\n&gt; &gt; information or feedback o=\r\nf any kind as a guide.  Rather, it simply\n&gt; &gt; makes sure it does not visit =\r\nthe same point twice.  (It is similar \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; random search except that r=\r\nandom search might indeed visit the same\n&gt; &gt; point twice.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One cle=\r\nar difference between such a search and NS is that we cannot\n&gt; &gt; purposeful=\r\nly enumerate all possible behaviors because our search \n&gt; space\n&gt; &gt; is the =\r\ngenotype space, which maps indirectly to the behavior space. \n&gt; &gt; Therefore=\r\n, there is actually no way to simply say &quot;list all possible\n&gt; &gt; behaviors&quot; =\r\nand try each one in succession.  We must seek them out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Furthermor=\r\ne, in novelty search there is *information* guiding the\n&gt; &gt; order of points=\r\n we visit (the information is the novelty measure). \n&gt; &gt; The points also ha=\r\nve an inherent order (perhaps quite useful) \n&gt; induced\n&gt; &gt; by the genetic e=\r\nncoding (hence the promise of combining it with\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT). In other wo=\r\nrds, we are not simply enumerating in an\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary non-overlapping orde=\r\nr.  Rather, we follow the most \n&gt; promising\n&gt; &gt; trails that seem to be lead=\r\ning to something new.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One significant consequence of this fact is =\r\nthat the actual search\n&gt; &gt; space (which is the genotype space) will almost =\r\ncertainly never need\n&gt; &gt; to be exhaustively searched.  So we effectively av=\r\noided wasting our\n&gt; &gt; time examining all kinds of genetic combinations that=\r\n would have\n&gt; &gt; produced redundant behaviors.  In its usual meaning, exhaus=\r\ntive \n&gt; search\n&gt; &gt; would be just such a search through genotype space.  So =\r\ncertainly it\n&gt; &gt; is not normal exhaustive search.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet if you still=\r\n want to talk about exhaustively searching behavior\n&gt; &gt; space, it is still =\r\nnot a typical exhaustive search because of the \n&gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; it proceeds in a=\r\nn order guided by information- not typical of\n&gt; &gt; exhaustive search.  Anoth=\r\ner corollary is that it is impossible to\n&gt; &gt; perform a typical exhaustive s=\r\nearch of behavior space because we \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; no method to enumerate it:  =\r\nIt must be explored.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet you might still say, fine, semantically p=\r\nerhaps it is something\n&gt; &gt; different, but still, in spirit are you not esse=\r\nntially doing\n&gt; &gt; something equally inefficient, i.e. looking for absolutel=\r\ny \n&gt; everything?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And it is true that in effect we are searching =\r\nfor every behavior, \n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; at least every behavior that looks distinguis=\r\nhable from each other\n&gt; &gt; with respect to the novelty metric and in an orde=\r\nr from simplicity \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; high complexity.  Yet therein lies the fundamen=\r\ntal insight: While \n&gt; such\n&gt; &gt; a search might sound bad, it is a lot better=\r\n to look at everything \n&gt; (in\n&gt; &gt; some meaningful order) and eventually run=\r\n across what you want\n&gt; &gt; (perhaps after a very long time) than to look for=\r\n one specific thing\n&gt; &gt; and *never* find it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are indeed suggest=\r\ning that this rather tortured choice (between\n&gt; &gt; looking for something wit=\r\nhout hope and looking for everything) is\n&gt; &gt; sometimes the real choice that=\r\n we face with the most ambitious\n&gt; &gt; problems.  In other words, objective-b=\r\nased fitness is literally \n&gt; doomed\n&gt; &gt; when it comes to evolving many incr=\r\nedibly complex systems from\n&gt; &gt; scratch.  It will simply never happen becau=\r\nse at high levels of\n&gt; &gt; complexity, there is going to be massive deception=\r\n at many levels, \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; fitness becomes as bad as random search in such=\r\n a problem.  In fact,\n&gt; &gt; as our results show, you don&#39;t even have to make =\r\nthe problem all \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; hard to cause fitness to crumble into something=\r\n as bad as random\n&gt; &gt; search.  What do you think will happen if you are try=\r\ning to evolve a\n&gt; &gt; neural network into the mind of a quantum physicist bas=\r\ned on how\n&gt; &gt; brilliant it is at quantum physics?  The answer: Nothing.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; A more down-to-earth example is the car that I evolved on \n&gt; Picbreed=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt;  It could never have evolved if evolving a car had been the\n&gt; &gt; *ob=\r\njective* because it was preceded by an alien face (evolved by\n&gt; &gt; someone e=\r\nlse).  It just so happens that the alien face is a stepping\n&gt; &gt; stone to a =\r\ncar, but if we had judged the alien face on it &quot;car-\n&gt; ness,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; it would =\r\nhave failed miserably and been deleted.  Hence if we were\n&gt; &gt; looking for a=\r\n car we would never have found one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In nature, if we had bred flat=\r\nworms (the earliest chordates) based \n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; their humanity, they too wou=\r\nld have never evolved into amphibians,\n&gt; &gt; then reptiles, then mammals, as =\r\nthey did.  The objective in long-run\n&gt; &gt; problems is totally blind to the n=\r\necessary stepping stones.  Unless \n&gt; we\n&gt; &gt; know them a priori, we are lost=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why do you suppose we have never seen a flowering of diversity a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; complexity such as seen in nature in evolutionary computation?  In \n=\r\n&gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; or 40 years of this field, which is inspired by nature, we have \n&gt;=\r\n never\n&gt; &gt; seen something that comes even close to even nature&#39;s modest\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n achievements.  The problem is that we have been blinded by \n&gt; objectives.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;    As soon as we set an objective, the stepping stones to it often\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nvanish into thin air.  There is no escape from this very sobering\n&gt; &gt; fact.=\r\n  It will have to be accepted, though it will be hard to \n&gt; accept.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Novelty search cures this problem, although admittedly in a painful\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nay, because it forces us to let go of our natural desire to \n&gt; *control*\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; what is happening.  We feel compelled to demand to the search\n&gt; &gt; algorit=\r\nhm that it go in a certain direction.  It is difficult to\n&gt; &gt; relinquish th=\r\nis feeling of control, yet if we recognize that in the\n&gt; &gt; end the setting =\r\nof such goals is its own worst enemy, then we can\n&gt; &gt; begin to be liberated=\r\n from this longstanding compulsion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Note that I am not saying fit=\r\nness is always useless; obviously that\n&gt; &gt; is not the case.  I am talking a=\r\nbout very ambitious problems, beyond\n&gt; &gt; the kind we have been able to solv=\r\ne yet- though even the &quot;hard maze&quot;\n&gt; &gt; is bordering on such a problem.)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; You point out that novelty search may get &quot;lost&quot; in a kind of \n&gt; endl=\r\ness\n&gt; &gt; offshoot in behavior space.  And yes, in some situations, it very \n=\r\n&gt; well\n&gt; &gt; may.  Yet I believe it will not do so in many interesting domain=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt; For example, if there was indeed a long offshoot of the maze, first=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; since there is a time limit for each robot, it would make little\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndifference and would quickly be filled up by novelty search.  If \n&gt; there\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; are no obstacles in the offshoot, it would be filled especially \n&gt; fast.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  But at the same time, novelty search is not likely to go off in \n&gt; on=\r\nly\n&gt; &gt; one direction anyway.  Because it is a population, it will go off in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; many directions at once.  While some parts may shoot down the\n&gt; &gt; dive=\r\nrsionary offshoot, at the same time others will begin to flow \n&gt; down\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe paths we want.  If it happens to take the wrong paths, it will\n&gt; &gt; fill =\r\nthat areas first and eventually be pushed back into the areas \n&gt; we\n&gt; &gt; car=\r\ne about (only if each individual was given infinite time could it\n&gt; &gt; be st=\r\nuck in one area forever)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the end, of course there is a chance i=\r\nt will fail to go the right\n&gt; &gt; way in reasonable time; after all, it has n=\r\no objective!  In fact, in\n&gt; &gt; the hard maze experiment, it did once fail to=\r\n find a solution in 40\n&gt; &gt; runs.  Yet look at how much more consistent it i=\r\ns than fitness-based\n&gt; &gt; search.  So the point is not that this is a guaran=\r\ntee (there will\n&gt; &gt; never be one).  Rather, it is a profoundly different ki=\r\nnd of search,\n&gt; &gt; which is likely to reach places that fitness-based search=\r\n can never\n&gt; &gt; hope to touch.  So it opens up a whole new world of possibil=\r\nities to\n&gt; &gt; evolutionary computation.  That does not mean it solves everyt=\r\nhing; \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; course it may still not always give us what we want.  There=\r\n is no\n&gt; &gt; method that will ever always give you what you want.  Yet object=\r\nive\n&gt; &gt; fitness is often even worse.  That is the sobering moral of the \n&gt; =\r\nstory.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So in my view, NS is actually suited for exactly those &quot;lar=\r\nge \n&gt; spaces&quot;\n&gt; &gt; that you suggest it will have trouble in.  And by large I=\r\n mean \n&gt; LARGE.\n&gt; &gt;  Those are the ones where objective-based fitness has n=\r\no hope.  \n&gt; These\n&gt; &gt; are spaces like life on earth, where it would be futi=\r\nle (and silly) \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; start with a single cell and select offspring base=\r\nd on relative\n&gt; &gt; humanity.  The only reason we got to humans in nature is =\r\nbecause\n&gt; &gt; nobody said we had to get there.  It&#39;s almost paradoxical, but =\r\nif \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; accept it, it is an exciting liberation.  If we let go of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; compulsion to be in control, we may find something we did not expect\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that is quite significant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So actually the idea of running fitn=\r\ness-based search and then \n&gt; novelty\n&gt; &gt; search is less exciting to us alth=\r\nough we raise it as a practical\n&gt; &gt; matter.  In some domains, objective fit=\r\nness is simply impotent, and\n&gt; &gt; the compulsion to have some shred of guida=\r\nnce to hang onto is a \n&gt; false\n&gt; &gt; comfort.  We will have to let go, and th=\r\nen, strangely, we will end \n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; where we want to be.  It&#39;s like when y=\r\nour grandparents told you that\n&gt; &gt; if you stop worrying so much about makin=\r\ng things work out, they will\n&gt; &gt; work out on their own.  Did you believe th=\r\nem?  Maybe there is more\n&gt; &gt; wisdom in it than there appeared to be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the thought provoking paper.=\r\n Here is my main question\n&gt; &gt; regarding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the work: How would you diffe=\r\nrentiate the NSA (novelty search \n&gt; algorithm)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from exhaustive search=\r\n in the behavior space?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you think there is a relevant diffe=\r\nrence between the NSA and\n&gt; &gt; exhaustive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behavioral search, have you =\r\ntried using the former as a control \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; seeing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how they compar=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the NSA is effectively exhaustive search in behavior spa=\r\nce, it\n&gt; &gt; seems to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me that, while it will work well (and better than=\r\n a GA) in small,\n&gt; &gt; deceptive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; landscapes, it will not perform very w=\r\nell in large search spaces.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for example, the paper&#39;s &quot;me=\r\ndium map&quot; but with a huge (near\n&gt; &gt; infinite) open\n&gt; &gt; &gt; area to the left o=\r\nf the starting condition. It could easily get \n&gt; lost\n&gt; &gt; over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there =\r\nindefinitely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You mention that it helps to have the domain con=\r\nstrain the search \n&gt; space.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this just mean that the (behavioral)=\r\n search space has to be \n&gt; small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough that it can an exhaustive sea=\r\nrch can deal with it? How will\n&gt; &gt; it fare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the much larger search =\r\nspaces of real-world problems, like \n&gt; checkers?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Using the NSA=\r\n as something to bail out objective-search when it\n&gt; &gt; stagnates is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nn interesting suggestion. But at that point it should be \n&gt; compared to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; fitness sharing. Would it do better than fitness sharing? I can \n&gt; think=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons it might (because it truly is not tempted by deceptive\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; traps), but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it would useful to see it compared to fitness sharing c=\r\nontrols.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents.

I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe this s=\r\ntrange result has fascinating implications for \n&gt; machine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learning,=\r\n artificial life, and even biology.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lately on this forum w=\r\ne have often discussed the nagging \n&gt; problem that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fitness func=\r\ntion often does not properly recognize or \n&gt; reward the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stepping st=\r\nones on the way to the solution.  I went as far as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting that =\r\nthe fitness function can become an *obstacle* to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success (e.g. when=\r\n we discussed creativity in Picbreeder).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this discus=\r\nsion was largely philosophical, Joel Lehman \n&gt; and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to mak=\r\ne it concrete and actually introduce an algorithm \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes an =\r\nautomated evolutionary process in *any* domain behave \n&gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human=\r\ns in Picbreeder, that is, like open-ended evolution.  This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approach=\r\n is called &quot;novelty search.&quot;  The algorithm simply \n&gt; searches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for =\r\nbehavior that is novel with respect to what has come before.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The benefit of this approach is that it is immune to deception \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it does not even try to achieve the objective.  I know it seems\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; strange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact it is far \n&gt; m=\r\nore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive \n&gt; land=\r\nscape than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitness-based search.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, w=\r\nhat we are saying is that to achieve some of \n&gt; the most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ambitious =\r\nobjectives we might have for evolution, we must \n&gt; abandon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying t=\r\no explicitly achieve them.  To quote from the end of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Discussion=\r\n section:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;In summary, almost like a riddle, novelty searc=\r\nh suggests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a surprising new perspective on achievement: To achieve\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your highest goals, you must be willing to abandon them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe this lesson is true in practice and is therefore \n&gt; beyon=\r\nd a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosophical curiosity.  In fact, we are instinctively \n&gt; fami=\r\nliar with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it in life in general when people say things like &quot;You ar=\r\ne \n&gt; trying too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard&quot; or when we focus so much on something so far =\r\nahead of us \n&gt; in life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we forget completely to solve the short=\r\n term problems that \n&gt; stand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in our way.  It is no less true in evo=\r\nlution or search in \n&gt; general.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For NEAT, novelty search s=\r\nhould open up new opportunities for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovery that were previously =\r\nclosed off to us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I look forward to hearing your thoughts =\r\non this work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
