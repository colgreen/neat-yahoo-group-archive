That paper was recently ac=\r\ncepted at CEC. I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on this paper in lig=\r\nht of our conversation now that you can see the specific paper that was rej=\r\nected. \n\nI&#39;d be especially interested to hear from those of you who argued =\r\nthat non-quantitative papers should be rejected (or, at least, should have =\r\na much higher threshold to gain acceptance). Obviously I think this paper i=\r\ns interesting and will benefit the scientific community, partly because it =\r\nsuggests new ideas (though it can&#39;t quantify all of them yet). Do you think=\r\n our field is better off barring such papers because they can&#39;t quantitativ=\r\nely &quot;prove&quot; they are better than some alternate algorithm in some way? Of c=\r\nourse I&#39;m not advocating that all papers should lack quantitative results; =\r\njust that we should not rule out such papers if they don&#39;t have statistical=\r\n comparisons. I do want to stress that I always include--and as a reviewer,=\r\n insist upon--a statistical test with a p-value *if* a quantitative claim i=\r\ns made, but that policy is not inconsistent with the view that many interes=\r\nting, subjective, qualitative observations are scientifically worthwhile to=\r\no. \n\nI won&#39;t take any criticism of our paper personally. I just think that =\r\nsometimes arguments are more informative when there is a specific example t=\r\no be discussed, instead of remaining entirely abstract. I also think this p=\r\naper is a nice example of a technique that can&#39;t be quantified in an inform=\r\native way, yet remains an interesting contribution. If you were our reviewe=\r\nr, would you insist upon a quantitative comparison for this paper? How woul=\r\nd you recommend such a test be made? Do you agree that we should encourage =\r\nreviewers to reject such papers, or that we should work to encourage review=\r\ners to consider such papers?\n\nHere is the cite and PDF: \n\nClune J, Chen A, =\r\nLipson H (2013) Upload Any Object and Evolve it: Injecting Complex Geometri=\r\nc Patterns into CPPNs for Further Evolution.

Indeed,\n&gt; Ken, you are the living proof that one can=\r\n publish novel ideas with\n&gt; qualitative results only(*) and, though getting=\r\n such papers accepted may be\n&gt; frustrating, it is the price to pay to avoid=\r\n getting *any* random ideas\n&gt; published. However, look at the benefit: once=\r\n accepted, how many works have\n&gt; been following the original idea of novelt=\r\ny search or CPPN?\n&gt; \n&gt; Moreover, let&#39;s keep in mind that for a conference/j=\r\nournal, there are\n&gt; several reviewers per paper, and then it is up to the e=\r\nditor or\n&gt; track/conference chair to check reviews for inconsistent or cont=\r\nroversial\n&gt; papers, and ask for complementary reviews if needed -- As an ex=\r\nample with\n&gt; the GECCO 2013 ALIFE track, we provided at least 5 reviews per=\r\n paper, and\n&gt; up to 7 for controversial papers. ie. decisions end up as the=\r\n results from\n&gt; the combined work of individual reviewers and editors, rath=\r\ner than being\n&gt; not just be numerical sum&averaging. In the end, a rejected=\r\n paper may be so\n&gt; because it has failed to convince the majority of review=\r\ners, would it be\n&gt; because it is too weak or out of topic wrt. the conferen=\r\nce/journal, but\n&gt; definitely not because a single reviewer killed the paper=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, the fact that canonical, syntactically-correct, papers wi=\r\nth\n&gt; quantitative results are more likely to get accepted is not a good thi=\r\nng\n&gt; either. If you look at the vast number of publications per year in our=\r\n\n&gt; field, there is already quite some noise (ie. papers that will be forgot=\r\nten\n&gt; for good or bad reasons), and few papers are actually used to inspire=\r\n new\n&gt; research in the years after - which can be seen more or less as an a=\r\n\n&gt; posteriori relevant evaluation of a paper&#39;s contribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems =\r\nto me that the problem is not about accepting more or less papers\n&gt; with or=\r\n without qualitative results only, but about leaving more room/time\n&gt; to pr=\r\nesentation and discussion around novel works, would they be with\n&gt; quantita=\r\ntive or qualitative results -- On the one hand, the current oral\n&gt; presenta=\r\ntion format in conferences, IMHO, partly fail to provide this\n&gt; space: leav=\r\ning 5 minutes for question is a bit ridiculous IMHO. On the\n&gt; other hand, t=\r\nhe poster sessions in most AI/EC conferences often leaves me\n&gt; very frustra=\r\nted (2 hours for more than one hundred posters, combined with a\n&gt; social ev=\r\nent), with the very notable exception of the PPSN conference\n&gt; (Parrallel P=\r\nroblem Solving from Nature). At PPSN, there are only posters: a\n&gt; conferenc=\r\ne chair (who read your paper) does approx. 3 minutes personal\n&gt; presentatio=\r\nn/interpretation for a dozen of posters, and then you have ~2\n&gt; hours to wa=\r\nnder around and visit posters, which often leads to you\n&gt; selecting 2-3 pos=\r\nters (There are several such sessions a day, in sequential\n&gt; order, without=\r\n any particular topic for a session). The time for discussion\n&gt; is therefor=\r\ne significant enough to have a true scientific interaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; A decent p=\r\noster session with a lower selection rate (~50%? unlike PPSN)\n&gt; would possi=\r\nbly enable to take some risks with accepting contributions, and\n&gt; giving an=\r\nyone the opportunity to present new ideas, without removing the\n&gt; fact that=\r\n if you want to get your work accepted for a conference talk or a\n&gt; journal=\r\n publication (with high selection rate), you have to work hard to\n&gt; convinc=\r\ne reviewers and editors (as it is already the case for many\n&gt; journals). To=\r\n some extent, this is already done elsewhere, for example in\n&gt; the annual m=\r\neeting of the Society for Neuroscience (thousands of\n&gt; attendants, many man=\r\ny posters, keynote talks).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nicolas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; (*) don&#39;t get me=\r\n wrong, you also published many very good papers with\n&gt; quantitative result=\r\ns ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 2013/4/22 Julian Togelius &lt;julian@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;s=\r\nnip-snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; On 21 April 2013 01:18, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;snip-snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
