This surprises me.  Surely I&#39;m not the only\n&gt; code monkey here. :)  How are you guys spending your time?\n&gt; \n\nI know a number of people in this group are working on NEAT-related\nprojects.  I think a lot of people are lurking, or mentioned their\nprojects before and don&#39;t feel like describing them again.  \n\nSo since this question comes up once a while, here&#39;s what I did:  I\nadded a bunch of projects I know of to the following part of the NEAT\nUsers Page:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html#users\n\nFor the ones I just added, I did not include names or links in most\ncases, in order to protect the anonymity of the researcher/hobbyist\ninvolved.  So, if you see your project listed there, and you want to\nget credit or have it linked, let me know and I will add in your name\nand link.  (Likewise if you want your project removed from the list ,\nI will remove it at your request)\n\nHope this helps answer your question.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
