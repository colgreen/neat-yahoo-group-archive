Before I do this though I want to \n&gt; implement a more simple problem domain, one that is fast to \nevaluate so \n&gt; that experiments can be run a lot faster....\n&gt; \n\nI look forward to seeing how this goes.  It would be interesting to \ncompare it to the &quot;mixed&quot; search of Derek and Philip.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)OCR - Optical Character Recognition. The plan is to expose a set \nof 2D \n&gt; bitmaps, in turn, to the inputs of an NN. The number of outputs \nwill \n&gt; reflect the number of 2D maps in the current set, so that the NN \ncan \n&gt; indicate which character it &#39;thinks&#39; it is looking at by setting \nthe \n&gt; appropriate output high. Straightforward and hopefully very fast. \nAlso \n&gt; the problem difficulty can be adjusted by changing the set size, \nthe \n&gt; data in the sets and the dimensions of each character.  Using such \na \n&gt; scheme allows us to very rapidly increase the input/output space - \nwhich \n&gt; we know is going to cause NEAT difficulties. I can then experiment \non \n&gt; this domain with phased searching switched on to see if it \nimproves the \n&gt; NNs we can generate.\n&gt; \n\nIt might be easier to evolve a single classifier net for each \ncharacter, i.e. &quot;is it or isn&#39;t it an &#39;a&#39;?&quot;  That obviously reduces \nthe output space a lot.  Then you could combine all these separate \nnetworks into a single network and let NEAT evolve interconnections \nto improve how they interact with each other...just an idea!\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
