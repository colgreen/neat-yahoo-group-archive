I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; simulator). \n\nDo you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\nsome point upload ANN controllers into physical\nhardware?\n\nInterestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\nand integrate a robot control domain into the Java\nimplementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\nwith Soccerbots:\n\nhttp://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n\nIt&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\nother robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\nwas primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\nand was not especially suited for evolving ANN\ncontrollers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\npurpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\nit).\n\nIt simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\nplayed on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\ngolf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\nup to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n(all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\ngoalie can have a different controller than a\nforward).\n\nIf this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\nstuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\nhappy to share our implementation.  If not, good\nluck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n\n&gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; predefined movement\n&gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n\nSoccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\nreturn 2d vectors to various objects on the field. \nEach has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\nvector object, which contains both the x and y\ncoordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\nangle in radians to the object.  There are methods\nthat return position of both goals and each player. \nFor my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\ninformation for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\ngoal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n\nThere are only three actuators in Soccerbots: \n\n--Set heading in radians.\n--Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n--Kick the ball\n\nCurrently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\nclamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n(basically always kicking).\n\nSince each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n(angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\nabout five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\ninputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n\nWe&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\nagainst hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\npackage (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\nfor coevolutionary runs as well.\n\nAnyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\ninterest in this domain.  Anybody else have\nexperiences or thoughts on robot control domains? \nRobot soccer?  Multi-agent systems?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nGet better spam protection with Yahoo! Mail.\nhttp://antispam.yahoo.com/tools\n\n"}}
