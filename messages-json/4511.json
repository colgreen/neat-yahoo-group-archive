You may indeed be right that a page of\nsele=\r\ncted merchandise would work better, that&#39;s a good thought.\n\nThe whole merch=\r\nandise idea was kind of an experiment, and so far it&#39;s\nnot very successful.=\r\n  But the hypothesis was that people might find it\ncool to be able to purch=\r\nase something that they themselves had a hand\nin creating.  I still believe=\r\n that if done right, there is an element\nof truth to that idea.  Perhaps it=\r\n would be more true with higher-end\ntype products.  For example, if you evo=\r\nlved your own coffee table\nperhaps you&#39;d be more interested in purchasing i=\r\nt than a T-shirt. \nStill, I would think some people would enjoy an evolved =\r\nT-shirt, mug,\nstamps, framed picture, etc.  We may try your approach.\n\nken\n=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nHi Ken, Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the merchandise it probably makes sense to get=\r\n the opinion\n&gt; of a marketing expert - contrary to popular belief they&#39;re n=\r\not all\n&gt; useless :)  I&#39;d recommend googling Seth Goldin and checking out th=\r\nis\n&gt; lecture he did at google:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=\r\n=3D-6909078385965257294&ei=3DqexESY-2I4WGiQKx4aW-DQ&q=3Dall+marketers+\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n From the top of my head I&#39;d say that a lot of the images probably\n&gt; don&#39;t =\r\nwork too well as mug or T-shirt art. So although it&#39;s nice to\n&gt; have the &#39;b=\r\nuy this on a...&#39; option available, I see that as a\n&gt; secondary sales channe=\r\nl. I think you need a more prominent link to a\n&gt; merchandise page that has =\r\na a few pre-selected images that work well\n&gt; on T&#39;s and mugs etc. So if I&#39;m=\r\n surfing for T-Shirts I can go straight\n&gt; to the merchandising page and see=\r\n some good T-shirt designs right away\n&gt; without being put off by pages of d=\r\nesign that don&#39;t work - as a surfer\n&gt; I may not have any clue what picbreed=\r\ner is, just that it came up on a\n&gt; T-shirt search and &quot;oooh, those look coo=\r\nl&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought. In general I think the site works really well and =\r\nis\n&gt; well put together.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
