I\nagree that they do not do a good job of motivating their choice of the\nfunction used in their interaction map (the local alignment of sequences).\nPartly because of that, I am inclined to think it unlikely that they\nstumbled onto a good one by accident. However, we do know that (at least in\ntheir 4 example problems) AGE seems to do well in comparison to GP and NEAT.\nWhy is it that it does well?\n\nAs you emphasize more in your first reply in this thread, it seems that the\nreason AGE does well is because it can take advantage of powerful genetic\noperators such as genome and gene duplication. I get the gist from their\npaper that they think this is the main advantage of AGE as well.\n\nIt would be really interesting to see them experiment with AGE by\nsystematically turning off some of these genetic operators and see how\nperformance is affected. Has anyone here read the two other AGE works they\ncite (reference numbers 35 and 37 in the paper)? They might perform such\nexperiments there. \n\nAs far as comparing AGE to HyperNEAT, if it is the case that the genetic\noperators are what is driving AGE&#39;s success, how do you feel HyperNEAT\nallows (or substitutes) for such operators? I can think of HyperNEAT analogs\nto things like gene duplication, but I would be interested in hearing your\ntake on it. \n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n517.214.1060\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2008 23:40:19 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Hi Ken. How do you feel about Analog Genetic Encoding\n&gt; (AGE)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you make a good point.  If you strip down the whole idea of\n&gt; an &quot;interaction map,&quot; all you really have left is a function that\n&gt; takes two nodes as input and outputs the parameters of the\n&gt; associated connection between them.  In AGE, that function is based\n&gt; on a matching scheme.  So the deeper question is, towards what kinds\n&gt; of patterns are matching schemes biased? It&#39;s all about bias when\n&gt; you&#39;re talking about indirect encoding.  I do not see any argument\n&gt; that there is a beneficial bias for a matching scheme.  The only\n&gt; thing the authors really say to recommend the matching scheme is\n&gt; that it allows a continuum of values.  Yet so do many other types of\n&gt; functions.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes, the crux of the issue is that any method for assigning\n&gt; values to compoments of a structure should ideally be based on some\n&gt; kind of principle that addresses how (i.e. in what kinds of\n&gt; patterns) we would like those values to relate to the underlying\n&gt; structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that the AGE papers seem to imply that AGE could theoretically\n&gt; use methods other than matching schemes in the interaction map.  But\n&gt; then, what other methods?  It seems the most viable alternative\n&gt; assignment method is just to collapse into HyperNEAT.  So the real\n&gt; core focus should be the matching scheme itself, i.e. not the gene\n&gt; alphabet and methods of recombination that AGE focuses on.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yes Ken. That&#39;s also what my question was referring, what advantage\n&gt;&gt; does it have. I can see AGE producing complex patterns via a\n&gt; intricate\n&gt;&gt; interaction map (or matching scheme, are they just different terms\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; the same mechanism?) And I suppose you can evolve the interaction\n&gt; map\n&gt;&gt; too. But then how would that be any different than HyperNeat if you\n&gt;&gt; just consider a matching scheme as a general function with input\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; output. It seems to me HyperNeat take one more abstraction away and\n&gt;&gt; made it more focus on the end result with is patterns of\n&gt; organization.\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe I am just not understanding the essence of GRN and AGE?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (This is my first post.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I recently came upon some literatures on Analog Genetic\n&gt; Encoding\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developed by Mattiussi and Floreano. It&#39;s interesting but\n&gt; certainly\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not revolutionary. After all it&#39;s just a simplified version of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gene-regulation in real biological system. Some stats shows it\n&gt; is as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; robust as Neat. (Probably not tested against HyperNeat)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you had any experience with it?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no experience with Mattiussi&#39;s Analog Genetic Encoding\n&gt; aside \n&gt;&gt;&gt; from reading about it myself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is similar in a way to Joseph Reisinger&#39;s work with evolving\n&gt; a GRN-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; based encoding with NEAT, as Joe mentions in his response to\n&gt; your \n&gt;&gt;&gt; post.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is interesting as an abstraction of  developmental encoding\n&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature.  In particular, it broadens our perspective on how such\n&gt;&gt;&gt; abstractions can work and from which aspects of development they\n&gt; can \n&gt;&gt;&gt; draw.  The abstraction seems fairly high-level, i.e. it\n&gt; abstracts \n&gt;&gt;&gt; away such details as chemical diffusion and growth from an\n&gt; embryo.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In that way, it has some similarities to HyperNEAT.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; The main question it brings to my mind is what exactly\n&gt; recommends \n&gt;&gt;&gt; this particular abstraction over any other.  Although the\n&gt; authors \n&gt;&gt;&gt; note that it allows a large variety of genetic operations, aside\n&gt; from \n&gt;&gt;&gt; that, it is unclear what the main principle is that supports the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; approach, i.e. why we should prefer it to any other indirect\n&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, as a proponent of CPPNs and HyperNEAT, I think that\n&gt; one \n&gt;&gt;&gt; important ingredient for a developmental encoding is the ability\n&gt; to \n&gt;&gt;&gt; create patterns as a function of the domain geometry (as in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; substrate in HyperNEAT).  AGE does not have such a capability.\n&gt; Its \n&gt;&gt;&gt; interactions are detached from the geometry of the ultimate\n&gt; network \n&gt;&gt;&gt; it encodes, which suggests to me that it may fare worse in\n&gt; domains \n&gt;&gt;&gt; with a geometric basis, especially those with high\n&gt;&gt;&gt; resolution/granularity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I also wonder why connection-centric parameters (such as\n&gt; weights) \n&gt;&gt;&gt; should be derived through a matching scheme like sequence\n&gt; alignment \n&gt;&gt;&gt; (which is one way AGE sets up its &quot;device interaction map.&quot;)\n&gt; This \n&gt;&gt;&gt; idea seems to be taken from biology simply for the sake of doing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; something similarly to biology.  Yet such matching schemes are\n&gt; ad hoc \n&gt;&gt;&gt; because they do not relate to anything extrinsic to the genome.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT relates its connection weights to the outside world by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; computing them as a function of the locations of nodes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; As for comparisons with NEAT, I do believe that indirect\n&gt; encodings, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; including AGE, should generally be superior to direct encodings\n&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt; tasks that involve moderate-sized patterns.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
