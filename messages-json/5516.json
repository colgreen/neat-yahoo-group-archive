This=\r\n is not really an argument with anything you said, but mainly a commentary =\r\non the meaning of &quot;objective&quot; that I think draws a useful distinction.\n\nI d=\r\non&#39;t deny that the word &quot;objective&quot; in a dictionary or common-use sense can=\r\n be used to cover &quot;survive and reproduce.&quot;  However, I think the idea that =\r\nsurvive-and-reproduce is an objective causes a lot of confusion for the fie=\r\nld of evolutionary computation and therefore should be dropped.  The proble=\r\nm is that &quot;objective&quot; in evolutionary computation has come to mean &quot;what we=\r\n want to evolve,&quot; which is a lot different from survive-and-reproduce.  Thu=\r\ns these are really two different types of things, and therefore the word &quot;o=\r\nbjecitve&quot; does us a disservice by conflating them as a single type of probl=\r\nem.\n\nFor example, consider that the very first organism(s) on Earth in the =\r\nvery first generation already could survive and reproduce.  Yet since when =\r\nhave we run an evolutionary algorithm whose &quot;objective&quot; is already achieved=\r\n in the very first generation (unless it&#39;s something very trivial)?  In oth=\r\ner words, it is part of the &quot;algorithm&quot; of nature that survive-and-reproduc=\r\ne is achieved from the start, which is a strange idea for a traditional EC =\r\nobjective.\n\nThen, from that point, this so-called &quot;objective&quot; is simply ach=\r\nieved and re-achieved over and over again.  This dynamic is completely cont=\r\nrary to the kind of objective in an EA, which you would stop as soon as the=\r\n objective is achieved, not leave running. Yet in nature all the greatness =\r\nis from leaving it running after the &quot;objective&quot; is already achieved.\n\nSo I=\r\n think survive-and-reproduce isn&#39;t what we mean by an objective in EC.  We =\r\nmean things that haven&#39;t been achieved that we want the algorithm to achiev=\r\ne in the future.  \n\nThis distinction is important because it shows why the =\r\nEA-style of objective is potentially handicapped.  After all, if you look a=\r\ngain at nature, what we marvel at is what it evolved, not the survival and =\r\nreproduction itself.  We marvel at brains and wings and photosynthesis.  Th=\r\nese artifacts are much closer to what EC means by an &quot;objective&quot; than survi=\r\nve-and-reproduce.  Yet they were *not* the objective; they are orthogonal d=\r\niscoveries on the road to nowhere in particular.  And that is why I think i=\r\nn spirit, in the spirit of EC at least, nature has no EC-style objective.  =\r\nAll its power is from the fact that it discovers things that it is not rewa=\r\nrded explicitly to produce.  In that sense, for me, saying that nature has =\r\nno objective captures more clearly how starkly different it is from the way=\r\n we traditionally run our algorithms and the way we think about search toda=\r\ny.\n\nPerhaps it can be said more succinctly:  For EC, an objective is someth=\r\ning for which the algorithm is explicitly rewarded for producing.  In this =\r\nsense, the kinds of things nature produced are not objectives.  Thus nature=\r\n is a non-objective search.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Gree=\r\nn &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2 April 2011 00:09, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; Brian Woolley and I are pleased to announce our new paper to appe=\r\nar at GECCO, &quot;On the\n&gt; &gt; Deleterious Effects of A Priori Objectives on Evol=\r\nution and Representation.&quot; You can get it\n&gt; &gt; here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs=\r\n.ucf.edu/papers/woolley_gecco11.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, I definitely think this is=\r\n worthy research avenue. I have a\n&gt; few thoughts on the subject that I&#39;d li=\r\nke to express, some more well\n&gt; formed than others :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, there i=\r\ns of course an objective driving evolution in the\n&gt; natural world albeit a =\r\nvery broad one, that is, being able to survive\n&gt; and for long enough to rep=\r\nroduce (and anything else you can do towards\n&gt; increasing the chances that =\r\nyour offspring will survive and\n&gt; reproduce). It just so happens that the n=\r\natural world has an incredily\n&gt; complex structure that allows for many diff=\r\nerent ways (niches) of\n&gt; eking out a living with a wide range of strategies=\r\n from the relatively\n&gt; simple (e.g. single celled algae floating in the sea=\r\n) to the more\n&gt; complex (e.g. writing software for a living). It also just =\r\nso happens\n&gt; that the sub-environments and niches have significant overlap =\r\nin terms\n&gt; of the strategies that work in one can sort of work in many othe=\r\nrs. As\n&gt; such there are many routes for evolution to take from simple to\n&gt; =\r\ncomplex life, not just a series of stepping stones but complex\n&gt; overlappin=\r\ng and criss-crossing paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evolution discovered eyesight independentl=\r\ny multiple times over\n&gt; because it was a recurring &#39;problem&#39; in all of thes=\r\ne evolutionary\n&gt; niches and one for which a solution was &#39;nearby&#39; in the en=\r\ncoding space\n&gt; of biological genetics, the same is true for other phenomeno=\r\nn (flight\n&gt; has been discovered independently, e.g. insects, birds, bats). =\r\nThis\n&gt; kind of shows that the biological encoding space is perhaps less\n&gt; s=\r\nusceptible to getting stuck than NEAT (but it does have a lot more\n&gt; space-=\r\ntime to play with, so perhaps not that much better)\n&gt; \n&gt; So for me the main=\r\n lesson from nature is that if you wish to evolve\n&gt; agents with complex str=\r\nategies then you probably need to a complex\n&gt; environment (fitness space) t=\r\nhat provides a wide range of overlapping\n&gt; niches and stepping stones all t=\r\nhe way from the simple through to the\n&gt; complex. So from this perspective t=\r\nhe miracle of life on earth is due\n&gt; 50% to the mirace of evolution and 50%=\r\n due to the miracle of the\n&gt; structure of the natural world. Evolution did =\r\nneed large numbers to\n&gt; work with (e.g. vast oceans of microscopic single c=\r\nelled creatures and\n&gt; 3.5 billion years) to make all the leaps required to =\r\nget where it is,\n&gt; but each of those leaps was possible because of the over=\r\nlapping nature\n&gt; of the available niches.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s perhaps this latter 50%=\r\n of the miracle that is generally\n&gt; overlooked in evolutionary computing ci=\r\nrcles, we&#39;ve tended to see the\n&gt; process of evolution as the solution but h=\r\nave overlooked the\n&gt; absolutely pivotal role of deep complexity in the fitn=\r\ness space.\n&gt; Without that complexity probably the best you can do is to mak=\r\ne one of\n&gt; those small leaps - essentially searching a local space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne problem with objective based search then, as I see it, is that the\n&gt; obje=\r\nctives we have tended to focus on are too focused and rigid.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
