Like you, I try to keep an open mind, and there may be\nsome interesting ideas, or ones that could be spurred from reading\nabout Thaler&#39;s stuff, but big giant warning lights go off in my head\nwhen I read passages about neural networks or AI that contains\nhyperbolic, grandiose, or sometimes simply incoherent rhetoric.  Such\nas:\n\n&quot;Creativity Machines represent a new kind of neural network paradigm\nthat is capable of generating, rather than just associating, patterns.\nThey are based upon what we believe to be a significant scientific\ndiscovery, that a neural network exposed to any conceptual space and\nthen internally irritated, in a specially prescribed way, tends to\ngenerate coherent ideas derived from its absorbed wisdom.&quot;\n\nIt tends to generate coherent ideas derived from its absorbed wisdom?  Huh?\n\nSome of the passages on the site are simply laughable:\n\n&quot; In a nutshell, this advantage derives from the close similarity of\nan all neural construction that emulates the brain (i.e., the seat of\nintelligence)..&quot;\n\nGee, thanks for the heads up.  I thought the kidney was the seat of\nintelligence.\n\nLooking for unbiased information wasn&#39;t very fruitful.  I came across\nthis Mercury News article, which contained passages like this one:\n\n&quot;In biological brains, the information-carrying cells, called neurons,\nmeet at junctions, called synapses. Brain chemicals, such as\nadrenaline and dopamine, flow across the junctions to stimulate or\nsoothe the cells. In the computer world, there are switches instead of\ncells. The switches are connected by numbers, or ``weights.&#39;&#39;\n\nSo after work, Thaler went home and created the epitome of a killer\napplication -- a computer program he called the Grim Reaper.\n\nThe reaper dismantles neural networks by changing its connection\nweights. It is the biological equivalent of killing neurons. Pick off\nenough neurons, and the result is death.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1989, Thaler typed the lyrics to some of his favorite\nChristmas carols into a neural network.&quot;\n\nHow do you &quot;type&quot; the lyrics of a song into a neural network?\n\n&quot;Once he&#39;d taught the network the songs, he unleashed the Grim Reaper.\nAs the reaper slashed away connections, the network&#39;s digital life\nbegan to flash before its eyes. The program randomly spit out\nperfectly remembered carols as the killer application severed the\nfirst connections. But as its wounds grew deeper, and the network\nfaded toward black, it began to hallucinate.\n\nThe network wove its remaining strands of memory together, producing\nwhat someone else might interpret as damaged memories, but what Thaler\nrecognized as new ideas. In its death spiral, the program dreamed up\nnew carols, each created from shards of its shattered memories.&quot;\n\nUm...okay.  I&#39;d be a lot more willing to approach Thaler&#39;s ideas if it\nwere presented in a fairly straightforward manner, without all the\nhyperbolic window dressing.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
