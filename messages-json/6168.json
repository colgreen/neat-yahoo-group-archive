In contrast, the novelty\n&gt; th=\r\nreshold\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is specified in terms of a more abstract quantity (i.e. nove=\r\nlty\n&gt; scores),\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and while this threshold can also be adjusted dynamic=\r\nally to add one\n&gt; or two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; individuals per generation on average, it c=\r\nan add some complication\n&gt; to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; implementation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Addi=\r\nng to the archive probabilistically (i.e. each new individual has\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; so=\r\nme fixed chance of being added to the archive regardless of how\n&gt; novel\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; they are) may also be more principled than the threshold method.

Whether\n=\r\n&gt; novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; search is performed generationally or in a steady-state al=\r\ngorithm, I\n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that taking the population into account in some w=\r\nay or another when\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; calculating the novelty of new individuals can of=\r\nten be very helpful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In particular, the motivation for me=\r\nasuring novelty against the\n&gt; current\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; population as well as the arch=\r\nive is to take all available\n&gt; information into\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; account. While it is=\r\n true that the archive alone provides some\n&gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; about where=\r\n in the space of behaviors has *previously* been searched,\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pop=\r\nulation gives additional information about where is *currently*\n&gt; being\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; searched.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In other words, it is likely desirable to h=\r\nave the population itself\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; spread over the space of previously unexpl=\r\nored behaviors. If only the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; archive is taken into account, it is pos=\r\nsible that the population\n&gt; itself\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may converge to searching one nov=\r\nel area of the behavior space (where\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are few archive points)=\r\n, which could potentially lead down blind\n&gt; alleys.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When the populat=\r\nion is taken into account there is some repulsive\n&gt; force\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; within the=\r\n population to maintain diversity and explore different\n&gt; novel\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; area=\r\ns of the behavior space -- which may in general benefit exploring\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; overall search for novelty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=B9=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=B9\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That said, the simpler algorithm yo=\r\nu suggest is interesting.

In my informal experiments it=\r\n didn&#39;t seem to have a large effect on the overall effectiveness of sea=\r\nrch. But, the probabilistic method is simpler to implement and I like how i=\r\nt directly samples where search is spending most time in the space of pheno=\r\ntypic behaviors -- which is the underlying motivation for the archive. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nI think you are right, that the threshold version also approximates =\r\nthis sampling process over time, and that the slight repulsive force of add=\r\ning a highly-novel individual to the archive in that version may be mitigat=\r\ned by averaging over many nearest-neighbors. So overall this implementation=\r\n detail might not be a determining factor in novelty search&#39;s success o=\r\nr failure in most domains.

If only the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\narchive is taken into account, it is possible that the population itself&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; may converge to searching one novel area of the behavior sp=\r\nace (where there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are few archive points), which could pot=\r\nentially lead down blind alleys.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When the population is t=\r\naken into account there is some repulsive force&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; within th=\r\ne population to maintain diversity and explore different novel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; areas of the behavior space -- which may in general benefit exploring=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; overall search for novelty.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=B9=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=B9&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That said, the si=\r\nmpler algorithm you suggest is interesting. It seems a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bi=\r\nt more greedy in nature and may work well sometimes in practice. One&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; slightly strange thing about it is that the evaluation order of=\r\n individuals&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; within a generation may matter; that is, the=\r\n novelty of an individual&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evaluated later in the populati=\r\non may be affected by archive additions&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; earlier. I am not=\r\n sure if that is bad or good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In a generational novelty search in particula=\r\nr, it may be wise to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reduce selection pressure or increas=\r\ne the number of nearest neighbors&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; considered in calculate=\r\nd novelty. The reason is that unlike in the steady&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; state =\r\nvariation, where the novelty of an individual will smoothly vary over&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; time (as individuals are replaced individually), in a generati=\r\nonal model,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the novelty of an individual can change abrup=\r\ntly over generations (what is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; novel one generation may no=\r\nt be novel even the next generation). To provide&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a smooth=\r\ner gradient, it may thus be important to reduce novelty pressure&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; (e.g. by decreasing the greediness of the search through the surviv=\r\nal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; threshold or however you are applying pressure, or by =\r\nincreasing the size&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the neighborhood considered for ca=\r\nlculating novelty, which may also&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; smooth novelty calculat=\r\nions).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I hope you find this r=\r\nesponse informative, while novelty search is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; viable wheth=\r\ner it is generational or steady-state, there are some factors&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; that may increase its performance when specializing the algorithm to&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; generational or steady-state evolutionary algorithms in pa=\r\nrticular.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Joel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/=\r\na&gt;, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a question about implementing novelty search in =\r\na generational&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; GA.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;A=\r\nbandoning Objectives: Evolution through the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sea=\r\nrch for Novelty Alone&quot; (Lehman and Stanley, 2011, pg 13), it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; suggests&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it&#39;s nec=\r\nessary (or at least a good idea) to determine the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; novelty=\r\n of&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; an individual against the=\r\n archive and the (entire) current population.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m wondering why this is better than the fo=\r\nllowing approach:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for (individual I in populati=\r\non)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; N =3D novelty of I measured against archive=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; if (N &gt; threshold)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; add I to archive&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; That is, if you iterate through the population, adding individuals to&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; archive as you go, then is t=\r\nhis equivalent (or a reasonable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; approximation)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to checking each individual against the entire population=\r\n and the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; archive?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, why=\r\n not?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks =\r\nin advance for any assistance! :)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T: 0421 972 953 | =\r\nE: oliver.coleman@ | W: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://ojcoleman.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://ojcoleman.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--f46d0421848581209e04e0c0cee7--\r\n\n"}}
