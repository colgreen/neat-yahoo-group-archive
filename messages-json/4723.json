Do you think this result in some simplified hard and fas=\r\nt\n&gt; rules you/we can use to get near optimal experimental setups with\n&gt; min=\r\nimal effort/thought?\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\nhave you guys considered for NEAT v2 a g=\r\nene to be not just a link, but a group of links ? And even more, a gene to =\r\nbe a well defined large network ? I have found this video called &quot;inner lif=\r\ne of a cell&quot;, amazing video btw:\nhttp://www.studiodaily.com/main/searchlist=\r\n/6850.html\nfor example, check the motor protein walking on the video and ca=\r\nrrying a sphere of lipids, that gene has only one function of &quot;moving stuff=\r\n&quot;. Could next version of NEAT evolve something like that and separate it as=\r\n a net and name it as some sort of &quot;complex gene&quot;, for later reuse to build=\r\n more complex structures? For example, it would scan through whole populati=\r\non, and recognize inside each network, a small subnetwork that is repeating=\r\n along many species, then it would disconnect this network, and name it as =\r\na gene. Do you think it could work ?\n\nThanks for your comments.\nNikolai\n\n\n\n"}}
