It has been shown recently that in some \ncases a very small population is sufficient.  For example, my \ndissertation includes pole balancing experiments with populations as \nsmall as 16 that evolved extremely fast.  This has also been shown \nin some ES methods (e.g. CMA-ES), as mentioned in my dissertation.\n\nI have a feeling small pops won&#39;t work well on problems that have \nmany local optima, since they can&#39;t maintain diversity.  But a \npopulation of 50 can support about 4 healthy species, so it may be \nsufficient.  Our NERO project uses a population of 50 with good \nresults.  So it&#39;s worth a try at least.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t know if anyone else has had a chance to look at our paper, \nbut\n&gt; we&#39;re still moving forward with this line of research and we had a\n&gt; general question we thought we&#39;d throw out to the group.\n&gt; \n&gt; We can evolve eyes that get in the upper 90s percentage-wise for\n&gt; identifying objects, but that last 2 or 3 percent is eluding us.  \nWhen\n&gt; evolving, we have a pop size of 100, and 30 randomized objects for\n&gt; evaluation.  But a best-evolved individual may have identifed all \n30\n&gt; correctly, but when shown a test set of 100, for example, it will\n&gt; still miss two or three.  It seems like the evaluation set may be \ntoo\n&gt; small to generalize *all* possible randomizations.\n&gt; \n&gt; So we thought about increasing the evaluation set, but our image\n&gt; processing is our big bottleneck, and the more evaluations we add, \nthe\n&gt; slower runs take.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does you think it makes sense to chop the pop size in half and up \nthe\n&gt; evaluation set during evolution?  Or does anybody have any other\n&gt; ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n\n"}}
