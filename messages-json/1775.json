I bumped it up to a gig\nwith -Xmx1000m and it works now.\n\nNormal single pole-balancing works now with JNeat, and I&#39;ll post a\nversion to the files section of the group when I comment my code.\n\nCiao Ugo,\n\nSorry it&#39;s taken me a while to get back to you. I put the error aside\nfor a while because I was in the middle of final exams, but I just\nstarted working with JNeat again. Increasing the java heap size seems to\nhave fixed the problem.\n\nAnyway, I modified gui.Generation.evaluate to make a\ngui.Generation.genericEvaluate. It might be useful to make something\nlike this a permanent part of JNeat so that it isn&#39;t restricted to\ntest-target data sets but can also be used for continuous feed-back\nproblems such as pole-balancing.\n\nHave you thought about putting JNeat up on SourceForge? I&#39;d like to work\non it a bit. The GUI is nice, although there are some ways it can be\nsimplified. Eventually it might be good to merge JNeat&#39;s GUI and logging\nstuff and ANJI&#39;s codebase. I&#39;ve also thought about trying to use JmDNS\n(i.e. zero-conf or Rendezvous) and RPC/CORBA so that multiple machines\nrunning JNeat will be able to work on the same problem, speeding up\nevolution a lot.\n\nI&#39;ll send you the work I&#39;ve done so far with pole-balancing in another\nemail. There is only single pole balancing (not double). Right now it is\nset up to do evolution using an image of the pole and cart. To make it\ninto a normal pole balancing evolution that uses 5 inputs, change \n&quot;pole = new PoleBalancing(gridInputs);&quot;\nto\n&quot;pole = new PoleBalancing();&quot;\nin roober.pole_fit.java\n\nand change \n&quot;public static final int nInputs = BinaryInputs.W * BinaryInputs.H;&quot;\nto\n&quot;public static final int nInputs = 5;&quot;\nin pole_inp.java\n\nCiao,\nReuben\n\n\nOn Dec 14, 2004, at 3:00 AM, Ugo wrote:\n\n\n\nHello Reuben\n\n(I truly ask forgiveness for my bad English and the delay but I have\napproached to single Internet point in determines periods , not every\nday !) \n\nI have read your question but for being able to help I would have need\nof knowing something more to you: \n\n1) the error message happens before during running or that beginnings\nthe generation? it tries to see where you have error putting of the\nsignallings or write in the program between the several ones is made\nthat beginnings before evolution\n\n2) you have used one class for input/ouput-target or a dataset fixed?\nif you have used the class it controls that the vector d[. ] it is\nwith correct size for computeFitness and main-application.\n\n3) if tests to visualize the genome that you have constructed come\nvisualized in correct way?\n\n\n\nNot is a lot but if in worse of cases if you want test to send me the\ngenome that uses and the modifications to make in order to try in my\nPC to simulate the error\n\n  Hello \n              Ugo\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Reuben Grinberg &lt;reuben.grinberg@y...&gt;\nwrote:\nHey Guys,\n\nI&#39;m using jNeat and I just modified the code so I could do \npole-balacing.
