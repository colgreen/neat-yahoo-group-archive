You might want to try this with your\n&gt; high-input domain as well.  He generally found it beneficial to start\n&gt; out with very few inputs attached and let NEAT attach inputs randomly\n&gt; through a special mutation that connects a disconnected input to all\n&gt; the outputs.  The rate of that mutation is somewhere between 0.05 and\n&gt; 0.2 in his experiments but it&#39;s still an empirical question what&#39;s\n&gt; best.  It would be interesting to see if it helps in OCR.\n\nThat&#39;s very clever indeed! How does the pick the initial inputs? Just \nrandomly over the set of possible inputs?\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
