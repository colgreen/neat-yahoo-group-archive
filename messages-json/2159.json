Such a network \nmay be \n&gt; able to pick up on more complex relationships between the \ndifferent \n&gt; techniques. e.g. if techniques 1 & 3 say it&#39;s junk but 2 doesn&#39;t \nthen 2 \n&gt; can be assumed to be right, in other scenarios though 2&#39;s answer \nmay be \n&gt; safely ignored. Of course there may be far more complex \nrelationships \n&gt; than this... or maybe not :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\nYes, interesting idea. In my opinion, such summation may have \nbenefit if input vector doesn&#39;t have contradictory values, but \npractically the statistical filter could start treat spam as \nlegitimate only because spammers found new way to trick the parser.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
