However reassigning policies for a\nfixed team could still be useful,=\r\n for example everytime an agent\ncompletes an objective HyperNEAT can assign=\r\n a new policy based on the\nagent&#39;s current position.  This method still has=\r\n the issues Ken\nmentioned, but not reassigning every time step might help m=\r\nitigate them.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, I agree that it would be interesting to experiment with=\r\n that\nidea.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does bring up an intriguing issue about role assignment=\r\n in teams. \n&gt; Is it best for each agent to have a fixed role that is assign=\r\ned a\n&gt; priori, or should roles constantly change based on position?  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFor example, in soccer, the roles are assigned based on a kind of\n&gt; virtual=\r\n configuration of players that may never actually exist on the\n&gt; field afte=\r\nr the initial kickoff.  As a result, if e.g. a forward drops\n&gt; back momenta=\r\nrily to play defense, he does not suddenly switch roles\n&gt; and *become* a fu=\r\nllback.  Rather, he goes back to being a forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would happen if=\r\n your role in soccer switched instantaneously with\n&gt; your position?  Then t=\r\nhe team could end up with problems where e.g.\n&gt; everyone on the team become=\r\ns offense at the same time by accident\n&gt; simply because they momentarily mo=\r\nved up the field.  Then who will go\n&gt; back to defend?  It seems there is a =\r\nuse to roles defined a priori.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet I imagine in other domains role mak=\r\nes more sense based on current\n&gt; position alone.  So it is probably domain-=\r\ndependent, and an\n&gt; interesting issue to think about.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing I thought about when I read the paper was, what would \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhappen if the CPPN generates the connectivity patterns depending on \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne relative positions of each individual in realtime while on the \n&gt; &gt; field=\r\n? It would require a great deal of computation time (it has to \n&gt; &gt; rebuild=\r\n the phenotype once per timestep per individual) but it may \n&gt; &gt; show inter=\r\nesting results. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio and I discuss =\r\nthe potential for HyperNEAT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; controlling multiple heterogeneous agent=\r\ns in this new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; paper, &quot;Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning,&quot; =\r\nto appear at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; GECCO 2008:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.=\r\nphp?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; option=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#dambrosio.g=\r\necco08\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Direct Link:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/paper=\r\ns/dambrosio_gecco08.pdf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We also have a nice sample of videos t=\r\nhat depict various evolved \n&gt; &gt; &gt; teams in action:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://eple=\r\nx.cs.ucf.edu/multiagenthyperneat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The interesting idea in this =\r\npaper is that just as a single \n&gt; &gt; &gt; connective CPPN can encode how a sing=\r\nle network varies over space, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it can also encode how a *set* of netw=\r\norks (each representing the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; policy of one agent on the team) varies =\r\nover space.  In this way, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT can learn an expression that enc=\r\nodes how policies vary \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over the team geometry.  For example, in a so=\r\nccer team agents vary \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from defensive to offensive as you move away f=\r\nrom the goal.  Part \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the power of this approach is that it me=\r\nans basic skills can be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; learned and shared among the whole team, sin=\r\nce the CPPN encodes how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; those skills vary across the field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
