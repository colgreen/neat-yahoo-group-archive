I have a couple of questions regarding the fitness penalty \n&gt;for species that have gone past the dropoff_age point with no improvement.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the C++ version of NEAT that I downloaded, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any \n&gt;check to see if the species being penalized is one of the top (if not *the* \n&gt;top) performers.  The literature I&#39;ve read on NEAT says &quot;in order to prevent \n&gt;stagnation, the lowest performing species over N generations old [is] not \n&gt;allowed to reproduce&quot;.  I don&#39;t see any such checks for &quot;lowest performing \n&gt;species&quot;.  This leads into my second question.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I can&#39;t see anything obvious. It&#39;s possible that this change was \nmade after the version of code you have. One for Ken I think. This topic \n(culling elite species in general) came up a while ago during work on \nSharpNEAT. I switched sharpneat from culling the best species, just as \nany other, to preserving them indefinitely. That way the user gets to \ndecide when to give up on the best species (by stopping the search) \nrather than some arbitrary number of generations in the search \nalgorithm(or config file). Taking a fresh look at this it would seem \nsensible to have two stagnation values - one for the elite and for for \nall other species. You could then set a zero value for the elite to \nprevent culling occuring on those if you wanted, depending on the type \nof experiment.\n\n&gt;If this is in fact the case, that no checks are made, then surely the \n&gt;population stagnancy check would not do much good, no?  The idea here seems \n&gt;to be not to allow any species to reproduce except for the top two if the \n&gt;entire population has not improved best fitness over N+5 generations (C++ \n&gt;version again).  Surely, since the best species would have been sterile -5 \n&gt;generations ago, at this point, only allowing it and the one below it to \n&gt;reproduce won&#39;t have much more of an effect than allowing any species to \n&gt;reproduce.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe basic idea is that species that have not improved for N generations \nwill have their fitness greatly reduced by dividing by a large number \n(100 in Ken&#39;s code). This means they are less likely to be selected as \nthe source of genetic material for the next generation. However, if the \nwhoe population has stagnated, then they all will by adjusted by the \nsame amount and therefore the algorithm runs just as if none of them \nwere adjusted - since the selection algorithm selects genomes/species \nbased on their relative fitness.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understood your query exactly, but hopefully that sheds \nsome light on the issue.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
