Hence option two is to establish a\nconsistent way of using the CPPN with just two inputs, the suggested\napproach is to use:\n\n    bias = f(x1, y1, 0, 0).\n\nMy first thought was that it might be better to use:\n\n    bias = f(0, 0, x1, y1).\n\nBecause I think of the bias as being a function of the target node\ncoord and the target is normally the second pair of inputs to the\nCPPN, although maybe I just got that bit wrong? Anyway, either way one\ndownside to this is that you have to be careful not to place another\nnode at (0,0), otherwise the CPPN can&#39;t distinguish between the real\nconnection and the bias connection. Thus I was thinking of using:\n\n    bias = f(x1, y1, x1, y1).\n\n\nHuh, but that foregoes the possibility of defining recurrent\nconnections on a node (connecting a node&#39;s output directly back to its\ninput), thus we can use that approach but it&#39;s not as general a\nsolution as I&#39;d initially thought.\n\nIt&#39;s tempting to &#39;solve&#39; the problem (that is, define a general scheme\nthat works everywhere always) by adding yet another CPPN input such as\na &#39;bias specifier&#39; input. Our CPPNs would now have inputs of\n(including the bias for the CPPN):\n\n    weight = f(1, x1, y1, x2, y2, biasFlag)\n\nThe biasFlag indicates that we are obtaining the weight to the bias\nnode, you still have to choose how you handle x1,y1,x2,y2 from the\nvarious options above but you don&#39;t have to worry [so much] about\noverlapping/clashing coordinates.\n\nThoughts?\n\nOne question is how this would affect ES-HyperNEAT (deriving node\nplacement from the structure of the Hypercube). One simple option is\nto just ignore the biasFlag input when determining node placement\n(input zero, or maybe some value between o and 1 to pick up on, to\nsome degree, any structure being generated specifically when the\nbiasFlag is on?).\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
