But for larger mazes (and mazes with more\n&gt; dimensions), you&#39;ll=\r\n eventually wind up with a lot of novelty memory. \n\nBut is this really true=\r\n?  As I mentioned, we have run novelty search\nin these mazes where the beha=\r\nvior is around 400 dimensions, which come\nfrom (x,y) on each timestep.  \n\nT=\r\nhus the space of possible trajectories is astronomical.  Yet even so,\nwith =\r\nthat type of characterization, there was no performance hit (in\nexperiments=\r\n not yet published).  What do you think that implies?  Do\nyou really feel t=\r\nhat one astronomical space is more expensive than\nanother?  For example, we=\r\n might have a 3 dimensional maze with a\nsimilar number of timesteps, but th=\r\nat would simply increase the\ndimensionality of behavior from 400 to 1200.  =\r\nThose are still both\nextremely high dimensional characterizations.  If movi=\r\nng from 2\ndimensions to 400 doesn&#39;t hurt, why would moving from 400 to 1200=\r\n?  \n\nI am not making an argument so much as just wondering what you think.\n=\r\n We are still trying to understand what actually makes a problem\nharder aft=\r\ner these strange results.\n\nI think it may have to do with complexification,=\r\n which imposes an\nimplicit order on the behaviors that are visited.  It ten=\r\nds to be that\nin the real world the behavior we would want is somehow meani=\r\nngful,\nwhich means it probably takes less neurons than crazy behaviors like=\r\n\n&quot;go to the left dead-end, turn around, zig-zag until you go to the\nright d=\r\nead-end, then run in circles 13 times and then go to the goal.&quot;\n I mean, if=\r\n that were something you were waiting for, it may take a\nvery long time to =\r\ncome up.\n\nBut real world problems seem to require somehow rational, regular=\r\n\nsolutions.  Going through a maze involves at least some general\n*princples=\r\n*, as does e.g. walking, or winning a game.\n\nIn other words, if the goal is=\r\n a rational behavior, the neural\nnetworks never become even close to big en=\r\nough to encompass all\npossible behaviors (because they encounter the soluti=\r\non at a\ncomplexity level well before they get that big) and therefore the\ns=\r\npace of behaviors that might be compared is astronomically smaller\nthan the=\r\n space of all possible behaviors.\n\n\n&gt; The\n&gt; main problem with this is that =\r\neach solution is tested against the\nentire\n&gt; novelty memory and the populat=\r\nion, which brings you towards O(n^2) which\n&gt; isn&#39;t good, unless you use som=\r\ne kind of spacial partitioning (which\n&gt; requires domain knowledge)/hashing =\r\nmethod (which doesn&#39;t require domain\n&gt; knowledge, but is potentially less e=\r\nfficient), that could bring you down\n&gt; to O(n*ln(n)). A vast improvement, b=\r\nut slow compared to what we&#39;re\nused to\n&gt; in GA which typically is O(N). \n&gt; =\r\n\n\nHowever, we are talking about comparing already-characterized\nbehaviors, =\r\nso the &quot;n&quot; in O(n^2) is not the same &quot;N&quot; that is in the\nO(N) for number of =\r\nevaluations.  Comparing two strings is not as\nexpensive as evaluating an in=\r\ndividual.  Still, there is clearly an\nissue in the long run with massive ar=\r\nchives becoming intractable to\ncompare with.  We do have some results that =\r\nsuggest it is possible to\ncompress archives substantially, also with little=\r\n loss of performance.\n However, these results are preliminary.  Compressing=\r\n the archive is\nan interesting issue.\n\n&gt; Your solution to problem 2 is inde=\r\ned elegant, I hadn&#39;t thought of that. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, I&#39;m indeed looking forw=\r\nard to be proved wrong, it would be very\n&gt; interesting to see the novelty m=\r\nethod used on another problem domain. I\n&gt; realize the maze problem is very =\r\ngraphic, understandable and easy to\n&gt; implement, but the novelty method has=\r\n a strength that the fitness method\n&gt; cannot compete with at all; problems =\r\nthat have no fitness function\nat all\n&gt; can still be solved. That&#39;s interest=\r\ning to me. Problems that are either\n&gt; solved or not solved but have no grad=\r\nient between solved and not solved\n&gt; can&#39;t be sovled with regular GA, but t=\r\nhey can with the novelty search\n&gt; method. If such a problem could be found,=\r\n then that would be very\n&gt; interesting indeed. \n&gt; \n\nI appreciate where you&#39;=\r\nre coming from.  Skepticism is certainly\nappropriate and healthy, which is =\r\nwhy your insights have been very\nhelpful.  Any other thoughts you have are =\r\ncertainly welcome.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
