I&#39;ve had\n&gt;discussion privately with Ken along these lines, and\n&gt;it&#39;s one of the experimental avenues I&#39;d definitely\n&gt;like to pursue.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI entirely agree with you on this one. I&#39;ve experimented with trimming \nin the past basically because it was necessary to prevent bloat. I \ncouldn&#39;t say whether it contributed in a positiive way to the \nfunctionality of the NN&#39;s (by removing old inhibitory functionality) but \ncombined with a small amount of selection against complexity it keeps \nthe population tight and therefore eliminates a lot of unnecessary CPU \ncycles - thus increasing the efficiency of the search as a whole.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
