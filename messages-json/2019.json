I had a lot of fun playing around with it, \nbut I\n&gt; can see how it could become a real time-thief ;) Did you come up \nwith any\n&gt; new cool features for NEAT in the process?\n&gt; \n\nActually we did come up with some pretty cool little ideas.  The \nmain innovation of course is making NEAT run in real time.  But on \ntop of that there were all kinds of lessons to be learned from doing \nsomething like this.  Most of it has to do with input and output \nrepresentation, though, rather than changes to NEAT itself.  The \nmain change to NEAT is making it rtNEAT, which is described in our \npapers on NERO.\n\n\n&gt; The comments on /. were very favourable also, which was nice also. \n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed that your site suffered the slashdot effect - it went \nbelly up\n&gt; from the intense load, but that&#39;s a common occurance.\n&gt; \n\nYeah it was really unbelievable how heavy the load was...the whole \nCS department server got bogged down and the main University IT \ninfrastructure even complained.  Eventually they actually cut off \nthe NERO domain entirely earlier today.  But we have resurrected our \nsite now in much better shape since we are providing downloads from \noffsite servers and torrents, so now we can handle all the visitors, \nthankfully.  I spent the whole morning on the phone and email with \nIT people trying to get things cleared up.  (I&#39;m not in Austin right \nnow since I&#39;m at GECCO)\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
