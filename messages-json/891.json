It&#39;s available through the website, and is also\nincluded in the distribution.\n\nBasically, when you download the .zip file for NEVT and extract it,\nthere are four directories:\n\n/complexity\n/fitness\n/network\n/species\n\nThey correspond to the four types of visual output NEVT generates.  In\neach directory there is a sample XML file, along with a DTD,\nindicating the format needed to generate images.\n\nI don&#39;t necessarily consider the current XML formats finalized.  I&#39;d\nreally like to get more feedback from anyone interested in using NEVT,\nand hopefully over the next few months we can improve it.\n\n&gt; Is it the same as the latest proposed xml spec for NEAT available in yahoo\n&gt; groups?\n\nNo, it&#39;s slightly different.  But not very much so.  \n\nThe nice thing about XML, though, is that once we settle on a standard\nformat, it&#39;s reasonably simple to convert old formats to new ones with\nXSL.  I don&#39;t mind helping with the style sheets necessary for people\nto convert their XML to the one supported by NEVT, as it goes through\nversion changes and settles on a standard.\n\n&gt; Thank you for nevt!\n\nNo problem.  I realize some people are reluctant to use unfamiliar\ntechnologies, but the intent was really to put together something that\nwas platform-independent, fairly easy to use, and save others the time\nand energy of coding graphical output for their implementation.\n\nAnyway, if you have any more questions...just let me know.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
