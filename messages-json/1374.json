I&#39;m not saying that \nper-species pruning wouldn&#39;t work OK, but I always try and keep things \nas simple as possible. So I&#39;m working on population wide pruning - which \nworks well BTW - and perhaps after some thought if we recon that per \nspecies is likely to have a greater benefit then I&#39;ll give it a go!\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
