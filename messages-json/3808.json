Nice \nwork,=\r\n I enjoyed playing with it. \n\nHowever, I don&#39;t see ghosts.  Are there suppo=\r\nsed to be ghosts?\n\nBy the way, I noticed that the probabilities of adding a=\r\n node or \nconnection default to pretty high values.  I tried turning them d=\r\nown \nto about one tenth of what they were.  I am still not sure if this \nhe=\r\nlps since I didn&#39;t run comparisons but I am guessing it might help.\n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve =\r\njust updated the PacMan code again based on some additional\n&gt; feedback.  He=\r\nre&#39;s the detail:\n&gt; \n&gt; v0.1.3 Updates \n&gt; -------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; Windows now u=\r\npdate during the evolution step thus preventing\n&gt; significant freezing of t=\r\nhe application during one epoch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The console window now tells you w=\r\nhether PacMan will run or not \nafter\n&gt; the current epoch and has (almost) i=\r\nnstant feedback from \npressing &#39;B&#39;.\n&gt; The title bar of the console window (=\r\nPacMan maze) states &quot;Active&quot; \nor\n&gt; &quot;Sleeping&quot; depending on the current stat=\r\ne of the application. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Small optimizations to speed up the simulation=\r\n. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Ghosts now allowed to reevaluate their direction after PacMan eats=\r\n\n&gt; PowerPellet, and ghosts made more aggressive. Hopefully this will\n&gt; disc=\r\nourage chance collisions forcing PacMan to be more active in \npursuit. \n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; When the console window was running a spontaneous crash would occur\n&gt; th=\r\ne seemed to stem from the Windows message queue.
