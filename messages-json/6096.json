Each subfield\nof AI has a d=\r\nifferent perspective on intelligence and unspoken\nassumptions about what is=\r\n critical to recreate it computationally. To\nbetter understand such differe=\r\nnces, we aim to bring together a diverse\ngroup of AI researchers interested=\r\n in discussing and comparing how\nintelligence and processes that might crea=\r\nte it are abstracted in\nvarious subfields. For example, such discussion may=\r\n include honest\nexamination of the strengths and weaknesses of different ap=\r\nproaches,\nand what features of biological intelligence are crucial or\nunnec=\r\nessary to include in algorithms.\n\nWe hope to encourage cross-pollination of=\r\n ideas between researchers\nviewing intelligence in different ways (e.g. thr=\r\nough the lens of MDPs\nor symbolic manipulation) and at  different levels of=\r\n abstraction\n(e.g. biologically-plausible neural simulations or restricted\n=\r\nBoltzmann machines). One goal is to facilitate  revising or creating\nnew ab=\r\nstractions of intelligence and intelligence-generating\nprocesses. More info=\r\nrmation can be found here:\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/AAAISymposium2013/\n\n=\r\nContributions related to how intelligence can or should be abstracted\nalgor=\r\nithmically in artificial intelligence research are invited.\nExtended abstra=\r\ncts that summarize the results of a research program\nalong these lines are =\r\nmost welcome, as are personal position papers or\ncontributions describing s=\r\npeculative work or work in progress. Works\nbridging traditionally separate =\r\nAI paradigms are encouraged.\nParticipants should be open to inspiration fro=\r\nm work and ideas in\nother subfields, and be willing to step outside their i=\r\nntellectual\ncomfort zones.\n\nInterested participants are encouraged to submi=\r\nt extended abstracts\n(no more than 2 pages), or full-length papers (up to 6=\r\n pages in AAAI\nformat) in PDF format to sebastian.risi@.... Accepte=\r\nd\nsubmissions will be published as citable, peer-reviewed papers in the\nAAA=\r\nI technical report.\n\nAreas of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n- D=\r\nifferent levels and types of knowledge representation and reasoning\n- Abstr=\r\nactions of the following:\n   - Neural networks (e.g. deep learning networks=\r\n, spiking ANNs, and\nplastic ANNs)\n   - Learning (e.g. machine learning and =\r\nreinforcement learning)\n   - Biological development (e.g. generative and de=\r\nvelopmental\nsystems, and developmental robotics)\n   - Evolutionary search (=\r\ne.g. digital evolution and evolutionary\nalgorithms)\n- Biologically-inspired=\r\n computation\n   - Evolutionary robotics\n   - Swarm intelligence\n   - Artifi=\r\ncial life\n- Philosophical arguments on characteristics of appropriate abstr=\r\nactions for\nAI\n\nThe symposium will be held Friday - Sunday, November 15-17 =\r\nat the\nWestin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, Virginia (adjacent to\nWashing=\r\nton, DC).\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.
