I think the t=\r\nhe root\n&gt; of your logical error is in considering fitness as a simple metri=\r\nc\n&gt; where we can take any two organisms/agents and state that one is\n&gt; fitt=\r\ner than the other based on reproductive efficiency and overall\n&gt; population=\r\n size. I believe this view of fitness as a simple linear\n&gt; metric is wrong =\r\nand thus any conclusions we build from this assumption\n&gt; are on shaky groun=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n\nAgreeing on an exact definition of biological fitness may be difficu=\r\nlt, especially as there isn&#39;t a complete consensus even among biologists (e=\r\n.g. Dawkins lists many different definitions in &quot;Extended Phenotype&quot; ch. 10=\r\n). But whether &quot;Survive and Reproduce&quot; is an objective rests not on an exac=\r\nt definition of biological fitness, but in the disparity between fitness dy=\r\nnamics in nature and the way that EC traditionally abstracts fitness as an =\r\nobjective -- which *is* typically a simple metric that compares any two ind=\r\nividuals on a linear scale. \n\nI completely agree that blindly optimizing th=\r\nis sort of measure is simplistic and not equivalent with what nature does! =\r\nHowever, this is the traditional approach in EC and is typically what we me=\r\nan by objectives, not only in EC but in machine learning as a whole. \n\nWhil=\r\ne natural evolution does optimize reproductive efficiency locally within ni=\r\nches, it does not do so globally. That is, bacteria do not preclude bears. =\r\nHowever, in traditional EC, bacteria would preclude bears, because bacteria=\r\n are a simpler, more efficient solution to the problem of survive-and-repro=\r\nduce, were survive-and-reproduce the objective. \n\nSo, while we abstract nat=\r\nural evolution as optimizing an objective in EC and in general look only at=\r\n the absolute high-fitness individuals, in nature more inefficient solution=\r\ns are still interesting. I maintain that solutions to reproduction such as =\r\nhumans are analogous to incredibly inefficient pole-balancers that are reco=\r\ngnized as interesting in their own right and still investigated within the =\r\nsearch process.\n\nI think if there was an objective in natural evolution, ra=\r\nther than survive-and-reproduce, it might be &quot;survive-and-reproduce competi=\r\ntively within your niche or find a new way to live.&quot; But this isn&#39;t an obje=\r\nctive in the traditional sense either, because it is relative not only to t=\r\nhe niche an organism exists within, but also to what niches exist already. =\r\nIn contrast, typical objectives in EC or machine learning are &quot;find a neura=\r\nl net that maximizes how far this biped robot walks before it falls&quot; or &quot;fi=\r\nnd parameters that minimize the classification error.&quot; These define specifi=\r\nc points in the search space that might count as solutions.\n\nBasically, I b=\r\nelieve we are in agreement over most things but perhaps disagreeing only in=\r\n definitions? That is, we agree that natural evolution is more nuanced than=\r\n the simple treatment of fitness functions in traditional EC, but may disag=\r\nree on particular definitions of biological fitness or objectives.\n\n\n"}}
