Because it is a \nchallenge=\r\n to affect the holistic policy of a neural network with a \nsingle input, I =\r\nam guessing it would not work as well.  In contrast, \nin HyperNEAT, the x p=\r\nosition naturally has a holistic effect on the \nsubstrate because the whole=\r\n substrate is generated from that value.  \nYet it is an empirical issue and=\r\n I could be wrong; your idea might \nwork as well.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Mattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;mattias@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, a very interesti=\r\nng paper and the videos are great.
