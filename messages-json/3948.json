The reason why is because we wanted to\ncompare HyperNEAT&#39;s app=\r\nroach to discovering geometric regularities\nwith NEAT-EI&#39;s approach of usin=\r\ng a priori engineered regularities.  If\nwe disabled the connections that wo=\r\nuld never be activated, we would be\ncheating, in a sense, by providing a pr=\r\niori domain-specific knowledge\nto the algorithm.  The only a priori knowled=\r\nge needed involves the\nsize of the layers in the substrate and the hidden l=\r\nayer\nconfiguration.  In this case, the extra connections have no impact on\n=\r\nthe network, but I left them in ti keep with the spirit of the experiment.\n=\r\n\nSecond, all 64*64 + 64*1 (4160) connections in the substrate are not\nalway=\r\ns expressed.  If the CPPN outputs a value with a magnitude less\nthan 0.2, t=\r\nhe connection weight is forced to absolute 0, disabling the\nconnection.  Co=\r\nnnections which are disabled are considered to not\nexist, so the 3979 numbe=\r\nr implies that some of the connections were\nnot expressed in that substrate=\r\n.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On =\r\nApr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Jason Gauci and I are =\r\npleased to share with you new results with\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper =\r\nto appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligenc=\r\ne (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt; &gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in=\r\n Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily cho=\r\nsen?\n&gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural to m=\r\ne?\n&gt; * Was more than one CPPN configuration tried?
