That is, if the item at the start of th=\r\ne list means the same thing no matter how long the list, that situation is =\r\ndifferent than if the items don&#39;t really have a precise meaning tied to the=\r\nir positions.\n\nI would guess that there are a lot of potential pitfalls in =\r\ngeneral because what you are doing during evolution is training the network=\r\n to treat certain positions in a certain way.  So if an item at x-position =\r\n0.25 has been used by the evolved substrate in a certain way and suddenly p=\r\nosition 0.25 disappears when the list expands, then the network may not pro=\r\ncess the item at the same cardinal position in the list in the same way, fo=\r\nr whatever that is worth.  \n\nHowever, in some cases, it may be that there i=\r\ns an aggregate kind of view of the whole list in which precise positions ar=\r\ne not important or only relative relationships matter.  In that case it is =\r\npossible the idea can work.  A situation like that is changing the resoluti=\r\non of an eye, wherein the image is spread across all the pixel positions in=\r\n a similar way regardless of the resolution.\n\nSo it really requires some in=\r\nsight into the domain itself and will likely be tricky to get working.\n\nken=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joelshellman&quot; &lt;joel@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have =\r\nrun into at least two situations where I have a variable number of inputs. =\r\nFor example, one is a list of a list of values. All of the lists can be of =\r\ndifferent length, including the outer list. It seems to me that HyperNEAT c=\r\nould handle this.\n&gt; \n&gt; When requesting the weights from the CPPN, could I u=\r\nse coordinates normalized to the size of the list meaning:\n&gt; \n&gt; Length  Coo=\r\nrdinates\n&gt; 1       1\n&gt; 2       0.5, 1\n&gt; 3       0.33, 0.66, 1\n&gt; 4       0.2=\r\n5, 0.5, 0.75, 1\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; And do this for both the inner and outer lists.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments on this type of approach or of handling variable sized i=\r\nnputs in general?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
