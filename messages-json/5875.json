Yes, well this is the RTRL code, which is pretty mu=\r\nch like backprop but can train recurrent nets as well. But it is very slow =\r\nas the number of neurons increases. I haven&#39;t done any optimizations on thi=\r\ns part yet. If only feed-forward nets without loops and recurrence are evol=\r\nved, it should be easy to add regular backprop. Introducing a flag for cont=\r\nrolling whether looped networks can appear in the population is on my todo =\r\nlist. (I don&#39;t mean looped recurrent connections, but any NN that has a loo=\r\np in the pathway between nodes like A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, C-&gt;A)\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; This l=\r\nooks great!
