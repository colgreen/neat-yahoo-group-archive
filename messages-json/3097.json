I ran across NEAT and I&#39;m very interested in using it a=\r\ns a \n&gt; function approximator of my value function. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am doing a singl=\r\ne pendulum balancing upright (much like the \n&gt; mountain-car problem). I am =\r\ncurrently discreteizing the state-space \n&gt; into a 60x60x3(position,velocity=\r\n,action) table.  This is fine for 2 \n&gt; states, but the model I will be impl=\r\nementing for my walker (3-link \n&gt; pendulum) has 6 states.  I have hopes of =\r\nadapting Matlab NEAT for \n&gt; NEAT+Q.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions on neural n=\r\nets that I couldn&#39;t find a clear \n&gt; answer on by searching through the inte=\r\nrnet.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) State Features:\n&gt;    In the mountain car example there are =\r\ntwo states: position and \n&gt; velocity.  However, the neural net has 20 input=\r\ns (10 for position, \n&gt; and 10 for velocity).  Am I correct in assuming that=\r\n each of the 10 \n&gt; inputs represents 1/10 of the unit circle for position? =\r\n I read \nthat \n&gt; Neural Networks like inputs in the range of 0 to 1 (why is=\r\n this?).  \n&gt; So if the position is in a certain region, is the input for th=\r\nat \n&gt; feature 1 and 0 for all other state features that represent other \n&gt; =\r\npositions?  Or can it be a fraction between 0 and 1?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Net Output:\n&gt; =\r\n   The mountain car problem had 3 outputs, 1 for each action.  I&#39;m \n&gt; guess=\r\ning that the output with the highest value corresponded to a \n&gt; discrete ac=\r\ntion.  If NEAT+Q was to approximate a value function \n&gt; however, would the =\r\noutputs still be the 3 actions?\n&gt;    In addition, By using the sigmoid 1/(1=\r\n+exp(-4.9x)) the output of \n&gt; each node is forced to be 0 or 1 correct?  In=\r\n NEAT+Q the output \nerror \n&gt; is: r+gamma*Va&#39; which would be used in back-pr=\r\nopagation.  But if \nthe \n&gt; output is either a 0 or a 1, how could this be u=\r\nsed to model a \nvalue \n&gt; function?  Unless the output of the NN is just the=\r\n sum of inputs \ninto \n&gt; the output node.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Matlab NEAT:\n&gt;    Other th=\r\nan number_input_nodes and number_output_nodes in the \n&gt; neat_main.m file, i=\r\ns the entire experiment contained in the \n&gt; xor_experiment_vec.m file?  I&#39;m=\r\n assuming this is where the Q-\nLearning \n&gt; and dynamics simulation would ta=\r\nke place.\n&gt;    Does Matlab NEAT use backpropagation to optimize the weights=\r\n?  I \n&gt; didn&#39;t see anywhere in the code where the weights were \nbackpropaga=\r\nted \n&gt; (perhaps I missed something).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry my message was so long, but=\r\n I&#39;ve read through the most of the \n&gt; Stanley/Whiteson/Stone papers, the 17=\r\n-page help file, the \n&gt; readme&#39;s contained in the c++ and matlab versions o=\r\nf NEAT, and a \nfew \n&gt; unrelated NN websites.  Needless to say I&#39;m new and s=\r\nort of lost.  \n&gt; Any assistance is greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
