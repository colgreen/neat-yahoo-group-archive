Ideas that \ncome\n&gt; to mind are to embed our current idea of genotype into a larger \ngenotype\n&gt; idea. In this super genome, a &quot;gene&quot; referes to what we have been\n&gt; calling a &#39;network.&#39; This network evolves using the same NEAT \nwe&#39;ve been\n&gt; playing with. In the super NEAT genome, each network is treated in \nthe\n&gt; same way as neuron is treated. Some changes in the super NEAT might\n&gt; include mutating the number of inputs and outputs a network gene \nhas (\n&gt; slowly enough for the network to work with the new topology ).\n&gt; This approach doesn&#39;t seem to me to be the best way to encorage \nprofound\n&gt; symetries that drasticly reduce search space, but it still might \nwork,\n&gt; and be a start.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just felt like I had to get that out there before I started \nreading\n&gt; that paper. 39 pages. Wow. These things don&#39;t read like pulp \nfiction.\n&gt; \n&gt; chad\n&gt; \n\nChad, you may be surprised to find a form of this idea has been \ntried.  See our paper, &quot;Evolving Reusable Neural Modules&quot;:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco04\n\nBy the way, we don&#39;t believe this is the best way to go in the long \nrun, but it&#39;s definitely one that makes sense intuitively.\n\nken\n\n\n&gt; &lt;-----Original Message-----&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: t_bommel\n&gt; &gt;Sent: 6/16/2004 2:27:32 PM\n&gt; &gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [neat] input\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;hey guys,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;i was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how/what to \ninput \n&gt; &gt;into my neural network (in progress). i&#39;m a real newbie at this \nstuff \n&gt; &gt;so i still got alot to learn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;i have rabbits and wolves im trying to figure how i should feed \nthem \n&gt; &gt;information. should i feed them a 2 array of thier local \nenvironment \n&gt; &gt;and if so, how does doing that differ feeding it 1d arrays? \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;like i said, i&#39;m a newb so any advice or referrals to other sites \n&gt; &gt;would be greatly appreciate. thanks\n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
