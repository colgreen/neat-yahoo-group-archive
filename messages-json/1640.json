In \nNEAT we all tend to use low &#39;add node&#39; and &#39;add connection&#39; rates and a \nhigh weight mutation rate, it seems to work well for all the problems we \nhave seen to date, yeh we teak them a bit but the system still works \nwithout the tweaking.\n\n&gt;  So I guess I was straying into the area of 3, whereas you were \n&gt;looking at 1...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIndeed. Also consider that the optimal search params may be different at \ndifferent stages of a search.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I take your point about getting carried away (it&#39;s always my first reaction \n&gt;to an area of research to go &quot;ah!  but what bout these 17 other related \n&gt;areas...&quot;) \n&gt;\nHey it&#39;s all food for though - that&#39;s what we&#39;re here for right. \nApologies for any negative vibes eminating from my emails yesterday :)\n\n&gt;but I&#39;m not sure adding a mutability to each gene is quite the \n&gt;same as adding a lot of global parameters (it&#39;s more like adding one \n&gt;meta-parameter -- it is only one &quot;concept&quot;, but implemented separately on \n&gt;each gene)...  But it probably is for a different question from the one you \n&gt;wanted to look at :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMy main concern really is that the meta-params would drift and greatly \nreduce the effectivness of a search - see my previous reply (to Ken).\n\nColin\n\n"}}
