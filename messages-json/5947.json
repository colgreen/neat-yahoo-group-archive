The focus of the GDS track is making artificially evo=\r\nlved systems scale to high complexity, with work ranging from biologically =\r\ninspired approaches to automated engineering design. Each paper submitted t=\r\no the GDS Track will be reviewed by experts in the field. The size and pres=\r\ntige of the GECCO conference will allow many researchers to learn about you=\r\nr work, both at the conference and via the proceedings (GECCO has the highe=\r\nst impact rating of all conferences in the field of Evolutionary Computatio=\r\nn and Artificial Life).\n\nTRACK DESCRIPTION\n-----------------\n\nThe continuin=\r\ng growth in systems&#39; size and complexity has rendered the engineering tradi=\r\ntions of rigid top-down planning and control unsustainable. Understanding t=\r\nhe evolution of natural complex systems - large sets of elements interactin=\r\ng locally and giving rise to collective behavior =97 can help create a new =\r\ngeneration of truly autonomous and adaptive artificial systems. Biological =\r\nevolution has produced the astounding complexity and diversity of living or=\r\nganisms based on random mutations, nonrandom selection and self-organizatio=\r\nn. The Generative and Developmental Systems (GDS) track seeks to unlock the=\r\n full potential of &quot;in silico&quot; evolution as a design methodology that can s=\r\ncale to systems of great complexity. It aims to create complex and diverse =\r\nartifacts that meet our specifications with minimal guidance and programmin=\r\ng effort.\n\nIndirect and open-ended representations: Representing more than =\r\nthe information needed to produce a single individual, the genotype is a la=\r\nyered repository of many generations of evolutionary innovation, and is sha=\r\nped by two requirements: to be fit in the short term, and to be evolvable o=\r\nver the long term through its influence on the production of variation. &quot;In=\r\ndirect representations&quot; such as morphogenesis or string-rewriting grammars,=\r\n which rely on developmental or generative processes, may allow long-term i=\r\nmprovement via accumulated elaborations and emergent new features. &quot;Direct =\r\nrepresentations&quot; are not capable of open-ended elaboration because they are=\r\n restricted to predefined features.\n\nComplex environments encourage complex=\r\n phenotypes: While complex genotypes are not necessarily favored in simple =\r\nenvironments, they may enable unprecedented phenotypes and behaviors that c=\r\nan later successfully invade new, uncrowded niches in complex environments =\r\n=97 which can create pressure toward increasing complexity. Many factors ma=\r\ny affect environmental (hence genotypic) complexity, such as spatial struct=\r\nure, temporal fluctuations, or competitive co-evolution.\n\nMore is more: Tod=\r\nay&#39;s typical numbers of generations, sizes of populations, and components i=\r\nnside individuals are still too small. Just as physics needs higher-energy =\r\naccelerators and farther-reaching telescopes to understand matter and space=\r\n-time, evolutionary computation needs a strong boost in computational resol=\r\nution and scope to understand the spontaneous generation of complex functio=\r\nnality. Biological evolution involved 4 billion years and untold numbers of=\r\n organisms. We expect that datacenter-scale computing power will be applied=\r\n in the future to produce artificially evolved artifacts of great complexit=\r\ny. How will we apply such resources most efficiently?\n\nOver 150 years after=\r\n Darwin&#39;s and Mendel&#39;s work, and the subsequent &quot;Modern Synthesis&quot; of evolu=\r\ntion and genetics, the developmental process that maps genotype to phenotyp=\r\ne is still poorly understood. Yet, development cannot remain an abstraction=\r\n if we wish to encourage open-ended evolutionary novelty in artificial syst=\r\nems. The GDS track at GECCO 2013 seeks to understand the full evolution-of-=\r\ndevelopment (&quot;evo-devo&quot;) picture. It stresses the importance of the generat=\r\nive and developmental processes that generate the raw material for selectio=\r\nn; such representations are uniquely capable of producing ongoing, open-end=\r\ned innovation.\n\nWe invite all papers related to the evolution of complexity=\r\n, including in the areas of:\n*   artificial development, artificial embryog=\r\neny\n*   evo-devo robotics, morphogenetic robotics\n*   evolution of evolvabi=\r\nlity\n*   gene regulatory networks\n*   grammar-based systems, generative sys=\r\ntems, rewriting systems\n*   indirect mappings, compact encodings, novel rep=\r\nresentations\n*   measures of complexity, theories of scalable design\n*   mo=\r\nrphogenetic engineering\n*   neural development, neuroevolution, augmenting =\r\ntopologies\n*   spatial computing, amorphous computing\n\nAdditionally, papers=\r\n in the following areas will be considered if they have a particular focus =\r\non representations and/or scaling to high complexity:\n*   competitive co-ev=\r\nolution (arms races)\n*   complex, spatially structured, and dynamically cha=\r\nnging environments\n*   diversity preservation, novelty search\n*   large num=\r\nbers of generations, individuals, and internal components\n*   unconventiona=\r\nl computing, natural computing, organic computing\n*   synthetic biology, bi=\r\nological and chemical IT, artificial chemistry\n\nVENUE\n-----\n\nThe track and =\r\nconference will be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n---=\r\n------------\n\n* January 31, 2013  - Paper submission deadline (FINAL deadli=\r\nne)\n* April 17, 2013    - Camera-ready version of accepted articles\n* July =\r\n06-10, 2013  - GECCO 2013 Conference in Amsterdam\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n---=\r\n-----------------\n\nMore information on the GDS track is at: http://iscpif.f=\r\nr/gds2013\nand on the GECCO conference at: http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2013\n=\r\n\nTo submit your paper to the GDS track, visit http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2=\r\n013/papers.html\n\nWe look forward to reading your paper.\n\n -- Michael Palmer=\r\n, Ren=E9 Doursat, and Joshua Bongard, GDS track chairs\n\n\n\n"}}
