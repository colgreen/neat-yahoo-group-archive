It is \nquite an anxious (as well as exhilerating) experience when you \nrelease years of work off into the world to unknown praise or scorn, \nand hearing something  like this is very encouraging.  The NERO team \nas well, consisting of many undergraduates, will really benefit from \nknowing our work is appreciated!\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \tI found time to have a quick look into Nero last night.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tSpeaking as a former professional in the computer games \nindustry, I&#39;ve \n&gt; seen a lot of cases folk decide a game will illustrate their \nwork.  They \n&gt; think &quot;how hard can it be?&quot;  And the answer is &quot;far harder than \nyou \n&gt; imagine&quot;, and they come up with some horrible effort with clunky \n&gt; interfaces, unusable controls, manual install procedures, flat-\nshaded \n&gt; graphics which poke through walls, etc etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tBut Nero completely turns this experience around.  It is \n_very_ cool.  I \n&gt; just ran it last night and was up and running within a minute.  \nThere is \n&gt; even a tutorial!  Which is _necessary_ for any complex game these \ndays but \n&gt; usually gets missed out.  The menus all make sense, training the \nteams is \n&gt; easy.  There&#39;s a sound-track and sound effects and the graphics \nare OK (not \n&gt; quite up to commercial grade but that would probably be over the \ntop in \n&gt; this context).\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNice one Ken!\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNow I just need a longer day so there&#39;s time to play with \nit :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; \n&gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________ \n&gt; Yahoo!
