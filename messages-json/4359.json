A formal way to\nexpress encodings would allow us to rely on a solid basis as we would\nbe able to reproduce experiments more easily and to draw a real\npicture of what our encoding is (instead of relying on poorly defined\nconcepts, figures, etc. to explain our work). For instance, a formal\nframework should make easy to define variants of a same encoding to\nefficiently understand which biasesre useful for a given class of\nproblems. Moreover, once we have a good formalism, we can often think\nabout more complex and abstract concepts.\n\nIt&#39;s clear that the ideal formalism should allow to express any\nencoding: it&#39;s a tool to explore encodings (at least a family of\nencodings) and to modify the search space.\n\nOverall, I think that designing such a formalism would be a decisive\nstep to make future progress in our field because we really need a\nmore solid basis.\n\nSo, the next question is: which formalism? We proposed (in the linked\npaper) to use attribute grammars and operators inspired by genetic\nprogramming. They are powerful and many concepts can be easily\nexpressed. For example it&#39;s easy to define a direct-encoding for\nneural-networks. Howerver, some neuro-evolution systems (especially\nNEAT) cannot be fully described because they are not only encodings\n(e.g. in NEAT, there&#39;s the diversity preservation mechanism). I&#39;m\nreally not sure that it&#39;s the best possible formalism but it&#39;s almost\nthe only one I know.\n\nIn the previously linked paper, we designed a modular and hierarchical\nencoding with this formalism (i.e. we designed a specific\ngrammar). This shows at least that it&#39;s possible to express such\nconcepts in the formalism. As a consequence, we now have a\nhierarchical and modular encoding and we can ask the next question\n(the one you ask): are these features really needed in an encoding?\nOur first results show that it can lead to interesting results but\nit&#39;s not a definitive answer. The point is to have a solid tool to\ninvestigate this question.\n\nBest regards,\n-- \nJean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\nhttp://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\ntel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n\n"}}
