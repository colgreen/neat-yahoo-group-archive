You can also see a picture of the evolved shapes 3D\nprinted.\n\nThe diversity of shapes I was able to discover just playing with the system\nmyself for a few hours is pretty incredible, which is a testament to Ken&#39;s\nCPPN encoding. Additionally, I ran tests with and without recurrence in the\nCPPN genome, and with different inputs to the CPPN, and you can see the\ndifference those choices make in the resultant objects. For example, with\nCPPN recurrence, the shapes often look more fractal. I believe (but please\ncorrect me if I am wrong) that this is the first publication with a test of\nCPPNs with and without recurrence.\n\nFInally, I conducted target-based evolution by evolving CPPNs to match a\ngoal object. I&#39;d be interested to hear if you think the goal was reached,\nand how to interpret these results in light of Brian Woolley & Ken Stanley&#39;s\npaper on CPPNs not being able to reach target 2D objectives.\n\nWhat I like best about being able to evolve 3D objects is learning how the\nCPPN search space works: mutations frequently produce very sensible\nvariation. For example, the two 3D printed elephants in figure one are\nbrothers, and are close relatives of the three elephant-looking things in\nfigure 4 (b2-4). It&#39;s nice to see mutations have such smooth, sensible\neffects, instead of creating wildly different objects.\n\nAs always, please let me know your thoughts and questions.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Creative Machines Laboratory\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\r\n--B_3391597407_30886135\r\nContent-type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;US-ASCII&quot;\r\nContent-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode:=\r\n space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-si=\r\nze: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello everyone=\r\n-&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hod Lipson and I have a new publication on evolv=\r\ning 3D morphologies with CPPNs, which explains the algorithm behind Endless=\r\nForms.com.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;PDF: &nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/goo.gl/HRXLD&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/HRXLD&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Most of you will at least enjoy quickly scanning the figures to see the ev=\r\nolved shapes, which are higher resolution and different than those on Endle=\r\nssForms.com. &nbsp;You can also see a picture of the evolved shapes 3D prin=\r\nted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The diversity of shapes I was able to discove=\r\nr just playing with the system myself for a few hours is pretty incredible,=\r\n which is a testament to Ken&#39;s CPPN encoding.&nbsp;Additionally, I ran test=\r\ns with and without recurrence in the CPPN genome, and with different inputs=\r\n to the CPPN, and you can see the difference those choices make in the resu=\r\nltant objects.
