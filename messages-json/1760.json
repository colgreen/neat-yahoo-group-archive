Basically, we feed the view out\n&gt; the front window.\n\nHow big a scene is that?  How many pixels are we talking about?  I\nwould imagine that the front end visual scene of a simulated car would\nbe at least something like 500x400 pixels.  You aren&#39;t inputting\n20,000 pixels inputs into a neural network, are you?  If not, then how\nare you limiting the input, if not by active vision?  Greatly reducing\nthe resolution?\n\n&gt; &gt; Again, I don&#39;t know how sophisticated the RARS visual modeling is,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; that would seem to be one of the big challenges in such an accident\n&gt; &gt; warning system...the complexity of real-world visual scenes,\n&gt; &gt; complicated by the fact that people drive all hours of the day and\n&gt; &gt; night, so there&#39;s a huge amount of variance in lighting\n&gt; conditions.\n&gt; &gt; Does RARS, for example, have night driving?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; No I don&#39;t believe it does.  We aren&#39;t really trying to solve the\n&gt; visual recognition task though.  \n\nWell, I understand that.  But you are trying to solve the accident\nwarning system problem, right?  And for any system to work reasonably\nwell, it would have to be robust to highly variant road conditions,\nincluding weather, lighting, etc.  Rain, for example, is going to add\nan extreme amount of noise to any sensory input (radar or visual), and\nI would imagine that lots of accidents happen in rainy weather.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
