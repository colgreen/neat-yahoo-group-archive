You would need to wait until the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;stagnant species has broken out of that stagnation, and THEN prune.  But \n&gt; &gt;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;think your best bet is to wait until you have found an acceptable \n&gt; &gt;solution,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and then do a phase that supports pruning in order to optimize that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;solution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yes that makes more sense :)  So if some of the neutral structure\n&gt; &gt;becomes positive then you have moved into a new and better position in\n&gt; &gt;the overall search space, this warrants searching around that space for\n&gt; &gt;a while, but! you are still likely to have some of the neutral structure\n&gt; &gt;that didn&#39;t become positive. This means you are searching through a\n&gt; &gt;higher search dimensionality than you really should be - you have found\n&gt; &gt;a new promising point in the search space so you don&#39;t really want that\n&gt; &gt;speculative neutral structure, not until you start to stagnate again.\n&gt; &gt;Therefore I think it would be a refinement of the NEAT search process to\n&gt; &gt;prune neutral structure from the genomes at that point.\n&gt; \n&gt; My question is, which is more expensive?  Continuing to search in the higher\n&gt; \n&gt; space, with the ability to coopt neutral structure into useful, or the \n&gt; pruning pass followed by a forward search that must then perhaps re-add \n&gt; structure?\n\nCertainly if you did a prune phase upon every single improvement I can imagine \nthis would be very inefficient. I remember now that this is why I suggested \npruning only after a period of stagnation... the theory being that you just \nleave the neutral structure and continue searching in the higher space while it \nis still working. If you then reach a point of stagnation *then* prune your way \nback to the lower search space - which could be quite a bit lower for the first \nprune.\n\nOf course if you did this and still stagnated then you wouldn&#39;t want to trigger \noff another prune phase, there would be no point. So perhaps if we set a flag \nthat tells us that pruning is an option, and which gets set to true whenever an \nimprovement is found. So when stagnation does occur we check the flag first \nbefore deciding to prune.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
