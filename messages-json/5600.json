I don&#39;t know of anyone who has specifically\ntried =\r\nyour idea, but I can give you my thoughts: As you know, what\nyou&#39;re proposi=\r\nng is sort of between genetic diversity and &quot;behavioral&quot;\ndiversity. Whereas=\r\n behavior would usually be defined as the actions\ntaken by an agent during =\r\nits lifetime, you are instead looking at the\nneural network substrate that =\r\nproduces the behavior (which is indirectly\nencoded by a CPPN) rather than l=\r\nooking at the behavior itself.\n\nIn any case, the idea raises some interesti=\r\nng questions.  My feeling is\nthat it will not work as well as genetic diver=\r\nsity, although it does\nprovide some benefits, which means that in some doma=\r\nins the difference\nbetween the two approaches may be difficult to discern. =\r\n However, I\nbelieve that in particular when you are hoping for something ve=\r\nry\ncomplex to evolve (i.e. something that requires a big CPPN to encode),\nt=\r\nraditional genetic diversity based on historical markings in the CPPN\nwould=\r\n be superior.\n\nThe reason for my hypothesis is that the genetic diversity m=\r\nechanism in\nNEAT is not only an attempt to provide diversity to avoid decep=\r\ntion. \nMore than that, it is meant to protect innovative structural changes=\r\n. \nThat is, when new structure is initially added to a CPPN through a\nmutat=\r\nion, the resulting fitness is often not better and probably worse\nthan befo=\r\nre the structure was added.  However, we do not want to throw\naway such inn=\r\novative structures too soon because they may pay off if we\nlet them optimiz=\r\ne for more generations.  Hence such novel structures are\nprotected in new s=\r\npecies by NEAT.  (The problem of losing innovative\nstructures can indeed al=\r\nso be interpreted as a kind of deception, but it\nis not the traditional kin=\r\nd of deception considered in optimization of\nfixed-sized search spaces.)\n\nI=\r\nf you think about the weight pattern output by the CPPN (as you\npropose), t=\r\nhen you can imagine that random structural additions to the\nCPPN may often =\r\nlead to degenerate output weight patterns that are\nsimilar to each other (s=\r\nuch as weight patterns with all weights\nsaturated).  Such CPPNs would not l=\r\nook diverse from the perspective of\nyour proposed mechanism.  However, my v=\r\niew is that they should look\ndiverse because their CPPNs have different str=\r\nucture, and we want to\nisolate unique structure to give it an opportunity t=\r\no optimize (which is\nthe general principle in NEAT).\n\nThe converse problema=\r\ntic situation is when new structure is added to the\nCPPN but the output wei=\r\nght pattern does not change much, which is also\npossible.  I would argue th=\r\nat such an augmented structure should be\nprotected so we can see whether it=\r\n optimizes to improve performance in\nthe future, but your mechanism would v=\r\niew it as nothing new (because it\nproduced nothing new) and hence likely lo=\r\nse it in future generations,\nunless it immediately boosts fitness.\n\nOne imp=\r\nortant consequence of genetic speciation in NEAT is\ncomplexification.  That=\r\n is, protecting novel structures helps CPPNs (or\nANNs in original NEAT) inc=\r\nrease in complexity because it protects\nstructural innovations that would o=\r\ntherwise be penalized for reducing\nfitness.  So one hypothesis (that we hav=\r\ne seen supported in preliminary\ntests) is that a system relying entirely on=\r\n behavioral diversity will\nnot effectively add complexity to CPPNs, even wh=\r\nen it would be helpful. \nThus in domains that do not require much complexit=\r\ny, you may not notice\na problem, but in domains that do, the problem will e=\r\nmerge.\n\nIn general, there has been some discussion lately (aside from your =\r\nidea)\nthat the recent successes of behavioral diversity techniques like\nnov=\r\nelty search might imply that we can drop NEAT&#39;s genetic diversity\nmechanism=\r\n. However, I would caution against jumping to this conclusion\ntoo soon.   W=\r\nhile I am sure that in some domains you can get equivalent\nor even better p=\r\nerformance, in the long run I believe that genetic\ndiversity plays a differ=\r\nent and complementary role to behavioral\ndiversity, in part to protect stru=\r\nctural innovation.\n\nMy interpretation of the benefits of behavioral diversi=\r\nty is different\nthan the emerging popular interpretation:  I believe that p=\r\nositive\nresults with behavioral diversity are confirmations of the deleteri=\r\nous\neffect of objectives rather than evidence that we should combine\ntradit=\r\nional fitness-based objectives with behavioral diversity.  While\nsuch combi=\r\nnations may work with traditional modest objectives (i.e. in\nbenchmark prob=\r\nlems of the variety popular today), behavioral diversity\nwill prove only a =\r\nplacebo when paired with much more ambitious\nobjectives.  That is, the more=\r\n ambitious we become, the less useful\ntraditional fitness-based objectives =\r\nwill be, even as behavioral\ndiversity/novelty alone remains important in it=\r\ns own right (i.e. when\nnot paired with a traditional objective).\n\nOf course=\r\n, much of this post is speculative, but it is my best guess\nbased on my exp=\r\nerience and understanding of the algorithms and\nrepresentations involved.\n\n=\r\nken\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Paul Tonelli &lt;nemo136@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hell=\r\no,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am currently experimenting with hyperNEAT and was just wondering i=\r\nf\n&gt; anybody tried to replace the NEAT mechanisms found in hyperNEAT\n(specia=\r\ntion,\n&gt; distance based on innovation numbers and weights in the cppn) by a\n=\r\ndistance\n&gt; between the behaviors of the CPPN.  This may not be clear, so I =\r\nwill\n&gt; developp:\n&gt;\n&gt; The NEAT part in hyperNEAT improves the evolution of C=\r\nPPNs, and, if\nyou\n&gt; remove both the speciation protection mechanism and the=\r\n distance\nbetween\n&gt; genotypes based on the innovation numbers, the &quot;HyperNe=\r\nuralNetwork&quot;\nhas bad\n&gt; fitnesses on the different benchmarks (the fitness l=\r\nandscape of the\ncppn\n&gt; seems to be quite deceptive).\n&gt;\n&gt; However, consideri=\r\nng the recent results on diversity and novelty\nobjectives,\n&gt; has anybody tr=\r\nied to replace them (innovation numbers and speciation\n&gt; mechanisms) with a=\r\nn explicit objective which would take into account\nthe\n&gt; novelty of behavio=\r\nr of the CPPN ?\n&gt;\n&gt; This is straightforward to implement for a given substr=\r\nate: for each\nquery\n&gt; of the cppn of an individual (each time you compute a=\r\n weight between\ntwo\n&gt; substrate nodes), append the obtained weight to a vec=\r\ntor. It is then\n&gt; possible to define a novelty objective based on a convent=\r\nional\ndistance\n&gt; metric between these &quot;CPPN Behavior&quot; vectors.\n&gt;\n&gt; An addit=\r\nionnal benefit I see from this approach, and if I understood\nneat\n&gt; innovat=\r\nion numbers correctly, is that the mathematical functions used\nfor\n&gt; each n=\r\node in the cppn are not taken into account by the neat metric\n(if two\n&gt; nod=\r\nes with a same innovation number have mutated to present different\n&gt; mathem=\r\natical functions, this does not increase the NEAT distance\nbetween\n&gt; them).=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have already have preliminary results showing that this metric is an=\r\n\n&gt; improvement over my partial implementation of hyperNEAT, however, I\nonly=\r\n\n&gt; used a distance based on the innovation numbers and not the species\n&gt; pr=\r\notection mechanism.\n&gt;\n&gt; Paul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
