I expect\n&gt; many others will also disagree.  \n\nWell, you&#39;d pretty much be out of step with most\nmodern biologists, then.\n\nHere&#39;s an interesting short essay on the definition of\nevolution:\n\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html\n\nAnd if you pick up just about any biology text that\ntalks about evolution and it will define it most\nlikely as genetic change in a population over time.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, evolution as a\n&gt; scientific theory includes the idea of selection. \n\nSelection is just one type of evolutionary pressure,\nand of course there are different types of\nselection--natural, artificial, and sexual.\n\nGenetic drift is also a very important factor in\nevolution, and by itself can cause a population to\nevolve.  \n\nOf course, biological populations in the real world\nare never going to be subject to genetic drift as the\nonly evolutionary pressure.  But we *can* subject our\nANN populations solely to genetic drift as the only\nevolutionary pressure.  And if we did so, they would\nstill evolve--that is, they would change genetically\nover time.\n\nIn using NEAT, there would only be a trend toward\ncomplexification (since NEAT only has additive\nmutations).  So even if you only used random\nselection, you would end up with larger, more complex\nindividuals at the end of your run.  They may not be\nable to *do* anything meaningful, but they would still\nbe significantly different from their ancestors.\n\nYou may not like to think of this as evolution, but\namong biologists, strictly speaking, it is.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
