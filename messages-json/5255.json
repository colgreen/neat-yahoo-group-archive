It is indeed impossible if the=\r\ny are the same length.  (I&#39;m not sure about mass.)  If the poles are made m=\r\nore similar, the problem becomes a lot harder.  \n\nIn fact, the neural netwo=\r\nrk long pictured at the top of the NEAT Users Page (http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~=\r\nkstanley/neat.html) was a solution evolved by NEAT to the DPNV problem at c=\r\nloser lengths.  I believe it used lengths of 1m and 0.3m.  The problem chan=\r\nges a lot with these lengths, requiring significant internal structure (whe=\r\nreas the usual setup requires almost none).  I&#39;m not sure if we ever report=\r\ned that result, but one reason I evolved the 0.3/1.0 balancer from scratch =\r\nwas because previously the only known way to get one at that setting was by=\r\n incrementally evolving from a pre-evolved 0.1/1.0 balancer, as reported by=\r\n Faustino Gomez and Risto Miikkulainen in 1999:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/u=\r\nsers/nn/downloads/papers/gomez.ijcai99.pdf\n\nSo I thought it would be cool i=\r\nf the complexification in NEAT could be shown to preclude the need to incre=\r\nmentally evolve, which it did at the 0.3/1.0 setting.  However, if I rememb=\r\ner right, at even closer settings I think it starts getting too hard to evo=\r\nlve from scratch.  Of course these are very old results so my memory could =\r\nbe fuzzy.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Looking over the double pole balancing code again (porting over to =\r\nsharpneat 2) and I&#39;m reminded that this problem is possible because the pol=\r\nes are different lengths. At least I think I&#39;m right in saying that the tas=\r\nk is impossible if the poles are the same length (and/or same mass?).\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSo anyway I was just thinking that we can alter the difficulty by making th=\r\ne lengths more or less similar. The code as it stands defines the poles as:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Pole 1: 1m, 0.1kg\n&gt; Pole 2: 0.1m, 0.01kg\n&gt; \n&gt; Just though I&#39;d mention=\r\n this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
