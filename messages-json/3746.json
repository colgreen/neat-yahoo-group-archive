For standard NEAT params, test cases (the results summa=\r\nry \nof which has been included in prior postings) demonstrate that the \npro=\r\nduct of number of individuals times generations are not created \nequal. \n\n\n=\r\n&gt; Note that search efficiency is generally considered to be number of \n&gt; ev=\r\naluations, so if 1,000 evaluations are added at the get-go, some \n&gt; consequ=\r\nence would need to make up for that initial investment.\n\n\nSpecifically, for=\r\n a given number of evaulations (i.e. # individuals * \ngenerations), higher =\r\nfitness was achieved when the composition \nincluded more &quot;0 generation&quot; eva=\r\nluations rather than less.\n\n\n&gt; The answer is not obvious because the dynami=\r\ncs of both strategies \nare \n&gt; quite complex and domain-dependent.\n\n\nReasona=\r\nbly so, but not an adequate justification to set-aside the \nissue. Until yo=\r\nu actually implement code infrastructure to attempt to \nquantify such thing=\r\ns as: a) exact genome duplication as measured by \nvisitation of design poin=\r\nts, not just genome structure, b) effective \ngenome duplication (i.e. so cl=\r\nose to be effectivily a duplicate), and \nc) coverage of the design space, y=\r\nou will not uncover just how \nredundant and limited coverage of the design =\r\nspace is for standard \nNEAT params for a given population size and number o=\r\nf generations.\n\nI am a huge fan of the NEAT method. But the method will not=\r\n achieve \nits potential to handle practical real-world problems until these=\r\n \nprofound inefficiencies are addressed.\n\nThe standard NEAT params appear t=\r\no be very conservative, resting on \nthe benefits of the NEAT method itself =\r\nto make up for the undue \nburden of their conservatisim. But that only goes=\r\n as far as the \ntrivialness of the fitness function evaluation. After which=\r\n it sinks \nunder the computational weight of its own inefficiency and \ncons=\r\nervatisism for practical problems where the fitness evaluation is \nnon-triv=\r\nal. It would be very disappointing that the benefits of the \nNEAT method ge=\r\nt lost due to the failure to address the significance \nand adaptive control=\r\n potential characteristics of the NEAT params.\n\nDancing rag-dolls reveal ap=\r\nplicability of the NEAT method to new and \ninteresting areas, but there is =\r\nmore fundamental research required on \nthe exploitation of the NEAT params =\r\nbefore you will see the NEAT \nmethod commonly applied to practical real-wor=\r\nld problems, as it \nrightfully should/could be.\n\nHand waving over &quot;complex =\r\nand domain-dependent&quot; is an inadequate \njustification for chosing to ignore=\r\n the issue, and instead focus on \nnew and interesting areas in which the is=\r\nsue is not addressed.\n\nAndy Carl\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth St=\r\nanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The distribution of the initial generation=\r\ns indeed can affect the \n&gt; course of evolution.  However, it is difficult t=\r\no make informed a \n&gt; priori decisions about the initial population before a=\r\nn experiment \nis \n&gt; run, because little may be known about the structure of=\r\n the search \n&gt; space.  However, I believe there has been work on the compos=\r\nition \nof \n&gt; initial populations in GAs and the right random distribution (=\r\ne.g. \n&gt; uniform vs. normal, or something else) of individuals in that \n&gt; po=\r\npulation to best cover the search space.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The idea that you might cre=\r\nate many initial populations and \nevaluate \n&gt; all of them is not buying any=\r\n obvious advantage because you still \nend \n&gt; up having to evaluate all thos=\r\ne initial populations.  For example, \n&gt; let&#39;s say that the population size =\r\nis 100.  Then if you generate 10 \n&gt; initial populations, you end up evaluat=\r\ning 1,000 individuals before \n&gt; deciding in which population to invest furt=\r\nher.  On the other hand, \n&gt; if you start with simply one population, then a=\r\nfter 1,000 \nevaluatins \n&gt; you will have proceeded 10 generations.  So the q=\r\nuestion is, which \n&gt; was more effective, evaluating 10 random populations, =\r\nor evaluating \n&gt; 10 generations of evolutionary search?  \n&gt; \n&gt; The answer i=\r\ns not obvious because the dynamics of both strategies \nare \n&gt; quite complex=\r\n and domain-dependent.  One could argue for the \n&gt; advantages of either.  H=\r\nowever, what can be said is that there is \nno \n&gt; knock-down reason that hav=\r\ning multiple initial populations will \n&gt; improve efficiency.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Note th=\r\nat search efficiency is generally considered to be number of \n&gt; evaluations=\r\n, so if 1,000 evaluations are added at the get-go, some \n&gt; consequence woul=\r\nd need to make up for that initial investment. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there any significanc=\r\ne to the composition of generation zero \n&gt; beyond \n&gt; &gt; that of providing a =\r\nradomized evaluation/starting point of the \n&gt; design \n&gt; &gt; space?
