I mean, the game told me that I should ev=\r\nolve a\n&gt; brain to follow and a brain to flee, but during training I got lit=\r\ntle\n&gt; feedback on if I was doing things right or not. Maybe it would help i=\r\nf you\n&gt; could select a target behavior during training such that the game c=\r\nould\n&gt; give you better feedback on your progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, despite the too=\r\nltips, some of the objectives weren&#39;t very clear to\n&gt; me. For example, I am=\r\n not sure what the exact difference is between keeping\n&gt; a certain distance=\r\n and reaching a certain distance, nor how exactly this\n&gt; interacts with the=\r\n &#39;- Distance&#39; slider. For example, I assumed that keeping\n&gt; a distance of 1=\r\n meter would cause the robots to drive towards the target\n&gt; and stop at 1 m=\r\neter distance, but looking at the results and numbers during\n&gt; evolution I =\r\nam really not sure if that is true. Another example is the\n&gt; &#39;move around&#39; =\r\nobjective. When I tried to evolve a brain that would stand\n&gt; still and do n=\r\nothing I set the &#39;move around&#39; slider to -100. When I ran\n&gt; evolution, rath=\r\ner than standing still the robots would instead start to\n&gt; move towards the=\r\n center of the arena. That said, the weapon based\n&gt; objectives were clear t=\r\no me, and seemed to work as expected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lastly, I think that the numbers =\r\nshown during evolution are a bit\n&gt; confusing. For example, at some point I =\r\nhad something like a &#39;Best Fitness&#39;\n&gt; of 1049, an &#39;Evolution&#39; of +623 and a=\r\n &#39;Keep distance&#39; of 5115, and I had no\n&gt; clue how those numbers were suppos=\r\ned to relate to each other. I mean, my\n&gt; fitness wasn&#39;t improving by +623 b=\r\necause my previous fitness was also\n&gt; around 1000, and I didn&#39;t know how a =\r\n&#39;Keep distance&#39; of 5115 would\n&gt; translate to a fitness of 1049. I wonder if=\r\n there are ways to make these\n&gt; numbers more intuitive.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, I di=\r\nd have some fun with game (I managed to beat the final\n&gt; boss), and I am lo=\r\noking forward to any updates and expansions, if they are\n&gt; planned. Making =\r\na compelling game based on evolutionary algorithms is a\n&gt; difficult but int=\r\neresting challenge, and this game provides a great start.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; Joost Huizinga\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Aug 10, 2014 at 6:03 PM, Sebastian Risi seb=\r\nastian.risi@...\n&gt; [neat] &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi =\r\nall,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m happy to announce our new game Evolve, made by Daniel Jallov=\r\n, a\n&gt;&gt; master student at ITU supervised by myself and Julian Togelius.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; The game consists of two major parts: an evolution part where neural\n&gt;&gt; n=\r\networks are evolved using NEAT, and a battle part where players use the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nevolved networks to control their robots.
