In general,\n&gt; the official reviewers are anonymous.  \n\nAh...okay.\n\n&gt; I thought it was a very good paper.  It\n&gt; really gives you a\n&gt; broad general sense of what it takes to become good\n&gt; at a particular\n&gt; game, and a theoretical sense of how challenging\n&gt; that really is. \n\nYeah. :)\n\n&gt; Because of this, I am not certain that the current\n&gt; form of the\n&gt; algorithm is really that practical, since it is\n&gt; based on creating a\n&gt; theoretically optimal competition.  The problem is\n&gt; that in practice,\n&gt; it is probably too computationally expensive to do\n&gt; that.  (That is,\n&gt; having all the players play all the test cases would\n&gt; just take too\n&gt; long in any serious game.)  \n\nYes, I can see how that would be a problem.  How to\nselect the most effective and efficient sample of\nopponents in a coevolutionary algorithm seems like an\nespecially difficult problem.\n\nI like the systematic approach of DELPHI, but I\nwondered just how it would work in practice on\nsomething other than a toy domain.  Seems like you&#39;re\nsaying it wouldn&#39;t.\n\n&gt; That, I\n&gt; believe, would make\n&gt; a really good competitive coevolution methodology,\n&gt; and probably would\n&gt; replace what I consider the current best practical\n&gt; method (Rosin and\n&gt; Belew 1997).\n\nYeah, I&#39;m really fascinated with this topic.  Are\nthere any other resources you (or anybody else here)\nmight point me to?\n\nIt seems like the key is to find an efficient sample\nof opponents each generation that tests each\nindividual against a diverse range of objectives.  I\nbelieve it was one of your robot domains in which you\nsampled opponents from across each NEAT species and\nused dominance tournaments to ensure a strong, diverse\nopponent population each generation.\n\nI&#39;ve read some of the discussion of &quot;subjective&quot; and\n&quot;objective&quot; fitness evaluations in coevolutionary\nalgorithms (e.g. Pollack, Luke, etc.).  It seems to me\nas if there&#39;s almost always an either/or with regard\nto such experiments.  That is, individuals are either\nevolved against internal opponents (others in the same\npopulation or past champions from the same run) or\nexternal opponents (pre-programmed algorithms).  To\nyour knowledge, have there been any experiments with a\nblend of subjective and objective evaluations?  I&#39;m\ncurious to see how this would play out experimentally.\n\n&gt; Yes I think you make a good conceptual anology. \n&gt; Your two ways of\n&gt; evaluating tic tac toe are roughly two objectives. \n&gt; What would happen\n&gt; in practice with the DELPHI algorithm is that a\n&gt; whole lot other\n&gt; objectives would be revealed and you would be able\n&gt; to construct a\n&gt; &quot;front&quot; that represented that various ways that\n&gt; players could be good.\n\nThis is an interesting concept.  I mean, a single\nplayer could represent *all* the ways that various\nplayers could be good (this optimal strategy is what\nwe want to evolve toward).  But players evolved\nagainst such a player would not be very robust. \n\nAre the ways that given strategies can be decomposed\nand represented by individual players dependent mostly\non the domain?  I mean, using the DELPHI technique,\nyou think you would end up with a given number of\nplayers, say 20 or 30, that would each represent a\ntest of a given strategic objective?\n\nTo what extent are strategies decomposable?  Could a\ngiven individual test for two or more objectives?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
