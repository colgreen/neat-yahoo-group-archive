So far we&#39;re generating five types of\ngraphical information: \n\n1) spiral layout for neural network\n2) layer layout for neural network\n3) graph of fitness over the run, with maximum,\nminimum, and average fitness for the population\n4) speciation graph very much like the one from your\npaper\n5) display of each game, and sequence of moves (for\nTic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, and Go)\n\nI&#39;ll post some examples of the fitness and species\ngraphs this weekend.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d also be interested if anyone else has some novel\n&gt; ideas for\n&gt; using graphics for analysis.\n\nRight now we&#39;re strongly considering representing\nheredity and lineages graphically.  A family tree,\nbasically, showing parent-child relationships, when\nparticular offspring arose, etc.  I&#39;m not exactly sure\nhow I want to format this information yet, but I\nbelieve it would be useful information to represent\ngraphically.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
