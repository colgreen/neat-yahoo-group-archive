I&#39;m planning to start with a\nvery small deck and work up if I&#39;m successful.  So the\nentire deck might be 1 1 2 2 3 3!\n\n&gt; How many inputs does your NN have?  It sounds like\n&gt; 12\n&gt; from your explanation...is that right?  So for the\n&gt; first row/first column, you&#39;re going to have one\n&gt; boolean input, either 0 or 1 depending on whether\n&gt; there&#39;s a card there?  But what is the other input\n&gt; going to be? \n\nLet&#39;s say we use the six card deck describe above. \nFor each of the six positions we have 5 binary inputs.\nOne input is for whether there is a card there or not.\nAnother if or whether the card is face down or now.\nIf there is a card and its face up, then the other\nthree inputs are for its identity, 1, 2 or 3.\n\nI could reduce the number of inputs to three by using\nbinary coding: 000 no card, 111 face down, 001 ace,\n010 deuce, 100 trey.  I would like to hear opinions\nabout whether that&#39;s a good idea.  If this works it\nmakes it easier to enlarge the deck.\n\n&gt; If your inputs range from 0 to 1, are you\n&gt; representing\n&gt; each type of card as a value range (e.g. King/clubs\n&gt; is\n&gt; from 0 to 0.33, 2/hearts is from .33 to .66, etc.)?\n\nKen thought it was not a good idea to use this\nrepresentation, and I&#39;m inclined to agree.\n\n&gt; I also think that Concentration sounds like an\n&gt; interesting test domain, and I&#39;m interested in how\n&gt; card games are represented.  \n\nThere is big money in Poker playing programs, but that\nis quite a difficult challenge.  I have no plans to\nattempt it.\n\nm\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
