I&#39;m using the rtNeat C++ pa=\r\nckage under linux and am trying to evolve a time-series predictor applicabl=\r\ne to either the stock market or forex markets.\n\nMost of the published resea=\r\nrch used Neural Networks trained via backprop.  These networks typically us=\r\ned a sliding window technique. For example, if you have 1000 days of histor=\r\nical data, a sliding window of 100 would feed the first 100 days of data as=\r\n input, and the 101st day would be the predicted output from the net. Then =\r\nthe window would slide by 1 day, and you feed the next 100 days and so on a=\r\nn so forth.  \n\nI&#39;ve been trying to use a similar technique with NEAT with v=\r\nery limited success.  For inputs, I use change in price and normalized volu=\r\nme.  The fitness function is basically the inverse of the mean squared erro=\r\nr of the predicted outputs vs. the actual data.  The output is trying to pr=\r\nedict the change in price at the next time period (it could be positive or =\r\nnegative).  I&#39;ve also switched from the default sigmoid activation function=\r\n to a bi-polar sigmoid activation that allows for outputs in the range of [=\r\n-1,1].\n\nHow are others using NEAT for time series prediction?  Are you usin=\r\ng a sliding window technique, or just have a large input with one output?  =\r\nHas anyone had success using NEAT to evolve a time-series predictor?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
