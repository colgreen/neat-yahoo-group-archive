I wonder if s=\r\nome global information in addition to \nyour \n&gt; local observations may be us=\r\neful?  For example, you may divide the \ngrid \n&gt; up into 2x2 (quadrants), or=\r\n even 3x3 (nonants?), and make \nobservations \n&gt; thusly.  You may even make =\r\nthese observations linear (rather than \n&gt; binary), for example based on num=\r\nber of ghosts/food/etc in a \nsection, or \n&gt; the weighted distance of all gh=\r\nosts/food/etc from the center of a \n&gt; section.  With such added global info=\r\nrmation, you&#39;d also need to \nprovide \n&gt; input as to where PacMan currently =\r\nresides (so he might know which \n&gt; section is most relevant).\n&gt; \n&gt; And of c=\r\nourse, this problem is screaming for HyperNEAT.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW - mine did cra=\r\nsh after I hit B and waited a few generations.  \nI got \n&gt; no exception dial=\r\nog though, it just disappeared.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, good work!\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
