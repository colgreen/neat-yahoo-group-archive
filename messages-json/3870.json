Local search does not have to proceed \nvia organism topo=\r\nlogy. \n\nUsage of NEAT as a global search method, as part of a hierarchical =\r\n\nmethodology, surely uses organism topology as the local search start \npoin=\r\nt. And in the case of your proposed backprop search on organism \nweight val=\r\nues, maintains the same number and composition of nodes and \nassociated con=\r\nnectivity. But a local search method could just as \neasily wander free in t=\r\nhe local fitness landscape, un-encumbered by \norganism topology issues, to =\r\nfind the local minima.\n\nThe very strong point of GA can also be its greates=\r\nt weakness, in \ninstances in which the computational resource requirements =\r\nof the \nfitness evaluation, in light of the dimensionality and hyper volume=\r\n \nsize and complexity, become non-trivial.\n\nThis is especially true in the =\r\ncase of non-adaptive mutation \nparameters, as is currently the case with NE=\r\nAT. There are many times \nin which it is orders of magnitude quicker for a =\r\nnon-GA local \ngradient search method to find a local minima, than an equiva=\r\nlent GA \nto mutate through generations to find the same local minima. \n\nNEA=\r\nT speciation and niche protection help to mitigate the problem via \npopulat=\r\nion size and maintaining multiple species, but at a \ncomputational cost. Bu=\r\nt a hierarchical search methodology can apply \nthe strengths of both GA and=\r\n local search, without having to use \ncomputational power to cover-up GA&#39;s =\r\nweak points.\n\nThe remaining question as to whether to a) re-encode the fina=\r\nl \ndestination of the local search back into the organism&#39;s topology, or \nb=\r\n) simply take the final/best fitness derived by the local search \n(using th=\r\ne organism&#39;s original topology as the start point), and \nassociate it with =\r\nthe organism and it&#39;s original topology, is up for \ndebate and/or personal =\r\npreference.\n\nThe moral of the story is that local search does not have to b=\r\ne \nconstrained by organism topology, beyond that of providing the start \npo=\r\nint. \n\nReal world problems are so complex in light of current computer \nspe=\r\neds and fitness computation requirements, to render GA alone to be \ncomputa=\r\ntionally unpractical in many instances, even with the obvious \nbenefits tha=\r\nt NEAT brings to the table.\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervens=\r\nki&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well actually speciation takes care =\r\nof this. Species are allowed to \n&gt; exist until they stagnate for too long t=\r\nime. If some new structure \n&gt; appears through mutations, the mutated indivi=\r\nduals are separated in \n&gt; another species. Each species is a local protecte=\r\nd competition \namong \n&gt; individuals grouped by similarity. Consider it as a=\r\n GA performed on \n&gt; near identical topologies. Then you can see NEAT as a a=\r\nlgorithm \n&gt; running multiple GAs. So this is actually what you mean by dyna=\r\nmic \n&gt; programming.. or something. In fact this scheme is far better than \n=\r\n&gt; it. \n&gt; As for the idea of speculative structure, this is the core of NEAT=\r\n \n&gt; and it is actually Ken&#39;s idea :) \n&gt; Colin Green&#39;s idea is about phased =\r\nsearching, as far as I know. It \nis \n&gt; that after some structure is added t=\r\nhrough complexifying, a \n&gt; simplifying phase kicks in, removing any unneces=\r\nsary structure, \nthus \n&gt; returning the search down to a baseline low diment=\r\nional space while \n&gt; retaining the fitness (because of elitism). \n&gt; \n&gt; Pete=\r\nr\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, c f &lt;christofer_fransson@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In dynamic programming the idea is to divide the\n&gt; &gt; solution in steps a=\r\nnd then for each step present a\n&gt; &gt; fixed number of possible solutions.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Collin Greens idea is that speculative nodes are added\n&gt; &gt; to the sol=\r\nutions but it might take time/generations\n&gt; &gt; before an added node are show=\r\nn to be useful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is it possible to apply dynamic programming appro=\r\nach\n&gt; &gt; to this area, to evolve NEAT driven networks?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To combine l=\r\nocal optimization and dynamic programming\n&gt; &gt; ideas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Br,\n&gt; &gt; Chris=\r\ntofer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- p=\r\netar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Given the simples=\r\nt topology (a perceptron\n&gt; &gt; &gt; structure), the local \n&gt; &gt; &gt; minima is just =\r\none.

The coolest thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in NEAT is tha=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when it increases the dimentionality of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution, the in=\r\ndividuals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are already located in a promising area of the new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npace.

There are unlimited possibi=\r\nlities. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So what local gradient search will do in essence is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pu=\r\nshing the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; weights towards the *local* minumim..
