I suppose it depends on how you set up the roving eye, I was\n&gt; thinking that the network would have something like two (x and y)\n&gt; outputs for the coordinates the eye should be looking at, the experiment\n&gt; code then supplies the appropriate image to the eye&#39;s sensor inputs.\n\nThat&#39;s where the complexity comes in, with the size of the eye. \nFloreano&#39;s triangle/square detector was a 3x3 pixel eye.  Ken&#39;s Go\nplaying eye also input values for a 3x3 area, but also included\nsomething like perimeter sensors in each cardinal direction.\n\nIf you scale up the size of the sensor area for the eye, you are\nexponentially increasing the size of the network needed.  A 3x3 eye\nneeds 9 sensor nodes, but a 5x5 needs 25, and so on.\n\nIt almost sounds as if you were assuming that the eye would only be\nlooking at a single pixel, or only receiving one sensory input value,\neach time step.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
