Yeh OK I&#39;ll have a look at \nimplementing it in SharpNEAT. What do you recon, should I used a fixed \nnumber of activations per evaluation or should I relax the network - \nwhich allows for open-ended recursiveness. Maybe I&#39;ll try a few \nvariations and see what happens eh. I&#39;ll try and kick it off tomorrow eve.\n\n&gt;But I&#39;m beginning to think that I&#39;m asking a network to do something other \n&gt;than what they are able to do.  Each output node is really a classifier, not \n&gt;a mathematical function output.  1 means yes, 0 means no.  Everything in \n&gt;between is a confidence level.  Now, for a single output pixel in a fixed \n&gt;size/location, a network can work just fine.  But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking \n&gt;it to do.  I&#39;m asking it not to identify features and classify them, I&#39;m \n&gt;asking it to form a mathematical model, and query that model.  But that&#39;s \n&gt;not what an ANN does, does it?  So I may well be doomed from the start, at \n&gt;least for this particular way of doing things.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI recon that an ANN could achieve this - given the right topology. Now \nwhether the task can be solved with a realisticly sized topology and \nwhether the topology can be found with NEAT or any other technique is \nanother question.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
