But, he\n&gt;doesn&#39;t fully exploit other weaker players.  And if you evolve only\n&gt;against a perfect player, all the net learns is not to lose - which is\n&gt;pretty boring.\n\nI don&#39;t know what properties a traditional perfect-player has, but I think \nwe need to distinguish between a real &quot;perfect&quot; player, and one that merely \nnever loses.  Call the latter an &quot;unbeatable&quot; player.  Obviously perfect \nplayers are a subset of unbeatable ones (and players who always win if \ntheir opponent makes a mistake, but cannot necessarily draw if their \nopponent does not, form another superset of perfect players).\n\nA true perfect player _will_ always will if they can, but like anybody \nelse, when playing another good player will generally only be able to draw.\n\nBut you are quite right, a player evolved against other players will \ngenerate tactics based on what it sees in its opponents while it is \nevolving.  a player evolved against only good opponents may well never \nlearn to win...\n\nWhereas at the start of evolution when the opposition is all lousy, \nlearning to win a few games might well be the way to make rapid progress...\n\nHmmm....\n\nBut a perfect player, will win if it can...\n\n&gt;Or solution to &quot;against a perfect player, the best you can do is draw&quot;\n&gt;is this: we&#39;ve started doing iterated Tic-Tac-Toe.  If a net plays\n&gt;multiple games against the same player, and can identify the opponent,\n&gt;it can play aggressively against a weak player and defensively against\n&gt;a strong one.  The problem becomes a combination of game strategy and\n&gt;opponent modeling.\n\nNot sure how that&#39;s useful.  I mean, OK if you were playing a complex game, \nthen knowing who your opponent is is a useful shortcut to doing the full \nanalysis of their playing.  And in a psychological (necessarily &quot;hidden \ninformation&quot;?) game obviously it is essential...\n\nBut for TTT?  You don&#39;t need to know anything about the opponent.  All you \nneed to do is look up the current board in that file I posted, and:\n\n1) pick any move labelled &quot;where Q wins&quot;,\n         or if there isn&#39;t one,\n2) pick any move labelled &quot;where nobody wins&quot;...\n\n(&quot;Q&quot; being whatever side you are on).\n\nBy this I don&#39;t mean that a net is actually going to work using some sort \nof board look-up, I mean that the patterns of winning and losing are simple \nenough that you never need to consider &quot;how my opponent is playing&quot;.  You \njust need to look at the current pattern of pieces...\n\nNot that we&#39;ve yet seen either &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;unbeatable&quot; players appearing \nyet (we don&#39;t have precise tests for them, but a perfect player would never \nlose to a random player).\n\n         Ian\n\n&gt;- Philip\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
