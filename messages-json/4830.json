I guess you could say it&#39;s a form of regularization.\n&gt;\n&gt; That sounds like a good idea. Did you find that it worked?\n\nLet&#39;s just say that I believe there are a class of problems where you\nwant to bias the search towards a more thorough search of the simpler\ntopologies before moving on to more complex ones. Where overfitting is\na concern you want that bias to be large and you can probably put a\nfinger in the air and come up with a maximum complexity beyond which\nyou can be sure the ANNs have overfit the data and are therefore\nuseless.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
