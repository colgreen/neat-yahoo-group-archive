I did\nhowever accidentally cut off the top test case when I cut and pasted\nthe code, and that case isn&#39;t preceded by ClearSignals() because I\nhappen to know that the network has just been constructed and is\nalready reset - it&#39;s a misleading optimisation though that can lead to\nerrors and/or confusion when experimenting with the code.\n\nSo hopefully that network I posted should work as a test case for\nRob&#39;s neural net code. It will of course require two activations.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
