Are you playing against other entrants into the  \n&gt; competition?\n\nExactly. The whole point of the competition is that the strengths and  \nweaknesses of various general game players are analyzed (there are  \nalso random and minimax reference players). All entrants basically  \nplay in three, week-long qualifier rounds (consisting of 20 games)  \nwhich one would assume pairs all the players on each of the games.\n\n&gt; Is there a set number of possible types of games (or are they able  \n&gt; to generate novel games based on variations of existing ones)?\n\nThe set of possible games is really only limited by the programming  \nskill of the game implementors. The specification language is very  \ngeneral. There are a few basic requirements that each valid game must  \nmeet (e.g. finite-length), but beyond that anything is fine. In  \naddition to the games I&#39;ve already mentioned there is a whole slew of  \nother games, some of which I&#39;ve heard of and some of which were  \ncreated just for the competition. My favorite is a game called  \nfarmers which is basically a really complicated version of lemonade  \nstand with three players. The final competition will consist of  \npreviously unreleased games, to avoid hard-coded strategies as much  \nas possible.\n\n&gt; Do you play a mixture of games each round or just one?  It would  \n&gt; seem unfair for some entrants to have to learn Tic-Tac-Toe one  \n&gt; round while others learn Chess.\n\nEach round is going to be a mixture of games, and I assume each  \nplayer will be evaluated on the same games (hopefully a full round- \nrobin tournament).\n\n&gt; How do they handle situations like draws?  Just settling on a rule  \n&gt; set for a Go competition would seem difficult enough.\n\nEach game has a set of goal conditions which detail how many points  \neach player receives for various terminal states. Unfortunately, full- \nblown Go is probably out of the question for the spec language.\n\n&gt; Per NEAT, is there any training/evolution that occurs prior to the  \n&gt; competition, or do you basically start evolving the population from  \n&gt; scratch during the competition, once you receive the rule set?\n\nAfter the spec is received, there is some amount of time for initial  \nlearning before the match commences. For now we&#39;re just starting from  \nscratch. I&#39;m not convinced that we can do any meaningful neural  \nnetwork &quot;pre-patterning&quot; given our current architecture. Eventually  \nwe&#39;d like to explore using SOMs for the input layer, and at that  \npoint it definitely becomes an option though.\n\n-- Joe\n\n"}}
