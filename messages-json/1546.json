What is going to be invented next year?  How can\n&gt;we know whether someone will come up with an ingenious marketing idea\n&gt;at an otherwise lackluster company?  Other human initiatives like\n&gt;deciding to take on a rival or even war also are frequently almost\n&gt;impossible to predict until it&#39;s too late (at least too late to make\n&gt;an economic gain from the prediction).  Accurately predicting the\n&gt;ideas and initiatives that various individuals will come up is perhaps\n&gt;as difficult as the problem of AI itself, since it would require\n&gt;accurately simulating the thought processes leading up to the\n&gt;decisions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, not to be too pessimistic, there are still some trends that\n&gt;can be followed with a level of success, but I just don&#39;t think\n&gt;there&#39;s ever going to be an extremely accurate prediction model.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n{Idea] Many stock price movements are unpredictable, but some of the \nmovements may be predictable after effects of the unpredictable moves. \nTherefore the key in making money would be to be ability to determine \nwhen the predictable movements are occuring (or are about to occur) and \nto trade based on the prediction, and to ignore all other \nnon-predictable movements.
