All reasonable types=\r\netting formats are\n  acceptable (later, the authors of accepted papers will=\r\n be asked to\n  follow a particular typesetting format to prepare their pape=\r\nrs for\n  publication.)\n\n  The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepte=\r\nd) will be limited\n  to 7 (IEEE style) pages.  Papers must not have been pr=\r\neviously\n  published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  The=\r\n\n  first page of the draft paper should include: title of the paper,\n  name=\r\n, affiliation, postal address, and email address for each author.\n  The fir=\r\nst page should also identify the name of the Contact Author\n  and a maximum=\r\n of 5 topical keywords that would best represent the\n  content of the paper=\r\n.  Finally, the name of the conference (GEM)\n  must be mentioned on the fir=\r\nst page.\n\n  Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity=\r\n,\n  impact, and soundness.  Each paper will be refereed by two experts\n  in=\r\n the field who are independent of the conference program committee.\n  The r=\r\neferees&#39; evaluations will then be reviewed by two members of\n  the program =\r\ncommittee who will recommend a decision to the co-chairs.\n  The co-chairs w=\r\nill make the final decision.  Lastly, the Camera-Ready\n  papers will be rev=\r\niewed by one member of the program committee.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\n  Feb.  25=\r\n, 2009:    Submission of papers (about 5 to 7 pages)\n  March 25, 2009:    N=\r\notification of acceptance\n  April 25, 2009:    Camera-Ready papers and Regi=\r\nstration due\n  July 13-16, 2009:  The 2009 International Conference on Gene=\r\ntic and\n                     Evolutionary Methods (GEM&#39;09)\n\nMEMBERS OF PROG=\r\nRAM AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEES:\n\n  The Program Committee includes members of=\r\n chapters of World Academy\n  of Science (chapters: supercomputing; scientif=\r\nic computing; AI;\n  imaging science; databases; simulation; software engine=\r\nering;\n  embedded systems; internet and web technologies; communications;\n =\r\n bioinformatics; computational biology; and computer security.)\n  The Progr=\r\nam Committee for GEM is currently being formed.  Those\n  interested in join=\r\ning the Program Committee should email Prof. Arabnia\n  (hra@...) the=\r\n following information: Name, affiliation\n  and position, complete mailing =\r\naddress, email address, a short\n  biography together with research interest=\r\ns and the name of the\n  conference (GEM) offering to help with.\n  Many who =\r\nhave already joined the committees of individual tracks\n  are renowned lead=\r\ners, scholars, researchers, scientists and\n  practitioners of the highest r=\r\nanks; many are directors of research\n  laboratories, fellows of various soc=\r\nieties, heads/chairs of\n  departments, deans and provosts.\n\nPURPOSE / HISTO=\r\nRY:\n\n  GEM&#39;09 is an annual research conference about genetic and\n  evolutio=\r\nnary methods.  It is being held jointly (same location and\n  dates) with a =\r\nnumber of other conferences (WORLDCOMP&#39;09).\n  WORLDCOMP is the largest annu=\r\nal gathering of researchers in\n  computer science, computer engineering and=\r\n applied computing.\n\n  The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliat=\r\ned research topics\n  into a coordinated meeting held in a common place at a=\r\n common time.\n  The main goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas i=\r\nn a number\n  of research areas that interact.  The model used facilitates\n =\r\n communication among researchers from all over the world in different\n  fie=\r\nlds of computer science, computer engineering and applied\n  computing.  Bot=\r\nh inward research (core areas of computer science and\n  engineering) and ou=\r\ntward research (multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary,\n  and applications)=\r\n will be covered during the event.\n\n  GEM&#39;09 and WORLDCOMP&#39;09 will be compo=\r\nsed of research presentations,\n  keynote lectures, invited presentations, t=\r\nutorials, panel discussions,\n  and poster presentations.  In recent past, k=\r\neynote and/or tutorial\n  speakers included: Prof. David A. Patterson (U. of=\r\n California,\n  Berkeley); Prof. Michael J. Flynn (Stanford U.); Prof. John =\r\nH. Holland\n  (U. of Michigan, Ann Arbor); Prof. Brian D. Athey (U. of Michi=\r\ngan,\n  Ann Arbor), Prof. H. J. Siegel (Colorado State U.); Prof. Barry Verc=\r\noe\n  (MIT); Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (U. of California, Berkeley);\n  Prof. Jun L=\r\niu (Harvard U.); Dr. Jim Gettys (OLPC + developer of X\n  Window); Dr. Chris=\r\n Rowen (President and CEO, Tensilica, Inc.); and\n  many other distinguished=\r\n speakers.\n\nLOCATION OF CONFERENCES:\n\n  The conferences will be held in the=\r\n Monte Carlo hotel, Las Vegas,\n  Nevada, USA (with any overflows at other n=\r\near-by hotels).  This is\n  a mega hotel with excellent conference facilitie=\r\ns and over 3,000\n  rooms.  It is minutes from the airport with 24-hour shut=\r\ntle\n  service to and from the airport.  This hotel has many recreational\n  =\r\nattractions, including: waterfalls, spa, pools, sunning decks, Easy\n  River=\r\n, wave pool, lighted tennis courts, health spa, nightly shows,\n  a number o=\r\nf restaurants, ...  The negotiated room rate for\n  conference attendees is =\r\nvery reasonable.  The hotel is within\n  walking distance from most other at=\r\ntractions (recreational\n  destinations, Golf courses, ...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--~--~----=\r\n-----~--~----~------------~-------~--~----~\nYou received this message becau=\r\nse you are subscribed to the Google\nGroups &quot;Machine Learning News&quot; group.\nT=\r\no post to this group, send email to ML-news@...\nTo unsubscribe=\r\n from this group, send email to\nML-news+unsubscribe@...\nFor mo=\r\nre options, visit this group at\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/ML-news?hl=\r\n=3Den\n-~----------~----~----~----~------~----~------~--~---\n\n"}}
