I haven&#39;t had time to think \nabout =\r\nit as much as I&#39;d like to and your critique helped me gain more \nperspectiv=\r\ne.

(=\r\nsorry I know that sounds like a totally \nloaded\n&gt; &gt;  question now, but I&#39;m =\r\ngenuinely interested in hearing your \nopinion --\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve been keeping an =\r\neye on the UCT literature for a while and \nits\n&gt; &gt;  hard to see the world w=\r\nithout UCT-colored glasses anymore :P)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Joe...yeah, it&#39;s a loaded q=\r\nuestion, but I&#39;ll give it a shot. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; My current perspective on how hum=\r\nans (and to a lesser extent other\n&gt; species) are able to flexibly learn a w=\r\nide range of novel cognitive\n&gt; tasks has to do with their ability to encode=\r\n invariant \nrepresentations\n&gt; of spatio-temporal patterns, and once acquire=\r\nd, use those encodings \nto\n&gt; recognize, generate, and predict sequences. I =\r\nthink this general\n&gt; perspective helps frame how people can learn to play t=\r\nennis, speak\n&gt; Chinese, play the piano, and master games like Go.\n&gt; \n&gt; My u=\r\nnderstanding of UCT is that it is a method of pruning the search\n&gt; tree for=\r\n Monte Carlo methods, but in the end you&#39;re still talking\n&gt; about a brute f=\r\norce search of child nodes in a tree, right? I was\n&gt; wondering how MoGo dea=\r\nlt with simple iterative or repeating patterns\n&gt; that arise in Go, like Ko =\r\nfights and ladders. For those who don&#39;t\n&gt; know, ladders are simple repeatin=\r\ng structures that arise in the game\n&gt; that many amateurs can instantly reco=\r\ngnize, but which tree-search\n&gt; methods perform extremely poorly at. I think=\r\n the reason for this is\n&gt; that a human can readily learn an invariant repre=\r\nsentation of a \nsimple\n&gt; pattern and recognize and predict the outcome rega=\r\nrdless of\n&gt; orientation or size of the board.\n&gt; \n&gt; A quick scan of the Comp=\r\nuter Go discussion group on the issue makes \nit\n&gt; sound like this is a reas=\r\nonably correct assessment, and that\n&gt; programmers generally include some ki=\r\nnd of ad hoc mechanism for \ncoping\n&gt; with things like ladders. This explain=\r\ns why MoGo can do reasonably\n&gt; well when powered by a supercomputer in play=\r\ning on a 9x9 board, \nsince\n&gt; structures like ladders are limited in size.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; So my criticism of an algorithm like MoGo would probably boil down \nto\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Where is its representation of a ladder?&quot; And if that \nrepresentation\n&gt; =\r\nis not at all part of its core algorithm, that&#39;s where my skepticism\n&gt; ente=\r\nrs that the methodology will not scale very well, either to \nlarger\n&gt; Go bo=\r\nards or to other domains. I think the ability to encode and\n&gt; employ invari=\r\nant representations of patterns is the root of the\n&gt; problem, and the whole=\r\n class of MC methods seems in the spirit of\n&gt; traditional AI approaches whi=\r\nch I just don&#39;t think are going to do \nthe\n&gt; job.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
