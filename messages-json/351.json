So even if you only used random\n&gt; &gt; selection, you would end up with larger, more complex\n&gt; &gt; individuals at the end of your run.  They may not be\n&gt; &gt; able to *do* anything meaningful, but they would still\n&gt; &gt; be significantly different from their ancestors.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is not entirely true.  We have actually done this experiment.  \n&gt; What NEAT actually does under these conditions is expand its *range*\n&gt; of complexity, but the simplest species generally remains intact \nsince\n&gt; it does just as well as the more complex ones that continue to \nappear.\n&gt; It is true that over 500 generations or so the simplest species may\n&gt; gain 5 or 10 connections, but this is trivial, since the most \ncomplex\n&gt; species gain hundreds.  \n\nThis depends greatly on your parameters, doesn&#39;t it?  With smaller \npopulations, larger initial genomes, higher mutation rates, and lower \nspeciation thresholds, the genetic change from generation to \ngeneration is going to be more pronounced, isn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt; In other words, simplicity is protected in\n&gt; NEAT by speciation as long as its competitive, just as complexity is\n&gt; protected!\n\nI guess I&#39;m confused about exactly what sort of experiment you&#39;re \nreferring to.  You say species are protected as long as they&#39;re \ncompetitive, but we were talking about an experiment where no fitness \nfunction is used.  How would you be &quot;competitive&quot; in a purely random \nselection environment? \n\nIncidentally, here&#39;s a pretty cool little webpage that models \nisolated effects of natural selection and genetic drift.  You can \npick particular species (e.g. Peppered Moth) and see how the ratio of \nparticular genes shifts as a result of either natural selection or \ngenetic drift.\n\nhttp://fmc.utm.edu/~rirwin/NatSelModIntro.htm\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
