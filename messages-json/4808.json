Activation function of=\r\n the CPPN, which can be of any type, and it can output any floating point v=\r\nalue\n  2. Activation function of the perceptron-type network in form of (1/=\r\n(1+(exp(-(slope*activesum))))) which output values are in range from 0 to 1=\r\n\n- There is no evolution mechanism for the topology of perceptron-type netw=\r\norks wich is fixed from the begining,  The only evolution that takes place =\r\nis evolution of the CPPN, wich is based on the coordinates of the source an=\r\nd destination node to produce the weight\n- The perceptron-type networks hav=\r\ne only 2 layers (input & output) and it is not possible to have hidden laye=\r\nrs, because CPPN can not produce them by definition, so all the hidden laye=\r\nrs must be engineered by hand of the designer. \n  For example, in order to =\r\nhave one hidden layer in HyperNEAT for a particular problem, 2 perceptron-t=\r\nype networks (which will be produced by 2 separated CPPNs)  must be joined =\r\ntogether, the outputs of the first perceptron-type network (produced by the=\r\n first CPPN) must be connected with the input of the second perceptron-type=\r\n network (produced by the second CPPN). \n\n\nIs this how HyperNEAT works?\n\n\nT=\r\nhanks in advance\n\n\n"}}
