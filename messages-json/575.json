The two n&#39;s are not the\n&gt; same. The size of\n&gt; the board and the number of initial stones are\n&gt; independent. For 7x7, I\n&gt; think we used 10 stones or something like that one\n&gt; the board. \n\nAh...okay.  Thanks for clarifying.\n\n&gt; &gt; -1  0  0  1  0\n&gt; &gt;  0 -1  0  0  0\n&gt; &gt;  0  0  0  0  1\n&gt; &gt;  0 -1  0  0  0\n&gt; &gt;  0  0  0  1  0\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually count three non-scoring first moves on\n&gt; that example \n\nYes, you&#39;re right...my mistake.\n\n&gt; (actually\n&gt; because of the real split-game dynamics, there are\n&gt; 5). \n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;split-game dynamics&quot;?\n\n&gt; True. The baseline was about 65% on 5x5 and between\n&gt; 50 and 60% on 7x7. \n\nAh...that&#39;s useful to know.  \n\n&gt; I\n&gt; didn&#39;t include this because I would rather focus on\n&gt; the NEAT comparison,\n&gt; than a random comparison. \n\nI understand.\n\n&gt; As for the relative sense of difficulty, I\n&gt; understand what you&#39;re getting\n&gt; at, but I don&#39;t think its that important. What might\n&gt; have been best, would\n&gt; be to show the average evolutionary trends as a\n&gt; graph. The initial\n&gt; solutions played slightly better than 50% on 7x7,\n&gt; and it would have been\n&gt; nice to convey that in the paper. However, since the\n&gt; main focus of the\n&gt; paper was on comparing to NEAT and analyzing the\n&gt; modularity, I don&#39;t think\n&gt; its that important.\n\nFair enough.  Just making suggestions.  \n\nI&#39;m extremely interested in indirect encoding in the\ncontext of NEAT.  We have some ideas about various\napproaches to take, and at some point we&#39;d probably\nlike to do a comparison with standard NEAT, as well as\nyour approach to modularity.  Is the code available\nsomewhere now? \n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
