But one thing I find a little confusing is the idea =\r\nthat there is a special kind of random distribution that is better than oth=\r\ner random distributions.  If that is true, then doesn&#39;t it require some inf=\r\normation to encode what that distribution is?  And if it does need to be ch=\r\nosen from some special distributions, and those distributions are captured =\r\nby Junk DNA, which ends up being expressed, then why is it called &quot;Junk DNA=\r\n?&quot;  Couldn&#39;t we essentially tell the same story in a simpler way by saying,=\r\n &quot;a subset of DNA encodes the initial weight distribution in the brain?&quot; Wh=\r\nat then makes it junk?  And why use the word random either?\n\nIn any case, i=\r\nt still does bring up whether a special activation function inspired by thi=\r\ns idea might be helpful in establishing some aspect of initial connectivity=\r\n.  I&#39;m guessing that if that is true, then the advantage would probably sho=\r\nw up more in plastic networks than static ones.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 6 March 2011 00:22, =\r\nKen &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Colin,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s pretty rea=\r\nsonable to speculate that some initial &quot;primed&quot; connectivity is\n&gt; &gt; specifi=\r\ned through DNA that then goes through changes according to rules of plastic=\r\nity. Of\n&gt; &gt; course, there is probably not a strict &quot;pre-specified&quot; period a=\r\nnd another strict &quot;plastic&quot;\n&gt; &gt; period, because in reality they likely over=\r\nlap from the very start, but the general idea that\n&gt; &gt; both elements are pr=\r\nesent and that the pendulum swings gradually away from\n&gt; &gt; pre-specificatio=\r\nn makes sense to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From a neuroevolution perspective, i=\r\nt&#39;s possible to\n&gt; &gt; imagine variants of adaptive HyperNEAT that exhibit mor=\r\ne or less of this type of dynamic.\n&gt; &gt; Adaptive HyperNEAT was described in =\r\n&quot;Indirectly Encoding Neural Plasticity as a Pattern\n&gt; &gt; of Local Rules,&quot; wh=\r\nich is at http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/risi.sab10.html . Of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; course we are continuing to explore these types of plastic models.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n About the junk DNA hypothesis - it&#39;s the type of thing you can&#39;t really de=\r\nfinitively verify as\n&gt; &gt; true or false, but if some initial &quot;randomness&quot; in=\r\n the brain was provided by junk DNA it\n&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be that surprising. But=\r\n the thing I kind of object to in the quotations you provided\n&gt; &gt; is the id=\r\nea that this idea is &quot;bold.&quot; It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a major problem to=\r\n explain\n&gt; &gt; how disorganized randonmness can get into a system. I mean, ra=\r\nndom initialization (which\n&gt; &gt; is a standard part of many EAs and other lea=\r\nrning algorithms) is generally not the\n&gt; &gt; interesting part, at least not i=\r\nn terms of being the part that requires great intellectual effort\n&gt; &gt; to co=\r\nnceive or understand. So if nature in fact took one arbitrary route to gett=\r\ning a little\n&gt; &gt; randomness into things over another, it doesn&#39;t seem that =\r\nimpressive or fortuitous\n&gt; &gt; compared to how it discovered the parts that a=\r\nre, in contrast, well-organized.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I have a counterpoint to this argu=\r\nment that I&#39;m not 100% sure how\n&gt; to explain but I&#39;ll have a go...\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes=\r\n there are various ANN connection weight initialisation methods\n&gt; some of w=\r\nhich employ randomness either by itself or as part of some\n&gt; broader method=\r\n. Those techniques (AFAIK) tend to use traditional\n&gt; random number generato=\r\nrs (RNGs) and either uniform or gaussian noise.\n&gt; I&#39;m suggesting that if na=\r\nture had a use for this form of randomness\n&gt; then it would be fairly easy t=\r\no evolve from scratch and therefore\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t require utilisation of junk =\r\nDNA. Easy to evolve because the\n&gt; noise could be said to have low Kolmogoro=\r\nv complexity (can be\n&gt; generated by a simple algorithm), although I&#39;m not 1=\r\n00% sure how\n&gt; biologically plausible this part of my argument is.\n&gt; \n&gt; So =\r\nassuming for now that nature /is/ using junk DNA as a source of\n&gt; noise for=\r\n connection patterns *and* that there is an easier to\n&gt; discover source, th=\r\ne question becomes - why use junk DNA?\n&gt; \n&gt; This junk DNA has complexity an=\r\nd structure that had utility in its\n&gt; origin domain, so as a source of conn=\r\nectivity patterns in this other\n&gt; unrelated domain it&#39;s /effectively/ rando=\r\nm, but this is a form of\n&gt; randomness very much distinct from gaussian nois=\r\ne, it has complex\n&gt; structure. E.g. consider using bytes from some random p=\r\nortion of\n&gt; computer RAM as a source of random numbers - it&#39;s going to have=\r\n very\n&gt; different properties than gaussian noise. Mathematically speaking t=\r\nhe\n&gt; junk DNA noise has a high(er) Kolmogorov complexity (it cannot be\n&gt; re=\r\npresented by a simple/trivial algorithm as gaussian noise can be).\n&gt; So yes=\r\n it&#39;s arbitrary but it&#39;s also non-trivial to evolve from\n&gt; scratch, as such=\r\n it&#39;s possible that some properties of this complex\n&gt; random noise are usef=\r\nul for brains - e.g. maybe when mapped to\n&gt; connectivity patterns they have=\r\n a good proportion of short to long\n&gt; connection lengths (massively oversim=\r\nplifying how complex this junk\n&gt; DNA might be here, but maybe that helps ex=\r\nplain my argument).\n&gt; \n&gt; [As a side note all of this sort of fits in with y=\r\nour talk on\n&gt; serendipity and novelty search]\n&gt; \n&gt; [As another side note I =\r\nwould also add that if junk DNA is being used\n&gt; it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s being=\r\n used for things other than connectivity\n&gt; patterns - that&#39;s just one hypot=\r\nhesis. We know that this DNA is being\n&gt; expressed but don&#39;t know for sure i=\r\nf it has an utility, it might just\n&gt; be a side effect of other useful DNA b=\r\neing expressed (holding on for\n&gt; the ride)]\n&gt; \n&gt; But if you take on the ass=\r\numptions I&#39;ve stated then this has\n&gt; implications for CPPNs. Currently our =\r\nCPPNs are mostly using\n&gt; continuous functions operating on a continuous coo=\r\nrdinate space - and\n&gt; therefore generate continuous/smooth connectivity pat=\r\nterns. Should we\n&gt; consider inclusing a means of introducing complexity int=\r\no the patterns\n&gt; early on that isn&#39;t directly evolved? e.g. some new CPPN f=\r\nunction that\n&gt; refers to a chunk of complex random noise? For a laugh we co=\r\nuld use\n&gt; actual junk DNA sequences from nature translated into numbers -\n&gt;=\r\n probably as good a source as any :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
