One\n&gt; connection you also may not know of is that Kennon was an undergrad\n&gt; here at UT and did an independent study with me working on NEAT a\n&gt; couple years ago. \n&gt; \n\nAnd that independent study on NEAT was also what got me thinking about \nnatural computation research, and thus this awesome year over here \ndoing cool stuff and meeting \ngreat people (like Arjun).\n\nSo thanks, Ken, for the encouragement to pursue research as well as \nthinking up NEAT :)\n\n&gt; It&#39;s definitely interesting to know what the biggest researchers in\n&gt; neuroevolution are up to, since there really aren&#39;t that many major\n&gt; places to study this topic (yet).\n\nI&#39;d say that there is much more emphasis on methods like neuroevolution \nover here in the UK; quite a few of the CS departments here (sussex, \nedinburgh, UCL, etc) have people working on GAs and things like \nneuroevolution.\n\nSadly, I didn&#39;t qualify for the Overseas Research Scholarship (pretty much \nthe only recourse for PhD funding for non UK/EU students here), so I&#39;ll be \nreturning to the US this autumn. I&#39;m hoping to start a phd in fall &#39;05 \n(since i missed the app deadlines for this next year). Any suggestions at \nuniversities in the US doing interesting work? (UT already turned me down \nonce ... I wonder if I should reapply?)\n\nAlso, I&#39;m hoping to find some position next year (fall &#39;04) as a research \nassistant or something ... any suggestions about places that might hire \nnon-phds?\n\n-KB-\n\n\n"}}
