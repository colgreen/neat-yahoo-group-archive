I was \ngetting a divide-by-zero that I shouldn&#39;t have gotten, but did.  Fixed it.  \nThat shouldn&#39;t happen again...I hope. :)\n\nBest of all, I decided something...  if 95% of the population has a &#39;stable&#39; \nfitness value, then what that tells me is that it has had plenty of time to \nstabalize, yet the remaining 5% is fluctuating too much to be considered \nstable.  That means that its results are somewhat random in nature, meaning \nit probably has low fitness anyway.  Which tends to be the case.  So I \ndecided that I would be willing to end a generation once 95% of the \npopulation has a stable fitness.  The result:  I end each generation faster \n(like after 70-80 samples vs. 256), so the overall pace of the experiment is \nappreciably faster now.  YEAH!\n\nOf course, more machines contributing would still be helpful and \nappreciated... ;)\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
