I&#39;d\n&gt; like to formalize it a little bit further here...\n&gt;\n&gt; What we have to do is distinguish between the spaces of the genotype\n&gt; and the phenotype, since they can be quite different in dimensionality\n&gt; depending on the mapping between them.  Then, as long as we are clear\n&gt; about which space we are talking about, there will be no ambiguity\n&gt; about the meaning of a dimension.\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, all of my arguments about the need to evolve variable\n&gt; length genomes are about *genotypic* space.  Of course, with NEAT in\n&gt; its current form, this is a trivial statement, since the dimensions of\n&gt; genotype and phenotype are the same.  However, in a future NEAT\n&gt; wherein the genotype goes through an indirect mapping to phenotype,\n&gt; the dimensions of the genotype may be much fewer than the phenotype.\n&gt; Neverthelsss, all the arguments still apply: we still wish to minimize\n&gt; the number of dimensions in the genome.  It&#39;s just that now they are\n&gt; going to be mapped to somethin different in the phenotype.\n&gt;\n&gt; What this analysis suggests, and what I ultimately believe is\n&gt; happening in this field, is that there are two parallel yet\n&gt; complementary directions of research that should ultimately converge:\n&gt; 1) The idea of complexification through starting minimally and\n&gt; protection of innovation inside NEAT is a generic methodology for\n&gt; evolving in any genotypic space, and 2) an (extremely) clever indirect\n&gt; mapping would allow very compact representations.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1 with 2 means efficient search plus efficient representation.  Thus\n&gt; they go together very neatly.  You may think for a moment that 2\n&gt; precludes 1, since perhaps if the mapping is sufficiently powerful the\n&gt; number of dimensions necessary in the genome will be so low that 1\n&gt; will become irrelevant.  However, that is not likely to be the case.\n&gt; Even in indirect mappings we are likely to need many hundreds or\n&gt; thousands of genes, even though those genes may be reused.  Note human\n&gt; DNA, with 30,000 genes.  These 30,000 genes are reused in such amazing\n&gt; proportions that they somehow map to 100 trillion connections in the\n&gt; human brain.  Yet even with this brilliant reduction, 30,000 is still\n&gt; a lot of dimensions, and still is unlikely to be optimized through\n&gt; direct search in the genotype space of 30,000 dimensions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore, I believe the field should head towards NEAT-style\n&gt; evolution of indiretly encoded genomes.  I don&#39;t know if you saw when\n&gt; I mentioned our paper, &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny,&quot; but it\n&gt; is a large review of this area that you may be interested in:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:alife03\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that modularity is a big deal in evolution, and it should\n&gt; definitely be at the forefront of future researh.  However, sometimes\n&gt; the way we think about modularity may be misleading since we are\n&gt; tempted to think as engineers whereas evolution is not like an\n&gt; engineer.  We have a short paper on this topic as well:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04ws\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; (I&#39;ve been on holiday so I&#39;m a bit out of daye, this is from\n&gt; Kenneth&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; long discussion of about a week ago)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Great analysis!  Just one small additional thought:  what do we\n&gt; mean by\n&gt; &gt; &quot;dimensions&quot; in the search space?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Example, suppose we&#39;re doing some vision processing and by whatever\n&gt; means\n&gt; &gt; we arrive at a good solution.  Then we analyze the solution and we\n&gt; discover\n&gt; &gt; that, although it contains 1000 neurones, they are actually 10\n&gt; copies(*) of\n&gt; &gt; the same 90-neurone structure (say an edge-detector) and a control\n&gt; network\n&gt; &gt; linking them together(**).  That&#39;s not really anything like as\n&gt; large a\n&gt; &gt; solution-space as it looked before the analysis, for two reasons:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (* or 10 &quot;iso-neural&quot; networks, e.g. not copies but functionally\n&gt; &gt; equivalent....)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (** current systems are unlikely to produce this, see below)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) The 10 copies of the edge detector are 10 copies of the same set\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; dimensions, and thus a sub-space with 10-fold less dimensions than\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; originally appeared\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) The edge-detector and the control network are (arguably) not in\n&gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; search-space -- they are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.  e.g. the modularity of the\n&gt; problem\n&gt; &gt; only requires them to respect the same &quot;interface&quot; connections, if\n&gt; does not\n&gt; &gt; required the edge-detector internal works to be finely tuned to\n&gt; match the\n&gt; &gt; control network.  Or, to put it another way, any functional edge\n&gt; detector\n&gt; &gt; would work with any functional control network.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stronger examples of modularity producing orthogonality can easily\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; dreamed up.  Consider the case of N sub-nets, each evolved to\n&gt; recognize a\n&gt; &gt; different input class, and a control net which just checks for\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; sub-net is reporting the highest confidence.  There is no\n&gt; dependency(***)\n&gt; &gt; between the sub-nets.  (Their internal dependencies are (i) report\n&gt; their\n&gt; &gt; confidence on a connection to the control net, (ii) the input data\n&gt; format.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (*** dependency is the opposite of orthogonality)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, one cannot expect a homogeneous evolution procedure to\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; happen to produce orthogonal modules.  You need a modular evolution\n&gt; system:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (slowest) mutate modularity\n&gt; &gt; (medium) try topologies within each module\n&gt; &gt; (fastest) play with the weights in each module\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - as people have begun to tinker with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ian Badcoe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms -\n&gt; &gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
