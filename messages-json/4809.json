That way you are show=\r\ning the substrate the true geometry of the world.  Even if it didn&#39;t achiev=\r\ne better performance, it would still be interesting that it can learn from =\r\na screen-like representation (very high-dimensional), like a human.  \n\nBy t=\r\nhe way, is a paper on HyperGP available anywhere online?\n\nken  \n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, Julian Togelius &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Congrats!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wow.
