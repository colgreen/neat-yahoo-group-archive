They used NEAT to evolve an eye that looks at only \nparts of an image and zooms on on relevant features to make \ndistinctions.  The eye actually decides where it wants to look, as \nopposed to directed scanning as you suggest, but the concept is \nsimilar.  The video is actually in the Files section of this group, \ncalled &quot;eye.swf.&quot;  Here is the full link:\n\nhttp://f6.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/QFoiQ4hlWrnOq9A5E5Xs1IXAJvXaVNupa4hhQqv2\nudISn92F1PydEVJy1gKj2No6n-0oA7_ir95uFFOZbrG_1tOizxY_KIqSzu3K/eye.swf\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;jeff@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This may be an off-the-wall suggestion but you could try, just for \nkicks,\n&gt; approaching the OCR problem a little differently.  You could look \nat one row\n&gt; or column as an input vector and step the network through cycles \nlooking at\n&gt; consecutive columns/rows.  Of course, this implies a greater \nnetwork\n&gt; complexity, but it&#39;s a different approach if you&#39;re trying to cut \ndown on\n&gt; inputs...may be interesting anyhoo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now someone else can say why this is a crazy idea :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, 09 Sep 2005 23:08:00 -0000, Carl Strange wrote\n&gt; &gt; I kicked around a few ideas for a project, many getting wildly \nout of\n&gt; &gt; hand, and settled on Braille character recognition.  It let me \nplay\n&gt; &gt; with a bit of development while using your OCR experiment as a\n&gt; &gt; framework.  I thought the reduced 7 X 5 input grid and very \ndistinct\n&gt; &gt; character set would be a snap for the network.  Now I know \nbetter. \n&gt; &gt; Thirty-five inputs and twenty-six outputs is too much for a one-\nto-\n&gt; &gt; one connected net so the problem isn&#39;t trivial.  I&#39;m having fun \nplaying\n&gt; &gt; with the various search parameters, especially the frequency \nof &quot;add\n&gt; &gt; connections&quot; and &quot;add nodes&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The downside of adding an experiment is my SharpNEAT library and \nsome\n&gt; &gt; of the Form1 initialization differ from the standard release.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lots to play with and I haven&#39;t even looked at the network code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Carl\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
