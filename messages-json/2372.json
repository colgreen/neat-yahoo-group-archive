I naively assumed that if I modified the &#39;add connection&#39; routine \nto only add connections where the source neuron&#39;s innovation # was less \nthan the target&#39;s [with a bit of added complexity around the input and \noutput neurons] that this would do the job.\n\nUnfortunately I noticed that some connections were still going back into \nthe net. This of course is due to the way we add new neurons by \nsplitting connections, which means that new neurons with high innovation \n#&#39;s are placed throughout the network and often before neurons with \nlower innov #&#39;s. It seems obvious to me now of course :)\n\nSo it seems I need some other mechanism to ensure new conenctions are \nall feed-forward and because of the optimisations in my exiting genome \ncode it is now quite rigid, or at least if I start hacking around in \nthere I risk disturbing the optimsations. No I think I&#39;ll defer this \nwork for now, what I want to do is allow for easy plugging-in of \nalternative genome classes which is something not quite in place right \nnow. However, as part of this I want to do a more wide ranging change \nwhich would be to expand the ANN model in use to allow for neurons with \nmultiple incoming connections. The standard single connection point \nneurons then just become a special case (I think!).\n\nOf course that could potentially take a while so I&#39;ll be thinking about \nwrapping up everything I&#39;ve done to-date and releasing some code in the \nnext day or so.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
