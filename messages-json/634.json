Firstly we draw\n&gt; &gt;neurons with &quot;pure&quot; 1-st level (all connections to the input one).\nThen (a bit further from inputs) only\n&gt; &gt;those neurons that have connections to the 0 and 1 layer only and\nso on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;And what was your method?\n&gt; \n&gt; The same, except we start at the output nodes and move backward.  \n&gt; The issue is that nodes are going to be placed in the layer \n&gt; corresponding to their shortest distance to the input (or output) \n&gt; layer.  So, a node with 1000 paths to the input layer that are 4 \n&gt; connections long and 1 path that&#39;s 1 connection long will wind up\nin \n&gt; the first hidden layer when it would more logically be in the 4th.\n\nHave you tried placing them in in the layer of their average distance\nfrom the input?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
