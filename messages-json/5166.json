On a moderate=\r\nly-deceptive map, novelty search outperforms fitness search, and fitness se=\r\narch outperforms random search. On a very deceptive map, novelty search onc=\r\ne again outperforms the other two methods, but fitness-based search is appr=\r\noximately equivalent to a random search.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any form random search (such =\r\nas the one you suggest) does not exploit any sort of domain information and=\r\n will likely perform very badly at almost any task if a large proportion of=\r\n genotypes specify degenerate behaviors (which is likely the case for real-=\r\nworld domains; most random genomes likely encode no useful information).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; To understand why a search for behavioral novelty may often be much diff=\r\nerent than a random search of the genotype space, it is helpful to consider=\r\n the mapping of a genotype to a behavior. This mapping is a composition of =\r\nthe mapping between genotype to phenotype and from phenotype to behavior sp=\r\nace. \n&gt; \n&gt; The first mapping (from genotype to phenotype) is the encoding. =\r\nIn neuroevolution, this encoding translates the genotype to a neural networ=\r\nk. NEAT and HyperNEAT are two potential encodings among many.\n&gt; \n&gt; The seco=\r\nnd mapping (from phenotype to behavior space) maps a neural network to its =\r\nbehavior when evaluated in a domain (for example, the coordinate within the=\r\n maze where a navigational robot with a particular brain would navigate to)=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is important to note that for many encodings (including NEAT and=\r\n HyperNEAT), the space of genotypes is effectively infinite-dimensional bec=\r\nause of genetic operators that add genes. This allows NEAT to evolve ANNs o=\r\nf arbitrary complexity and HyperNEAT to evolve CPPNs of arbitrary complexit=\r\ny. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, the space of behaviors is typically not infinite-dimensio=\r\nnal; for example, in the maze domain, it is only two-dimensional. So, the s=\r\npace of behaviors may be significantly smaller than the space of all possib=\r\nle neural networks. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is also somewhat reasonable to believe that pe=\r\nrturbing a genotype that maps to a certain behavior may often generate a si=\r\nmilar, yet slightly different behavior. In this way, it may be more effecti=\r\nve to explore the behavior space by perturbing genotypes representing novel=\r\n behaviors rather than exhaustively or randomly searching through the under=\r\nlying genotype space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Imagine a situation in which 99% of all genomes =\r\nmap to degenerate behaviors that do nothing, but the remaining 1% of genome=\r\ns map to behaviors that are functional, and these 1% of genomes form a conn=\r\nected mesh in the search space (that is, they are reachable from each other=\r\n through mutations). In a random search, 99% of all evaluations will be was=\r\nted, while a search for novelty will exploit domain information to more eff=\r\nectively find these non-degenerate behaviors.\n&gt; \n&gt; In summary, random searc=\r\nh ignores domain information, while a search for novelty (or a fitness-base=\r\nd search) does utilize domain information.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks all for the inform=\r\nation.\n&gt; &gt; I looked at the articles and I am left with a question.\n&gt; &gt; How =\r\ndoes novelty search compare with random search of the genotype space? If th=\r\ne task is sufficiently deceptive, random search will actually outperform fi=\r\ntness directed search. It seems to me that the new algorithm must be compar=\r\ned against both fitness directed search and random search.\n&gt; &gt; Preference f=\r\nor simple models can be incorporated into random search by giving higher pr=\r\nobabilities to simpler models. A classic solution would be to let the proba=\r\nbility decrease exponentially with the number of nodes in the compact descr=\r\niption.\n&gt; &gt; Are there any theoretical or practical results regarding the co=\r\nmparison with a random search? Do you have any estimates or ideas on this?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I am not saying that novelty search won&#39;t work, but I think this point =\r\nmust be cleared. I also want to try gain a better understanding of how and =\r\nwhy the search works.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
