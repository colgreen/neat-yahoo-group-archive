One motivation \nfor\n&gt; this com=\r\npetition is comparing strengths and weaknesses of various CI\n&gt; techniques, =\r\nsuch as temporal difference learning, neuroevolution, \netc.\n&gt; Another motiv=\r\nation is just having a fun competition that is as easy \nas\n&gt; possible to pa=\r\nrticipate in, but still has some depth to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think NEAT could do ve=\r\nry well on this problem, and interfacing it\n&gt; (especiall one of the Java ve=\r\nrsions) to the competition code should \nbe\n&gt; quite simple. Is anyone up to =\r\nthe challenge?
