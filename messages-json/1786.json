And it&#39;s a big problem, because on a\n&gt;long time series (10 years), it&#39;s easy to pick 10 good buy spots and 10\n&gt;good sell spots and earn fantastic profits, but it&#39;s harder to pick 100\n&gt;such spots. \n&gt;\n&gt;And if you evolve something that trades well once in 10 years, that&#39;s less\n&gt;likely to perform well out of bounds than something that trades well 1000\n&gt;times in 10 years.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nConsider that there may be certain rare events that have a very \ndistinctive signature leading up to them - and that you can make money \non if you spot the signature. A possible example would be the collapse \nof sterling in 1992, which many currency traders profited from, even the \nrelative late comers I guess.\n\nBut do you want to wait around for (possibly) years to make relatively \nfew big &#39;bets&#39; (high risk, eggs in one basket scenario), or do you want \na system that makes more frequent smaller bets? (Trading being a form of \nbetting). Now it would be nice to have a system quietly looking out for \nthose big bet scenario&#39;s 24/7 just to highlight them so you can make an \ninformed judgement whether to act, but I see this as being a completely \nseperate system to one that looks for short term trades. Many smaller \ntrades seems intuitively safer, if the system makes a loss, it does so \ngradually and you can very calmly choose to stop trading, re-evaluate \nyour position, rethink the prediction model, etc.\n\n&gt;Currently, I severely punish infrequent trading because I view it as a\n&gt;form of overfitting.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI definitely see overfitting as being a problem because the only way to \nreduce it is to test against larger test data sets (thus slowing \nevaluation), even then one big gain on one data set could skew a fitness \nscore. I had considered that a network with a confidence output that it \nkeeps low most of the time, and which only goes high when it&#39;s very sure \nof making profit would be a good network. A sort of &quot;if you aint got \nanything interesting to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot; approach to \nprediction :)  But I can definitely see how overfitting might put the \ndampers on this idea, beside which it goes against my comments in the \nprevious paragraph - few trades = bad.\n\n\n&gt; I find that infrequent trading is more of a problem in my current\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This is a valuable (and profitable) system in a trending market,\n&gt;&gt;although it typically boils down to &quot;it&#39;s going up - buy, then sell\n&gt;&gt;when it stops going up&quot;. It tends to be awful in a sideways market.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nA network should be able to detect these different market states and \ndecide that it performs poorly in those conditions and thus decide to \nbail out of trading (low confidence). So low frequency of trades might \nnot be pad per se *if* there were particular conditions where a network \nwere &#39;in it&#39;s element&#39; and starts to give trading commands at high \nfrequency for a while, going quiet later when market conditions change.\n\nA complete trading system might be made up of many of these specialist \nnetworks, each kicking in under different circumstances.\n\nWhatever approaches folks try, I personally absolutely stand by the \nconcept of some form of confidence factor. Another idea that crops up is \nto try and reduce a stock&#39;s price history to underlying frequency \nelements (function regression), and as you yourself know (Mattias) NEAT \ncan do function regression quite well, but I just don&#39;t see this working \nfor something as complex and fluid as the stock market. There will \nalways be unpredictable external influences and chaotic movements of \nprice that cannot be predicted, and for these scenarios a confidence \noutput can just say &#39;dunno&#39;, and that to me is a completely accetable \nresponse.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
