I tried to develop=\r\n the code as \n&gt; flexibly as possible and the result allows control over the=\r\n mazes, \n&gt; character positions, graphics, etc.  I think it is reasonably \n&gt;=\r\n flexible enough for some interesting experiments.  These details \nas \n&gt; we=\r\nll as NEAT parameters are controlled through a parameter file.\n&gt; \n&gt; Current=\r\nly, the inputs to the net are defined as a window centered \non \n&gt; PacMan an=\r\nd extending 6 tiles in each direction.  The result is a \n&gt; 13x13 window wit=\r\nhin which there are independent inputs for walls, \n&gt; dots, empty space, and=\r\n ghosts of various flavors.  There&#39;s also an \n&gt; example (WMV) of the best r=\r\nun I&#39;ve seen thus far using this scheme.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please head over to SourceFor=\r\nge and give it a run.
