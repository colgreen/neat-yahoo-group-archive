For example, XOR isn&#39;t a typical benchmark for HyperNEAT (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; its=\r\n network doesn&#39;t have regularities and is quite small). Also, it would need=\r\n to come with a HyperNEAT substrate for XOR. Is that\n&gt; &gt; really the intent =\r\nor is it more than there aren&#39;t really HyperNEAT-centric experiments at lea=\r\nst at the moment?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes so the test code that&#39;s in there currently b=\r\nuilds a substrate for\n&gt; XOR on the basis that (A) I have known-to-be-workin=\r\ng XOR code and (B)\n&gt; I already knew a minimal substrate for XOR - in was a =\r\nquick way to\n&gt; test the code in totallity.\n&gt; \n&gt; The harness builds a suitab=\r\nle substrate and &#39;wires&#39; it and various\n&gt; other components together, such a=\r\ns a genome decoder, evaluator,\n&gt; speciation strategy and evolution algorith=\r\nm. The problem domains are\n&gt; completely independent from NEAT or HyperNEAT =\r\nso all you have to do to\n&gt; get an existing domain designed for NEAT to work=\r\n is build a substrate\n&gt; and switch to using the HyperNEAT genome decoder in=\r\nstead of the Neat\n&gt; decoder.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW do you or anyone here have any ideas =\r\nabout what is a good baseline\n&gt; problem domain for HyperNEAT? sort of an eq=\r\nuivalent to XOR in NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
