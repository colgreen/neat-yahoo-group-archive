But in a \n&gt; realistic physics world, the hi=\r\ngh-level patterns have to be \n&gt; interpreted in the appropriate way. The raw=\r\n CPPN output has just \n&gt; everything needed, but the pattern itself cannot *=\r\neffectively* \n&gt; describe quantity/density of matter. And more, because subs=\r\ntrates and \n&gt; physics bodies are structures with finite size, all these pat=\r\nterns \n&gt; have to be interpreted in a special way, completely different than=\r\n a \n&gt; simple mapping from a higher-dimensional space. This is because an \n&gt;=\r\n isomorphic mapping like in HyperNEAT does not contain information \n&gt; about=\r\n quantity of structural components, i.e. if I query for 100 links \n&gt; in 4D =\r\nor 6D they are still 100 links mapped back to 2D for example. \n&gt; And I am b=\r\nasically allowed to query for links/points anywhere in  \n&gt; space, which I c=\r\nan&#39;t do in physics. \n&gt; \n\nYou make a good argument, and I understand the con=\r\ncerns, but I think\nthis is still an open question right now.  I am still no=\r\nt sure about\nit.   However, I do think it is good that we are now consideri=\r\nng this\nissue.  It&#39;s very interesting that density and connectivity can be\n=\r\nthought about as potentially two separate problems that both relate to\nneur=\r\noevolution in different ways.  In my view, that is one of the most\ninterest=\r\ning things to emerge from HyperNEAT.\n\nIn any case, I am certainly intereste=\r\nd in the density maps that\nyour approaches come up with.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
