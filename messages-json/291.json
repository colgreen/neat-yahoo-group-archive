The graphical nature of the demos\n&gt; really helps us appreciate what the evolution is accomplishing.\n\nThe reason I make them so graphical is that I can enjoy them more that \nway - I hope others feel the same way ;)\n\n&gt; I am\n&gt; currently traveling, but when I get more time I&#39;ll give some more\n&gt; comments.  \n\nSure thing!\n\n&gt; By the way, would you like me to put your source code\n&gt; distribution up on our NN group web pages, where all the other NEAT\n&gt; source version are currently available?  \n\nWell, the thing is that the code might be in a state of flux, or it \nmight be stable rigt now. I&#39;m not sure what the future holds - but if I \nupdate it a lot, it&#39;d be a hassle keeping it up to date on both sites. \nIf it&#39;s stable, that would be fine. So perhaps we should give it a month \nand then put up a new version? Or you could put up a similar page for \nDelphiNEAT, but link to the binary release?\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll also fix my own web pages that mention software to point to your\n&gt; new NEAT page.\n\nCool!\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
