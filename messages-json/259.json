This program beats\nme almost every time. :)\n\nTo those who want to make ANNs that play board games,\nI think the use of mini-max is required for any game\nmore complex than tic-tac-toe.  This is my somewhat\neducated opinion, but I don&#39;t think its possible to\nplay the typical board game just from pattern\nrecognition.  I have two arguments: 1) is that humans\ncannot do it; they must look ahead in order to play\ndecently, and 2) no one has succeeded with an ANN that\ndoesn&#39;t look ahead.  Even with tic-tac-toe, I don&#39;t\nthing there has been and ANN produced that plays a\nperfect game.\n\nPeople have used ANNs very successfully to evaluate\nthe board after looking ahead a few ply.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
