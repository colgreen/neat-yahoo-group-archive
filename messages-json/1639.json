The fitness landscape ruggedness, hilliness,\n&gt;deceptiveness, etc., in different domains is likely to be different.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree, and if this is the case we can then look at the numbers that \ncome out of each domain and build up a sort of lookup table that we can \nrefer to whenever we approach a new domain. Now it might be that all of \nthe numbers come out approximately the same for each domain, or we might \nnot find any specific parameters for any domain - due to the large \namount of noise. Whatever happens we will have learned something.\n\n&gt;Therefore, it actually kind of makes sense if you want to search for\n&gt;mutation parameters to tie them to the individual genes, since at\n&gt;least then the search is domain-specific.  Of course, as you point\n&gt;out, this kind of gene-by-gene searching may go all over the place,\n&gt;but then again, at least in the ES community (as Ian pointed out),\n&gt;they have had some success with this, and it&#39;s (I think) almost a\n&gt;standard part of their methodology now.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt seems very likely to me that the genome or gene level meta-parameters \nwill drift a *lot*, mainly because there isn&#39;t much selection pressure \nbeing applied to them - the pressure is applied whenever a new better \ngenome is found, and we can say aha! the set of meta-params on this \ngenome/gene must be good. But of course a bad set of meta-params can \nfind good genomes to, sometimes.  Assuming a lot of drift you then have \nto consider the possibility that some of these drifting parameters \naren&#39;t working very well, but they are still able to propagate through \nthe population (because of low selection pressure) and in fact you might \nend up with a population where only a few of the genomes are actually \nusing sensible meta-parameters that have any chance of finding a good \nsolution.\n\nNo doubt then the ES people have encountered these issues, so some \nreading would be in order before implementing such a system with NEAT.\n\n&gt;There actually is a third, more sophisticated method for getting\n&gt;weight mutation parameters, which is to measure the success of\n&gt;mutations in various directions in the multidimensional space and\n&gt;actually construct a model of the most promising mutation trajectory\n&gt;based on the experience over past generations (as a multi-dimensional\n&gt;probability distribution).  That has recently popped up in ES as well,\n&gt;though the math behind it is not simple at all.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAhh ok, I definitely think this could help compensate for the lack of \nselection pressure. You still might get misleading signals, but they \nwould be averaged out by maintaining some central model that keeps track \nof all beneficial and detrimental meta-params.\n\n&gt;The problem of getting weight mutation right is a little bit of an art\n&gt;form and may have an element of alchemy (i.e. there&#39;s perhaps not that\n&gt;much you can really do without just getting lucky) but then again\n&gt;there probably are some ranges that are more reasonable than others\n&gt;over multiple domains, so it&#39;s not bad to learn more about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is my general philosophy for now. It may be simplistic compared to \nthe techniques discussed in the last couple of days, but at least if \nit&#39;s not a step forward in searching efficiency, it will be a step \nforward in terms of knowledge.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
