I get that NEAT is unique in the fact that it has a very effectiv=\r\ne search mechanism for topoligical variation, with the ability to stress bo=\r\nth additive and subtractive aspects of change.  And I get that it is fun to=\r\n focus on the topological variation as it is somewhat spatially interesting=\r\n.\n\nHowever, I am realizing that just doing effective weight mutations, sans=\r\n topological changes, can end up producing solutions that are very &quot;fit&quot;.  =\r\nI have been focused on reproducing the experiments Fogel and Kumar produced=\r\n which are covered in their book Blondie24.  In that, they had only 3 topol=\r\nogies they experimented with.  All of the GA searching was just done with w=\r\neight mutation within a step size that was both a GA parameter and nudged t=\r\nowards smaller values.  In the Fogel experiments, they arrived at an expert=\r\n player (well, at least against human opponents) using just co-evolution an=\r\nd a static topology.  And in my own replication of the experiments, somethi=\r\nng as simple as turn on/off biases had a substantial effect in how long it =\r\ntook to arrive at a specimen of similar fitness.\n\nNow, I realize that mutat=\r\ning weights only is not near as sexy sounding as both weight mutation and t=\r\nopological variation.  However, what I am wondering and hope to be able to =\r\nevaluate with experimentation is whether the topological mutation rates oug=\r\nht not be very small with the focus more on trying out many weight mutation=\r\ns within a given topology?  What is occurring to me is that just doing weig=\r\nht mutation is a search at a rate X in a huge space.  And it seems to me ad=\r\nding topological variation is not just a multiplier, but an exponent increa=\r\nsing X.  Perhaps the space is being made too large too quickly, before a se=\r\narch just in the weight mutation space might demonstrate a uniquely fit ind=\r\nividual.\n\nMy understanding is that the &quot;search in higher dimensional space&quot;=\r\n might produce more robust and fit players.  At what computational cost?  I=\r\nf the topological complexity curve for having a &quot;more fit player&quot; is expone=\r\ntial, then doesn&#39;t that mean that there is a threshold of diminishing retur=\r\nns somewhere?  Granted, it may not be.  However, when it is exponential (an=\r\nd my intuition says it is more of the time), we now have an exponent on an =\r\nexponent of complexification which massively enlarges the search space, X^T=\r\n, where T =3D Y^Z and Z is the complexity curve.  If this is true, then we =\r\nare massive amounts of processing power away from achieving result in anyth=\r\ning but the simplest of domains, like XOR and Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\nAm I missing so=\r\nmething here?  Perhaps I need to do more direct experimentation and examine=\r\n the results before jumping to this kind of conclusion.  I just get the sen=\r\nse that simple weight mutation achieved quite a bit in Checkers, a domain m=\r\nore complex than Tic-Tac-Toe.  It would be interesting to see how Checkers =\r\nmight do with NEAT and see what kinds of mutation rates might be more/less =\r\neffective and why.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: John Arr=\r\nowwood \n  To: neat@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, June 04, 2004 4:14 PM\n =\r\n Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Bloat\n\n\n  &gt;From: Derek James &lt;djames@...&gt;\n  =\r\n&gt;\n  &gt;On Fri, 04 Jun 2004 00:42:41 +0100, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@...&gt;=\r\n \n  &gt;wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; Consider the problem from the other direction then. If al=\r\nl of of these\n  &gt; &gt; useless structures aren&#39;t participating positively in a=\r\n search (on the\n  &gt; &gt; whole) then every single improvement seen in a popula=\r\ntion must come from\n  &gt; &gt; immediately beneficial single mutations.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;W=\r\nell, that&#39;s not entirely accurate.  In any new individual generated\n  &gt;in N=\r\nEAT, there could be a very large number of mutations at once.\n  &gt;Many of it=\r\ns connection weights may be mutated at once, along with the\n  &gt;addition (or=\r\n subtraction) of a fairly large number of topological\n  &gt;features.\n\n  That =\r\nseems strange to me.  It seems to me like the more appropriate thing to \n  =\r\ndo is to limit mutations to one structural change at a time.  You can add \n=\r\n  one connection, OR you can split one connection (or delete one \n  connect=\r\nion...), but you can&#39;t do any more than that for a given mutation of \n  a g=\r\niven organism.  Then, each and every change has a chance to prove itself \n =\r\n before being added upon.\n\n  &gt; &gt; So anyway, what I was proposing was a meth=\r\nod of getting the best of both\n  &gt; &gt; worlds. If excess structure is importa=\r\nnt then keep it, but if the search\n  &gt; &gt; has stagnated for a period of time=\r\n then I would say that the excess\n  &gt; &gt; structures have now had plenty of t=\r\nime to prove themselves - and failed.\n  &gt; &gt; They have crossed the line from=\r\n being possible useful structures into\n  &gt; &gt; being useless junk (bloat).\n  =\r\n&gt;\n  &gt;It would be interesting to see if this view could be tested\n  &gt;empiric=\r\nally.  It was my understanding that the philosophy of NEAT was\n  &gt;essential=\r\nly gradualist in its approach to adding structure, and that\n  &gt;was part of =\r\nthe appeal of it to me.  It sounds as if you and Ken are\n  &gt;both now arguin=\r\ng more for the approach of jumping, via allowing chunks\n  &gt;of untested morp=\r\nhology to accumulate in the hope that they will\n  &gt;eventually spontaneously=\r\n contribute to increased fitness.\n\n  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Ken was tryi=\r\nng to say.\n\n  Picture an experiment.  Focus on one species that is fairly w=\r\nell developed, \n  but stagnant.  During a generation, the top members breed=\r\n or are mutated.  \n  The mutations add structure.  Some are helpful, maybe.=\r\n  Some hinder.  Others \n  are neutral.  Those that are a hindrence get sele=\r\ncted against.  Those that \n  help are selected for.  But in (this) stagnant=\r\n population, few single \n  mutations are by themselves helpful.  So a lot o=\r\nf the neutral mutations \n  survive to the next generation.  They are now ca=\r\nrrying something extra.  It \n  doesn&#39;t help.  It doesn&#39;t hinder.  It&#39;s just=\r\n there.\n\n  At the next generation, the same thing happens.  Now, some porti=\r\non of the \n  population will not have any extra, some will have one extra, =\r\nand others \n  will have two.  And others will be mixtures thereof.  If that=\r\n isn&#39;t enough \n  to cause a fitness jump, then the process happens again.  =\r\nAgain, some will \n  have no extra, some one extra, some two, some three, an=\r\nd many will be \n  variants thereof.  The more generations go by, the bigger=\r\n the spectrum.  \n  However, it will most likely be fairly evenly distribute=\r\nd between those \n  without and those with extra neutral structure.\n\n  As th=\r\nat neutral structure is recombined through crossover, some will be a \n  hin=\r\ndrence, and will die out.  Others might be helpful, and others neutral, \n  =\r\nsame as with mutation.  If no helpful ones are discovered, then neutral wil=\r\nl \n  remain.\n\n  Eventually, some combination may strike on a configuration =\r\nthat results in \n  an improvement in fitness.  At that point, evolution wil=\r\nl favor that \n  configuration.  The stagnation will end.  The point is, to =\r\nget there, you \n  had to add structure.  There&#39;s no assurance that all the =\r\n&#39;extraneous&#39; \n  structure that accumulated will be useful, however.\n\n  As f=\r\nor the idea of pruning a stagnant species, that&#39;s not all that \n  good...wh=\r\nen you start going forward again, you would undo your pruning as \n  you loo=\r\nk for a way to move forward.  You would need to wait until the \n  stagnant =\r\nspecies has broken out of that stagnation, and THEN prune.  But I \n  think =\r\nyour best bet is to wait until you have found an acceptable solution, \n  an=\r\nd then do a phase that supports pruning in order to optimize that \n  soluti=\r\non.\n\n\n\n        Yahoo!

If excess structure is important then \n  keep it, but if the =\r\nsearch&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has stagnated for a period of time \n  then I would say =\r\nthat the excess&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; structures have now had plenty \n  of time to p=\r\nrove themselves - and failed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; They have crossed the \n  line fr=\r\nom being possible useful structures into&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; being useless \n  junk=\r\n (bloat).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;It would be interesting to see if this view could =\r\n\n  be tested&lt;BR&gt;&gt;empirically.&nbsp; It was my understanding that the \n  =\r\nphilosophy of NEAT was&lt;BR&gt;&gt;essentially gradualist in its approach to add=\r\ning \n  structure, and that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;was part of the appeal of it to me.&nbsp;=\r\n It sounds \n  as if you and Ken are&lt;BR&gt;&gt;both now arguing more for the ap=\r\nproach of \n  jumping, via allowing chunks&lt;BR&gt;&gt;of untested morphology to =\r\naccumulate in \n  the hope that they will&lt;BR&gt;&gt;eventually spontaneously co=\r\nntribute to \n  increased fitness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Ken was =\r\ntrying to \n  say.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Picture an experiment.&nbsp; Focus on one species =\r\nthat is fairly \n  well developed, &lt;BR&gt;but stagnant.&nbsp; During a generati=\r\non, the top members \n  breed or are mutated.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;The mutations add st=\r\nructure.&nbsp; Some are \n  helpful, maybe.&nbsp; Some hinder.&nbsp; Others =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;are neutral.&nbsp; Those \n  that are a hindrence get selected against.&=\r\nnbsp; Those that &lt;BR&gt;help are \n  selected for.&nbsp; But in (this) stagnant=\r\n population, few single \n  &lt;BR&gt;mutations are by themselves helpful.&nbsp; S=\r\no a lot of the neutral \n  mutations &lt;BR&gt;survive to the next generation.&nbs=\r\np; They are now carrying \n  something extra.&nbsp; It &lt;BR&gt;doesn&#39;t help.&nbs=\r\np; It doesn&#39;t hinder.&nbsp; \n  It&#39;s just there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the next generati=\r\non, the same thing happens.&nbsp; \n  Now, some portion of the &lt;BR&gt;populatio=\r\nn will not have any extra, some will \n  have one extra, and others &lt;BR&gt;will=\r\n have two.&nbsp; And others will be \n  mixtures thereof.&nbsp; If that isn&#39;=\r\nt enough &lt;BR&gt;to cause a fitness jump, then \n  the process happens again.&nb=\r\nsp; Again, some will &lt;BR&gt;have no extra, some one \n  extra, some two, some t=\r\nhree, and many will be &lt;BR&gt;variants thereof.&nbsp; The \n  more generations =\r\ngo by, the bigger the spectrum.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;However, it will \n  most likely b=\r\ne fairly evenly distributed between those &lt;BR&gt;without and those \n  with ext=\r\nra neutral structure.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As that neutral structure is recombined \n  thr=\r\nough crossover, some will be a &lt;BR&gt;hindrence, and will die out.&nbsp; \n  Ot=\r\nhers might be helpful, and others neutral, &lt;BR&gt;same as with mutation.&nbsp;=\r\n \n  If no helpful ones are discovered, then neutral will \n  &lt;BR&gt;remain.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Eventually, some combination may strike on a configuration \n  that resu=\r\nlts in &lt;BR&gt;an improvement in fitness.&nbsp; At that point, evolution \n  wil=\r\nl favor that &lt;BR&gt;configuration.&nbsp; The stagnation will end.&nbsp; The \n =\r\n point is, to get there, you &lt;BR&gt;had to add structure.&nbsp; There&#39;s no \n  =\r\nassurance that all the &#39;extraneous&#39; &lt;BR&gt;structure that accumulated will be =\r\n\n  useful, however.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As for the idea of pruning a stagnant species, t=\r\nhat&#39;s \n  not all that &lt;BR&gt;good...when you start going forward again, you wo=\r\nuld undo \n  your pruning as &lt;BR&gt;you look for a way to move forward.&nbsp; Y=\r\nou would need \n  to wait until the &lt;BR&gt;stagnant species has broken out of t=\r\nhat stagnation, and \n  THEN prune.&nbsp; But I &lt;BR&gt;think your best bet is t=\r\no wait until you have \n  found an acceptable solution, &lt;BR&gt;and then do a ph=\r\nase that supports pruning in \n  order to optimize that &lt;BR&gt;solution.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00D7_01C44A6A.D6E69140--\r\n\n"}}
