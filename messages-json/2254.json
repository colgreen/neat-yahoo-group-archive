For a\nwhile  I thought that genetic programming could be an avenue to follow\n(Koza). However lately I came across the NEAT concept which I found\nfascinating since it combines the best of both worlds (neural networks\n+ evolution).\nI have followed the discussions you guys have with interest. I think\nthat since the recurrent neural networks are intractable\nmathematically, apart from some very special cases (hopfield), one can\nonly speculate and experiment to learn things.\nRegarding the discussion about the recurrency question and what a RNN\ncan or can not do there is a very interesting paper which proves that\nthere is a turing machine for every RNN and vice-versa. Since anything\nthat is computable can be achieved with a turing machine so can it\nthrough an RNN. The trick is to find it :)\nhttp://www.uwasa.fi/stes/step96/step96/hyotyniemi1\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
