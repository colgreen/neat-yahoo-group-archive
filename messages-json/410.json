This could easily be extended to other forms of\ndata rendering too... and its pretty much implementation-agnostic isn&#39;t\nit? As long as you have a decent XML library.\n\nAre the XSL style sheets included with your distribution? I&#39;ve been\ncollecting very general snippets of code for use in NE, so that I won&#39;t\nhave to go through the process of reimplementing every time I want to\nconstruct a new system.\n\n&gt; Yes, I agree.  Thanks for bringing this up.  Do any of\n&gt; the other NEAT implementations use XML?\n\nI started out using XML to represent the all of the data from a single\nrun, but it turned out to be really bulky. I didn&#39;t even consider piping\nthat information directly into SVG though...\n\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
