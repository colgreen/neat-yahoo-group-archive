The short an=\r\nswer is no, I haven&#39;t\n&gt; experimented with phased searching on the double po=\r\nle problem. Double\n&gt; pole is (or should be) sufficiently simple as to not r=\r\nequire phased\n&gt; searching.  In fact douple pole (DP) and DP and no velocity=\r\n (DPNV) can\n&gt; both be solved without any hidden nodes and/or recurrent conn=\r\nections -\n&gt; so a single activation and 2 or three connections from input la=\r\nyer to\n&gt; output layer is all that is required.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n&gt; =\r\nThe tricky(er) problem is that of DPNV with punishment for pole-wiggling\n&gt; =\r\n(bad jokes on a postcard...), let&#39;s call it DPNV/AW, which is the\n&gt; problem=\r\n tackled by Ken in his(& Risto&#39;s) 2002 GECCO paper. If you punish\n&gt; wigglin=\r\ng then you get far nicer solutions where the poles end up almost\n&gt; perfectl=\r\ny balanced and upright, but of course this problem is harder to\n&gt; solve.\n&lt;s=\r\nnip&gt;\n&gt; I should also point out that Ken&#39;s published solution to DPNV/AW\n&gt; c=\r\nontained only one hidden node and 6 connections, so this really isn&#39;t a\n&gt; p=\r\nroblem that requires a lot of complexity to solve.\n\nHm...where did you find=\r\n that info?  Did you run it with Ken&#39;s code and\nget solutions of this compl=\r\nexity?  This is pretty interesting, since\nyes, I assumed the problem was mo=\r\nre difficult than this.\n\nWe&#39;re going to go ahead and implement the DPNV/AW =\r\ndomain with ANJI\njust as a secondary test domain along with XOR to verify o=\r\nur code each\ntime we make changes.  It should be a good test of functionali=\r\nty, but\nit sounds like it&#39;s not really a very good benchmark...that is what=\r\n\nyou&#39;re saying, correct?\n\nSo what do you think about the various variations=\r\n on pole balancing\n(e.g. 2d pole balancing, particle chasing, etc.)?  It re=\r\nally would be\nnice to have a decent control task benchmark for comparison b=\r\netween\nthe implementations and between other approaches.  For that matter, =\r\nit\nwould be nice to benchmarks in other types of domains as well.  I&#39;m\ngoin=\r\ng to post a similar question to the group, so feel free to either\nreply the=\r\nre or continue in private.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n"}}
