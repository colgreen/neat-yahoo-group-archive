It is probably true that there are=\r\n some more complex behaviors that could be learned that way than with the c=\r\nurrent setup.  However, the cost would be slower learning and since the cur=\r\nrent setup is sufficient for the Keepaway task, it may not be really import=\r\nant for that task.  However, if the task was made more complex, it could be=\r\ncome necessary.\n\nNote that even if the substrate was not allowed to evolve,=\r\n we could still insert the hidden layer at a fixed resolution.  We could al=\r\nso allow the hidden layer node placement to evolve as well.  It&#39;s difficult=\r\n to say the impact of that idea on this domain since the evolvable substrat=\r\ne (ES-HyperNEAT) is such a new approach, but I would guess again that the c=\r\nurrent task setup would not really need it, though it might be useful as it=\r\n gets more complex.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;v.vassiliades&quot; &lt;vas=\r\nsilisvas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all and Happy Easter,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I liked the ideas=\r\n in your new papers:\n&gt; - Evolving the Placement and Density of Neurons in t=\r\nhe HyperNEAT Substrate\n&gt; - Transfer Learning through Indirect Encodng\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI was wondering whether you had any thoughts about combining them.
