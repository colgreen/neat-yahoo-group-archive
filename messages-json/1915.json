The cat has 16 inputs:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0-3: Distance to walls in U,R,D,L\n&gt; 4-7: Proximity to mouse in U,R,D,L (-1.0 for no sight)\n&gt; 8-11: Direction heading of mouse is: U,R,D,L (-1.0 or +1.0)\n&gt; 12-15: Measure of how long since walking on tiles in U,R,D,L\n&gt; \n&gt; The cat can only see through LOS.  There are five outputs of the cat:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 - Move Up\n&gt; 1 - Move Right\n&gt; 2 - Move Down\n&gt; 3 - Move Left\n&gt; 4 - Make Sound\n\nAre the directions absolute or relative to the cat; i.e., do they map\nmore to north, south, east, west, or to forward, left, right, and\nbackward?  It sounds like the former.  Not sure how much it matters,\nbut that would be a difference between your representation and many\nother predator/prey representations I&#39;ve seen.  Colin, what was your\nrepresentation like?\n\n- Philip\n\n"}}
