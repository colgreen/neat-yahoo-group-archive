I&#39;d like to find out if this helps \nwith high input/output spaces, I was thinking of using an OCR type \ndomain since it&#39;s simple to implement, not CPU intensive and also a \ndomain that has been successfuly solved with more traditional techniques \nsuch as back-propagation. Mattias&#39; DelphiNEAT also has a demo EXE that \nattempts this problem with a standard NEAT search (I assume anyway) and \nit sems to perform quite poorly :(\n\n&gt;&gt;I have thought a little about board games. I was thinking about the\n&gt;&gt;&#39;roving eye&#39; technique which overcomes the problem of a large input\n&gt;&gt;space and board size scalability. I wonder if it could be improved by\n&gt;&gt;providing a further set of inputs that provide a sort of density map of\n&gt;&gt;pieces (and their type, e.g. black or white) on the board. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes.  We plan on using this very technique.  In other words, the eye\n&gt;will have a zoom factor.  There are other innovations on the idea of a\n&gt;mobile eye that we&#39;d like to explore.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe zoom idea I like. I may well start looking into this sort of stuff \nmyself, not for a while though.\n\n&gt;&gt;Another less well formed idea is to think of how nature deals with the\n&gt;&gt;high input space from our own eyes. A large amount of image processing\n&gt;&gt;occurs which reduces the high input space information down to the\n&gt;&gt;position and size of lines, boundaries and objects. Perhaps we could\n&gt;&gt;convert the normal x by y grid state into a more digestable form using a\n&gt;&gt;similar technique. E.g. in Go lines of pieces are quite important, so\n&gt;&gt;perhaps we could provide the network with data describing where lines are.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s an interesting idea.  But it&#39;s not just lines that are\n&gt;important in Go, but *life*, stable structures that are incapable of\n&gt;being completely surrounded and captured.  The problem is, recognizing\n&gt;live groups of stones, and distinguishing them from dead groups is an\n&gt;extremely difficult problem.  To follow your idea, one type of network\n&gt;could analyze life/death, and feed that analysis into another network\n&gt;that makes game play decisions.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes so we&#39;re back to task decomposition. So we would have to determine \nmeasurable goal tasks (functionality) that we want the analysis network \nto do. I&#39;ll leave that as an excercise for the reader :)\n\n&gt;&gt;Is this the paper investigating node/connection deletion mutations? \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Is it available yet?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No. :)  We&#39;ve finished it and submitted it to GECCO, but haven&#39;t heard\n&gt;back from them yet.  When we do, we&#39;ll post it to the group.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
