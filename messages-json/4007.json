I can&#39;t wrap my head around that (a failing on my\npart), any papers I should read that broaches the subject? Clearly, our\nbrain which does symbolic reasoning can handle it, so NE should be able to\ndo the same, but how to represent it with input, output and hidden nodes,\nthat&#39;s a little beyond me at the moment.\n\nOne practical problem I have with HyperNEAT is that we&#39;re back to deciding\nthe number of hidden node layers, and the number of nodes in each layer\nfor the phenotype. Any thoughts on how to handle that gracefully? A brute\nforce solution would simply be to provide each genotype with some kind of\nevolvable descriptor that would determine the hidden nodes. But maybe that\ncould be represented within the genotype instead?\n\nOne very interesting experiment I&#39;d like to see done (or do myself); if\nthe genotype decides the hidden nodes, can HyperNEAT successfully cross\ntwo genotypes which different hidden node targets? It should be possible,\nconsider humans with our 46 chromosomes. There must have been a point\nwhere one person had say 44 chromosomes but doubled up on one of them,\nending up with 46. Then that person mated with another person with the\nusual 44 chromosomes, and successfully so. The reason it worked at all is\nprobably because the chomosomes were very similar, or even identical,\nmaking the evolutionary landscape _fairly_ even when it comes to\nchromosome duplications (99.9999...% of all chromosome duplications must\nhave resulted in abortion or sterility, but still).\n\nSince HyperNEAT uses continuous functions to describe the connection\nweights, that could possibly imply that the same evenness. It&#39;s impossible\nto know without testing, but if we could mate one individual with one\nhidden layer with another individual with two hidden layers and get viable\noffspring (preferably stronger), that would be spectacular. Well, I would\nthink so anyway ;)\n\nAs for the 0.2 weight threshold being arbitrary, sure it&#39;s arbitrary, but\nit&#39;s the landscape that evolution works with, it&#39;s as arbitrary as g\n(gravity)=9.81, if g would have been say 5, animals would have been\ndifferent but no less successfull. Thus using a weight threshold of\n0.1-0.3 would probably not change the results significantly - another\ninteresting experiment though. Where are the limits for the threshold? Too\nclose to 0 and the number of connections will explode. To close to 1 and\nsigmoid nodes will have a hard time generating connections, and their\nconnection weight resolution would be seriously compromised.\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
