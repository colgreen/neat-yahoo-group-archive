I would like to do some\nsimple 2-D graphics, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s\navailable.  I realize that C++ has no built-in\ngraphics so that I have to use an add-on package of\nsome kind.  I would like something fairly easy to\nlearn and use.  I would like it portable so that both\nlinux and Windows users can run my programs.  I prefer\nsomething fairly popular, so that I can easily find\nother experienced users for help or collaboration. \nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks,\n\nm\n\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
