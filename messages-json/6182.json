A full tech report of our results is now av=\r\nailable at:\n \nhttp://tr.eecs.ucf.edu/77/1/stanley_ucftr13-05.pdf\n \nAbstract=\r\n: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2013/stanley-ucftr13-05\n \nThe aim of=\r\n this response is mainly to show that HyperNEAT is indeed able to solve tas=\r\nks that are interesting or that require adding hidden nodes, and that CPPNs=\r\n can encode fracture.  Two of the three tasks in the original paper are rei=\r\nmplemented and solved effectively  in this paper, and source code is provid=\r\ned.  The paper also shows through detailed examples that HyperNEAT (and CPP=\r\nNs in general) can encode complex forms of fracture. \n \nWhile these results=\r\n may seem to contradict the original, I think the right interpretation is p=\r\nerhaps that there are many factors that go into any experiment in this area=\r\n, and differences in the population size, length of runs, system parameters=\r\n, or experimental setup can all influence the results.  In this sense, Thom=\r\nas and Shimon&#39;s original results are not necessarily contradictory to the f=\r\nindings reported here, which simply show that it is possible to create cond=\r\nitions that lead to solutions in these domains.  We hope in any case that t=\r\nhese results provide some reassurance to those beginning to apply HyperNEAT=\r\n that there is no fundamental concern to be worried about.\n \nThat said, Tho=\r\nmas and Shimon have done a service to point out that, especially under targ=\r\net-based conditions, fitness functions that might not seem initially too ch=\r\nallenging can be surprisingly deceptive.   Our response accordingly also tr=\r\nies to highlight that it will be important in GDS to reduce our reliance on=\r\n reward functions based strictly and only on a target objective.  Many of t=\r\nhe concerns raised in their paper mainly apply under such strictly target-b=\r\nased conditions. \n \nWe hope especially for new HyperNEAT users this respons=\r\ne provides some encouragement and tips on how to get around potential obsta=\r\ncles (like structural mutation rates being too low, population sizes too sm=\r\nall, or runs too short). \n \nFinally I&#39;d like to state publicly that Thomas =\r\nand Shimon are both great colleagues who have made a very professional effo=\r\nrt to accommodate our response and keep the lines of communication open bet=\r\nween our groups, all of which is healthy for the field and for science in g=\r\neneral.    \n                                                               =\r\n                                   \nBest,\n \nken\n\n\n\n"}}
