This game requires active use of\nmemory during the game.  All of the previous ANNs that\nI&#39;ve worked with were essentially ROMs; the evolution\nwas all for the purpose of programming the ROM. \nConcentration cannot be played effectively by ROM\nalone; it requires active use of RAM.  I chose this\nproblem knowing that it was well suited for a Von\nNeuman or Turing machine, not for your typical ANN. \nBut I&#39;m using a type of ANN that is a state machine,\nand has some RAM capability.  I was not at all sure if\nit could play the concentration game, and neither were\na couple of experts I talked to, so I&#39;m very pleased\nwith this success.\n\nThe &quot;deck&quot; that I&#39;ve been using has only these six\ncards: 1 1 2 2 3 3, so its a pretty small game.  I\nplan eventually to use a larger deck.\n\nThe ANN is a fully connected binary threshold machine,\nor Hopfield network.\nTo make clear what this means I&#39;ll describe completely\na 2 neuron version with one input and one output.\n\nEach neuron is a summer and a unit step function:\n\n\ty1 = U(w11*y1 + w12*y2 - T1 + wx*x)\n        y2 = U(w21*y1 + w22*y2 - T2)\n\nU(x) is the unit step function which is 0 for negative\nx and 1 otherwise.\ny1 and y2 are the states of the neurons\ny1 is also the external output\nx is the external input\nThe w&#39;s are weights and the T&#39;s are thresholds.  They\nare what get evolved, starting with random values.\n\nfor my concentration player I&#39;m using 15 neurons with\n18 inputs and six outputs, but it follows exactly the\nplan above, just with a lot more terms.\n\nThe way this is computed is, we start with y1 and y2,\nthen we compute everything without changing y1 and y2,\nand then y1 and y2 are given new values.  That is one\nstep.  This can be repeated through several steps;\nafter a few steps it will either stabilize or enter a\nlimit cycle which persists forever.  When playing the\ngame, I allow it to step until there is exactly one\nhigh output, which selects the card to turn over.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
