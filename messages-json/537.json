Your \ncode queries the DOM for XML tags that it knows about. Any newer tags or \ntags you&#39;r not interested in are simply ignored.\n\n3) Because unknown tags can be ignored this makes XML ideal for defining \ndata interchange standards. XML from external sources (e.g. a different \nNEAT implememntation) can be checked against a definition file. \nHistorically this was done with a Data Type Definition (DTD) file, the \nmore recent approach is to use XML Schema Definition (XSD) files. XSD \ncan allow for &#39;open-ended&#39; areas in the XML that allow for non-standard \nXML to be legal, e.g. tags that are specific to a particular NEAT \nimplemenation that no-one else cares about.  \n\n4) Easy and standardised manipulation. The XML Stylesheet Language \nTransformation (XSLT)   is itself an XML dialect that has been adopted \nby the W3C. Transformations can be written to transform XML into a new \nformat. A nice example as mentioned on this group would be converting \nNEAT network XML into SVG (Another XML dialect for defining graphics) \nthat can then be rendered with an SVG viewer.\n\n5) Readability of the data. OK I admit that this is subjective :)\n\nXML is everywhere these days. E.g the HTML &#39;language&#39; which historically \nwas a bit of an untamed beast has been standardised as an XML dialect - \nXHTML. This gratefully simplifies web development since XHTML pages can \nnow be manipulated and built with standard and already existing XML \nprocessors. The old windows INI files have mostly been replaced with \nXML, look at any config file in Windows for an example. My own day job \nrevolves around building XML manipulation tools and defining XML \ndialects that are used to convey data between companies, \ninsurance/mortgage applications, that sort of thing.\n\nXML isn&#39;t suited for everything but it&#39;s always worth considering and \nI&#39;d recommend you cast an eye over the wealth of info on the web before \ndismissing it :)\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
