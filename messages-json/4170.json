I can later mix it with fitness \nsearc=\r\nh once a good population has evolved, on objectives \nlike &quot;swimming&quot;. \n\nLet=\r\n me mention about one interesting experiment I made with the NS \nNEVH. I re=\r\nstricted the substrate connectivity so that output-&gt;output \nconnections are=\r\n not queried. Then I made the environment to 0 gravity \nand removed the gro=\r\nund plane. The behavior characterization was \nchanged like this. The behavi=\r\nor data is a vector of 15 doubles \nrepresenting the outputs. Each time an o=\r\nutput oscillates (going to \n+treshold and then -treshold, or vice versa), i=\r\nts corresponding place \nin the vector is incremented. \nSo the vector is act=\r\nually counting how many oscillations the outputs \ndid during the lifetime. =\r\nA substrate oscillating with high frequency \nis very far in the behavior sp=\r\nace. Different outputs oscillating are \ncounted too. The behavior distance =\r\nmetric is the eucledian distance \nbetween these 15-D vectors. \n\nSo novelty =\r\nsearch now has to find new ways to oscillate the entire \nbody, to do repeat=\r\ning movements. In all the runs, Novelty Search with \nHyperNEAT finds walkin=\r\ng gaits 100% of the time, in the first 1000 \nevaluations. There are also sw=\r\nimming gaits and all kind of stuff (I \nsaw one individual actually dancing =\r\n:)) \n\nSo what was stopping it from walking before, is the gravity. Keeping =\r\n\nbalance on one leg and trying to walk at the same time turns out to \nbe ve=\r\nry hard task. One environmental constraint that would be useful \nto make it=\r\n walk is, when only one foot has stepped on the ground, \nstick that foot to=\r\n the ground. So the chance the humanoid to fall is \nminimized. \n\nAs for the=\r\n novelty search stagnation, where getting new behaviors \nbecomes hard, the =\r\npopulation begins to do something like a random \nprobing anything that is n=\r\not the same stuff. Then it begins to rely \nentirely on mutation to get out =\r\nsomehow. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; I finally borrowed a windows machine from someone and looked at \nthi=\r\ns. It&#39;s\n&gt; really fun to watch! I am leaving it running overnight to see wha=\r\nt \nhappens.\n&gt; So far the best I have seen has been about a five mini-step s=\r\nhuffle\n&gt; backwards...although I have seen a few three mini-step forward \nsh=\r\nuffles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you post either the genome and or a movie of the best org =\r\n\nyou&#39;ve seen so\n&gt; far? \n&gt; \n&gt; I second the notion that it would be cool to b=\r\nrowse the archive, \nespecially\n&gt; if you could choose archive members to vie=\r\nw based on max distance \nfrom 0,0\n&gt; or something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; It might h=\r\nelp you to visualize things if you added another viewing \nmode that\n&gt; put a=\r\n dot in the 3D viewer for every x,y,z coordinate in the \narchive (one\n&gt; col=\r\nor) and in the current population (another color).\n&gt; \n&gt; Watching this also =\r\nmakes me wonder about the population losing its \ngradient\n&gt; and disengaging=\r\n. Here is the potential concern (and I think mattias \nand ken\n&gt; discussed t=\r\nhis already): Once all the easy to access points are \nfound, if\n&gt; most of t=\r\nhe orgs are not getting somewhere new, they will all have \nequal\n&gt; fitnesse=\r\ns and the search will not be focused on the outside edge. \nDo you\n&gt; think t=\r\nhis is happening (and might this be why David mentioned that \nhe saw a\n&gt; lo=\r\nt of repeats toward the end)? The visualization I just proposed \nmight help=\r\n\n&gt; on this front. Do the points added in the archive tend to be \nfurther an=\r\nd\n&gt; further away from 0,0....or is it just filling in the spaces in the \nne=\r\narby\n&gt; vicinity? \n&gt; \n&gt; Despite these concerns/suggestions, it is very fun s=\r\ntuff to look \nat...and\n&gt; its exciting that you are hybridizing these ideas =\r\nso quickly and \ntesting\n&gt; them. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital =\r\nEvolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: David D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;=\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:46:57 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New file=\r\n uploaded to neat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I thought it=\r\n would be awhile\n&gt; &gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combined.  =\r\nI ran it \nwhile I\n&gt; &gt; was working on other stuff for a bit over 50,000 eval=\r\nuations, \nchecking\n&gt; &gt; in on it periodically.  The behavioral diversity was=\r\n really\n&gt; &gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby steps and guys tha=\r\nt \nwere\n&gt; &gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them did &quot;the chair&quot;), althoug=\r\nh \nthere\n&gt; &gt; were still a good number of repeats, especially near the end \n=\r\n(falling\n&gt; &gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty common).  No one that I saw ha=\r\nd a \ngood\n&gt; &gt; walking gait, but I guess it&#39;s possible that one could have w=\r\nhen I\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an option to browse the archive.=\r\n \nI&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; curious about a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; -What did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems like there are \na\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnumber of viable options here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -What do the nodes on the substrate=\r\n mean, and are they just on a \nflat\n&gt; &gt; plane?  I used your older version w=\r\nhen it was first released, and \nif I\n&gt; &gt; remember right the two on the left=\r\n are inputs and the stuff on the\n&gt; &gt; right is various joints, but I wanted =\r\nto make sure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Similarly, what do you use as the 5th input on the =\r\nCPPN?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hel=\r\nlo,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the neat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; group.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   File        : /novelty_nevh.rar\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervens=\r\nki &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Description : Novelty Search applied to evolv=\r\ning HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; leaky-integrator substrates controlling a 3D humanoid mod=\r\nel.
