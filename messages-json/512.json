Developing this simulation is the\n&gt; &gt; difficult part.  We cannot perform neuroevolution\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; the actual vehicle, but only in a computer\n&gt; simulation.\n&gt; \n&gt; By &#39;high-level&#39; task I meant a NN that would receive\n&gt; at it&#39;s inputs \n&gt; the bearing and distance of a target location plus\n&gt; information about \n&gt; local obstacles. The output of the NN would then be\n&gt; a bearing and \n&gt; speed the vehicle should go in in order to get to\n&gt; the target \n&gt; location, but avoiding the local obstacles. A model\n&gt; can be built for \n&gt; this task and an NN evolved for it.\n&gt;\n\nI don&#39;t think that for desert racing the task is\nseparable in the way you propose, although it would\ndepend on the characteristics of the particular\nterrain.  Would you believe I have personal experience\nracing a motorcycle on the desert? :)  It&#39;s true; it\nwas in California in 1961.  I used to be a dirt-biker.\nBut my assertion is that the vehicle spends at least\n50% of its time moving in a curved path.  Hence it is\nmore appropriate that the ANN output steering and\nthrottle information.  These outputs will rarely be\nconstant, but rather continually changing.  However, I\nconcede that if the obstacles are sparse, and the\nvechicle large and stable, then the path might be\nmostly a series of straight lines between points.\n\n&gt; The resultant NN is then fixed, it&#39;s a black box\n&gt; with inputs and \n&gt; outputs, no more evolving of the NN is necessary. \n\nI don&#39;t think this is feasible, because the terrain\nand vehicle characteristics affect the choices, even\nif the outputs are desired heading and speed.\n \n&gt; We would then move onto the next task, evolving a NN\n&gt; that receives at \n&gt; its inputs a bearing and speed the vehicle should\n&gt; move. It&#39;s outputs \n&gt; then give controls signals for steering and drive\n&gt; motors.\n&gt; \n&gt; When both NNs are ready they can be combined to\n&gt; create a complete \n&gt; system. Keep in mind this is just an example\n&gt; scenario to explain my \n&gt; point, it&#39;s not meant to be complete!\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that the first &#39;high&#39;level&#39; black box\n&gt; should not require \n&gt; any further evolving in order to work in the real\n&gt; world - it can be \n&gt; used as it is. \n&gt; \n&gt; The other task though would require complex models -\n&gt; e.g. to take \n&gt; into account different surface and terrain types.\n&gt; These sort of \n&gt; models can never be completely accurate and this\n&gt; does present a major \n&gt; problem for evolving solutions since you need to be\n&gt; able to run many \n&gt; trial runs automatically.\n\nMy approach combines your two levels into one.  But we\nare in agreement that complex models are necessary to\nevolve the 2nd level of your description.  I think\nthat if there is a big-budget operation, then models\nof sufficient accuracy might be created.  When\ncombined with Darren&#39;s suggestion of randomization, a\nsufficiently robust ANN might eventually evolve.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
