The graphics are quite valuable,\n&gt; in my opinion. \n\nThanks!\n\n&gt; I would like to add graphics to some\n&gt; of my own projects; I&#39;m currently seeking a\n&gt; collaborator to take on that responsibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some of those applications are new, right?  Like for\n&gt; example the &quot;Obstacle Navigator&quot;.  I have not seen\n&gt; that before.  I think that&#39;s a very interesting\n&gt; application.\n\nI&#39;m not sure when that was added, but it&#39;s not one of the oldest \nsimulations.\n\n&gt; Here is a suggested extension of the &quot;Obstacle\n&gt; Navigator&quot; problem which would require the ANN to make\n&gt; active use of memory:  When the navigator gets to the\n&gt; end of the path it is required to return to the\n&gt; starting point.  The fitness is reduced by the time or\n&gt; number of steps taken to return, hence the ANN needs\n&gt; to be able to remember the way back and not have to\n&gt; feel its way.  Basically, the robot navigator feels\n&gt; its way out, but then returns much more quickly by\n&gt; remembering the path and following its memory model.\n&gt; I think this is a challenge that NEAT would be capable\n&gt; of, and it will be an impressive feat (A NEAT FEAT).\n\nYes, that would be something to behold!\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
