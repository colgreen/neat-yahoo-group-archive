I hope you all will forgive my useful\nenthusiasm (2nd childhood I suppose) but I have\ndiscovered a bug in my code that allowed the ANNs to\ndiscover how to cheat.  This was not obvious because\nit only happened after two or more cards had already\nbeen removed.  At that point if the computer picked\nthe 0 element of the array, it would get a match,\nalbeit a false one.  The ANNs slowly learned to pick 0\nwhen there were empty spaces on the board.\n\nI have fixed it, and just started them evolving from\nscratch again just a few minutes ago.  So far they are\nmuch weaker than my reference player that picks\nblindly at random.  I will keep you posted of course.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
