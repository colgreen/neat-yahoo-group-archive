It would also be interesting to allow\n&gt; HyperNEAT to decide the locations of the nodes in the substrate on\n&gt; its own.\n\nI think this is important.  Part of the draw to NEAT, for me, is  the \nlow level of human configuration and design required.\n\nKen, I had another question related to varying node density on the \nsubstrate.  The CPNN may (likely) connect &#39;regions&#39; heavily, and so as \nnode density increases, so will these regional connections.  My question \nis, is there evidence of this in biology?  That is, of groups of neurons \nregionally strongly connected to other groups of neurons?  I realize \nit&#39;s probably mostly irrelevant, but I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s something \nyou&#39;ve researched.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\n\n"}}
