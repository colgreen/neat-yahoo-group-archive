For about a year now I&#39;ve been working on my own\nimplementation of NEAT in C++ in an effort to create a fast, templated\nimplementation that can be adapted to many problems.  Also, just for the\nhell of it.  It all seems to be working quite well now and I&#39;m in a bit of\na clean-up stage.  Currently all the structures are implemented using std\nvectors, etc.  I did many benchmarks comparing this approach to others and\nthe std library seems to provide performance on par or better than more\n&quot;customized&quot; implementations I came up with.  Plus, when I was at SDWest I\nlearned that no matter how much stl I&#39;m using in my code, it&#39;s not enough.\n Anyway, I also became aware of the Boost Graph library.  Long story short\n(too late) I was wondering if anyone has used the library, specifically\nwith NEAT.  I want to consider doing a NEAT implementation using it but\nit&#39;s going to be a lot of work and I&#39;m not completely sure it&#39;s possible. \nJust thought I&#39;d check with everyone before I embark on this.  Also, at\nsome point I will publish what I&#39;ve done.  I just want to finish cleaning\nit all up.  Thanks for any info.  Regards,\n\njeff\n\n\n"}}
