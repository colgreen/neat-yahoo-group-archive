For instance: color.\n&gt; The only approach I see is to just tack on inputs that begin the same \n&gt; as any other input. For a three color system, the eye just got three \n&gt; times many more dimensions complicated. Is there any way to scale from \n&gt; a monochromatic solution to a color solution, without forcing a new \n&gt; search?\n\n\nHi Chad, I would keep the monochromatic input and attach 3 new color \nsignals. That way previously evolved genomes can be used (with the new \ninputs added) in the start population and mainatian their existing \nfunctionality. You also might want to look at different color \nrepresentation systems, Red/Green/Blue is the system used in biological \neyes (or most of them AFAIK) but there are other schemes such as \nHue/Saturation//Brightness. So for instance in *that* scheme the \nmonochromatic input is effectively a brightness input so you only need \ntwo more inputs.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
