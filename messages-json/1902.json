I \nhaven&#39;t re-created the DPNV experiments (I&#39;m doing other things), so \ntake this with a grain of salt ...\n\nMy code penalizes _any_ species that does not achieve a new high in \naverage fitness after N+5 generations (i.e., not just the bottom 2).  I \ndid not see a performance improvement with &quot;delta coding&quot; \n(redistributing the population to only the top two species), so I left \nit out.\n\n[Aside: This policy created the opposite of your problem -- the \npopulation would sometimes lose the best individual(s) when the \nhighest-performing species would stagnate and be thusly penalized.  I \nhave been experimenting with providing a reward, either immunity from \nthe age penalty or bonus offspring, to either the species with the \nhighest average fitness or the species containing the population \nsuperstar (or some combination of those things).  As is sometimes the \ncase with NEAT, none of these methods proved universally superior, so I \njust parameterized the various options ...]\n\nOne piece of general advice that I&#39;ll offer is that I find that many \naspects of the NEAT algorithm can be application specific; what&#39;s sauce \nfor XOR is not necessarily sauce for your problem.  I&#39;ve been using NEAT \nto create robot controllers, and I&#39;ve made a variety of tweaks and \nadditions to the algorithm/parameters and had some success.  The best \nadvice I can give you is to keep detailed records of your algorithmic \nchanges and parameter values when you run experiments so that you don&#39;t \nwaste a lot of time trying to figure out how you got a given set of results.\n\nAnd go easy on the brick wall with your coconut.\n\n--Bryan\n\n\ngerbopel wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;On discussing culling species after N generations of\n&gt;&gt;no improvement.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, now I&#39;m thoroughly confused.  After re-reading over the NEAT\n&gt; material I have and checking K.S.&#39;s source code again, nothing seems\n&gt; to match up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically the publications state that the lowest performing species\n&gt; over N generations in age will not be reproduced.  However the code\n&gt; uses the any species that has not improved in N generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, there is written: &quot;In rare cases when the fitness of the\n&gt; entire population does not improve for more than 20 generations, only\n&gt; the top two species are allowed to reproduce, refocusing the search\n&gt; into the most promising spaces&quot;.  That is from &quot;Evolving NN through\n&gt; Augmenting Topologies&quot;.  In code K.S. simply checks to see if the\n&gt; whole population hasn&#39;t improved in N+5 generations and then takes\n&gt; only allows to reproduce the top 2 species.\n&gt; \n&gt; So many different things are being said and being done here, I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure who to listen to.  At the moment I am not allowing the 2 worst\n&gt; species to reproduce if they haven&#39;t improved in N generations.  As\n&gt; well, if the whole population has not improved in N+5 generations then\n&gt; I only allow the top 2 species to reproduce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately this is still leading to serious stagnation towards\n&gt; local minima.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m getting to the\n&gt; point of hitting my head on the brick wall here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
