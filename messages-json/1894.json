What I \ncan say is that one is taking a fresh look at Go and the other is \nevolving a net for part of the auto-pilot of a model airplane. From what \nI&#39;ve seen this latter experiment is up and running using flight sim \nsoftware as the basis for an evaluation function.\n\n&gt;As for myself, I&#39;m still working on the NERO video game and the \n&gt;collision warning project with Toyota.  I&#39;m also continuing to think a \n&gt;lot about indirect encoding and what a next-generation indirect \n&gt;version of NEAT might look like.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks. Looking forward to seeing some papers on those, and a NERO \ndownload I believe?\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
