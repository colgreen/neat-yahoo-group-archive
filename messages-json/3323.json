The objectives are two-fold. First, \nto expand t=\r\nhe scope of problems in which the HyperNEAT approach may \nbe applied. Secon=\r\nd, to enable evolved partition of the design space, \nso as to enable applic=\r\nation of the HyperNEAT approach to problems \nwhich contain highly discontin=\r\nuous and divergent natures in different \nportions of the design space. It i=\r\ns intended to provide a starting \npoint for further thought and interchange=\r\n of ideas, with the focus on \nachieving the stated objectives by whatever m=\r\neans or changes which \nmay emerge.\n\n1 - Preliminary Definitions: Given an a=\r\nrbitrary point &quot;P&quot; in design \nspace, comprised of the following:\n(a) proble=\r\nm specific inputs (PSIs);\n(b) auxiliary additional parameters associated w/=\r\n PSIs (i.e. includes \ngeometry);\n(c) problem specific outputs (PSOs);\n(d) a=\r\nuxiliary additional parameters associated w/ PSOs (i.e. includes \ngeometry)=\r\n;\n(e) Substrate Inputs: comprised of PSIs, &quot;a&quot; above;\n(f) Substrate Outputs=\r\n: comprised of PSOs, &quot;c&quot; above;\n(g) CPPN Inputs: comprised of auxiliary add=\r\nitional parameters \nassociated w/ PSIs & PSOs, &quot;b&quot; & &quot;d&quot; above;\n(h) CPPN Ou=\r\ntput: weight between current pair of substrate nodes;\n(i) An &quot;experience_po=\r\nint&quot; is defined as a struct containing items &quot;a&quot; \nthrough &quot;d&quot; above;\n(j) Th=\r\ne &quot;Experience&quot; is defined as a vector of experience_points;\n\n2 - Current Hy=\r\nperNEAT Implementation:\n(a) CPPN Inputs comprised of (1-b) and (1-d) are ea=\r\nch constant in \nnumber and meaning as you loop over the links in the substr=\r\nate \nnetwork (i.e. 3D CPPN &quot;From&quot; Input: quan. =3D 3, meaning =3D X, Y & Z =\r\n\ncoordinates)\n\n3 - Proposed Generalization For CPPN Input:\n(a) the quantity=\r\n and meaning of auxiliary additional parameters \nassociated w/ PSIs (1-b) c=\r\nan vary over the substrate network (i.e. \ndimensionality of substrate input=\r\ns, hidden and output nodes);\n(b) the quantity and meaning of auxiliary addi=\r\ntional parameters \nassociated w/ PSOs (1-d) can vary over the substrate net=\r\nwork (i.e. \ndimensionality of substrate inputs, hidden and output nodes);\n(=\r\nc) CPPN Input &quot;From&quot;: the quantity and meanings are defined to be \nthe supe=\r\nrset of possible auxiliary additional parameters associated \nw/ PSIs and PS=\r\nOs (i.e. 5D CPPN &quot;From&quot; Input: quan. =3D 5, meaning =3D X, \nY, Z, apples & =\r\noranges);\n(d) CPPN Input &quot;To&quot;: the quantity and meanings are defined to be =\r\nthe \nsuperset of possible auxiliary additional parameters associated w/ \nPS=\r\nIs and PSOs (i.e. 5D CPPN &quot;To&quot; Input: quan. =3D 5, meaning =3D X, Y, Z, \nap=\r\nples & oranges);\n(e) the meaning of any given CPPN Input node, for both &quot;Fr=\r\nom&quot; \nor &quot;To&quot;, remains constant (i.e. only apples are presented on the \nappl=\r\nes input node);\n(f) the quantity of zero is presented on any CPPN Input nod=\r\ne whose \ndimensionality, or meaning, is not present/applicable for the curr=\r\nent \nCPPN Input &quot;From&quot; or &quot;To&quot;;\n\n4 - Proposed Generalization For Evolved Pa=\r\nrtition of Design Space:\n(a) Evaluation of speciation of CPPN population al=\r\nong design space \npartition lines, as defined by allocation of experience_p=\r\noints \naddressed by a specific species (i.e. species &quot;0&quot; by default \naddres=\r\nses all experience_points, species &quot;1&quot; through &quot;n&quot; addresses \nonly those ex=\r\nperience_points which yield a higher absolute fitness \nthan species &quot;0&quot;;\n(b=\r\n) species fitness computed based upon percentage of \nexperience_points yiel=\r\nding a highest absolute fitness among all \nspecies (i.e. if species &quot;1&quot; gav=\r\ne best fitness for 25 percent of the \nexperience_points, then the species f=\r\nitness would be the summation of \nfitness for those specific experience_poi=\r\nnts);\n(c) objective to maximize overall fitness of &quot;Experience&quot; as \nsummati=\r\non of best individual from each species over those \nexperience_points for w=\r\nhich they were evolved and maintained the best \nfitness (i.e. all experienc=\r\ne_points addressed only once);\n\n\n\n"}}
