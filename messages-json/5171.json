The weights are computed in exa=\r\nctly the same fashion as in the checkers experiment,\nwith a formula like: (=\r\nw-0.2)/0.8 * 3.0 for positive weights w &gt; 0.2 (etc) \n\nThe output is all 1&#39;s=\r\n, and the substrate does indeed seem to have more positive weighted links t=\r\nhan negative ones. I am facing the same &#39;issue&#39; in later generations. \n\nThe=\r\n substrate inputs are all between -1 and 1, but I do not normalize the 9x9 =\r\ninput matrix. Might this be the issue. \n\nI changed the formulas to somethin=\r\ng like: (w-0.2)/0.8 * 0.01 and now I get values around 0.44 on all output n=\r\nodes.\n\nDoes this &#39;issue&#39; suggest any misuse of (Hyper)NEAT to anyone?\n\nThan=\r\nks, \nAndrei\n\n\n"}}
