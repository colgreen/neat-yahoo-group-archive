The agents seem to be improving in fitness for the\nfirst ~250 generations and then they dip in performance for ~150\ngenerations before climbing back up again and plateauing:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/20857495/longrun.png\n\nNote that the graph there is an average over 30 trials. We&#39;ve repeated the\nexperiment across machines and agent configurations, and we keep seeing\nthis strange dip.\n\nThe world has a bunch of food that&#39;s randomly scattered at every\ngeneration, and we&#39;ve double-checked our code including writing unit tests,\nso we&#39;re fairly confident that it&#39;s not a bug of some kind in our\nsimulator. One thing worth noting is that the maximum fitness in this\ndomain is 3000, so we&#39;re wondering if maybe this could be the result of\nsomething SharpNEAT is doing when fitness stagnates. We&#39;re using the\ndefault NEAT parameters with the exception of starting with fully-connected\nnetworks. I thought it may be due to the FitnessHistoryLength, but setting\nthat to 0 doesn&#39;t change anything either.\n\nHas anyone seen anything like this before? Colin, maybe you can offer a\nhypothesis about what in SharpNEAT could cause this?\n\nWesley\n\r\n--bcaec54fb9e0aa024b04b464dd59\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi all,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m working on a simple robot foraging task =\r\nin SharpNEAT and we&#39;re seeing a very strange result.
