Will\n&gt; graphics\n&gt; also be displayed in the browser during runtime?\n\nThe approach we&#39;re taking is to have any additional\ngraphical information pop up in a new browser window.\nFor something like an XOR run, you would have\ncheckboxes for population size, mutation rates, etc. \nAnd there would also be checkboxes for:\n\n--Fitness graph\n--Generational winner topology\n--Species makeup of population\n\nIf you checked any or all of them, each would pop up\nin a new window when you click &quot;Begin Run&quot;.  That&#39;s\nthe idea, anyway.  We&#39;ll try to make it fairly\nflexible, so that the same basic interface may be used\nwith a variety of different domains.\n \n&gt; What if \n&gt; you ran an experiment for example involving\n&gt; real-time \n&gt; animations, like Mattias&#39; or Mat&#39;s?  \n\nI&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to display\nreal-time animations in a seperate window as well. \nWe&#39;d like to be able to release our implementation\nwith at least a couple of different examples, probably\nXOR, Tic-Tac-Toe, and perhaps a simple control\nexperiment in which an agent travels to a target while\navoiding traps.  For this last (and maybe\nTic-Tac-Toe), we&#39;ll most likely include a some sort of\nreal-time visualization.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
