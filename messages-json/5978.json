Here =\r\nare my thoughts (obviously influenced by the fact that I work in a group th=\r\nat tries to model the hippocampus ;))\n\nMy impression is that you showed the=\r\n emergence of modularity in the sense of parallel processing but I was wond=\r\nering whether the objective &quot;low connection costs&quot; would also yield to modu=\r\nlar networks in sequential processes. Sequential processes could be either =\r\ninterpreted as a decomposition of the problem in sequential subproblems (e.=\r\ng. low-feature-analysis of retinal input =3D&gt; detection of an object =3D&gt; a=\r\nssociating the object with a learnt item), or as solving a problem in the t=\r\nemporal domain (e.g. the network receives two objects in a temporal order a=\r\nnd should decide whether the second object corresponds to an expected objec=\r\nt).\n\nThe modularity observed in your paper seems to result from the fact th=\r\nat the problem domain contains already two groups of input neurons that req=\r\nuire independent computations + a small number of computational steps to pr=\r\noduce the solution. What if modularity does not correspond to parallel and =\r\nindependent processing and the number of layers is much higher? Will connec=\r\ntion cost be still an important factor here?\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n \n\n\n\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m extremely pl=\r\neased to announce a new paper on a subject that many--including myself--thi=\r\nnk is critical to making significant progress in our field: the evolution o=\r\nf modularity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Hod Lipson and I have a new paper=\r\n that \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) sheds light on why modularity may evolve in biological netwo=\r\nrks (e.g. neural, genetic, metabolic, protein-protein, etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) provid=\r\nes a simple technique for evolving neural networks that are modular and hav=\r\ne increased evolvability, in that they adapt faster to new environments.

A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biologic=\r\nal networks=97their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits=\r\n=97but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Altho=\r\nugh most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we dem=\r\nonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost =\r\nof connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networ=\r\nks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximiz=\r\ne network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are=\r\n significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments tha=\r\nt only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in nume=\r\nrous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our abilit=\r\ny to harness evolution for engineering purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Video: http://www.you=\r\ntube.com/watch?feature=3Dplayer_embedded&v=3DSG4_aW8LMng\n&gt; \n&gt; There has bee=\r\nn some nice coverage of this work in the popular press, in case you are int=\r\nerested:\n&gt; \n&gt; National Geographic: http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/=\r\n2013/01/30/the-parts-of-life/\n&gt; MIT&#39;s Technology Review: http://www.technol=\r\nogyreview.com/view/428504/computer-scientists-reproduce-the-evolution-of-ev=\r\nolvability/ \n&gt; Fast Company: http://www.fastcompany.com/3005313/evolved-bra=\r\nins-robots-creep-closer-animal-learning\n&gt; Cornell Chronicle: http://www.new=\r\ns.cornell.edu/stories/Jan13/modNetwork.html\n&gt; ScienceDaily: http://www.scie=\r\nncedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130130082300.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know what=\r\n you think and if you have any questions.
