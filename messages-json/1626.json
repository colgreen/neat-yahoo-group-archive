The fitness landscape ruggedness, hilliness,\ndeceptiveness, etc., in different domains is likely to be different.\n\nTherefore, it actually kind of makes sense if you want to search for\nmutation parameters to tie them to the individual genes, since at\nleast then the search is domain-specific.  Of course, as you point\nout, this kind of gene-by-gene searching may go all over the place,\nbut then again, at least in the ES community (as Ian pointed out),\nthey have had some success with this, and it&#39;s (I think) almost a\nstandard part of their methodology now.\n\nThere actually is a third, more sophisticated method for getting\nweight mutation parameters, which is to measure the success of\nmutations in various directions in the multidimensional space and\nactually construct a model of the most promising mutation trajectory\nbased on the experience over past generations (as a multi-dimensional\nprobability distribution).  That has recently popped up in ES as well,\nthough the math behind it is not simple at all.  \n\nThe problem of getting weight mutation right is a little bit of an art\nform and may have an element of alchemy (i.e. there&#39;s perhaps not that\nmuch you can really do without just getting lucky) but then again\nthere probably are some ranges that are more reasonable than others\nover multiple domains, so it&#39;s not bad to learn more about it.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
