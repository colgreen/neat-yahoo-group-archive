T. The Sensitivity of HyperNEAT to Different Geometr=\r\nic Representations of a Problem. Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionar=\r\ny Computation Conference (GECCO) 144=96148 (2009).\n\nIn it are a couple of i=\r\ndeas that could be helpful to you:\n\nThe first is a test for whether HyperNE=\r\nAT is exploiting geometric information in the input domain. We show that yo=\r\nu can simply compare the performance of HyperNEAT with the geometrically ar=\r\nranged inputs and then compare it to runs with HyperNEAT where you randomiz=\r\ne the geometric locations of the inputs. Any performance advantage (average=\r\nd over many runs) in the geometrically arranged input space runs vs. the ra=\r\nndomized runs reveals the extent to which those geometric relationships hel=\r\np. \n\nMore to your point, as Ken mentioned, I also found that HyperNEAT outc=\r\nompetes a direct encoding control (Fixed Topology-NEAT) even when inputs ar=\r\ne randomized. That performance gain can either be interpreted as a benefit =\r\nof generative encodings vs. direct encodings, or it could be that HyperNEAT=\r\n learns to map its inputs into a geometric arrangement in the hidden layer,=\r\n and then exploits that geometry in the hidden layer. \n\nEither way, the res=\r\nults suggest that even if you don&#39;t have a good idea for how to geometrical=\r\nly arrange the inputs, HyperNEAT will still do better than direct controls.=\r\n None of that, of course, answers whether ES-HyperNEAT is better than NonES=\r\n-HyperNEAT uniquely in such situations, aside from the general differences =\r\nbetween the two algorithms. \n\nI hope that helps. \n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune=\r\n\n\nVisiting Scientist\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\njeffclune.com=\r\n\n\nOn Oct 17, 2012, at 8:44 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Hi Oliver, even though the individual depicted in the &quot;Unified Approach&quot; p=\r\naper does not appear to reflect the symmetry of its inputs and outputs, my =\r\nguess is that it still benefits from the fact there is some geometry to the=\r\nm. For example, aside from symmetry, sensors that are next to each other ar=\r\ne responsible for adjacent areas of the sensory field. It&#39;s also possible t=\r\nhat even though the node placement is asymmetric that their internal connec=\r\ntivity among each other is still somehow a derivation of the more explicit =\r\nsymmetric geometry of the sensors and outputs, like if you took a symmetric=\r\n pattern and twisted it in a half-pretzel - within the pretzel itself (igno=\r\nring its curvature) there is still a notion of symmetry. Also, often we do =\r\nsee ES-HyperNEAT produce nice symmetric patterns that even the human eye ca=\r\nn appreciate.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, none of that really answers your question about=\r\n what it implies if there is no clear geometry to begin with. I believe Jef=\r\nf Clune can point you to some of his work where he tried training off rando=\r\nmized geometries and found that even there HyperNEAT still can gain some ad=\r\nvantage from arbitrary geometric relations that can still be exploited. But=\r\n in terms of ES-HyperNEAT, I don&#39;t know of any explicit studies of this iss=\r\nue. If there is really no geometric principle whatsoever then I think it wo=\r\nn&#39;t work out as well as if there is, so I&#39;d try to have one. But if you rea=\r\nlly can&#39;t (e.g. because of the domain) there still might be hope of somethi=\r\nng interesting happening in the hidden node configuration nevertheless.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone have thoughts or experience on=\r\n the benefits or issues of using\n&gt; &gt; ES-HyperNEAT for evolving recurrent ne=\r\nural networks which deal with input\n&gt; &gt; and output that does not necessaril=\r\ny/explicitly contain geometric\n&gt; &gt; regularities (compared to, say, NEAT).
