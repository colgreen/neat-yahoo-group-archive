My first step is to recreate\n(relatively closely) Ken Stanley&#39;s original competitive coevolution\nrobot duel experiment, which is where I am at now. This is my first\nreal project with NEAT, so I&#39;m probably messing up some pretty basic\nstuff.\n\nNow that I can run the experiment, I&#39;m seeing my first problems. I&#39;m\nnot seeing nearly enough complexification compared to the original\nexperiment. I figure a good chunk of that is my parameters need\ntweaking, but I could also be missing something essential in my\nimplementation.\n\nI have 10 runs, and all seemed to do rather poorly:\nAverage of 7.9 dominant strategies\nFinal dominant strategies have an average of 0.3 hidden nodes\nFinal dominant strategies have an average of 43.6 connections\n\nSimilarly to Ken&#39;s original experiment, I have 500 generations, with\ntwo teams (red and blue) with 256 robots per team. Each generation\neach robot competes in 24 matches (both left and right starts against\n4 best agents from the other team, and 8 randomly selected\nhall-of-famers).\n\nThe team champs compete in a tournament against each other to figure\nout which is the generation champ. I differ slightly from the original\nexperiment as I only have them compete in 158 matches (79 food\nconfigurations, with both left and right starts). If they tie, I\nrandomly select one to be the generation champ (not sure if this is\nhow it wad done in the original experiment).\n\nThe generation champ them plays all prior dominant strategies in the\nsame style tournament, and if it defeats them all, it is the newest\ndominant strategy (ties are counted as a loss, not sure if this is the\nsame as the original experiment).\n\nMy implementation is highly multi-threaded, written in C++ for Linux\n(I have lots of multicore linux boxes I can use at work). The\nunderlying NEAT implementation is basically a Linux port of Mat\nBuckland&#39;s implementation from his gaming AI book, extended a bit here\nand there, particularly to support neural net duplication to support\nsafe multi-threading.\n\nAll the experimental stuff is in the\ncompetitiveCoevolutionNeatMain.cpp file. There are two threads defined\nin there, the runJobManagerThread (of which only 1 is run), and the\nrunExecutionThread (of which any number will run based on parameters).\nAll the NEAT stuff is encapsulated in classes, with most work going\nthrough the higher level Cga class.\n\nI&#39;m attaching a tarball of my source code (it&#39;s a work in progress and\npretty rough), and my spreadsheet with my 10 run results (summary\nsheet, and then a sheet for each run with the name of the machine I\nused).\n\nAll the data in the spreadsheet is from the .csv files in the\ndataFiles directory in the tarball.\n\n\nParameters are found in the parameters.h file, but here are the values\nI&#39;m using:\nconst int    param_numAgents                        = 256;\nconst int    param_numTicks                           = 750;\nconst int    param_maxNumGenerations           = 500;\n\nconst int    param_numBestAgentsPerTeam     = 4;\nconst int    param_numHallOfFamers                = 8;\n\nconst int    param_numInputs                           = 13;\nconst int    param_numOutputs                        = 3;\nconst int    param_maxPermittedNeurons         = 2000;\nconst int    param_numTrysToFindOldLink        = 5;\nconst int    param_numTrysToFindLoopedLink   = 5;\nconst int    param_numAddLinkAttempts          = 5;\n\nconst int    param_numGensAllowedNoImprovement = 30;\nconst int    param_youngBonusAgeThreshold           = 10;\nconst int    param_oldAgeThreshold                         = 50;\nconst double param_youngFitnessBonus                 = 1.3;\nconst double param_oldAgePenalty                         = 0.7;\nconst double param_survivalRate                             = 0.2;\n\n// Mutation stuff\nconst double param_crossoverRate                          = 0.7;\nconst double param_chanceAddNode                      = 0.01;\nconst double param_chanceAddLink                       = 0.1;\nconst double param_chanceAddRecurrentLink          = 0.05;\nconst double param_mutationRate                           = 0.8;\nconst double param_probabilityWeightReplaced       = 0.1;\nconst double param_maxWeightPerturbation            = 0.9;\nconst double param_activationMutationRate             = 0.1;\nconst double param_maxActivationPerturbation        = 0.1;\n\n\n// Compatibility calculation parameters\nconst double param_mExcess                      = 1.0; // C1\nconst double param_mDisjoint                      = 1.0; // C2\nconst double param_mMatched                    = 2.0; // C3\n\n// Can be overridden using Cga::SetCompatibilityThreshold for dynamic use\nconst double param_compatibilityThreshold      = 3.0;\n\n// If using dynamic compatibility thresholds,\n// Cga will use these parameters as a minimum\n// and maximum\nconst double param_minCompatibilityThreshold   =   0.1;\nconst double param_maxCompatibilityThreshold   = 500.0;\n\n// If using dynamic compatibility thresholds, here&#39;s\n// a convenient place to stash the target number\n// of species.
