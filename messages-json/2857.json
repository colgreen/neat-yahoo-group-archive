However, it \ncan be co=\r\nmbined with backprop if that&#39;s what you want to do, and some \nhave had succ=\r\ness with it (as has recently been discussed on this \ngroup).\n\nAs mentioned =\r\nby another poster, my own C++ code has some simple \nexperiments such as XOR=\r\n, and to some extent pole balancing is simpler \nthan minesweepers.\n\nAll the=\r\n various versions of NEAT, each with their own interesting \nexperiments, ar=\r\ne available from my homepage:\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/\n\nNote howeve=\r\nr that NEAT really wasn&#39;t designed for problems like \nmultiplexer, which ma=\r\ny be the explanation for your uncertainty.  NEAT \nwas designed mostly to de=\r\nal with sparse reinforcement problems (i.e. \nnot supervised) that are harde=\r\nr than classification problems where \ntargets are provided.  That may be a =\r\nreason that you find the tasks \navailable too complex- those are the type o=\r\nf task the system was \ndesigned for.  Supervised problems are much easier a=\r\nnd the selection \nof methods that can deal with them is greater.\n\nken\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, Richard Gong &lt;gongrichard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a no=\r\nob, and I&#39;m looking at some sharpNEAT code...\n&gt; \n&gt; Does NEAT do things like=\r\n backprop at all? Or does it just randomly \nevolve networks, and combine th=\r\ne best genes? Once you evolve a \nnetwork, and you use backprop on it?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAlso, is there a simple NEAT example in c++?
