It&#39;s worth noting that the NEAT genome used for these experiments \nwas also still using floating point numbers and therefore a great many fine \nweight adjustments within a genome will actually have no effect in the \nresulting network since the float values have a higher level of precision \nthan the integer based system in use, therefore it would probably be \nbeneficial to switch the genomes over integers as well if you were actually \nlooking to evolve integer based networks.&quot;\n\nCould you not just up the minimum weight change until it definitely made a \ndifference to the fixed point?\n\n\tIan\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
