One thing that may be a challenge in this domain\nis the high number of inputs and outputs.  The problem, which comes up\noften with NEAT, is that starting out with a large number of of inputs\nand outputs means starting with a very large number of starting\nconnections, and hence violating the spirit of the principle of\nstarting minimally.  Thus, it may be necessary to start evolution in a\nmore sophisticated way, such as letting NEAT decide which inputs\nand/or outputs to use, or perhaps using an &quot;eye&quot; like Darren Izzard\n(in this group) did.  The main concern is that if you start out with\ntoo many connections to begin with, you don&#39;t get the full power of\nNEAT, which is meant to start in a low-dimensional space.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
