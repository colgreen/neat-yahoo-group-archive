I have the HyperNEAT code \nimplemented, it&#39;s actually very simple. The problem is that even the \nHyperNEAT Tic-Tac-Toe player still sucks, and I was kind of implicitly \npromising a near-optimal player next. It&#39;s funny how sometimes simple \ndomains turn out to be so difficult. If I don&#39;t come up with anything in \na few days, I&#39;ll write it up anyway.\n\nI&#39;d be happy to hear suggestions from the group on better ways to \ncoevolve a better player. I&#39;ve been toying around with dual populations \nwhere one is O and the other is X, similar to the host-parasite setup I \nposted at the end of part 2, but no luck so far. The only other ideas I \nhave left are to drastically increase the population size or to add in \nan optimal opponent with random noise like Fogel did originally. I \nhesitate to do the latter though, as coevolution is generally a more \nelegant solution.\n\nSincerely,\nWesley\n\nAnthony Ison wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks so much for these tutorials Wesley. I for one am eagerly \n&gt; awaiting any more youï¿½re planning to post.\n&gt;\n&gt; You have a great eye for writing an article that balances conceptual \n&gt; and technical detail.\n&gt;\n&gt; Love your work!\n&gt;\n&gt; *From:* Wesley Tansey [mailto:tansey@...]\n&gt; *Sent:* Sunday, 25 July 2010 6:43 AM\n&gt; *To:* neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Subject:* [neat] Part 2 of SharpNEAT 2 Tutorial\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve just finished part 2 of the tutorial on using SharpNEAT 2 to create\n&gt; a Tic-Tac-Toe AI: http://www.nashcoding.com/?p=177\n&gt;\n&gt; This part covers coevolution, creating custom population evaluators, and\n&gt; handling update events. Specifically, I show how to create a parallel\n&gt; two-player competitive coevolution evaluator and a hall of fame\n&gt; evaluator that you can wrap around other evaluators.\n&gt;\n&gt; The resulting AI is still not very strong, but it is at least as good as\n&gt; the part 1 player. The next tutorial will cover HyperNEAT and\n&gt; (hopefully) evolving an optimal player.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thoughts, comments, and questions are always welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
