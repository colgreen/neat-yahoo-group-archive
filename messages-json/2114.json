If there is, we&#39;ll \nshow &#39;em ;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wouldn&#39;t say everyone is anti-modular, they just seem focused \nmore\n&gt; &gt; on issues with the standard NEAT implementation, which just by \nitself\n&gt; &gt; has quite a lot of issues :) Though to be fair both Ken and I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; come to the conclusion that the ad-hoc kind of modularity \npresent in\n&gt; &gt; e.g. mNEAT is kind of the wrong way to approach the problem. \nThats\n&gt; &gt; not to say doing work in the area is not extremely valuable (and \nmay\n&gt; &gt; yield some excellent results), its just that there might be \nother,\n&gt; &gt; better ways of doing modularity besides explicit modularization. \nKen\n&gt; &gt; and I wrote a position statement that appeared in a GECCO \nworkshop on\n&gt; &gt; modularity last year that focuses on this topic. If you haven&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; already, I&#39;d say it might be worth reading. Its available here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04ws\n&gt; \n&gt; So does this mean someone is working on a NEAT with indirect \nencoding?\n&gt; \n\nI know of at least 1 case where someone already built NEAT with an \nindirect encoding, but they scrapped the design because they didn&#39;t \nlike the encoding they chose.  One recent Ph.D. grad in Norway, \nDiego Federici, has taken some of the principles of NEAT and applied \nthem to an indirect encoding.  His web site is here:\n\nwww.idi.ntnu.no/~federici/ \n\nIn any case, I&#39;d say a fair number of people are thinking about \nindirect NEAT at this point.  One of the main reasons for this is \nour 2003 paper, &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny,&quot; which was a \nlarge review exploring this issue:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:alife03\n\nIf you haven&#39;t read it, you may find this article interesting since \nit explores the problem with a biological perspective, addressing \nsome your comments below about whether such a system is possible.  \nYou may be surprised that numerous developmental encodings have \nalready been developed and successfully utilized to evolve things \nfrom robot morphoologies to sorting networks.\n\nI thought the discussion of the word &quot;ad-hoc&quot; was also interesting.  \nI&#39;d actually say the word can be used in several different ways.  In \none sense, the engineer is analytic while nature is ad-hoc.  \nHowever, ad-hoc design of this type is incredibly powerful, whereas \ndesign based on analytic common sense breaks down at extreme levels \nof complexity.  For example, the way nature builds things it might \nturn a refigerator into a TV instead of just breaking the problem of \nbuilding a TV into parts and putting them together bit by bit.  \nThat&#39;s pretty ad-hoc as far as ad-hoc goes  (after all, why go \nthrough a refigerator?), but it&#39;s also ingenious in a way an \nengineer would never be.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of arbitrarily picking a component of a \nsystem and duplicating it all over the place is totally ad-hoc and \nextremely brittle.  That doesn&#39;t mean that duplication of genetic \nsequences cannot be quite powerful, but that&#39;s different from an \nengineer taking a chunk of your machine and praying that it will \nwork in another part.  You might point out that engineers don&#39;t \nreally do that- they don&#39;t just randomly take parts and duplicate \nthem without considering the application.  But that&#39;s precisely the \npoint: Nature is not an engineer so why would you expect it to work \nlike one?\n\nIt&#39;s way too early to discount the power of developmental encodings.\nOn the other hand, it&#39;s also too early to endorse them.  They seem \nto have great potential but I&#39;d keep an open mind at this early \nstage in the field.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
