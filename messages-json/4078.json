As some of you know from experience,\n&gt; &gt; evolving black and white=\r\n pictures with CPPN-like representations \nis\n&gt; &gt; fairly straightforward, bu=\r\nt adding color is a major challenge.  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; in large part to Nick B=\r\neato, who did the actual implementation on \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; applet after many gro=\r\nup discussions, we now have an intuitive and \n&gt; fun\n&gt; &gt; color evolution sys=\r\ntem that actually works.  An important aspect \nof\n&gt; &gt; our color system for =\r\nthe continuity of the site is that it allows \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; begin with one of t=\r\nhe preexisting black and white images (if you \n&gt; want)\n&gt; &gt; and it will evol=\r\nve color into it seamlessly.  So all the existing\n&gt; &gt; images can now be col=\r\norized!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve just begun to start publishing some color images, wh=\r\nich you \n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; see under our Newest Images category:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://pi=\r\ncbreeder.org/imagedisplay.php?type=3DCREATED&page=3D0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, =\r\nin case you did not know, Picbreeder also allows \n&gt; anonymous\n&gt; &gt; publishin=\r\ng, so you don&#39;t need an account to play with and even \n&gt; publish\n&gt; &gt; color =\r\npictures.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
