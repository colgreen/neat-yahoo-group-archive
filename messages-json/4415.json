For tho=\r\nse who don&#39;t know of Mat, he wrote the book &quot;AI\nTechniques for Game Program=\r\nming,&quot; which culminates in a final chapter\nalmost entirely about NEAT and a=\r\npplying NEAT to video games.  The book\nhas been on sale at Amazon for years=\r\n:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/193184108X/qid%3D1034633319/sr%3D=\r\n11-1/ref%3Dsr_11_1/104-5338435-0523903\n\nI know that a lot of people were in=\r\ntroduced to NEAT through this book\nand I communicated extensively with Mat =\r\nwhile he was working on it to\nhelp make sure his NEAT implementation (which=\r\n is now available\npublicly as &quot;Windows NEAT C++&quot; and also comes with the bo=\r\nok) was\nworking.  The book (and Mat) succeeded in connecting neuroevolution=\r\n to\nvideo games in many people&#39;s minds for the first time and gave\ncredibil=\r\nity to the idea in the video game industry.    Mat has posted\non the NEAT U=\r\nsers Group in the past as well, as I&#39;m sure some of our\nveteran members rec=\r\nall.\n\nI had the privilege of meeting Mat in 2005 at the CIG symposium. \nRec=\r\nently, I even used his book as a textbook in my class on AI for\nGames.  How=\r\never, in about early 2007, Mat disappeared, as far as I can\ntell.  The webs=\r\nite he runs, http://www.ai-junkie.com/ai-junkie.html\nstopped being updated,=\r\n and stranger, he stopped posting to his own\nforums on that site.  I no lon=\r\nger know how to contact him, and it\nseems strange that he stopped supportin=\r\ng his own site, which had been\nquite popular.\n\nDoes anyone know how to cont=\r\nact Mat or what he&#39;s up to recently?  I&#39;ve\nbeen wanting to discuss with him=\r\n some ideas about teaching AI for\ngames, but more importantly, I&#39;m hoping e=\r\nverything is ok with him...\n\nken \n\n\n"}}
