And simple things are often the \nbest. :=\r\n) \nI thought about this issue you mention but it looks like there is no \nge=\r\nneral solution to it. Or I may be wrong. Since NS uses steady-state \nevolut=\r\nion, it can take advantage of real-time NEAT in the sense that \nall individ=\r\nuals can be evaluated simultaneously and one is replaced \neach N ticks. In =\r\nNERO you have a minimum time-to-live treshold, in \norder to distinguish ind=\r\nividuals that are properly evaluated, right? \nIn my implementation I call t=\r\nhese &quot;Adults&quot;. So one way to prevent the \nblank behaviors is to let the ind=\r\nividual live as long as it does all \npossible actions at least once, then t=\r\nhe &quot;Adult&quot; switch is turned on \n(it is off at birth). But individuals that =\r\nare genetically incapable \nof doing some actions could live forever, which =\r\ncan be a problem. \nHowever, this also means that they are already far into =\r\nthe behavior \nspace and therefore can be considered very different behavior=\r\n. So \nanother &quot;give up&quot; constant can be introduced that kills off such \nbeh=\r\naviors. \nIn general, this is something similar to applying NS for a game of=\r\n \nchance. Maybe a better solution is to have multiple trials for each \nindi=\r\nvidual, to ensure it will meet at least most of the possible \nsituations. \n=\r\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, I like your idea for characterizing behavior in dynamic and\n&gt; =\r\ninteractive environments, and I think it makes good sense.  I&#39;d be\n&gt; intere=\r\nsted in seeing how well it works. \n&gt; \n&gt; One issue may be that some individu=\r\nals simply never encounter the\n&gt; situations that others do.  Therefore, som=\r\ne of the behavior\n&gt; characterization will be blank.  How do you think such =\r\nblank areas \ncan\n&gt; be rectified when comparing two individuals?  For exampl=\r\ne, perhaps \nyou\n&gt; took a right turn when you could, but I never encountered=\r\n an\n&gt; opportunity to turn right.  Do we consider this behavior different? \n=\r\n&gt; (I am assuming we would just ignore that dimension of behavior, but\n&gt; per=\r\nhaps you have another idea)  In general, I like your idea and \nthink\n&gt; it s=\r\nhould be an effective general approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may also be possible to cha=\r\nracterize behavior in more general\n&gt; terms.  Even though evaluation is inhe=\r\nrently noisy, it is possible\n&gt; that a general characterization may filter o=\r\nut much noise.  For\n&gt; example, perhaps something like counting how many doo=\r\nr an individual\n&gt; enters or how much food it eats could give a general sens=\r\ne of its\n&gt; personality even though it would vary slightly in any given \nlif=\r\netime.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are important issues if NS is to be used directly in an\n&gt;=\r\n interactive/coevolutionary world, so it&#39;s good to think about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; k=\r\nen\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking of how to characterize b=\r\nehavior of an agent in a \n&gt; &gt; complex dynamic world. As you all know, the 2=\r\nD maze world in the \n&gt; &gt; demos is a static one. It doesn&#39;t interact with th=\r\ne agent. Thus \nit is \n&gt; &gt; possible for Novelty Search to exploit the static=\r\n environment and \n&gt; &gt; develop behaviors that are not successful or meaningf=\r\nul on even \n&gt; &gt; slightly different maze configurations. I don&#39;t say that NS=\r\n \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; find general solutions able to navigate most mazes. I mean \n=\r\nthat &quot;born \n&gt; &gt; to solve only this particular maze&quot; solutions appear often.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, what if I add more agents, in a realtime interavtive \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; environment like the one in NERO? While trying to generalize \n&gt; &gt; everyt=\r\nhing I see in terms of behavior characterization, it was \n&gt; &gt; difficult to =\r\njust say &quot;the agent does this!&quot; and use it as BC. It \nis \n&gt; &gt; because the r=\r\neal world environment is not static, it interacts \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the agent, so =\r\nit becomes something like noisy evaluation when I \ntry \n&gt; &gt; to evolve one. =\r\nThe same individual could appear more and less \nnovel \n&gt; &gt; every time. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; So one day, I was observing my dog.. Let&#39;s think of my dog as a \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncomplex biological agent in a real world interactive \nenvironment.. If \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n you try to make a summary of its behavior, how can you do it? One \nmay \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; suggest to put the dog in various situations and observe its \n&gt; &gt; reactio=\r\nns, finally collecting a summary of what it does in those \n&gt; &gt; situations. =\r\nWhile this seems like the solution, it is not. \nBecause in \n&gt; &gt; order to co=\r\nmpare different dogs, you will have to put all of them \n&gt; &gt; through the sam=\r\ne tests in order to avoid the noisy evaluation. \nAnd \n&gt; &gt; this brings us to=\r\n a static environment again, because we know \nwhat \n&gt; &gt; exactly is going to=\r\n happen to all agents, in order to see their \n&gt; &gt; reactions. While realizin=\r\ng that, I arrived on a better idea that \nI am \n&gt; &gt; going to talk about now.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a complex interactive world, a little is known what exactly \n=\r\ncan \n&gt; &gt; happen to an agent. Further, the agent has a limited set of \nactio=\r\nns \n&gt; &gt; that it can take. A behavior characterization taking into account \n=\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; actions only is not enough, because it is not known what happened =\r\n\nto \n&gt; &gt; the agent before that action. So one solution I came up with is \nt=\r\nhis \n&gt; &gt; one. You have a list of all possible and/or performed actions for =\r\n\nthe \n&gt; &gt; BC. For each action, a summary or a more detailed list of \nsituat=\r\nions \n&gt; &gt; must exist. So basically let&#39;s say that we have a simple robot \nt=\r\nhat \n&gt; &gt; can go forward, fire a rocket and turn left/right. With \nrangefing=\r\ner \n&gt; &gt; sensors or whatever. Instead of tracking only *what* it did \nduring=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; its lifetime, the system now has to track also in what \ncircumstances=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; the particular action took place, and add that to the summary of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n behavior. This can be the inputs at that particular timestep, for \n&gt; &gt; exa=\r\nmple. Or the relative positions of other agents that it may \n&gt; &gt; interact w=\r\nith. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does it make sense? Suppose you try to characterize a driver=\r\n in a \n&gt; &gt; city traffic conditions. Anything can happen. But if you also \nt=\r\nrack \n&gt; &gt; what the driver *sees* in the particular moments when he acts, in=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; addition to what actions he takes, it is a lot easier to \ndistinguish=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; between different driving behaviors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will be happy to hear=\r\n your thoughts about this. Perhaps it is \n&gt; &gt; nothing new, but I didn&#39;t see=\r\n any discussion about it. Though it \nis \n&gt; &gt; an important issue about how t=\r\no use Novelty Search for multi-\nagent, \n&gt; &gt; coevolutionary, and some real-w=\r\norld applicatons. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
