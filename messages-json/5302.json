I recently went throug=\r\nh the code and made a 15x improvement on the performance, so I will take th=\r\ne changes I made and your experiments and release a version 3.1.\n\nJason G.\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of you have asked for the source code of my HyperNEAT experiment=\r\ns (so\n&gt; far).\n&gt; \n&gt; I kept putting off publishing the code until I had time =\r\nto clean up the\n&gt; code. Instead of further delay, I am just releasing it as=\r\n is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a link to it:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/JeffCluneHyperNEATc=\r\node\n&gt; \n&gt; The most requested code--that for evolving gaits for simulated qua=\r\ndruped\n&gt; robots--is in here as the LegSwingExperiment. There is a readme fi=\r\nle for how\n&gt; to get started. If you have any questions, just let me know.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; PS. I think it would be fun to have the robot experiment included in th=\r\ne\n&gt; more canonical HyperNEAT releases, if the maintainers of those packages=\r\n are\n&gt; interested. It is very fun to watch the robots evolve, and it quickl=\r\ny gives\n&gt; one a sense of the difference in behaviors produced by HyperNEAT =\r\nvs. NEAT\n&gt; and FT-NEAT. I have found that being able to download a package =\r\nand see\n&gt; something that is visually intuitive can often engage an enthusia=\r\nst/hobbyist\n&gt; who does not immediately know how to evaluate improved perfor=\r\nmance on more\n&gt; abstract problems (e.g. the boxes domain). So, it would be =\r\nnice to have\n&gt; something like this for them to immediately see and play wit=\r\nh. Just a\n&gt; thought. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolutio=\r\nn Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
