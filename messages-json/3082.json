The last thing you said is that pattern recognition &quot;is\n&gt; beneficial independent of whether a traditional developmental\n&gt; encoding is used.&quot;  I think that&#39;s pretty consistent with my\n&gt; argument that a traditional developmental encoding does not\n&gt; necessarily hold any advantages just by virtue of its unfolding over\n&gt; time or local interaction.\n&gt;\n\nYeah that may very well be the case. Maybe I&#39;m just misrepresenting  \nwhat you wrote earlier. :)\n\n&gt; You also point out that CPPNs in effect do something similar in a\n&gt; more explicit way.  And I agree that it&#39;s an interesting question\n&gt; whether implicit vs. explicit matters for this kind of &quot;targeting&quot;\n&gt; ability.  My guess is that explicit is the same or better because\n&gt; making such an operation implicit makes it somewhat indirect, which\n&gt; means the route to a particular goal state may become more\n&gt; convoluted due to an inability to simply say directly what it should\n&gt; be.\n\nI think the explicit/implicit duality is a bit more complex than your  \ncharacterization though. My intuition would actually be the opposite:  \nthat implicit determination of phenotypic structures is more  \n&quot;flexible&quot; allowing simpler access to mutations which affect  \nevolvability. Here is one way to think about it that I just conjured up:\n\n- &quot;Explicit&quot; determination, or what we might call &quot;explicit network  \nspecification&quot; a la CPPNs and traditional NEAT works on the level of  \nobjects (neurons) which need to have interfaces specified explicitly  \nevery time new ones are added.\n\n- &quot;Implicit&quot; determination, as per GRNs which specify networks  \nthrough if-then clauses, works on the level of the interfaces, and  \nnew objects benefit from being &quot;compatible&quot; with the interfaces  \nalready. That is, a new object that arises through a mutation is  \nimmediately connected up to other objects at many different levels in  \nthe hierarchy because its connecting via a predefined interface. This  \nis achieved implicitly, without the need for a bunch of mutations  \nconnecting up each node explicitly.\n\nTo me it seems like this approach has merit, although it is obviously  \na little counter-intuitive: Why should we sacrifice fine-grained  \ncontrol for this weird idea of &quot;implicit similarity&quot; based on  \ninterfaces? But actually it turns out to be quite powerful, at least  \nfor complex domains like othello.\n\nThe next step I think is to compare these approaches side by side  \nacross a bunch of domains to see where they differ. I think there is  \na lot of room here to develop a robust theory of representation  \ndesign in evolutionary search.\n\nI should point out that actually carrying out all the comparisons and  \ntheorizing necessary here is probably going to constitute the bulk of  \nmy PhD dissertation, so watch this space for future developments.\n\n&gt; These are obviously subtle issues that merit more research, since I\n&gt; am speaking only from intuition.  It&#39;s a really interesting topic.\n&gt; We can talk about this more in Hawaii in a couple days :)\n\nDefinitely, I&#39;m looking forward to it.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe, I may not be fully understanding your point, so I wanted to\n&gt; ask\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for clarification.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My point was only that CPPNs can abstract away\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the temporal unfolding and local interaction that are usually\n&gt;&gt;&gt; associated with development.  You are saying something that does\n&gt; not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seem in opposition to this point, but I may be\n&gt; misunderstanding.  It\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seems you are saying that &quot;pattern recognition&quot; gives a powerful\n&gt;&gt;&gt; capability to traditional developmental systems in terms of being\n&gt;&gt;&gt; able to target mutations to specific areas.  I would not disagree\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with that point.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Right, but such pattern matching is independent of the\n&gt; developmental\n&gt;&gt; process, its a representational feature that could be added in to\n&gt; any\n&gt;&gt; indirect encoding. Its just a different way of specifying locality\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; a slightly more &quot;unstructured&quot; way than is done with CPPNs. In\n&gt; fact\n&gt;&gt; it could certainly be used with CPPNs, in the same way we use it\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; neural networks.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to be clear that I believe the idea of &quot;pattern\n&gt; recognition&quot;\n&gt;&gt; in development is completely independent of local interactions\n&gt;&gt; determining &quot;where am i?&quot; Furthermore, I believe this idea plays\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; role in determining evolvability.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, what I would say, which may simply be consistent with\n&gt; what\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you are saying, is that CPPNs abstract away the need for there\n&gt; to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such pattern recognition in order to get either global or local\n&gt;&gt;&gt; targeted mutations.  I still submit that the targeted mutations\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which you are referring ultimately hinge on &quot;where am I?&quot;\n&gt; Because\n&gt;&gt;&gt; how did the liver cell ultimately figure out it was a liver cell?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s because of its neighbors, and so forth.  It&#39;s all context-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dependent.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But it doesn&#39;t have to be determined from the neighbors. A cell\n&gt; could\n&gt;&gt; just have a context determined by overlapping regulatory regions\n&gt; on a\n&gt;&gt; fixed substrate (like how CPPNS and implicit NEAT work). These\n&gt;&gt; overlapping regulatory regions are what I&#39;m trying to get at here:\n&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; regulatory region in a gene does exactly the &quot;pattern\n&gt; recognition&quot;\n&gt;&gt; that we are discussing. For instance, a cell at some fixed\n&gt; location\n&gt;&gt; could respond to some regulatory signals A, B, and C. These\n&gt; signals\n&gt;&gt; exactly determine the cell&#39;s context within development, and\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; cells with the exact same signals would be treated the same, even\n&gt;&gt; though they may be located in spatially diverse areas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, in the CPPN, the liver is a local coordinate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; frame (i.e. some internal node) that is built upon (i.e. a\n&gt; function\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of) other coordinate frames.  So in effect the same thing is\n&gt; going\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on, just in a different way.  But ultimately it &quot;knows&quot; it is a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; liver cell in either case.  In the CPPN this knowledge is simply\n&gt;&gt;&gt; encapsulated as the node in the CPPN itself where the coordinate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; frame is represented.  A mutation thereabout will effect only\n&gt; those\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cells within that coordinate frame.  So you get targeted\n&gt; mutations\n&gt;&gt;&gt; just as well without &quot;pattern recognition.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Right, this is a good example. The hierarchical nesting of\n&gt; coordinate\n&gt;&gt; frames in CPPNs and the idea of doing pattern recognition for\n&gt;&gt; matching regulatory signals accomplish the same goal, although\n&gt; they\n&gt;&gt; are wildly different approaches. One could almost say that a CPPN\n&gt;&gt; builds definitions of locality &quot;explicitly&quot; while the regulatory\n&gt;&gt; approach builds it &quot;implicitly.&quot; Which of these representations\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; better for what problems is an interesting open problem in\n&gt;&gt; representation design.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think what I&#39;m saying is consistent with the results that you\n&gt; cite\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from your paper since I fully believe that IF you are using a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional developmental encoding, &quot;pattern recognition&quot; indeed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; carries the benefits you cite.  So I expect you could\n&gt; demonstrate it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; experimentally.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again to be clear where I disagree with you, &quot;pattern\n&gt; recognition&quot;\n&gt;&gt; can be used and is beneficial independent of whether a\n&gt; traditional\n&gt;&gt; developmental encoding is used.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this is a great discussion to have.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have one (small) point of clarification to add to your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; exposition\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;genes essentially &#39;pattern recognize&#39; certain areas in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organism&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is absolutely correct for biological organisms, and for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iterated developmental systems in general.  However, the deep\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is *why* should they need to &quot;pattern recognize&quot;\n&gt; certain\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; areas?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And the answer is because they need to know where they are.  In\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effect, in the physical universe, there is no intrinsic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; coordinate\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system that cells can query to ask their location.  Thus, they\n&gt;&gt;&gt; must\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; develop elaborate and ad hoc ways of communicating to each\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other, as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a group, where everyone is.  I send my neighbor signals, my\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neighbor\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sends me signals back, and we negotiate our roles.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My undoubtedly controversial contention is that the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; question &quot;where\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am I?&quot; is the ONLY reason that such negotation is necessary.\n&gt; If\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t have to ask that question, then you would not need to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; talk to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your neighbors in order to determine your role.  Rather, you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; could\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just compute your role as a function of your known\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coordinate/position in the world.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your answer to &quot;why we need to pattern recognize&quot; is a little\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; incomplete. Basically you&#39;ve only answered this from the cell&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective. Lets consider &quot;pattern recognize&quot; from the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the developmental program instead of the cell. Then the main\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; question is &quot;how do I select a bunch of cells that match some\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; property?&quot; That is, I want to select some contiguous region,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g.,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;toe cells&quot; or &quot;heart cells&quot; or maybe I want to select something\n&gt;&gt;&gt; more\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developmentally useful, e.g. &quot;epithelial cells&quot; or &quot;cells in\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stripe pattern along the HOX axis.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why is this useful? Because then we can make mutations that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; affect\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these areas and no others, i.e. mutation selectivity that is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; defined\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for some (hopefully) useful phenotypic axes of variation. A lot\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; useful things fall out naturally from this idea, like modularity\n&gt;&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolvability (this is where I cite my GECCO 2007 paper, which is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet on the web). In CPPN terms it would be like being able to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; select,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say, all the black stripes in a sine grating, but not the white\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ones.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I&#39;m not mistaken, CPPNs support this idea of regional\n&gt;&gt;&gt; selection\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very nicely, so I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t mention it here.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I totally agree that doing away with the &quot;negotiation&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; step\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; required for developmental systems using purely local\n&gt; interactions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a useful optimization, but I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to say that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; being\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; able to &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain areas serves the sole\n&gt; purpose\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; localization with respect to only the global coordinate system.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll go into this issue in more detail in my talk at GECCO, but\n&gt; I\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think its very important, and our empirical results seem to back\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up quite strongly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Joe\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
