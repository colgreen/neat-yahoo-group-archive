In other words, it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gives\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the brain the opportunity to exploit the changes occur over\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development.

There are some\n&gt;&gt;&gt; problems \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when trying to use CPPNs directly to map onto 2/3D objects\n&gt; with \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finite, though variable (among individuals) size. I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; particularly\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in this issue because it also holds the key to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; automatic generation of HyperNEAT substrates as well. And\n&gt; perhaps \n&gt;&gt;&gt; it \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may open up new ways to have content generation in games, too.\n&gt; And \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Artificial Life, of course.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember that Ken suggested that animal morphologies and\n&gt; such \n&gt;&gt;&gt; things \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may be easier to describe in higher dimensional space and then\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mapped \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; back to 2D/3D, just like in HyperNEAT. Day after day I was\n&gt; trying \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find such a higher-dimensional description of something that\n&gt; has \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; limbs, joints, all with variable numbers and size. Even in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; most \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simplistic 2D case, I never got even close to such an elegant\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solution. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Suppose I want to have a 2D creature with rectangular limbs.\n&gt; But \n&gt;&gt;&gt; how \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many of them is unknown. How they are connected - too. A limb\n&gt; is  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; represented as position in 2D and width/height and an angle of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orientation. This makes 5D space in which I have to query all\n&gt;&gt;&gt; possible \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things and ask the CPPN if there is a limb or not. Sounds too\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expensive, and more, even if I do that, there are\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithmic/implementation issues that are just too hard.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem I had is, actually, that I missed the fact that a\n&gt; CPPN \n&gt;&gt;&gt; is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an infinite mathematical description of the phenotype. Any use\n&gt; of \n&gt;&gt;&gt; a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CPPN involves approximating the phenotype with some kind of\n&gt; level \n&gt;&gt;&gt; of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detail. The CPPN makes no difference if I use it for 16x16\n&gt; visual \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; substrate or 65536x65536, for example (note: I mean not in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; phenotype \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluation). So there must be a way to have such level of\n&gt; detail \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scaling in animal morphologies as well.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So I went back to the cellular growth approach, looking for\n&gt; what I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missed before. The biggest unsolved problem with my previous\n&gt;&gt;&gt; system is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that coordinates may grow to infinite and the activation\n&gt; functions \n&gt;&gt;&gt; are \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually best suited to work in [-1..1] substrates (given the\n&gt; fact \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have fixed CPPN weight range and mutation powers). Plus, the\n&gt; CPPN \n&gt;&gt;&gt; is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requeried on each cell on each timestep in the process of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; development. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Too expensive and as the phenotype gets bigger, development\n&gt; slows \n&gt;&gt;&gt; down \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to a rate that is not acceptable. And more, it is not clear\n&gt; how \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scaling could work if I want to, say, have the same object,\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; same \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shape, much bigger, but the cell size and the coordinate\n&gt; frames - \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still fixed. Something was terribly wrong with that model. But\n&gt; I \n&gt;&gt;&gt; think \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have finally found a solution! Or at least something very\n&gt; close \n&gt;&gt;&gt; to \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The CPPN already encodes all the development of a phenotype\n&gt; with \n&gt;&gt;&gt; any \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; precision via composing coordinate frames. A whole phenotype\n&gt; with \n&gt;&gt;&gt; all \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its patterns with infinite (well at least huge) precision can\n&gt; be \n&gt;&gt;&gt; fit \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into just the patch of [-1 .. 1] in Cartesian space. Assume I\n&gt; will \n&gt;&gt;&gt; be \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about 2D space only for simplicity. That patch [-1 ..\n&gt; 1] \n&gt;&gt;&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both X and Y I call &quot;the Egg&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The first approach I took with the idea of the egg was too\n&gt; simple, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; but \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is interesting to know about. After the CPPN &quot;paints&quot; the\n&gt; egg \n&gt;&gt;&gt; with \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cell color and stuff, then it is re-queried again, this time\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outputs are 2D vectors. The magnitude of these vectors was re-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; scaled \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be within [0 .. MAX_DISTANCE]. So the entire phenotype\n&gt; building \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; procedure became very simple - first build the egg, then send\n&gt; each \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cell where its vector points. Well that looks so ugly in\n&gt; practice, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with empty holes and.. eh.. forget that! This is not anything\n&gt; more \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advanced than just painting the CPPN output directly like in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Picbreeder, just a fancy way of doing the same.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I realized that these &quot;cells&quot; can be also thought of an\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abstractions of &quot;masses/groups of cells&quot;. In nature, cells\n&gt; don&#39;t \n&gt;&gt;&gt; just \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; go &quot;that way&quot; moving through each other, but stick together.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Entire \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tissues develop fast as a mass of cells divides and increases\n&gt;&gt;&gt; size. So \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had this insight. I changed the concept of a cell and\n&gt; improved \n&gt;&gt;&gt; over \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the previous model. A cell is a circle with a radius, has a\n&gt; color \n&gt;&gt;&gt; and \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has mass. It also has more properties but more on that after a\n&gt; few \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other words. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the key idea. In my previous model, the CPPN was\n&gt;&gt;&gt; instructing a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; big mass of many cells on the fly, during development time. It\n&gt;&gt;&gt; took \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; advantage of using time as input, so the development was like\n&gt; a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spatial pattern in 4D. But it suffered from the coordinates\n&gt; and \n&gt;&gt;&gt; other \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems I mentioned above. In this model, the CPPN does not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; operate \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the cells during development. The CPPN predetermines the\n&gt; fate \n&gt;&gt;&gt; of \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each cell right in the egg, before development begins.\n&gt; Everything \n&gt;&gt;&gt; else \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; during development is a consequence of the cell&#39;s fate and the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; internal 2D physics world in which the phenotype develops. So,\n&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simpler words, the CPPN is programming the egg.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A cell has the following properties that are determined by the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; CPPN:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Color (of course :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Growth rate. How fast it increases size in % of circle area.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Time to begin growth. It is a value in [0 .. 1] where 1 is\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; total \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; number of time steps allocated for development.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Growth time duration. Between some min and max value.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Angle for division splitting. Between [-1 .. 1], during\n&gt;&gt;&gt; development \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rescaled to [0 .. pi]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As cells grow, they will inevitably overlap each other. This\n&gt; issue \n&gt;&gt;&gt; is \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; handled by the internal simple 2D physics engine that adds\n&gt; forces \n&gt;&gt;&gt; if \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the circles overlap. So they eventually will converge to a\n&gt; state \n&gt;&gt;&gt; that \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they only touch each other, and the whole phenotype bigger of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; course. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cells can divide. Division is automatic. If a cell&#39;s radius\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reaches a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a fixed treshold value, it is split into 2 cells, each one\n&gt; having \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly half the area of the mother cell. The mother cell is\n&gt; split \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; along a predetermined angle, so the CPPN can control the\n&gt; overall \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; directions of growth for the phenotype. The 2 children overlap\n&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning, but as time progresses, they are pulled apart by\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; physics. Children cells inherit the properties of the mother,\n&gt; but \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change their positions and reset their lifetime timers. The\n&gt; cells \n&gt;&gt;&gt; in \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the egg count their children and their grandchildren as well.\n&gt; No \n&gt;&gt;&gt; more \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 3 generations of division can occur, in order to keep the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of cells relatively small for performance considerations.\n&gt; Though \n&gt;&gt;&gt; this \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; value can be changed.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In order to keep the phenotype solid, not torn apart from\n&gt; internal \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; velocities, a mass-spring grid mesh is created in the egg\n&gt; before \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development. Cell divisions update the mesh. The mass-spring\n&gt; mesh \n&gt;&gt;&gt; plus \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the cell-to-cell overlapping prevention forces act together as\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenotype increases in size and number of cells. Eventually it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; become more stiff, where large group of recently divided cells\n&gt; are \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; packed together. I don&#39;t know if that is a bug or a feature :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is one insight I had after seeing the results. Watching\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; mesh \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; develops, and some with interesting shapes and configurations,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; makes \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me think this approach is very well suited to evolve HyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; substrates as well. In fact I am about to add brains to these\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; creatures right this evening :) But I don&#39;t know, if the links\n&gt;&gt;&gt; should \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be determined from the beginning right in the egg or after\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; development. Any suggestions?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is it. I hope this may be some advance into the\n&gt; field. I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will be happy to see any thoughts about this stuff. I&#39;ll post\n&gt; an \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; executable compiled with VS2008 in the files section now, so\n&gt; you \n&gt;&gt;&gt; will \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see it in action. Note however, that it is just a demo of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; development, \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not evolution. There is no doubt that this thing combined with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; NEAT \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will make at least something very very cool. :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
