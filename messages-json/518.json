A standard NEAT \n&gt; might be both smaller and more efficient if it new nothing about \n&gt; trains. It would be confident about how to deal with boulders and \n&gt; trenches that don&#39;t move. The conventional controller would keep track \n&gt; of remembering where to go.\n&gt; So in the particular example, the NEAT is doing a good job interacting \n&gt; with the conventional controller and avoiding the bolders and \n&gt; skillfully manuevering the ditches the conventional controller knows \n&gt; nothing about, when all of a sudden, the LSTM becomes very confident \n&gt; that death is a DARPA locomotive, and now would be a good time to \n&gt; stop. So the LSTM confidence output goes from low to high very \n&gt; quickly, drowning the output of the NEAT. The result is most likely to \n&gt; stop the robot right away.\n&gt; This would work on the idea that the LSTM doesn&#39;t know where the robot \n&gt; is going or how to avoid drowning in a river, the NEAT doesn&#39;t know \n&gt; anything about trains, and can&#39;t remember where it&#39;s going, and the \n&gt; conventional controller can use a GPS and ethernet, but doesn&#39;t know \n&gt; what trains and ditches are.\n&gt; Any of that make sense?\n&gt;\nHi Chad,\n\nYes I think I understand. I would tend to think of the technique you \ndescribe as being a further level of task decomposition. I described \nbraking the goal task into layers, high to low. I think the technique \nyou describe would fit in nicely by taking a sub-task at a specific \nlayer and braking it down further. Would you agree?\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
