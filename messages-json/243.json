I was referring to the\n&gt; phenomenon of gender, whereby the population of one\n&gt; species is divided into two groups, and mating can\n&gt; only be with an individual from the other group. \n&gt; Also, each individual carries a pair of homologous\n&gt; chromosomes, one of which came from the father and the\n&gt; other from the mother.  The phenotype depends on both\n&gt; chromosomes in a complicated way. (And of course there\n&gt; are multiple pairs of chromosomes in most species.)\n\nIt is a good idea to define terminology fairly precisely, since the \nGA literature borrows from biology, but there isn&#39;t always a nice \nconceptual fit.\n\nI was referring to sexual reproduction as a mode of reproduction \nthat requires two parents whose offspring are genetically composed \nof traits from both parents.\n\nThe most important distinction I&#39;d make between a sexual model and \nan asexual one is that the first model employs both mutation and \ncrossover, while the second uses only mutation as the primary means \nfor traversing a given search space.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t put the constraints of dimorphism or gender-distinct \norgans on the definition of sexual reproduction, and I&#39;m not sure \nmost biologists would either.  In fact, yeast and algae reproduce \nboth asexually and sexually, do they not?  And not all sexually-\nreproducing organisms do so under the conditions you outline above, \nsuch as polyploidy. \n\n&gt; NEAT doesn&#39;t model any of that, or did I miss that in\n&gt; my reading?  \n\nNEAT does model the production of offspring from two parents, \ncomprising traits inherited from both.  Topology is dominant based \non fitness, and crossover occurs in matching genes.  I think this \nmodel is much more accurately described as sexual than as asexual \n(which I would be more likely to ascribe to GAs in which offspring \nare cloned from the fittest, then simply mutated to some degree).  \nWouldn&#39;t you agree?\n\nDerek \n\n\n"}}
