I have\nread all your work regarding NEAT which I think it is really neat and\nwas really keen to use your idea for game of Hex as oppose to Go with\nroving eye. But I will try using roving eye directly for 12 by 12 board\ninstead of starting with small board.\n\nThanks once more for your kind help and if you have any other\nsuggestions for my work, it will be highly appreciated specially coming\nfrom a man like you.\n\n\nRamin\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; kstanley@... 02/16/06 2:37 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ramin Lessani&quot; &lt;kcy42rl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; I want to buid an nnPlayer to play a board game.

It&#39;s at:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04\n\nThat might give you some general ideas.  Derek and Philip can probably \nhelp with specifics on getting started with ANJI, where they have a \nlot of experience with e.g. Tic Tac Toe.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
