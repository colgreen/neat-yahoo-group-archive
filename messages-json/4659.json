Perhaps it is indeed the geometry that co=\r\nuld be improved or the domain may also simply not be complicated enough to =\r\nrequire an indirect encoding to do well.  However, have you seen this inter=\r\nesting application from the Computational Intelligence Group at the Czech t=\r\nechnical University in Prague of HyperNEAT to driving in traffic:\n\nhttp://w=\r\nww.youtube.com/watch?v=3DlmPJeKRs8gE\n\nThey show briefly (at 0:07) how they =\r\norganize the sensor geometry.  They discretize each rangefinder into severa=\r\nl discrete bits.  Apparently, this geometry was enough for the cars to come=\r\n up on their own with the idea of driving on one side of the road, which is=\r\n a pretty nice result.  However, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;d win a r=\r\nace.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken\n&gt; \n&gt; I had done an experiment in conjuction with the Torc=\r\ns competition that Julian Togelius et al are running.  The results were not=\r\n that encouraging when compared with a standard NEAT experiment (maybe I ne=\r\ned to sort out the geometry, though given the recent paper by Jeff, any geo=\r\nmetry should work better than standard NEAT).  I implemented David B. D&#39;Amb=\r\nrosio&#39;s Food Finder experiment and that worked just fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know you u=\r\nsed this experiment in your alife 09 paper and I have one question regardin=\r\ng the fitness function of this experiment.  First, the algorithms are sligh=\r\ntly different - could be typos or could be just different.  However, in bot=\r\nh, they seem to reward (increasing fitness) bots that take longer with the =\r\n(Ttot * 1000r) or (Ttot / 1000r) terms of yours and David&#39;s experiments. Th=\r\nis seems at odds with the goal.  I have implemented (1000r / Ttot) which af=\r\nter all food is found rewards quicker bots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I have missed someth=\r\ning or misunderstood.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Matt, what kind of experime=\r\nnt is implemented in your hyperneat?
