The growing disruptive impact of construction operators as the size of =\r\nthe construction plan increases, seemly undercuts the benefit of compact na=\r\nture of the approach, and also illustrates a fundamental strength and weakn=\r\ness of NEAT. NEAT, starting from minimal size, mitigates the disruptive nat=\r\nure of various operators at the beginning allowing for more effective use o=\r\nf computational resources for growing of the organism in a profitable porti=\r\non of the design space. But as organism size increases, the growing disrupt=\r\nive impact of some operators, and where they are applied, increasingly bog =\r\ndown further progress.\nIn the context of BlindBuilder, two examples are use=\r\nful:\n1) Bridge: The concept of a bridge is simple and straight forward. Fro=\r\nm a construction perspective, could be achieved with a single element of ap=\r\npropriate size and orientation. While the size of the construction plan is =\r\nvastly different based upon the characteristics of the formative elements, =\r\nthough the concept is still simple, the disruptive impact of various operat=\r\nors on form, fit, function and convergence is also vastly different.\n2) Wal=\r\nl: Also, the concept of a wall is simple and straight forward. And again fr=\r\nom a construction perspective, could be achieved with a single element of a=\r\nppropriate size and orientation. The same comments also apply regarding con=\r\nstruction plan size and associated disruptive impact of construction operat=\r\nors.\nThe point being, that the sensitivity of the concept should not be sub=\r\nject to the scale of the formative elements, but rather the suitability of =\r\nthe formulation to the objectives of the concept. In the construction conte=\r\nxt, this is more straight forward. The overall objective is composed of a r=\r\nelatively few well known concepts taken together in some relative orientati=\r\nons WRT each other (i.e. a house can be composed of four orthogonal walls a=\r\nnd a roof). The construction operators should be confined to refinement of =\r\nsuitability of the formative elements and their orientations taken together=\r\n WRT the individual concept, guided by concept specific operator selection =\r\ncriteria (i.e. semi-separable multi-subobjectives).\nOf course, in the gener=\r\nal case, the identification of concepts is not as straight forward. But eff=\r\norts to identify reusable genetic material snippets would most likely quali=\r\nfy as identification of concepts, and would thus likely benefit from: a) pa=\r\nrtitioning of the genome for application of operators, and b) application o=\r\nf concept specific operator selection WRT concept suitability for the curre=\r\nnt overall objective.\n\nAndy\n\n\n \r\n---655678339-1117704007-1321919759=:19450\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi,&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;Agree, BlindBuilder is a nice case of &quot;compact encod=\r\ning does not means good encoding&quot;, for the reasons you mentionned.
