In last year&#39;s competition, which used a simpler racing game,\ncontrollers based on NEAT scored well but were overtaken by other\ncontrollers based on e.g. genetic programming and fuzzy logic. This\nyear we&#39;re using a more complex racing game, and learning a really\nwell-performing controller will likely prove to be quite challenging;\nstill, we&#39;ve worked hard to make it as easy as possible to enter the\ncompetition.\n\nhttp://cig.dei.polimi.it/?page_id=5\n\nWe&#39;ve been off to a slow start this year thanks to an unexpected\nnumber of technical problems, but with some assistance from Matt\nSimmerson all the bugs seem to have been squashed in the current\nrelease of the competition software.\n\nJulian\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
