E.g. We can make solar cells that\nare more efficient than photosynthesis, in fact in the lab we can make\n*very* efficient cells, but cells which are not commercially viable.\nSo on the simple efficiency metric nature loses. And yet globally\nphotosynthesis is the dominant form of solar energy capture (I&#39;m\nactually just guessing here, but I think I&#39;m on pretty safe ground :),\nso nature wins on that metric. The reason being that nature wins on\nthe large scale economics metric - it can make its solar cell\nequivalents insanely cheaply from stuff that is just lying around\n(dirt, water, etc.), no human labour and no expensive manufacturing\nfacilities.\n\nI suspect this same line of thinking can be applied to many of the\ndomains discussed. The naive view of scientific innovation is that\nsomeone figures out how do something and that becomes a game changer -\nwhereas in reality the economic factors of how do you manufacture\nproduct X or offer service Y are the biggest barriers to success. This\ncertainly applies to medicine (e.g. cancer treatment) where we now\nhave very costly drugs and health care systems having to draw the line\nsomewhere due to money constraints. Just because you can solve some\nproblem for a specific case in a lab doesn&#39;t mean you can solve it\ngenerally. Nature does pretty well on the economics front, mainly\nbecause it widely utilises cheap nanoscale engineering.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
