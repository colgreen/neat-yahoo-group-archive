A discrete grid. A shape was just a bitmap on a\n&gt; smallish grid (about 8x8)\n&gt; and the viewing window was a 3x3 + shape. \n\nSo your network had 9 inputs?  And an output for each\ntype of shape to be identified?\n\nI was wondering if you did a comparison with networks\nthat looked at the entire grid at once (i.e. with 64\ninputs).\n\n&gt; However, this\n&gt; produced a form of network memory which Kenneth\n&gt; seemed quite interested in,\n&gt; where long strings of nodes would form a kind of\n&gt; short-term memory rather\n&gt; than loops.\n\nI don&#39;t quite understand what you mean here.
