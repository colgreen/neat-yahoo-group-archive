In other words, the input is passed through the =\r\nsigmoid before anything else. \n\nDo most of you (either in NEAT or HyperNEAT=\r\n) pass your inputs through functions immediately? If so, why? \n\nI tend to t=\r\nhink of the raw inputs as similar to the output of a node, not as an input =\r\nto the function of a node. It makes more sense to me to leave the inputs in=\r\n their raw form, and let evolution decide to connect to the raw input, or p=\r\nre-process it in some way before using it. \n\nThe sigmoids in the C++ HyperN=\r\nEAT are actually quite linear in the [-1, 1] range of inputs, so I doubt th=\r\ne use of the sigmoid has a large effect in my experiments, but I was curiou=\r\ns if there was any benefit of passing inputs through a node/function that I=\r\n was not thinking of. \n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nVisiting Scientist\nCornel=\r\nl University\njeffclune@...\njeffclune.com\n\n\n"}}
