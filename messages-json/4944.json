It is defined in=\r\n the params.txt with that line:\n\nSubstrateActivationFunction Sine\n\nIf there=\r\n&#39;s no hard coded usage of any sigmoid activation function, then the constru=\r\nctor should be correct.\n\nHowever, it doesn&#39;t work. The input is exactly the=\r\n same, the output completely different.\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; David is prob=\r\nably best placed to answer this one, but I was just\n&gt; wondering if the acti=\r\nvation function being passed in the Substrate\n&gt; constructor is correct. Nor=\r\nmally I think it would be one of the\n&gt; sigmoid activation functions; as a s=\r\nine function is normally used in\n&gt; the underlying CPPN/genome. Apart from t=\r\nhat method 3 looks about\n&gt; right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
