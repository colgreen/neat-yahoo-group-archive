The ability of HyperNEAT to =\r\nevolve the placement and density of nodes on the substrate has long been de=\r\nsired by HyperNEAT users and researchers, and we are hoping with these reso=\r\nurces to make it easier to incorporate such a capability into the algorithm=\r\n.\n\nThe new ES-HyperNEAT Users Page is at \n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/ESHyperN=\r\nEAT/ \n\nand includes an overview of the algorithm, answers to frequent quest=\r\nions, and links to papers and software (including ES-HyperNEAT source code =\r\nthat is now available in C#).  \n\nA complete, comprehensive introduction to =\r\nthe method with several experiments is also now available in our new journa=\r\nl article, &quot;An Enhanced Hypercube-Based Encoding for Evolving the Placement=\r\n, Density and Connectivity of Neurons,&quot; to appear in Artficial Life journal=\r\n.  The manuscript is at:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_alife12.pdf\n\n=\r\nFinally, we are also happy to announce our forthcoming IJCNN paper, &quot;A Unif=\r\nied Approach to Evolving Plasticity and Neural Geometry,&quot; which combines ES=\r\n-HyperNEAT with adaptive HyperNEAT to produce a system that can evolve the =\r\ngeometry, placement, density, and plasticity of an adaptive neural network:=\r\n\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_ijcnn12.pdf\n\nThis work aims to move o=\r\nne step closer to evolving more brain-like structures.  \n\nWe are happy of c=\r\nourse to answer any questions as well.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
