Depending on\nthe search strategy of the eye, it may output high confidence if it\nviews the similar region first, and so a single thresholded affinity\noutput may lead to more errors.\n\nI don&#39;t know.  But we were thinking about how people compare images,\nand their confidence usually fluctuates if they&#39;re looking at two\nsimiliar images, though their confidence in making a match is usually\na function of how long they study them.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
