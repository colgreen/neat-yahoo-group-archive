Also the\n&gt; speciation in standard\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see how crossover can contribute to bloat,\n&gt; though.  A child\n&gt; is, structurally, a clone of the dominant parent\n&gt; (i.e., the parent\n&gt; with highest fitness).  Crossover only occurs in the\n&gt; weights of\n&gt; connections shared by both parents.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the way we implemented it in ANJI, anyway. \n&gt; Have others done\n&gt; differently, where the child contains a union of\n&gt; parent genes?\n\nI think in Ken&#39;s original, unmatched genes from either\nparent are taken into the child, but a separate case\nis made where the range of genes in one parent extends\nbeyond the range in the other (e.g. where an\ninnovation number &gt; than the max innovation in the\nother), and I think those are taken only from the\ndominant parent.\n\nIn my case I currently take all unmatched genes.  This\nis partly because I wasn&#39;t sure I liked Ken&#39;s reasons\nfor his scheme, partly because my innovation numbers\nare more complex, and partly just because I didn&#39;t get\naround to trying anything else yet.\n\nI have tried to get my head around how crossover\ninfluences bloat and I find it resists easy analysis.\n\nClearly without crossover, the equilibrium situation\nis where:\n\ninsertion_prob = deletion_prob * num_genes\n\n(e.g. assuming that deletion is a separate chance for\neach gene, the most ration scheme to my mind).\n\nBut crossover changes that, by forming unions of pairs\nof individuals.  I&#39;m wondering whether, vis-a-vis my\n&quot;assymetric parentage&quot; discussion in the other thread,\na 50% chance of keeping an unmatched gene is the\ncorrect approach...\n\nIan\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
