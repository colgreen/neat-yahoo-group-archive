This research has some of the same goals as Ken&#39;s CPPN  \nwork, but the approach is quite different. Using a very simple  \n&quot;indirect&quot; encoding of neural network weights that has some of the  \nfeatures found in GRNs in biology, we show (empirically) that both  \nthe final performance and sample complexity of NeuroEvolution can be  \nimproved in a coevolutionary setting.\n\nBut the story gets even better: Making random mutations to the  \nchampions that result from the GRN-like encoding, we find that  \nperformance degrades much more slowly than when the same number of  \nmutations are made to NEAT-encoded networks. Furthermore, if we plot  \nthis fitness degradation against network distance instead of mutation  \ndistance, we find that each mutation is having a vastly larger  \nphenotypic effect on the GRN-encoded neural nets. In other words  \nperformance is decreasing /less/ even when we make /larger/ changes  \nto the network topology and weights. This kind of artifact is exactly  \nwhat we&#39;d like to see in so-called &quot;evolvable&quot; encodings: The  \nrepresentation has learned to bias the effects of mutation towards  \nbetter networks\n\nAnyway, this work is definitely still only a first step, but I find  \nit very exciting. My paper is even going up against Ken&#39;s CPPN paper  \nfor the best paper award in the GDS track at GECCO. Wish me luck :)\n\nIf you are at all interested, you should definitely take a look:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco07\n\n-- Joe\n\n"}}
