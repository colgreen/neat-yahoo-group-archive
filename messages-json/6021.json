I believe=\r\n we have reached the\npoint at which reasonable minds can respectably disagr=\r\nee, as you put it.\nWere I to respond, I believe I would mostly repeat mysel=\r\nf as the ideas I\nbelieve answer your comments and questions I&#39;ve already ex=\r\npressed earlier in\nthis thread. That usually is an indication of coming to =\r\nan agreement, even\nif the agreement is to disagree. :-) \n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I&#39;=\r\nll summarize my main points: I do think nature has default\nfitness penaltie=\r\ns, and all we have done is change the default to one that\nencourages modula=\r\nrity and evolvability. As such, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re subject\nto general atta=\r\ncks on fitness pressures, because by default there are\nfitness pressures (e=\r\n.g. a cost for materials), we just change them to be\nbetter with respect to=\r\n modularity and evolvability. Moreover, I think a\nconnection cost encourage=\r\ns modularity in a way similar to how things work in\nnature, even if nature =\r\nmore resembles a combination of performance and costs\ninto a single objecti=\r\nve instead of multi-objective algorithms. Our work is\nnot dependent on an M=\r\nOEA: we suspect a connection cost will encourage\nmodularity in general irre=\r\nspective of the details of the algorithm. As I&#39;ve\nmentioned, I think nuance=\r\n and subtlety are possible with a connection cost\nbecause nature can pay fo=\r\nr more connectivity via performance gains, allowing\nall sorts of exceptions=\r\n to the general rule. I still don&#39;t see how an\ninitial encoding bias will h=\r\nave any long-term effect on evolution, so the\nonly hope for canalization an=\r\nd helpful encoding biases is via fitness. I\nthus believe that fitness penal=\r\nties are a great way to encourage good\nencodings via canalization. For exam=\r\nple, we know that default penalties\nexist (such as a default tendency to NO=\r\nT produce modularity, which has been\nempirically observed in our systems re=\r\npeatedly), and nature will not explore\nthose areas unless the fitness funct=\r\nion is changed (just as nature never\nexplored certain classes of extremely =\r\ninefficient metabolisms, or birds with\nbones made of lead). Ultimately, sin=\r\nce the effect of your initial encoding\nbias hint will vanish over millennia=\r\n, your argument amounts to saying that\nwe should not try to bias evolution =\r\nat all. But this whole conversation was\non the best way to bias evolution, =\r\nso maybe your position is that we\nshouldn&#39;t be biasing evolution at all. Th=\r\nat&#39;s fine if we don&#39;t have any\ndefault fitness penalties in the environment=\r\n that will hurt us, but we have\nno guarantee of that. As you point out, Nat=\r\nure has done impressive things,\nbut it also had a very different environmen=\r\nt than the environment in our\nsetups so far. What we&#39;ve shown in this paper=\r\n is that some things that we\noriginally thought just happened to exist in n=\r\nature, but were unnecessary\nvis a vis evolvability (such as a cost for mate=\r\nrials) actually may play a\nrole in the evolution of modularity and evolvabi=\r\nlity. I think it is\nworthwhile to investigate what else we may have skipped=\r\n from the natural\nworld that may be an important driver of evolvability and=\r\n, ultimately,\nopen-ended evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; A final point: your criticism that=\r\n &#39;nothing we learn matters if we don&#39;t\nhave an open-ended algorithm&#39; discou=\r\nnts all the work that has been done to\ndate in computational evolutionary b=\r\niology, not just our paper. You may be\nright that all of our lessons are wo=\r\nrthless once we figure out an open-ended\nevolutionary algorithm, but I doub=\r\nt that will be the case. I think a lot of\ninteresting, worthwhile understan=\r\ndings have been gained by simulated\nevolution, and that much of that work w=\r\nill prove informative even if the\nunderlying algorithms change. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Assistant Professor\n&gt; Computer Science\n&gt; Univ=\r\nersity of Wyoming\n&gt; jeffclune@...\n&gt; jeffclune.com\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mar 2, 2013, at 4=\r\n:16 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff, Stef, and Marti=\r\nn, I hope you don&#39;t mind since all of you\naddressed me if I try to reply to=\r\n all of you at once to keep the thread (and\nmy brain) from branching in thr=\r\nee directions. Many of your points follow a\nsimilar theme so I think it mak=\r\nes sense to respond collectively. This\nresponse is practically an article, =\r\nbut oh well, it&#39;s nice to get the ideas\ndown even if it&#39;s a bit too long (i=\r\nt just shows you are asking me great\nquestions that are challenging).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Martin offers a good unifying question: &quot;My question to Ken would be\nhe=\r\nre: what is the additional ingredient that makes a\n&gt; &gt; bias in the encoding=\r\n better / more plausible than *any* implementation\nof the bias in the fitne=\r\nss function?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After some thought, I believe one of the difficultie=\r\ns in this discussion\nis that we often conflate artificial EC-style fitness-=\r\nbased experiments with\nopen-ended scenarios when these are entirely differe=\r\nnt situations (I take\nblame myself as well for this tendency). That is, whe=\r\nn we talk about\nsomething being &quot;better&quot; or &quot;solving&quot; a problem, we are oft=\r\nen talking about\nartificial and unnatural experimental setups that have lit=\r\ntle relationship\nto open-ended evolutionary scenarios like nature. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Why does that matter? It matters because in discussions that try to\ndovet=\r\nail engineering-oriented mechanisms (like a connectivity penalty) with\nexpl=\r\nanations of what happened in nature (such as the emergence of modular\nconne=\r\nctivity), it cannot simply be ignored that nature in fact is first and\nfore=\r\nmost an open-ended evolutionary system, and that that open-ended dynamic\nis=\r\n a significant factor in the explanation of its products. What that means\nt=\r\no me is that if you think your proposed mechanism actually *explains*\nsomet=\r\nhing that happened in nature, then it is essential that the explanation\nspe=\r\naks to the question of how the particular mechanism you are advancing\ncombi=\r\nned historically with the open-ended evolutionary dynamics in nature to\npro=\r\nduce the result you expect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But because we conflate very closed-en=\r\nded artificial scenarios with\nmonumentally open-ended searches like nature,=\r\n it leads to a lot of dangerous\ninferences. So ideas that would make sense =\r\nin one context end up sounding\nreasonable when they don&#39;t really make any s=\r\nense in the other context. The\ndifficulty of squaring fitness-pressure obje=\r\nctives with nature is more\nserious when you consider it in this perspective=\r\n. (Note that I am defining\n&quot;fitness pressure&quot; as selection based on relativ=\r\ne performance to other\norganisms on a measure of some property that varies =\r\nover a range of possible\nvalues, such as degree of connectivity.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe problem is that fitness pressures that preserve a degenerate niche\nfor =\r\neternity are definitively not like nature, so whether they work or not,\nor =\r\nwhether I am somehow indicting them or not, should not be the issue. The\nis=\r\nsue should be that we should be worried that nature does not use a\nmechanis=\r\nm even remotely like that yet still achieves the &quot;same&quot; result (i.e.\nbeauti=\r\nful variations of pseudo-modular design). If you are advancing the\nhypothes=\r\nis that this kind of constant &quot;pressure&quot; is somehow essential to the\nemerge=\r\nnce of modularity in nature, then you must somehow explain why you\nneeded t=\r\no use a setup with these bizarre and unnatural side effects (like\neternal d=\r\negenerate niches) instead of whatever nature actually supposedly\ndoes use.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And the fact that you cannot come up with anything similar to what=\r\n\nnature does, i.e. something that does not involve creating such a deadweig=\r\nht\npocket, reasonably may suggest that your hypothesis about nature could b=\r\ne\nwrong. That is, it may not be this endless &quot;fitness pressure&quot; after all t=\r\nhat\nexplains what is happening there, because fitness pressure in general i=\r\nn EC\nis almost always creating some kind of unintended deadweight niche.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it is particularly fascinating that in fact nature obtains n=\r\not\nreally the same result, but a far more awesome result (in terms of\nmodul=\r\narity or anything else), without such an ad hoc mechanism. \n&gt; &gt; If you thin=\r\nk about it, as long as you insist on cheering for fitness\npressure, it prev=\r\nents you from asking how this could be - how is it possible\nthat you can ge=\r\nt these kinds of results without such an unnatural side\neffect?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nneed to emphasize here the difference between being a better\nengineering me=\r\nchanism and a better explanation. I am focusing now primarily\non the explan=\r\natory power of the proposed mechanism. But because nature is so\nmuch more a=\r\nccomplished than anything artificial, the explanatory gap here\nimplies a da=\r\nngerous potential to overlook what will ultimately amount also\nto a major e=\r\nngineering gap as well. There is no evidence that anything\nexcept nature in=\r\n its open-ended way can create anything like the\nconnectivity of natural br=\r\nains.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, it is always important to acknowledge nuance an=\r\nd subtlety\nin nature, which has not really been acknowledged yet in this co=\r\nnversation.\nNature is almost never all one way. So it is misleading and pot=\r\nentially\nconfusing to talk about brains as simply modular or not. The recen=\r\nt\ndiscussion on the Connectionists list, where scientists have been giving =\r\nall\nkinds of subtle and conflicting perspectives on modularity in natural b=\r\nrains\nin response to Jeff and JBM&#39;s article, echoes this nuance. The beauty=\r\n of the\nhuman brain to me is not that it is modular, but that it is modular=\r\n to an\nextent, but not entirely so, and what modularity there is is hard to=\r\n pin\ndown. This kind of nuance is not to me a mere footnote to the achievem=\r\nent of\nnature, but the central point of it: what nature achieves in spades =\r\nis\nnuance. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And the idea of a constant pressure of any kind is dir=\r\nectly in conflict\nwith the achievement of nuance, because nuance is a delic=\r\nate balancing act\nthat is easily tipped off its perch if constant pressure =\r\nin *any* direction\nis applied without relief. Jeff is concerned with short-=\r\nterm versus\nlong-term issues (which isn&#39;t really as clearly defined in an o=\r\npen-ended\ncontext), but even if we honor that concern, it is potentially na=\r\n=EFve to\nbelieve that pressure in either direction from the start, or even =\r\nan\nencoding bias in either direction from the start, is somehow going to\ndi=\r\nrectly align with the level of nuance observed millions of years in the\nfut=\r\nure. However, while fitness pressure is eternal, encoding bias is\nmalleable=\r\n, so pushing in the &quot;right&quot; direction from the start is not\nessential for e=\r\nncoding. It&#39;s more like a hint to get you started, whereas\nfitness pressure=\r\n is more like a gun forever pointed at your back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, who=\r\n is to say that we should not have the opposite\nshort-term worry as Jeff do=\r\nes =96 he worries that an encoding bias towards low\nconnectivity &quot;might evo=\r\nlve away because of fitness pressure,&quot; but can&#39;t we\njust as easily worry ab=\r\nout *too much* modularity? In that case, Jeff&#39;s evil\ntwin &quot;opposite-Jeff&quot; m=\r\night be worried that an initial encoding bias towards\n*high* connectivity m=\r\night evolve away. It is not clear nor established fact\n(see Connectionists)=\r\n that the exact form of the final &quot;solution&quot; is\nparticularly modular or non=\r\n-modular. What it is, is subtle and somewhere in\nthe middle. So none of thi=\r\ns kind of panicking about what nature &quot;needs&quot; to\nharass it into such an ast=\r\nronomically complex future configuration makes\nmuch sense. We cannot say de=\r\nfinitively the extent to which the final\nstructure is &quot;closer&quot; to modular o=\r\nr non-modular, whatever that even means.\nFortunately, an encoding that begi=\r\nns with a bias towards modularity can tone\nit down as needed, or ramp it up=\r\n even more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet Jeff also worries about about the radiation of evo=\r\nlutionary lineages\nbeing blocked because of implicit penalties: He says, &quot;Y=\r\nou assume that\nevolution will branch out and explore all these options even=\r\n in the face of\nfitness penalties for that exploration. But that is not how=\r\n evolution\nworks.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But branching out and exploring many (not neces=\r\nsarily all of course) of\nthe options is the only way that natural evolution=\r\n works. That&#39;s what\nopen-endedness is (unless you don&#39;t believe natural evo=\r\nlution to be\nopen-ended). The tree of life is ever-branching. The worry abo=\r\nut &quot;fitness\npenalties&quot; here is a red herring because it originates from clo=\r\nsed-ended\nartificial EC experiments where you can end up on the wrong path.=\r\n But nature\ndoes not have any single &quot;fitness penalty&quot; or &quot;right path&quot; thro=\r\nughout its\nrun because the landscape is always changing as it branches and =\r\nbranches.\nFor example, before trees, being an extremely tall herbivore woul=\r\nd incur a\nfitness penalty, but after trees giraffes were perfectly viable. =\r\nThe penalty\nis not consistent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More generally, how can there be wh=\r\nat you call a &quot;default fitness\npenalty&quot; if there is no final goal? Penalty =\r\nwith respect to what? Keep in\nmind here that the origin of pseudo-modular o=\r\nrganization in nature likely\npredates the emergence even of neurons. The fi=\r\nrst neural structures\npiggy-backed on previously evolved organizational str=\r\nucture that likely\ninfluenced the subtle pseudo-modularity of connectivity =\r\nfrom the start for\nreasons entirely unrelated to connection cost because th=\r\nese organizational\nconventions evolved long before neurons even existed: th=\r\ne bias in the\nencoding was in part already there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Which brings me =\r\nback to the origin of all such conventions -\ncanalization - which is the ke=\r\ny here. Stephane talks about a bias that\nexists &quot;all along&quot; in evolution, b=\r\nut ultimately the ability to *change* bias\neclipses choosing one up front. =\r\nAgain, in the context of artificial\nscenarios, it&#39;s a good engineering hack=\r\n to force in some kind of bias into\nthe encoding or into fitness that you e=\r\nxpect to control things for a\nmoderate number of generations. But in nature=\r\n the scope is so vast that it\ncan&#39;t be the final word; it&#39;s only the initia=\r\nl hint. While that hint can\nhelp, nature in the long term needs to choose a=\r\nnd commit to its own biases,\nand to slither out of them from time to time, =\r\nand only encoding offers that\npotential. Canalization is the way nature can=\r\n make long-term (though not\nnecessarily permanent) commitments. It&#39;s how co=\r\nnventions are established in\nspecific lineages.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a genuine open-=\r\nended scenario like nature, modularity will emerge and\nproliferate over vas=\r\nt stretches of time only if modularity leads to more\nspecies emerging. Of c=\r\nourse, the species we observe at the end are the\nconsequence of organizatio=\r\nnal principles that supported generating many\nspecies (which is almost taut=\r\nological). So it need not relate to being\nbetter or worse, or &quot;solving&quot; any=\r\nthing. It has to do with open-ended\ndynamics. Air will escape a hole in a b=\r\nalloon if you wait long enough. If\nthat hole leads to a whole other world, =\r\nyou will eventually see that other\nworld. Modularity, to the extent it actu=\r\nally exists in nature, has served as\nsuch a hole. But the only way such a h=\r\nole can be exploited, the only way you\ncan keep focused on that area, is if=\r\n it can be canalized. An encoding that\ncan be canalized allows you to maint=\r\nain the subtle convention that is\nresponsible for spreading diversity. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Stef nevertheless reminds me that &quot;selection pressure has strong\nimpa=\r\nct,&quot; and I entirely agree of course. But there are two very different\nclass=\r\nes of selection pressure. One is about pushing you towards the new, and\nthe=\r\n other is about forcing you to commit to the old. There are many ways to\npu=\r\nsh towards the new, and novelty search is just one. In contrast, these\nthin=\r\ngs we call &quot;fitness pressures&quot; (whether part of a MOEA or not) are the\noppo=\r\nsite =96 they are toxic strait jackets applied for eternity. They presume\nt=\r\nhat we know what we need with no nuance whatsoever eons before anything\nrem=\r\notely related has appeared. Again, in engineering, fair enough =96 it can\nw=\r\nork. But it is not an *explanation* of the products of open-ended evolution=\r\n\nin nature, and likely is not a good way to produce open-endedness\nartifici=\r\nally either. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the only escape I see here from my argument is if=\r\n you can argue\nsomehow that you can do all these amazing things *without* o=\r\npen-ended\nevolution. Then all your pressures and constraints might make sen=\r\nse. But I\ndon&#39;t think you can argue that, which, to finally circle back to =\r\nMartin&#39;s\nbroad question, is why encoding is ultimately superior. A canalize=\r\nable\nencoding is the perfect partner for an open-ended process. But it is n=\r\not (as\nMartin puts it) because it makes a particular &quot;bias in the encoding =\r\nbetter.&quot;\nRather, it is because encoding lets evolution delicately modify it=\r\ns own\nbiases on the fly and explore all of them in parallel. That is, the a=\r\nbility\nto change, the ability to flexible, to commit but to uncommit in inc=\r\nrements\nof subtlety, to radiate diversity while still committing to certain=\r\n biases\nin certain chains, is the power that made everything happen. Any fo=\r\nrced\ncompetition, any constant bias, any eternal relative judgment, which a=\r\nre all\nthings that constant fitness pressure offers, will diminish that\nfle=\r\nxibility. It will not necessarily destroy the open-ended process, but it\nwi=\r\nll reduce its power and ultimately therefore cannot explain or account for\n=\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailt=\r\no:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; ,\n&quot;martin_pyka&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just would l=\r\nike to point out that, in my opinion, part of the\ndisagreement between you =\r\nand Jeff and Ken comes from the fact that Ken\nsomehow made the statement &quot;i=\r\nt is better to implement the bias in the\nencoding than in the fitness funct=\r\nion&quot; but in actual fact argues for a\nspecific type of implementation in the=\r\n encoding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I thing the discussion should not center arou=\r\nnd the general\nquestion whether a bias should be incorporated in the fitnes=\r\ns or in the\nencoding because in both areas there are better and worse ways =\r\nto do it.

In my reply to Stef I made a few general last points and I think we=\r\n can safely assume we will have some very interesting further discussions a=\r\nt GECCO!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ken&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jc=\r\nlune@...&quot;&gt;jclune@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks for clarifying y=\r\nour positions Ken. I believe we have reached the point at which reasonable =\r\nminds can respectably disagree, as you put it. Were I to respond, I believe=\r\n I would mostly repeat myself as the ideas I believe answer your comments a=\r\nnd questions I&#39;ve already expressed earlier in this thread. That usually is=\r\n an indication of coming to an agreement, even if the agreement is to disag=\r\nree. :-) &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; That said, I&#39;ll summarize my main points: I do t=\r\nhink nature has default fitness penalties, and all we have done is change t=\r\nhe default to one that encourages modularity and evolvability. As such, I d=\r\non&#39;t think we&#39;re subject to general attacks on fitness pressures, because b=\r\ny default there are fitness pressures (e.g. a cost for materials), we just =\r\nchange them to be better with respect to modularity and evolvability. Moreo=\r\nver, I think a connection cost encourages modularity in a way similar to ho=\r\nw things work in nature, even if nature more resembles a combination of per=\r\nformance and costs into a single objective instead of multi-objective algor=\r\nithms. Our work is not dependent on an MOEA: we suspect a connection cost w=\r\nill encourage modularity in general irrespective of the details of the algo=\r\nrithm. As I&#39;ve mentioned, I think nuance and subtlety are possible with a c=\r\nonnection cost because nature can pay for more connectivity via performance=\r\n gains, allowing all sorts of exceptions to the general rule. I still don&#39;t=\r\n see how an initial encoding bias will have any long-term effect on evoluti=\r\non, so the only hope for canalization and helpful encoding biases is via fi=\r\ntness. I thus believe that fitness penalties are a great way to encourage g=\r\nood encodings via canalization. For example, we know that default penalties=\r\n exist (such as a default tendency to NOT produce modularity, which has bee=\r\nn empirically observed in our systems repeatedly), and nature will not expl=\r\nore those areas unless the fitness function is changed (just as nature neve=\r\nr explored certain classes of extremely inefficient metabolisms, or birds w=\r\nith bones made of lead). Ultimately, since the effect of your initial encod=\r\ning bias hint will vanish over millennia, your argument amounts to saying t=\r\nhat we should not try to bias evolution at all. But this whole conversation=\r\n was on the best way to bias evolution, so maybe your position is that we s=\r\nhouldn&#39;t be biasing evolution at all. That&#39;s fine if we don&#39;t have any defa=\r\nult fitness penalties in the environment that will hurt us, but we have no =\r\nguarantee of that. As you point out, Nature has done impressive things, but=\r\n it also had a very different environment than the environment in our setup=\r\ns so far. What we&#39;ve shown in this paper is that some things that we origin=\r\nally thought just happened to exist in nature, but were unnecessary vis a v=\r\nis evolvability (such as a cost for materials) actually may play a role in =\r\nthe evolution of modularity and evolvability. I think it is worthwhile to i=\r\nnvestigate what else we may have skipped from the natural world that may be=\r\n an important driver of evolvability and, ultimately, open-ended evolution.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; A final point: your criticism that &#39;nothing we learn matt=\r\ners if we don&#39;t have an open-ended algorithm&#39; discounts all the work that h=\r\nas been done to date in computational evolutionary biology, not just our pa=\r\nper. You may be right that all of our lessons are worthless once we figure =\r\nout an open-ended evolutionary algorithm, but I doubt that will be the case=\r\n. I think a lot of interesting, worthwhile understandings have been gained =\r\nby simulated evolution, and that much of that work will prove informative e=\r\nven if the underlying algorithms change. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Assistant Professor&lt;br&gt;&gt; Comp=\r\nuter Science&lt;br&gt;&gt; University of Wyoming&lt;br&gt;&gt; jeffclune@...&lt;br&gt;&gt; je=\r\nffclune.com&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; On Mar 2, 2013, at 4:16 PM, Ken &lt;&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:kstanley@...&quot;&gt;kstanley@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff, Stef, and Martin, I hope you don&#39;t mind s=\r\nince all of you addressed me if I try to reply to all of you at once to kee=\r\np the thread (and my brain) from branching in three directions. Many of you=\r\nr points follow a similar theme so I think it makes sense to respond collec=\r\ntively. This response is practically an article, but oh well, it&#39;s nice to =\r\nget the ideas down even if it&#39;s a bit too long (it just shows you are askin=\r\ng me great questions that are challenging).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mart=\r\nin offers a good unifying question: &quot;My question to Ken would be here:=\r\n what is the additional ingredient that makes a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; bias in the en=\r\ncoding better / more plausible than *any* implementation of the bias in the=\r\n fitness function?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; After some thought, I b=\r\nelieve one of the difficulties in this discussion is that we often conflate=\r\n artificial EC-style fitness-based experiments with open-ended scenarios wh=\r\nen these are entirely different situations (I take blame myself as well for=\r\n this tendency). That is, when we talk about something being &quot;better&q=\r\nuot; or &quot;solving&quot; a problem, we are often talking about artificia=\r\nl and unnatural experimental setups that have little relationship to open-e=\r\nnded evolutionary scenarios like nature. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Why do=\r\nes that matter? It matters because in discussions that try to dovetail engi=\r\nneering-oriented mechanisms (like a connectivity penalty) with explanations=\r\n of what happened in nature (such as the emergence of modular connectivity)=\r\n, it cannot simply be ignored that nature in fact is first and foremost an =\r\nopen-ended evolutionary system, and that that open-ended dynamic is a signi=\r\nficant factor in the explanation of its products. What that means to me is =\r\nthat if you think your proposed mechanism actually *explains* something tha=\r\nt happened in nature, then it is essential that the explanation speaks to t=\r\nhe question of how the particular mechanism you are advancing combined hist=\r\norically with the open-ended evolutionary dynamics in nature to produce the=\r\n result you expect.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; But because we conflate very=\r\n closed-ended artificial scenarios with monumentally open-ended searches li=\r\nke nature, it leads to a lot of dangerous inferences. So ideas that would m=\r\nake sense in one context end up sounding reasonable when they don&#39;t really =\r\nmake any sense in the other context. The difficulty of squaring fitness-pre=\r\nssure objectives with nature is more serious when you consider it in this p=\r\nerspective. (Note that I am defining &quot;fitness pressure&quot; as select=\r\nion based on relative performance to other organisms on a measure of some p=\r\nroperty that varies over a range of possible values, such as degree of conn=\r\nectivity.)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is that fitness pressures=\r\n that preserve a degenerate niche for eternity are definitively not like na=\r\nture, so whether they work or not, or whether I am somehow indicting them o=\r\nr not, should not be the issue. The issue should be that we should be worri=\r\ned that nature does not use a mechanism even remotely like that yet still a=\r\nchieves the &quot;same&quot; result (i.e. beautiful variations of pseudo-mo=\r\ndular design). If you are advancing the hypothesis that this kind of consta=\r\nnt &quot;pressure&quot; is somehow essential to the emergence of modularity=\r\n in nature, then you must somehow explain why you needed to use a setup wit=\r\nh these bizarre and unnatural side effects (like eternal degenerate niches)=\r\n instead of whatever nature actually supposedly does use.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; And the fact that you cannot come up with anything similar to wha=\r\nt nature does, i.e. something that does not involve creating such a deadwei=\r\nght pocket, reasonably may suggest that your hypothesis about nature could =\r\nbe wrong. That is, it may not be this endless &quot;fitness pressure&quot; =\r\nafter all that explains what is happening there, because fitness pressure i=\r\nn general in EC is almost always creating some kind of unintended deadweigh=\r\nt niche.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I think it is particularly fascinating =\r\nthat in fact nature obtains not really the same result, but a far more awes=\r\nome result (in terms of modularity or anything else), without such an ad ho=\r\nc mechanism. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If you think about it, as long as you insist on =\r\ncheering for fitness pressure, it prevents you from asking how this could b=\r\ne - how is it possible that you can get these kinds of results without such=\r\n an unnatural side effect?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I need to emphasize h=\r\nere the difference between being a better engineering mechanism and a bette=\r\nr explanation. I am focusing now primarily on the explanatory power of the =\r\nproposed mechanism. But because nature is so much more accomplished than an=\r\nything artificial, the explanatory gap here implies a dangerous potential t=\r\no overlook what will ultimately amount also to a major engineering gap as w=\r\nell. There is no evidence that anything except nature in its open-ended way=\r\n can create anything like the connectivity of natural brains.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Furthermore, it is always important to acknowledge nuance and=\r\n subtlety in nature, which has not really been acknowledged yet in this con=\r\nversation. Nature is almost never all one way. So it is misleading and pote=\r\nntially confusing to talk about brains as simply modular or not. The recent=\r\n discussion on the Connectionists list, where scientists have been giving a=\r\nll kinds of subtle and conflicting perspectives on modularity in natural br=\r\nains in response to Jeff and JBM&#39;s article, echoes this nuance. The beauty =\r\nof the human brain to me is not that it is modular, but that it is modular =\r\nto an extent, but not entirely so, and what modularity there is is hard to =\r\npin down. This kind of nuance is not to me a mere footnote to the achieveme=\r\nnt of nature, but the central point of it: what nature achieves in spades i=\r\ns nuance. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; And the idea of a constant pressure o=\r\nf any kind is directly in conflict with the achievement of nuance, because =\r\nnuance is a delicate balancing act that is easily tipped off its perch if c=\r\nonstant pressure in *any* direction is applied without relief. Jeff is conc=\r\nerned with short-term versus long-term issues (which isn&#39;t really as clearl=\r\ny defined in an open-ended context), but even if we honor that concern, it =\r\nis potentially na=EFve to believe that pressure in either direction from th=\r\ne start, or even an encoding bias in either direction from the start, is so=\r\nmehow going to directly align with the level of nuance observed millions of=\r\n years in the future. However, while fitness pressure is eternal, encoding =\r\nbias is malleable, so pushing in the &quot;right&quot; direction from the s=\r\ntart is not essential for encoding. It&#39;s more like a hint to get you starte=\r\nd, whereas fitness pressure is more like a gun forever pointed at your back=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; For example, who is to say that we should not =\r\nhave the opposite short-term worry as Jeff does &#8211; he worries that an =\r\nencoding bias towards low connectivity &quot;might evolve away because of f=\r\nitness pressure,&quot; but can&#39;t we just as easily worry about *too much* m=\r\nodularity? In that case, Jeff&#39;s evil twin &quot;opposite-Jeff&quot; might b=\r\ne worried that an initial encoding bias towards *high* connectivity might e=\r\nvolve away. It is not clear nor established fact (see Connectionists) that =\r\nthe exact form of the final &quot;solution&quot; is particularly modular or=\r\n non-modular. What it is, is subtle and somewhere in the middle. So none of=\r\n this kind of panicking about what nature &quot;needs&quot; to harass it in=\r\nto such an astronomically complex future configuration makes much sense. We=\r\n cannot say definitively the extent to which the final structure is &quot;c=\r\nloser&quot; to modular or non-modular, whatever that even means. Fortunatel=\r\ny, an encoding that begins with a bias towards modularity can tone it down =\r\nas needed, or ramp it up even more.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yet Jeff als=\r\no worries about about the radiation of evolutionary lineages being blocked =\r\nbecause of implicit penalties: He says, &quot;You assume that evolution wil=\r\nl branch out and explore all these options even in the face of fitness pena=\r\nlties for that exploration. But that is not how evolution works.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; But branching out and exploring many (not necessaril=\r\ny all of course) of the options is the only way that natural evolution work=\r\ns. That&#39;s what open-endedness is (unless you don&#39;t believe natural evolutio=\r\nn to be open-ended). The tree of life is ever-branching. The worry about &q=\r\nuot;fitness penalties&quot; here is a red herring because it originates fro=\r\nm closed-ended artificial EC experiments where you can end up on the wrong =\r\npath. But nature does not have any single &quot;fitness penalty&quot; or &q=\r\nuot;right path&quot; throughout its run because the landscape is always cha=\r\nnging as it branches and branches. For example, before trees, being an extr=\r\nemely tall herbivore would incur a fitness penalty, but after trees giraffe=\r\ns were perfectly viable. The penalty is not consistent.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; More generally, how can there be what you call a &quot;default fitn=\r\ness penalty&quot; if there is no final goal? Penalty with respect to what? =\r\nKeep in mind here that the origin of pseudo-modular organization in nature =\r\nlikely predates the emergence even of neurons. The first neural structures =\r\npiggy-backed on previously evolved organizational structure that likely inf=\r\nluenced the subtle pseudo-modularity of connectivity from the start for rea=\r\nsons entirely unrelated to connection cost because these organizational con=\r\nventions evolved long before neurons even existed: the bias in the encoding=\r\n was in part already there.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Which brings me back=\r\n to the origin of all such conventions - canalization - which is the key he=\r\nre. Stephane talks about a bias that exists &quot;all along&quot; in evolut=\r\nion, but ultimately the ability to *change* bias eclipses choosing one up f=\r\nront. Again, in the context of artificial scenarios, it&#39;s a good engineerin=\r\ng hack to force in some kind of bias into the encoding or into fitness that=\r\n you expect to control things for a moderate number of generations. But in =\r\nnature the scope is so vast that it can&#39;t be the final word; it&#39;s only the =\r\ninitial hint. While that hint can help, nature in the long term needs to ch=\r\noose and commit to its own biases, and to slither out of them from time to =\r\ntime, and only encoding offers that potential. Canalization is the way natu=\r\nre can make long-term (though not necessarily permanent) commitments. It&#39;s =\r\nhow conventions are established in specific lineages.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; In a genuine open-ended scenario like nature, modularity will emerge =\r\nand proliferate over vast stretches of time only if modularity leads to mor=\r\ne species emerging. Of course, the species we observe at the end are the co=\r\nnsequence of organizational principles that supported generating many speci=\r\nes (which is almost tautological). So it need not relate to being better or=\r\n worse, or &quot;solving&quot; anything. It has to do with open-ended dynam=\r\nics. Air will escape a hole in a balloon if you wait long enough. If that h=\r\nole leads to a whole other world, you will eventually see that other world.=\r\n Modularity, to the extent it actually exists in nature, has served as such=\r\n a hole. But the only way such a hole can be exploited, the only way you ca=\r\nn keep focused on that area, is if it can be canalized. An encoding that ca=\r\nn be canalized allows you to maintain the subtle convention that is respons=\r\nible for spreading diversity. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Stef nevertheless=\r\n reminds me that &quot;selection pressure has strong impact,&quot; and I en=\r\ntirely agree of course. But there are two very different classes of selecti=\r\non pressure. One is about pushing you towards the new, and the other is abo=\r\nut forcing you to commit to the old. There are many ways to push towards th=\r\ne new, and novelty search is just one. In contrast, these things we call &q=\r\nuot;fitness pressures&quot; (whether part of a MOEA or not) are the opposit=\r\ne &#8211; they are toxic strait jackets applied for eternity. They presume =\r\nthat we know what we need with no nuance whatsoever eons before anything re=\r\nmotely related has appeared. Again, in engineering, fair enough &#8211; it =\r\ncan work. But it is not an *explanation* of the products of open-ended evol=\r\nution in nature, and likely is not a good way to produce open-endedness art=\r\nificially either. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; So the only escape I see here=\r\n from my argument is if you can argue somehow that you can do all these ama=\r\nzing things *without* open-ended evolution. Then all your pressures and con=\r\nstraints might make sense. But I don&#39;t think you can argue that, which, to =\r\nfinally circle back to Martin&#39;s broad question, is why encoding is ultimate=\r\nly superior. A canalizeable encoding is the perfect partner for an open-end=\r\ned process. But it is not (as Martin puts it) because it makes a particular=\r\n &quot;bias in the encoding better.&quot; Rather, it is because encoding le=\r\nts evolution delicately modify its own biases on the fly and explore all of=\r\n them in parallel. That is, the ability to change, the ability to flexible,=\r\n to commit but to uncommit in increments of subtlety, to radiate diversity =\r\nwhile still committing to certain biases in certain chains, is the power th=\r\nat made everything happen. Any forced competition, any constant bias, any e=\r\nternal relative judgment, which are all things that constant fitness pressu=\r\nre offers, will diminish that flexibility. It will not necessarily destroy =\r\nthe open-ended process, but it will reduce its power and ultimately therefo=\r\nre cannot explain or account for it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best,&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ken&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;martin_pyka&quot=\r\n; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I just would like to point out=\r\n that, in my opinion, part of the disagreement between you and Jeff and Ken=\r\n comes from the fact that Ken somehow made the statement &quot;it is better=\r\n to implement the bias in the encoding than in the fitness function&quot; b=\r\nut in actual fact argues for a specific type of implementation in the encod=\r\ning.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I thing the discussion shou=\r\nld not center around the general question whether a bias should be incorpor=\r\nated in the fitness or in the encoding because in both areas there are bett=\r\ner and worse ways to do it.
