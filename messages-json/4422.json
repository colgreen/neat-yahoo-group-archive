I&#39;m sure there are others like me\n&gt; who would be interested in contributing.\n\nI thought it was enabled, sorry for that. The Issue tracker is available now.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d also be interested in being able to check out the latest code,\n&gt; even if it still requires some cleaning up, as while it would be great\n&gt; to be able to download a 1.0 release at the end of the year, that&#39;s\n&gt; still some time away and time is a little short :)\n\nI&#39;m not adding new functionalities to version 1.0, everything is\nbasically there already. But I hope to get the C/C++ extensions done,\nas well as the DPNV experiment. What I meant &quot;by the end of the year&quot;\nwas to include documentation, FAQs and all that. I can promise you the\ncode, but not the docs :)\n\nStay with the Python neural network module meanwhile.\n\nCesar\n\n"}}
