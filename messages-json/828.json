This network is \nperfect on all 64 tests but obviously contains a LOT of redundant \nneurons/connections. In fact it&#39;s a small wonder such a complex network \nwas able to make any gains towards the end of the search due to the \nlarge size of the search space.\n\nI would say that these large networks are really the result of some very \nlong searches(like about 24 hours) where the add neuron/connections \nrates where too high, but then even with low mutation rates I would \nexpect some accumulation of neurons during a long search that has gone \nthrough periods of stagnation. This is why I want to try using a phased \nsearch whereby we alternate between adding neurons/connections and \ntrimming them back - I think it should improve very long duration searches.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
