Philip\nTucker (also on this=\r\n list) and I are working on a Java\nimplementation of NEAT that we hope to o=\r\npensource in\nthe near future.  We&#39;re primarily interested in board\ngame dom=\r\nains, specifically the Gomoku/Renju/Go class\nof games, but also to a lesser=\r\n degree, other game\ndomains and real-time robot control.\n\nAnyway, chime in =\r\nif you like, and let us know what\nyou&#39;re up to, or what you&#39;re thinking abo=\r\nut.\n\nBest,\nDerek James\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nP=\r\nrotect your identity with Yahoo!
