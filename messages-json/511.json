In my\n&gt; thinking about this problem, I had planned to have\n&gt; randomness in the &quot;boulders&quot;.  There would be a random\n&gt; number of boulders, in random locations, and with\n&gt; random diameters.  There would also be a user option\n&gt; for a non-random run.  I had not thought about\n&gt; randomness in the vehicle characteristics or the\n&gt; traction of the sand, etc.  All of that is certainly\n&gt; possible, and could result in a very robust ANN\n&gt; controller.\n\nIt&#39;s an good point that Darren makes, and it&#39;s interesting to know of \nyour success with this approach in EvSail. It would be an interesting \nexperiment to see just how much noise an NN could cope with and to \nsee just how far this approach can go. E.g. a little bit of error \nintroduced between a motor&#39;s power input and the eventual speed of a \nvehicle can be &#39;fixed&#39; by an NN evolving a servo/feedback type \nmechanism. But would an NN be able to cope the large changes in a \nvehicle&#39;s dynamics, E.g. the steering alignment being knocked out \nof place by 20% :)  \n\nColin.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n"}}
