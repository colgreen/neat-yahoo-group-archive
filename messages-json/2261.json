We usually end up wi=\r\nth somewhere between 20-30\nspecies in a typical run.\n\nTheoretically, I like=\r\n to think of species as camps moving out into the\nsearch space and explorin=\r\ng.  They&#39;re clusters of similar solutions in\nthe fitness landscape.  You do=\r\nn&#39;t want too many and you don&#39;t want too\nfew.  And you want a certain amoun=\r\nt of turnover or dynamism, because\nyou want to encourage more exploration, =\r\nand probably have some search\nspaces abandoned in favor of more promising o=\r\nnes.\n\nOthers may have some insights into why they clamped the species size.=\r\n\n\nThe short answer, though not very helpful, is somewhere between 1 and\nyou=\r\nr population size. :)\n\nDerek\n\nOn 9/7/05, Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@btopen=\r\nworld.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wondering if anyone has any view as to the=\r\n optimum(ish) number of\n&gt; species.  My implementation will cope with both a=\r\n fixed and dynamic\n&gt; compatability threshold so I can control the number of=\r\n species to a\n&gt; certain degree.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find that with a fixed CT, the numbe=\r\nr of species decline eventually\n&gt; to just a few, after intially having many=\r\n (tens/hundreds).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thoughts, opinoins etc very much welcomed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chee=\r\nrs\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
