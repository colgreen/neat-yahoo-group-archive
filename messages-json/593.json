That way, when returning\n&gt; &gt; the evaluation results, it\n&gt; &gt; can return it to a single point of contact that then\n&gt; &gt; knows where to put\n&gt; &gt; them.  Then, it won&#39;t be necessary for the server to\n&gt; &gt; maintain a list of who\n&gt; &gt; took what and then run the risk of getting things\n&gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the input.\n&gt;\n&gt;The way we&#39;re currently doing our runs and generating\n&gt;XML, all the information you&#39;re talking about is\n&gt;stored in the run XML.\n\nBut do you have any way of tying the network XML to the run XML?  If you see \nthat there was a network that did something anomalous in the run, can you \nidentify the xml of the network in question?  Can you, given a network XML \nfind the results of its fitness evaluation in the run?  How?  By file name?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ get it now! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"}}
