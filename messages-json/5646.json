I&#39;m looking over the paper &quot;The Dominance Tournament Method of Monito=\r\nring Progress in Coevolution&quot;, and it gives a little more detail on the app=\r\nroach taken. I&#39;m still fuzzy on how you arrange the food items to get 144 p=\r\nositions per starting side, for 288 total evaluations. \n\nI suppose it&#39;s not=\r\n critical for my purposes to *exactly* recreate the layouts as long as the =\r\ndominance tournament works, but if you have any documentation detailing the=\r\n exact locations I might as well throw them in there for good measure. \n\n\n-=\r\nDrew Kirkpatrick\n\n\n"}}
