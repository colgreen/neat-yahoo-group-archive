It very well may do so.   If you have \nposted evidence=\r\n of such an advantage, it&#39;s possible I missed it in \nthe past.  If not, I&#39;d=\r\n be happy to take a look.\n\nI understand that you are concerned with coverag=\r\ne and in particular \nvisiting the same point in the search space more than =\r\nonce.  I \nremember that you showed that there is some percentage of such re=\r\n-\nvisitation in the search space in NEAT (as happens in fact in many \nevolu=\r\ntionry and learning algorithms).   It appears that if you manage \nto avoid =\r\nsome revisitation (without paying a different cost for \navoiding it), you c=\r\nould maybe at best double the efficiency or the \nalgorithm, or something in=\r\n that ballpark.  However, I am not sure \nthat the cost of revisitation is r=\r\neally any worse than the cost of \ntrying to prevent it?  It depends on how =\r\nclever the preventation \nscheme is.\n\nYou also mention that NEAT&#39;s standard =\r\nparameters are &quot;conservative.&quot;  \nCan you give an example of what you would =\r\nconsider more &quot;liberal&quot; \nparameters?   Are you talking about e.g. higher mu=\r\ntation rates?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; With all due respect,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The idea that you might c=\r\nreate many initial populations and \n&gt; evaluate \n&gt; &gt; all of them is not buyi=\r\nng any obvious advantage because you still \n&gt; end \n&gt; &gt; up having to evaluat=\r\ne all those initial populations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I disagree. For standard NEAT params,=\r\n test cases (the results \nsummary \n&gt; of which has been included in prior po=\r\nstings) demonstrate that the \n&gt; product of number of individuals times gene=\r\nrations are not created \n&gt; equal. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that search efficiency is=\r\n generally considered to be number \nof \n&gt; &gt; evaluations, so if 1,000 evalua=\r\ntions are added at the get-go, \nsome \n&gt; &gt; consequence would need to make up=\r\n for that initial investment.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Specifically, for a given number of e=\r\nvaulations (i.e. # individuals \n* \n&gt; generations), higher fitness was achie=\r\nved when the composition \n&gt; included more &quot;0 generation&quot; evaluations rather=\r\n than less.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer is not obvious because the dynamics of bot=\r\nh strategies \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; quite complex and domain-dependent.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Reason=\r\nably so, but not an adequate justification to set-aside the \n&gt; issue. Until=\r\n you actually implement code infrastructure to attempt \nto \n&gt; quantify such=\r\n things as: a) exact genome duplication as measured by \n&gt; visitation of des=\r\nign points, not just genome structure, b) \neffective \n&gt; genome duplication =\r\n(i.e. so close to be effectivily a duplicate), \nand \n&gt; c) coverage of the d=\r\nesign space, you will not uncover just how \n&gt; redundant and limited coverag=\r\ne of the design space is for standard \n&gt; NEAT params for a given population=\r\n size and number of generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a huge fan of the NEAT method. B=\r\nut the method will not achieve \n&gt; its potential to handle practical real-wo=\r\nrld problems until these \n&gt; profound inefficiencies are addressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n standard NEAT params appear to be very conservative, resting on \n&gt; the ben=\r\nefits of the NEAT method itself to make up for the undue \n&gt; burden of their=\r\n conservatisim. But that only goes as far as the \n&gt; trivialness of the fitn=\r\ness function evaluation. After which it \nsinks \n&gt; under the computational w=\r\neight of its own inefficiency and \n&gt; conservatisism for practical problems =\r\nwhere the fitness evaluation \nis \n&gt; non-trival. It would be very disappoint=\r\ning that the benefits of the \n&gt; NEAT method get lost due to the failure to =\r\naddress the significance \n&gt; and adaptive control potential characteristics =\r\nof the NEAT params.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dancing rag-dolls reveal applicability of the NEAT=\r\n method to new \nand \n&gt; interesting areas, but there is more fundamental res=\r\nearch required \non \n&gt; the exploitation of the NEAT params before you will s=\r\nee the NEAT \n&gt; method commonly applied to practical real-world problems, as=\r\n it \n&gt; rightfully should/could be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hand waving over &quot;complex and domai=\r\nn-dependent&quot; is an inadequate \n&gt; justification for chosing to ignore the is=\r\nsue, and instead focus on \n&gt; new and interesting areas in which the issue i=\r\ns not addressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenne=\r\nth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The distribution of the initial gene=\r\nrations indeed can affect the \n&gt; &gt; course of evolution.  However, it is dif=\r\nficult to make informed a \n&gt; &gt; priori decisions about the initial populatio=\r\nn before an \nexperiment \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; run, because little may be known about t=\r\nhe structure of the \nsearch \n&gt; &gt; space.  However, I believe there has been =\r\nwork on the composition \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; initial populations in GAs and the right=\r\n random distribution \n(e.g. \n&gt; &gt; uniform vs. normal, or something else) of =\r\nindividuals in that \n&gt; &gt; population to best cover the search space.  \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The idea that you might create many initial populations and \n&gt; evaluate=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; all of them is not buying any obvious advantage because you still \n&gt; =\r\nend \n&gt; &gt; up having to evaluate all those initial populations.  For \nexample=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; let&#39;s say that the population size is 100.

So the question is, \nwhich \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; was more effective, evaluating 10 random populations, or \nevaluating \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 10 generations of evolutionary search?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer is not obvi=\r\nous because the dynamics of both strategies \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; quite complex and d=\r\nomain-dependent.
