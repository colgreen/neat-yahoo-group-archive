That would be a good experiment.\nCompare a set of good fixed parameters to evolving ones that start with\nthose same parameters.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n517.214.1060\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed, 07 Nov 2007 19:39:07 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Does NEAT always lead to higher fitness value?\n&gt; \n&gt; Your point could be interpreted to be substantiated, if you were to\n&gt; start your parameter evolution from scratch.

I am currently\n&gt; working\n&gt;&gt; on a manuscript now that greatly bolsters the argument, but it is\n&gt; not out\n&gt;&gt; yet. I will let you know when it is.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I started all of this with the great hope that\n&gt; evolution could\n&gt;&gt; do a great job of picking its own parameters. I would love to be\n&gt; proven\n&gt;&gt; wrong! Please let me know if you have any success. I have found that\n&gt;&gt; evolution consistently does  poor job of evolving its own settings.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Here is a challenge: take Ken&#39;s default settings for a good NEAT\n&gt; run.\n&gt;&gt; Compare those to a situation where a GA picks those settings. I&#39;ll\n&gt; bet ya a\n&gt;&gt; six pack o porter the hand picked values do significantly better.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; 517.214.1060\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Wed, 7 Nov 2007 07:18:45 -0800\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Does NEAT always lead to higher fitness\n&gt; value?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Nov 7, 2007, at 6:44 AM, Jeff Clune wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Beware: evolution is very bad at choosing good settings for\n&gt; evolution.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s in addition to all of the extra computation time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a rather broad statement, and, paper or not, I don&#39;t buy\n&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe a Differential Evolution would work *very* well to\n&gt; choose\n&gt;&gt;&gt; NEAT parameters.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve thought of doing this very thing myself.
