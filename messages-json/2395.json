I \nmeant to pose it as a philosophical question, e.g. what _should_ we \ndo when two individuals are each non-recursive, but the result of \ncross-breeding them would be recursive?\n\n From your answer I think I take that in your case some of the \noffending connections would be dropped in an arbitrary manner?  And I \nthink that stems from the fact that there is an underlying order to \nthe nodes which all connection must respect?  So that means that when \na single order has been determined for the offspring, some \nconnections which were valid in the parents will be forbidden in the offspring.\n\nOf course, that means having to test every connection for inclusion \nin the offspring.  I was assuming that if two valid parents were \ncross-bread, then the offspring would automatically be valid.  But \nmaybe I was naive on that.\n\nOn the other hand, isn&#39;t what we have here an example of competing \nconventions?  e.g. no convention was defined in the original \nancestor, because there was no connection between these two \n&quot;subroutines&quot; but the two current individuals have developed \ndifferent conventions since then.  e.g. a convention of &quot;subnet(BC) \nis a suitable input for subnet(B&#39;C&#39;)&quot; or vice-versa.\n\nOne way to avoid the generation of this type of competing convention \nis not to use topological analysis to avoid recurrence, but instead \npredetermine which nodes will be acceptable as inputs for which \nothers at the time of node creation.  e.g. by assigning each one a \nrandom real value in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and allowing links only \nwhere this variable increases.\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
