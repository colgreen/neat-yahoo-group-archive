Although we have\nhighlighted geometr=\r\nic regularity in our papers recently, another one\nis the ability to increas=\r\ne substrate density (i.e. the number of\nneurons) holistically and still ret=\r\nain functionality, as we showed in\nour publications from 2007:\n\nhttp://eple=\r\nx.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html#gauci.gecco07\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/public=\r\nations.html#dambrosio.gecco07\n\nThis ability allows a novel kind of complexi=\r\nfication that can increase\ncomplexity by orders of magnitude in an orderly =\r\nway.   It is what\nallowed us to produce a working network with 8 million ne=\r\nurons in the\npaper by Jason Gauci and myself.\n\nThere are some other advanta=\r\nges that we have not even pointed out yet,\nsuch as an easy way to express a=\r\n &quot;connectivity group,&quot; which means one\nwhole group of neurons connecting to=\r\n another partner group in an\norderly manner, similar to a &quot;nerve&quot; in the br=\r\nain.  It turns out that\nsuch a group connection in the substrate can be exp=\r\nressed elegantly by\na CPPN.\n\nHowever, I am not certain whether overall the =\r\nadvantages of HyperNEAT\napply to time series prediction.  Peter may be corr=\r\nect that this\ndomain is not necessarily the right one for HyperNEAT.  Yet I=\r\n would\nstill encourage you to try if you have a gut feeling about it, becau=\r\nse\non the chance that HyperNEAT does provide some advantage, we will only\nd=\r\niscover it by trying it out.  \n\nIt is even possible that time could be arra=\r\nnged along one axis of the\nsubstrate, thereby leveraging the &quot;geometry of t=\r\nime&quot; as an advantage.\n There may be something to that, i.e. the idea that t=\r\nhere is a\nrelationship among inputs that come from points in time that are =\r\nclose\ntogether in terms of how they relate to what is coming next. \nHyperNE=\r\nAT may be able to capture that geometry through some kind of\nsliding window=\r\n of inputs arranged in temporal order.  Yet it would not\nbe a traditional w=\r\nay of processing a time series.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Ow=\r\nen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your last post was how I wanted t=\r\no respond to Petar, but your\n&gt; explanation is much better.
