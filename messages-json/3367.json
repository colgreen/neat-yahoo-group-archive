I am trying to test the learning \nalgorith=\r\nm on it. You see that the legs, arms and the torso are \ncubic.. eh.. what w=\r\nas that word.. they have edges! It gives more \nproblems. The guys at Natura=\r\nlMotion have their own models, taken from \nbiometric data.. And more, they =\r\nhave modeled elastic muscles and so \non... It&#39;s just a prototype to test Hy=\r\nperNEAT. I see that NEAT and \nHyperNEAT are the best EC learning algorithms=\r\n available, so thank Ken \nfor creating it and... and I will now try to make=\r\n more accurate \nmodels and run it. These current models.. just suck! \n\nPete=\r\nr\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; petar_=\r\nchervenski wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Feedback can be achieved as adding more input=\r\ns that represent \nthe\n&gt; &gt; ACTUAL joint angles at the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t for=\r\nget joint rotation too.

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re simulation is doing this at \nthese \n&gt; joints rig=\r\nht now, but I think it&#39;s pretty important.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example of the rotati=\r\nonal motions I&#39;m talking about:\n&gt; \n&gt; * hips:  stand, feet together.  squat =\r\nuntil knees are bent 90 \ndegrees. \n&gt; move knees apart and together\n&gt; * ankl=\r\nes:  sit, legs extended above ground, feet together.  move \ntoes \n&gt; apart a=\r\nnd together with heels touching.\n&gt; * shoulders:  lock elbow at 90 degrees. =\r\n place elbow on table.  \nmove \n&gt; hand up and down while keeping elbow in on=\r\ne place.  like arm \nwrestling.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
