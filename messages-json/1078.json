I&#39;m *highly* skeptical that this is a good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, lost track of who said this but:\n\nThat was me.\n\n&gt; In cells, one advantage of junk DNA is the way the indirect encoding operates.\n&gt; \n&gt; DNA codes proteins... and proteins are simply dropped into the cytoplasm\n&gt; (or the membrane, or one of a small number of other places).\n&gt; \n&gt; So, a non-functional mutated copy of a gene in the junk DNA can be\n&gt; activated, and then very easily plugs into the existing systems.  e.g. the\n&gt; protein is created, dropped into the cytoplasm, and is then immediately\n&gt; playing a role in the cells control systems.  \n\nWell, you&#39;re describing something that, when expressed in the\n*phenotype* becomes beneficial.\n\nMy point, which I think still holds up reasonably well, is that\norganisms don&#39;t do very well when they have a lot of neutral or\nmaladaptive structure in their phenotype.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
