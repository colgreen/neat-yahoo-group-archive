We are\nalways=\r\n happy to receive positive feedback.  We also like your demos\nand from what=\r\n I&#39;ve seen you could easily pursue a Ph.D. if you wanted\nto.  Have you ever=\r\n considered going to graduate school for a Ph.D.?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree that=\r\n all the re-querying will get expensive. In fact running \n&gt; such an evoluti=\r\non, in the matter of computational effort, that would \n&gt; come as close as e=\r\nxhaustive search, but I think there is something \n&gt; beatuful in the way it =\r\nis done. The CPPN can be re-queried each N \n&gt; timesteps or when some criter=\r\nia in the environment is met. \n&gt; \n&gt; You know, I actually changed my entire =\r\nphylosophy about EC since your \n&gt; last paper about NS came out. I am about =\r\nto add dynamic re-quering to \n&gt; the CPPN-&gt;HyperNEAT substrates, while being=\r\n in Novelty Search. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really have to say too much good words, b=\r\nut it is obvious, NS \n&gt; avoids all deception and it reaches solutions that =\r\nFS has no hope to \n&gt; reach. Great work, you people over there in the Eplex =\r\ngroup! Cheers \n&gt; to Ken, David, Joel and Jason! I am not a PhD or anything =\r\nlike that, \n&gt; I am just a bulgarian freelancer but I really admire what you=\r\n have \n&gt; done in this area. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, I think re-querying the=\r\n CPPN over time is a great idea.  \n&gt; We&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; talked about it in our resea=\r\nrch group but we don&#39;t have any ongoing\n&gt; &gt; projects with it, and I don&#39;t k=\r\nnow of any.  The only downside is \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; all that querying will get ex=\r\npensive.  However, it&#39;s very \n&gt; interesting\n&gt; &gt; because it means that the l=\r\nearning rules themselves become \n&gt; distributed\n&gt; &gt; in a pattern, and are &quot;m=\r\nade up&quot; by HyperNEAT rather than being\n&gt; &gt; preselected by the experimenter.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The CPPN might also be able to output Hebbian parameters; althoug=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; that is less groundbreaking, though it might work well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is an interesting idea to=\r\n see what if the phenotypes produced \n&gt; by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPNs change over the=\r\nir lifetime. There are two approaches to \n&gt; this: the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN can outpu=\r\nt hebbian learning parameters to the connections or \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN can =\r\nbe re-queried every time step, so the connections will \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; basical=\r\nly different every time, depending on the environment, \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will=\r\n be input to the CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any ongoing research into this? \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
