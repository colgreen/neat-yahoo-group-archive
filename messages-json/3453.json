Fitness in NEAT indeed must be scaled \nto ab=\r\nove zero values.\n\nNoisy domains present a problem for any method and requir=\r\ne many \ntrials to average out.  In some cases, noise can be so much that it=\r\n \nmakes learning impossible, which means the noise must be reduced.  In \nge=\r\nneral I suggest starting out with as little noise as possible to \nsee what =\r\nyou can learn without it.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;crazyhamster0=\r\n3&quot; &lt;mirenner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I modified the NEAT Matlab code to perform the=\r\n NEAT+Q algorithm, it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t quite work yet though.\n&gt; \n&gt; I spoke with S=\r\nhimon and he basically told me that the fitness \n&gt; function has to be posit=\r\nive.
