TBE does not limit the solution, =\r\nit \nsimply follows the same method of selection for mostly simple tasks - \n=\r\nlike - keep the poles balanced or drive that car without crashing. \nThis is=\r\n actually dependant of all possible solutions for the given \nproblem at han=\r\nd. You can&#39;t expect that a pole balancer can evolve a \nhuman-level AI, simp=\r\nly because the environment that hosts the \nevolution process is too simple.=\r\n \nThe key point in this is, what is possible in the task domain and how \nsm=\r\nart the selection process can be? In nature, everything is \npossible. Excel=\r\nlent advancements pop up and survive, but this is just \nbecause this is pos=\r\nsible in nature. More freedom means more complex \nspace to search and there=\r\nfore, more power. \nThe freedom in the picture drawing domain is enourmous. =\r\nAnything can \nbe drawn on a simple 2D plane! \nThe selection in nature is ba=\r\nsed on the performance of the actual \nphenotypes, but since that the nature=\r\n is a very complex world with a \nlot of chemistry, physics and ecologic rel=\r\nationships, this gives the \nprocess a new level of freedom.. How to explain=\r\n that?! \nA good evolutionary algorithm should consider good/bad indivuduals=\r\n \nnot compared to a static fitness function, but simply as these \nindividua=\r\nls show what they are capable of! The problem is how to make \nthe environme=\r\nnt rich enough, so the phenotypes will be enabled to do \nvarious things, &quot;e=\r\nxperiment&quot; in this environment. This is why IEC \nlooks so great, because th=\r\ne environment is the artist&#39;s perception of \nviewing a picture.  \nImagine a=\r\n virtual world where there are rules, stuff like physics for \nexample. Crea=\r\ntures evolving there may have any topology and survive \nnot based on some f=\r\nitness function like &quot;who lives longer, is good&quot;, \nbut simply as &quot;show me w=\r\nhat you can do&quot;.. The method of selection is \ntherefore dependant every tim=\r\ne, for every generation.. \nSo, there is an idea. The system hosting the evo=\r\nlution process should \nnot choose the parents for the next generation. The =\r\nindividuals \nthemselves should be the ones who decide! \nBut I have no idea =\r\nhow to automate that without human interaction..   \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;PlaceboZA (Greg)&quot; &lt;placeboza@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good points, Th=\r\nanks for that :)\n&gt; \n&gt; A simplification (perhaps oversimplified) is that TBE=\r\n:\n&gt;  - limits the solution, putting a ceiling on it&#39;s possibilities\n&gt;  - co=\r\nmpletely ignores excellent advancements into other directions\n&gt;  - has diff=\r\niculty determining the short term goals in a complex \ntarget (e.g.\n&gt; can&#39;t =\r\ndetermine what image looks  most like mona lisa when you&#39;ve \njust\n&gt; started=\r\n breeding)\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the key points for me anyway :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Greg\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/=\r\n13/07, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Derek and Jeff,\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I would be happy to expand on my controversial remarks on \ninteractive\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; evolution being more &quot;natural&quot; than the usual kind of evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncomputation. I&#39;ve been thinking about this issue for a couple \nyears\n&gt; &gt; so=\r\n it will be good to get some of it down. Please be warned this \nis\n&gt; &gt; a lo=\r\nng argument, but hopefully you will find it interesting \nenough to\n&gt; &gt; be w=\r\north your time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First, let me make sure the terms are straight. I&#39;m=\r\n comparing\n&gt; &gt; interactive evolutionary computation (IEC), which means evol=\r\nution\n&gt; &gt; with a human (or &quot;breeder&quot;) in the loop, to regular evolutionary\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; computation, which means evolution with respect to a given fitness\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfunction. I have begun to call the latter (at least to\n&gt; &gt; myself) &quot;target-=\r\nbased evolution&quot; (TBE) because the fitness \nfunction\n&gt; &gt; in effect describe=\r\ns a target that a human designer is hoping to\n&gt; &gt; reach, so I will use that=\r\n term here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note that neither IEC nor TBE are really &quot;natural&quot; in t=\r\nhe sense \nthat\n&gt; &gt; natural evolution neither involved a sentient breeder ov=\r\nerseeing \nthe\n&gt; &gt; process nor did it involve a predesignated target based o=\r\nn which \neach\n&gt; &gt; organism is always evaluated. The question then is which =\r\none is \nmore\n&gt; &gt; natural than the other, since neither one is truly natural=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To get some perspective on this question, let&#39;s consider the \nsim=\r\nple\n&gt; &gt; task that Colin proposed: Imagine that we set a particular desired\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; image as a target and evaluate against that. Could we then evolve \na\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; CPPN (or ANN if you prefer) that produces the desired image?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nanswer is surprising (we&#39;ve tried it!). It turns out to be \nvery\n&gt; &gt; hard w=\r\nith anything but the simplest of images. What you discover\n&gt; &gt; quickly is t=\r\nhat the fitness function isn&#39;t rewarding the right\n&gt; &gt; things. The images t=\r\nends to devolve into a gray cloud that \nminimizes\n&gt; &gt; error by choosing an =\r\nintermediate shade- not what you want at all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yet the issue is deep=\r\ner than that. In fact, here is what is really\n&gt; &gt; interesting: If you take =\r\nany image (except the simplest ones) on\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder- images that were ev=\r\nolved through IEC with NEAT- you \nwill\n&gt; &gt; not be able to evolve to those s=\r\name images through TBE with NEAT! \nI\n&gt; &gt; challenge anyone to disprove me on=\r\n this; I&#39;d be very interested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is a remarkable observation: NE=\r\nAT can&#39;t reproduce it&#39;s own\n&gt; &gt; results! The only conclusion is that the se=\r\nlection method is the\n&gt; &gt; culprit. That is, it has to do with how you decid=\r\ne what&#39;s good in\n&gt; &gt; any particular generation, which of course is differen=\r\nt in IEC and\n&gt; &gt; TBE.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So let&#39;s look more closely at this issue: How=\r\n did we evolve images\n&gt; &gt; interactively that could not be reached through r=\r\negular TBE? The\n&gt; &gt; answer is that humans have a different way of rewarding=\r\n \nintermediate\n&gt; &gt; results. In particular, human breeders in IEC examine wh=\r\nat is good\n&gt; &gt; *in the present* and make their decision based on that where=\r\nas TBE\n&gt; &gt; compares what you have in the present to a long-term future goal=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps if you&#39;ve used Picbreeder or IEC you may think that you \n=\r\nwere\n&gt; &gt; actually evolving to a target and thus that I am wrong. But\n&gt; &gt; Pi=\r\ncbreeder disproves this view. As soon as *someone else* branches\n&gt; &gt; from y=\r\nour image, whatever &quot;target&quot; you may have had in mind (if \nany)\n&gt; &gt; is irre=\r\nlevant. They have their own ideas about what is good. So it\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t possi=\r\nble that what the next person in the chain evolved was\n&gt; &gt; your original in=\r\ntent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand I may not need to go that far to make the p=\r\noint\n&gt; &gt; because if you&#39;re like me, you kind of discover what&#39;s cool as you=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; go. I may have a vague idea in mind, but on the road to that idea \nI\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; see that something cool I hadn&#39;t thought of before pops up, so I \ngo\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n off in that direction instead. What matters most is what&#39;s good in\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n present.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now here is the connection to natural evolution: Natural =\r\nevolution\n&gt; &gt; is also completely unconcerned with ultimate goals or targets=\r\n. It\n&gt; &gt; only concerns itself with whether the present candidates are good =\r\n\nin\n&gt; &gt; the present.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am going to argue that that is a major sourc=\r\ne of its power; it\n&gt; &gt; explains in part its prolific creativity and its ast=\r\nounding \nability\n&gt; &gt; to elaborate indefinitely. Yes, I am claiming that it =\r\ncan do all\n&gt; &gt; that because it *doesn&#39;t* have a target.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So then wha=\r\nt&#39;s so great about not having a target? What&#39;s great is\n&gt; &gt; that you get re=\r\nwarded for doing what you *can* do. And a good\n&gt; &gt; encoding can do a lot. H=\r\nowever, what&#39;s very difficult, even for a\n&gt; &gt; good encoding, is to do a com=\r\npletely arbitrary complex thing that \nis\n&gt; &gt; nowhere close to the current p=\r\nopulation in the search space.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is why I called TBE a liability=\r\n: It evaluates the current\n&gt; &gt; candidates against something that ignores th=\r\neir current strengths\n&gt; &gt; completely. For example, imagine if the first bil=\r\nateria \n(bilaterally-\n&gt; &gt; symmetric organisms) were evaluated for their hum=\r\nanity. They would\n&gt; &gt; all fail miserably and they would all therefore be el=\r\niminated.\n&gt; &gt; Humanity would never have evolved even though we in fact did =\r\n\nevolve\n&gt; &gt; from the first bilateria! If TBE were in charge and humans were=\r\n \nthe\n&gt; &gt; goal, we wouldn&#39;t exist right now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Try going back even fa=\r\nrther. Can you imagine evaluating single\n&gt; &gt; celled organisms for their &quot;hu=\r\nman-ness?&quot; That would be silly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yet that is exactly what we are doi=\r\nng in most evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; experiments. We do nothing to capture good inte=\r\nrmediate ideas from\n&gt; &gt; which it would be possible to build our ultimate ob=\r\njectives. So we\n&gt; &gt; are hampered from getting anywhere truly interesting.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then you might ask, that&#39;s all well and good, but how in the world\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; can we reward the intermediate serendipitous discoveries if we \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; know what they should be? The answer is: Respect the fact that you\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t know what they are. Stop trying to *tell* evolution what it\n&gt; &gt; can do =\r\nand let it *show* you what it can do. When it shows you\n&gt; &gt; something cool,=\r\n then keep that for later. Keep everything with any\n&gt; &gt; promise for later. =\r\nYou never know what might be a foundation for \nthe\n&gt; &gt; next level up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; That&#39;s exactly what natural evolution did and that&#39;s exactly what \nIEC\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (Picbreeder variety) does: In nature what happened was that there\n&gt; &gt; we=\r\nre many ways of doing a good job (at surviving) and there was \nroom\n&gt; &gt; eno=\r\nugh on Earth to support a lot of them at once. Nobody &quot;knew&quot;\n&gt; &gt; which ones=\r\n would form a good foundation for something more complex\n&gt; &gt; (and many line=\r\nages didn&#39;t go anywhere), but because a lot of cool\n&gt; &gt; ideas were able to =\r\nhang around, some of them happened to be good\n&gt; &gt; stepping stones to the ne=\r\nxt big thing. The issue was where the DNA\n&gt; &gt; encoding could go next from w=\r\nhere it is now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Same with IEC in Picbreeder: We don&#39;t know what we =\r\nwant to evolve\n&gt; &gt; collectively. I think it&#39;s fair to say that we have no c=\r\nollective\n&gt; &gt; common goal at all. We are all just trying different paths. S=\r\nome \nof\n&gt; &gt; us, when we see a cool path, take that path a bit farther and a=\r\n \nbit\n&gt; &gt; farther still. We keep all the intermediate stages around forever=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and we therefore preserve all possible stepping stones. Some \nhappen\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to be genuinely good foundations for future progress, like those \nthat\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; produced the car, or the recent skull. Yet who would have seen \nthat\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n coming? If we had tried to evolve to them from the start, we&#39;d be\n&gt; &gt; nowh=\r\nere (we&#39;d be in the usual TBE trap).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For this reason, what&#39;s going =\r\non in Picbreeder is really \nintriguing.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s the first artificial evolu=\r\ntionary experiment that is really\n&gt; &gt; doing something like natural evolutio=\r\nn! We may have some amazing\n&gt; &gt; encodings out there, but we don&#39;t get to se=\r\ne it because all we do \nis\n&gt; &gt; TBE, where we keep losing the intermediate f=\r\noundations we would \nneed\n&gt; &gt; to get to a new level. Picbreeder is the firs=\r\nt time that we let\n&gt; &gt; evolution show us what it can do instead of telling =\r\nit what we \nwant\n&gt; &gt; it to do. We are respecting the encoding just as natur=\r\ne respected\n&gt; &gt; DNA.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are some important corollaries: First, T=\r\nBE is not just about\n&gt; &gt; images. In effect, all regular fitness functions h=\r\nave the same TBE\n&gt; &gt; liability. Do you think you can evolve an amazing neur=\r\nal network\n&gt; &gt; with NEAT or with HyperNEAT? Or something else? Well, if you=\r\n have \na\n&gt; &gt; target behavior that you evaluate against, you are never going=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; know how amazing things could be. This is a sobering realization.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; But it&#39;s just as true with behaviors as it is with images. (This\n&gt; &gt; ins=\r\night suggests that evolving behaviors interactively instead of\n&gt; &gt; through =\r\na fitness function is a really promising path)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One exception is com=\r\npetitive coevolution, wherein individuals\n&gt; &gt; actually are evaluated agains=\r\nt other individuals, so it&#39;s not \nreally\n&gt; &gt; target-based. In a sense indiv=\r\niduals are recognized for being as\n&gt; &gt; good as they can be in the present. =\r\nOf course, nature is a kind of\n&gt; &gt; coevolution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yet I don&#39;t want to=\r\n pretend that competitive coevolution is the\n&gt; &gt; perfect pathway to complex=\r\nity because the task may be defined in \nsuch\n&gt; &gt; a way that it might as wel=\r\nl be necessary to solve some gigantic\n&gt; &gt; problem to become good. For examp=\r\nle, competitive coevolution on Go\n&gt; &gt; may not really end up rewarding indiv=\r\niduals for finding really \nbasic\n&gt; &gt; regularities that are necessary to eve=\r\nntually evolving a good Go\n&gt; &gt; player.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The key to natural evolution=\r\n was that there were a lot of easy \nways\n&gt; &gt; to do well in the beginning. S=\r\no we got a diversity of viable \njumping\n&gt; &gt; off points. That is also true o=\r\nn Picbreeder: You can easily get a\n&gt; &gt; picture that&#39;s good enough to be wor=\r\nth showing others. So it&#39;s \ngot a\n&gt; &gt; very natural property: It proliferate=\r\ns jumping-off points too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you like, you can think of Picbreeder =\r\nas an ecology where the\n&gt; &gt; environment is just the preferences of its myri=\r\nad users. The\n&gt; &gt; environment in nature is just Earth and physics. These ar=\r\ne quite\n&gt; &gt; different environments, but their effect on the dynamics of \nse=\r\nlection\n&gt; &gt; form an analogy. So at that level, it doesn&#39;t matter if a human=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; in the loop or not. What humans like is just the environment. And\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the nice things is, humans are very sensitive to regularity and\n&gt; &gt; orga=\r\nnization at all levels: exactly what a good environment should\n&gt; &gt; reward i=\r\nf we want to build up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know where Picbreeder will go becaus=\r\ne part of it depends \non\n&gt; &gt; how many users we get and how much they persev=\r\nere. So it may never\n&gt; &gt; produce great works of art; I&#39;d be surprised if it=\r\n did. Yet it has\n&gt; &gt; these intriguing ingredients that we have not had befo=\r\nre, so it \nis a\n&gt; &gt; much more significant experiment than just a bunch of p=\r\neople \nplaying\n&gt; &gt; with an art toy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hopefully this endless message =\r\nanswers the question with some \nextra\n&gt; &gt; food for thought to boot. I know =\r\nthere are a lot of controversial\n&gt; &gt; ideas here and please forgive me for n=\r\not reminding you as I went \nthat\n&gt; &gt; many such claims were merely speculati=\r\non: I realize that they are,\n&gt; &gt; but if I acknowledged that every time I sp=\r\neculated this near-novel\n&gt; &gt; would be twice as long! You can be sure that I=\r\n am not trying to\n&gt; &gt; present these ideas as settled facts by any means.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;De=\r\nrek \nJames&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of co=\r\nurse the reason it was possible is because humans are \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; evaluation- which yields another lesson: The fitness function \nin\n&gt; &gt; mos=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary computation is a liability against getting to \nhigh-=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; level\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexity. There are deep reasons that human evaluation=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more analogous to what happened over natural evolu=\r\ntion than \nany\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; type of evaluation scheme we run on comput=\r\ners. We are often \nmisled\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into believing that interactive evolution=\r\n is less &quot;natural&quot; \nthan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; normal EC. Actually, the opposite is true.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like Jeff, I&#39;d be interested in hearing you expand your \nthoug=\r\nhts on\n&gt; &gt; this. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think the demonstration is no less impressive, but=\r\n it seems to \nme\n&gt; &gt; that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distinction between natural and artific=\r\nial selection is an \nimportant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conceptual one. Natural selection is b=\r\nased on the attributes of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; environment, while artificial selectio=\r\nn is the result of \nattributes\n&gt; &gt; selected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by an agent (akin to anim=\r\nal breeding or horticulture). In fact, \nin\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Origin of Species,=\r\n Darwin used many many examples of rapid\n&gt; &gt; evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; change in d=\r\nomesticated species such as pigeons and dogs to \nbolster\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argu=\r\nment for his theory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe you&#39;re taking issue with the terms &quot;=\r\nnatural&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;artificial&quot;, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe there are better ways to mak=\r\ne the distinction (&quot;agent-\n&gt; &gt; directed&quot; vs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;environment-directed&quot;, =\r\n&quot;conscious&quot; vs. &quot;unconscious&quot; \nevolution...I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know). But whi=\r\nle I don&#39;t think artificial selection is any less\n&gt; &gt; effective\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or po=\r\nwerful, probably moreso in some cases, I think it&#39;s useful \nto\n&gt; &gt; maintain=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that distinction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Derek\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n -- \n&gt; `People who don&#39;t get carried away, should be`\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
