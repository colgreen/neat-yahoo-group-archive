I took a CPPN that produces a CTRNN exhibiting \na &quot;mexican wave&quot; =\r\nbehaviour. I scaled up the substrate to \napproximately 200 hidden nodes. Th=\r\ne &quot;mexican wave&quot; pattern was \npreserved! And more, even the direction of th=\r\ne wave was the same! \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello, \n&gt; \n&gt; I was just thinking about NERO.=\r\n I suddenly made the connection \nbetween \n&gt; the sensor placements and the s=\r\nubstrates for the robot experiment \nin \n&gt; D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s paper. It is so simi=\r\nlar. So I begin to think.. What \nabout \n&gt; NERO, but using HyperNEAT? The su=\r\nbstrates can be made geometrically \n&gt; similar to the.. enivonment, you know=\r\n what I mean. \n&gt; I will try to implement a 2D version of something similar =\r\nto NERO, \nbut \n&gt; with leaky integrator neurons, because there every node ha=\r\ns a bias \nand \n&gt; I don&#39;t have to care about where to place the bias unit in=\r\n the \n&gt; substrate. \n&gt; Besides, I have the following idea. During evolution,=\r\n in the first \n&gt; generations (in the rtNEAT case, the first N minutes of ev=\r\nolution), \nthe \n&gt; substrates will be simple, with low node counts. Then, gi=\r\nven a \n&gt; threshold (num. of generations/time), the program will \nautomatica=\r\nlly \n&gt; scale up the substrate to a higher density. \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions/id=\r\neas about that? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
