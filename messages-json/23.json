That is, environments or conditions that\nyou can start simply, then scale to increased\ncomplexity.  \n\nYou mention Go, which is a good example.  The\nresearcher can apply NEAT initially to 5x5 Go, then\nscale up the board size, increasing the complexity of\nthe domain.\n\nI don&#39;t think NEAT would work well with a massively\ncomplex domain that wasn&#39;t able to be scaled down\ninitially.  Dunno, though.\n\n&gt; But do you\n&gt; believe there is\n&gt; some ultimate open-ended type of domain that is\n&gt; &quot;made for&quot;\n&gt; complexification?\n\nSure...general intelligence, problem solving, whatever\nyou want to call it. :)\n\n&gt; I tried to make the robot duel open ended in the\n&gt; sense I&#39;m talking\n&gt; about.  But it isn&#39;t *truly* open ended...there is a\n&gt; point after which\n&gt; you can&#39;t really do much better.  \n\nWell, that&#39;s because your environment is relatively\nsimple, right?  I mean, if you add another dimension\nto your model, and it&#39;s 3D instead of 2D, then it&#39;s\nmore difficult to reach optimal strategies because the\ndomain is now an order of magnitude more complex.  If\nyou add other facets to the environment (like changing\nconditions, uneven surfaces, weather simulations like\nrain/wind, etc.) then the behavior would have to be\nmore complex to achieve the goal, right?\n\nAn exciting area to me is that of evolvable hardware. \nI think it would be fascinating to evolve the\nmorphology of an agent along with its neural net\ncontrol mechanisms in a complex 3D simulation.  Just\nas with biological organisms, the body and mind could\ncomplexify in a sort of feedback loop.  \n\nWe&#39;re pretty far from being able to do something like\nthis, but would such a domain be open-ended enough for\nyou? :)\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
