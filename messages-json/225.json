This is done without changing the\nweights nor thresholds.  The memory is in the state\nvector of this highly recurrent ANN.  The weights and\nthresholds are established by neuroevolution.  NEAT is\nnot used.  The software is in C; it is extensively documented.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
