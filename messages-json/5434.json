I commend you on the excellent\nwork. It is very well written, thorough, and interesting. Are you planning\non submitting it for publication? I think it would be well-received.\n\nOut of curiosity, did you try your pattern recognition tasks (e.g., the ones\nin fig. 8) without scaling? Do you know whether evolving at the highest\nresolution is easier/harder for HyperNEAT than evolving at lower resolutions\nand scaling up? I am talking about performance per generation, not\nperformance per amount of cpu/clock time.\n\nOn pg. 58 you mention that nodes could be represented in 3D instead of 2D.\nYou may already be aware of this, but I actually tried that with the\nQuadruped Gait evolution problem. We found that 3D did not help vs. 2D\n(although both 3D and 2D beat 1D).\n\nThat work is described in this paper:\n\nClune J, Pennock RT, and Ofria C (2009). The sensitivity of HyperNEAT to\ndifferent geometric representations of a problem. Proceedings of the Genetic\nand Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO). 675-682.\n\nCongrats again on the excellent work, and thanks for sending it to the list.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Laboratory\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n**Call for papers!

The abstract is below; the thesis is\n&gt; attached. As part of this work I created a Java implementation of\n&gt; HyperNEAT, it is currently available on the NEAT group page in the files\n&gt; section and should soon be up on the HyperNEAT User&#39;s Page (when Ken\n&gt; gets around to it).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; In this study a recently developed neuroevolution method, HyperNEAT, is\n&gt; applied to new tasks in order to learn more about its characteristics in\n&gt; general and for the tasks specifically. The tasks required directly\n&gt; processing raw image data, including some from a robot-mounted camera,\n&gt; requiring the neural networks to directly process hundreds or thousands\n&gt; of inputs. The tasks included object recognition and robot navigation.\n&gt; The complexity and properties of the tasks, as well as the neural\n&gt; network substrate topologies, were varied and the performance and\n&gt; characteristics of the evolutionary process and solutions generated were\n&gt; analysed. Positive results were achieved for non-trivial tasks, and some\n&gt; important characteristics of HyperNEAT not previously reported were\n&gt; discovered: a bias towards generating weight patterns aligned with the\n&gt; topographical arrangement of neurons within the layers of the substrate\n&gt; network; the impact on performance of the number of dimensions in the\n&gt; topographical arrangement of neurons in hidden layers; the ability to\n&gt; evolve solutions more quickly with larger substrate networks; and a\n&gt; possible difficulty co-evolving weight patterns for substrate networks\n&gt; containing more than one hidden layer. New directions for further\n&gt; research and possible enhancements to HyperNEAT are proposed based on\n&gt; these findings.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; *E:* oliver@...\n&gt; *P:* 0421 972 953 (Aus.), +61 421 972 953 (Intl.)\n&gt; *Skype:* oliver.coleman\n&gt; *W:* www.e-geek.com.au - /commercial web services./\n&gt; *W:* www.enviro-geek.net - /not-for-profit web services./\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
