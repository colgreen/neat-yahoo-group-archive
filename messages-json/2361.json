Probably I&#39;ll be working on a few\n&gt;&gt;odds and ends for a while like the compat threshold idea, but also just\n&gt;&gt;updating the web site and thinking about which direction to go in. E.g.\n&gt;&gt;your approach of evaluating all board states got me thinking that NEAT\n&gt;&gt;in its current guise is rarely going to be able to do well at problems\n&gt;&gt;where we can only evaluate a small sub-set of test cases at each\n&gt;&gt;evaluation. The fitness functions cause the population to chase very\n&gt;&gt;specific points in the fitness space, like how kids chase a football\n&gt;&gt;around a playground, all clumped around the ball.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is where co-evolution can come in.  When there&#39;s no specific \n&gt;fitness function, then the individuals are free to exploit any and \n&gt;every aspect of the problem.  Of course they might still get stuck in \n&gt;some tiny little area of strategy, but in theory the fact that the \n&gt;fitness function is implicit means it _can_ cover anything...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMaybe it can do but more often than not it doesn&#39;t, hence your resorting \nto testing all board states for TTT.  All I can see is that the number \nof directions a game can go in are so many that a fitness function \ncannot ever keep track of all of them except in teh most simple cases. \nHence if you&#39;re modifying weights, topology or whatever then you want \nsome indication of how important that piece of structure is.
