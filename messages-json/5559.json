We investigate whether the types of neu=\r\nral networks produced by\nHyperNEAT are different from those produced by DSE=\r\n (an iterative,\ngrowth-based encoding).

DSE combines elements of =\r\ntwo powerful generative encodings,\nCellular Encoding and HyperNEAT, in orde=\r\nr to evolve networks that are\nmodular, regular, scale-free, and scalable. G=\r\nenerating networks with these\nproperties is important because they can enha=\r\nnce performance and\nevolvability. We test DSE=B9s ability to generate scale=\r\n-free and modular\nnetworks by explicitly rewarding these properties and see=\r\ning whether\nevolution can produce networks that possess them. We compare th=\r\ne networks\nDSE evolves to those of HyperNEAT. The results show that both en=\r\ncodings can\nproduce scale-free networks, although DSE performs slightly, bu=\r\nt\nsignificantly, better on this objective. DSE networks are far more modula=\r\nr\nthan HyperNEAT networks. Both encodings produce regular networks. We furt=\r\nher\ndemonstrate that individual DSE genomes during development can scale up=\r\n a\nnetwork pattern to accommodate different numbers of inputs. We also comp=\r\nare\nDSE to HyperNEAT on a pattern recognition problem. DSE significantly\nou=\r\ntperforms HyperNEAT, suggesting that its potential lay not just in the\nprop=\r\nerties of the networks it produces, but also because it can compete with\nle=\r\nading encodings at solving challenging problems. These preliminary results\n=\r\nimply that DSE is an interesting new encoding worthy of additional study.\nT=\r\nhe results also raise questions about which network properties are more\nlik=\r\nely to be produced by different types of generative encodings.\n\n\n\nPS. Becau=\r\nse there is not a current working distribution of Cellular\nEncoding, this e=\r\nncoding can serve as a descendent of CE if people wish to\ncompare against t=\r\nhis type of encoding.

DSE combines elements of two powerful generative encodings, Cellular En=\r\ncoding and HyperNEAT, in order to evolve networks that are modular, regular=\r\n, scale-free, and scalable. Generating networks with these properties is im=\r\nportant because they can enhance performance and evolvability.

DSE significantly outperforms HyperNEAT, suggesting that its p=\r\notential lay not just in the properties of the networks it produces, but al=\r\nso because it can compete with leading encodings at solving challenging pro=\r\nblems.
