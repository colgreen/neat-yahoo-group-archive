He found it could make a big\nimpact.  If you feel performance could improve, it may be worth\nexperimenting with activation functions a bit.  Maybe Mattias can\ncomment on this since he went through a lot of interesting discoveries\non that front.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Well, we finally got our implementation firing on all\n&gt; cylinders.
