It would \nbe really inter=\r\nesting. \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It does bring up an intriguing issue about role assignment in \ntea=\r\nms.\n&gt;  &gt;  Is it best for each agent to have a fixed role that is assigned \n=\r\na\n&gt;  &gt;  priori, or should roles constantly change based on position?\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\nChanging the roles based on position resembles the &quot;virtual force\n&gt;  field&quot;=\r\n or &quot;potential field&quot; control method, something that at least\n&gt;  used to be=\r\n common in some robotics application. In such methods, \nthe\n&gt;  world is ove=\r\nrlaid with a (ususally 2d) force field, where each \npoint\n&gt;  has an associa=\r\nted vector that influences the movement of the robot.\n&gt;  Having obstacles e=\r\nmit a repulsive field and targets an attractor \nfield\n&gt;  solves some naviga=\r\ntion problems elegantly.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The big difference is of course that positio=\r\nn-based multiagent\n&gt;  hyperneat encodes a complete behaviour rather than ju=\r\nst a force\n&gt;  vector.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;  For example, in soccer, the roles are ass=\r\nigned based on a kind \nof\n&gt;  &gt;  virtual configuration of players that may n=\r\never actually exist \non the\n&gt;  &gt;  field after the initial kickoff. As a res=\r\nult, if e.g. a forward \ndrops\n&gt;  &gt;  back momentarily to play defense, he do=\r\nes not suddenly switch \nroles\n&gt;  &gt;  and *become* a fullback. Rather, he goe=\r\ns back to being a \nforward.\n&gt; \n&gt;  On the other hand, in ant societies, I th=\r\nink at least some of the\n&gt;  role-switching (fight, gather food, feed the yo=\r\nung etc.) is done\n&gt; depending on where the ant happens to be\n&gt;  (relative t=\r\no breeding grounds, enemies, food etc.) rather than who \nit grew up\n&gt;  as. =\r\nThe same would go, I guess, for soldiers in a battle \nsituation. I\n&gt;  guess=\r\n that in most scenarios, there are some aspects of any role \nthat\n&gt;  are de=\r\nfined a priori and some that are situation-dependent.\n&gt; \n&gt;  By the way, it&#39;=\r\ns a very interesting idea, and a good paper!\n&gt; \n&gt;  Julian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;  Wh=\r\nat would happen if your role in soccer switched \ninstantaneously with\n&gt;  &gt; =\r\n your position? Then the team could end up with problems where \ne.g.\n&gt;  &gt;  =\r\neveryone on the team becomes offense at the same time by \naccident\n&gt;  &gt;  si=\r\nmply because they momentarily moved up the field. Then who \nwill go\n&gt;  &gt;  b=\r\nack to defend? It seems there is a use to roles defined a \npriori.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;  Yet I imagine in other domains role makes more sense based on \ncurrent\n&gt;=\r\n  &gt;  position alone. So it is probably domain-dependent, and an\n&gt;  &gt;  inter=\r\nesting issue to think about.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  ken\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  --- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; One thing I thought about when I read the paper was, what \nwou=\r\nld\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; happen if the CPPN generates the connectivity patterns \ndependin=\r\ng on\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; the relative positions of each individual in realtime while \no=\r\nn the\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; field?

In this \nway,\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT can learn an expression that encodes how policies \nvary\n&gt; =\r\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; over the team geometry. For example, in a soccer team \nagents vary\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt; from defensive to offensive as you move away from the goal. \nPart=\r\n\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; of\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt; the power of this approach is that it means basic ski=\r\nlls \ncan be\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt; learned and shared among the whole team, since the CP=\r\nPN \nencodes how\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt; those skills vary across the field.\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  --\n&gt;  Julian Togelius\n=\r\n&gt;  IDSIA\n&gt;  Galleria 2\n&gt;  6928 Manno-Lugano\n&gt;  Switzerland\n&gt;  julian@...\n&gt; =\r\n http://julian.togelius.com\n&gt;  http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt;  +41-764-110=\r\n679\n&gt;  +46-705-192088\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; IDSIA\n&gt; Galleria 2=\r\n\n&gt; 6928 Manno-Lugano\n&gt; Switzerland\n&gt; julian@...\n&gt; http://julian.togelius.co=\r\nm\n&gt; http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; +46-705-192088\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
