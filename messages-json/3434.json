How exactly does this work? Doesn&#39;t\n&gt; the CPPN need =\r\nto know of a hidden layer at the start?  It looks to \nme\n&gt; like there is on=\r\nly an input/source layer and an output/target layer\n&gt; that&#39;s being mapped i=\r\nn the state-space sandwich.\n&gt; \n\nWesley, the paper is talking about adding a=\r\n hidden node to the CPPN, \nnot to the substrate.  The substrate, as you men=\r\ntion, has no hidden \nnodes.\n\nYou can however create a substrate with hidden=\r\n nodes if you want.  We \nalready have some experiments running here with hi=\r\ndden nodes with \ngood results.  There are several ways to add hidden nodes,=\r\n e.g. you \ncould embed them into a 3D or 2D substrate structure.  There are=\r\n \nother options as well.\n\n&gt; 2) Why were tests run against P-NEAT and not ag=\r\nainst regular NEAT? \nWas\n&gt; it just for saving computational resources?\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nThe problem is that HyperNEAT optimizes in this problem only the \ndirect li=\r\nnks from inputs to outputs.  We wanted \nto compare it to a system with the =\r\nequivalent optimization problem, \ni.e. one with exactly the same number of =\r\ndimensions (connections) to \noptimize in the phenotype.  With regular NEAT,=\r\n the number of \ndimensions would vary.\n\nContrary to the usual case with reg=\r\nular NEAT, in this problem adding \nstructure could be a liability because o=\r\nf the enormous number of \nconnections in the initial population.  It is alr=\r\neady in a massive \n&gt;10,000 dimensional space just with the zero-hidden-node=\r\n starter \npopulation, so in fact in this case, NEAT will likely do no bette=\r\nr \nthan P-NEAT and probably worse.\n\nHowever, our main motivation for using =\r\nP-NEAT was simply to ensure \nthat the comparison was between two systems th=\r\nat optimized exactly \nthe same set of connections.\n\nken\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I loved the p=\r\naper though overall.  It&#39;s really exciting and \nhopefully\n&gt; I&#39;ll be able to=\r\n use it in a project I&#39;m planning on starting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
