When the validation sco=\r\nres start\n&gt; &gt;going down, you stop evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using SharpNEAT and =\r\nam new to all this so I would appreciate a\n&gt; little more detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hav=\r\ne implemented two interface, IExperiment and INetworkEvaluator.\n&gt; Neither i=\r\nnterface appears to have any concept of a generation or of a\n&gt; champion. It=\r\n looks to me like I might want/need to subclass\n&gt; SingleFilePopulationEvalu=\r\nator so that I can override\n&gt; EvaluatePopulation. I can then call the super=\r\nclass&#39; EvaluatePopulation\n&gt; and after it completes do my validation testing=\r\n on the\n&gt; EvolutionAlgorithm&#39;s BestGenome. I was then thinking\n&gt; that once =\r\nI wished to stop evolution, I could set the\n&gt; EvolutionAlgorithm SearchComp=\r\nleted boolean. Finally, I can modify\n&gt; SharpNeatGui&#39;s SearchThread to check=\r\n the ea&#39;s SearchCompleted flag so\n&gt; that the thread will stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I on=\r\n the right track here?
