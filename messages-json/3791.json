I suppose that to have a fair comparison, each algorithm\nsh=\r\nould be tested with different parameter settings to determine its\nideal set=\r\nting. My question is, how comprehensive should it be? (eg.\nfor 1 variable, =\r\nshould we test 10 different values? should we have 10\ntrials for each run?)=\r\n This has become my concern because I don&#39;t want\nto waste too much time in =\r\nfinding the right parameters.\n\nI am mostly concerned with finding the appro=\r\npriate mutation\nprobabilities (mut add link, mut add node, mut link weight,=\r\n mut power).\n\nI looked through some papers on how they chose their paramete=\r\nrs when\ncomparing, and noticed that researchers usually say that the settin=\r\ngs\nare found experimentally, without mention of how comprehensive it is.\nAl=\r\nso, most don&#39;t show experimental statistics of these parameter\ntesting. Is =\r\nit because such thing is trivial? \n\nI appreciate your answers. Thanks!\n\n\n\n"}}
