But I\n&gt; didn&#39;t have the opportunity to check your work\n\nI had nothing to do with developing Soccerbots (if\nthat&#39;s what you&#39;re saying).  I&#39;m just making some\nminor adaptations to it to use with NEAT.  It was\ndeveloped by some folks at Carnegie Mellon University\nand Georgia Tech.\n\n&gt; mainly because I need to work\n&gt; with the RobotSoccer simulator developed by Dr Jun\n&gt; Jo for competition (you\n&gt; can download it here\n&gt; http://www.fira.net/soccer/simurosot/overview.html).\n&gt; I&#39;ve done work exclusively for this league\n&gt; (Simurosot 5x5) so we have to get\n&gt; used to that particular simulator. \n\nAh, okay.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not planning\n&gt; to work with real robots\n&gt; because we cannot afford any of that around here.\n\nThey are expensive, aren&#39;t they? :)\n\n&gt; One of the main disadvantages for applying a\n&gt; neuroevolution technique with\n&gt; this simulator is that you can only run the\n&gt; simulator in real time (no\n&gt; offline fast non-graphic simulation available) so it\n&gt; should take a long time\n&gt; and patience.\n\nYes...that is a big disadvantage.  Soccerbots has a\ngraphics-off mode, which is many times faster than\ngraphical mode.  It&#39;s a shame you&#39;re stuck with using\nthat particular simulator.\n\n&gt; Anyway I&#39;m interested in your work specially if\n&gt; you&#39;ll be doing\n&gt; neuroevolution, perhaps we can share some material\n&gt; later on when I have\n&gt; something to share! ;-) (we should discuss what are\n&gt; our points in common,\n&gt; perhaps we can establish a common NEAT framework for\n&gt; 5x5).\n\nWell, we&#39;re primarily interested in game board\ndomains, but we thought it would be a good idea to\nintegrate a robot control domain into our\nimplementation, and robot soccer seemed like a good\none.  At least we&#39;re both interested in domains with\nsimilar field dimensions and similar team sizes.\n\nI don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been following the XML\ndiscussion, or have dipped back into the message\narchive, but if we can agree on a common format for\nchromosomes and/or networks, we would easily be able\nto share populations between implementations, no\nmatter their platform or language.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nGet better spam protection with Yahoo!
