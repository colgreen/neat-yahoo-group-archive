(In a lot of \ncases X0 is zero.)  This is a very natural form of decay (e.g. many \nchemical reactions have these kinetics as does radioactive decay and the \nsimpler kinds of thermal equilibration) and also dead cheap to \ncalculate.  Its downside is that it is only asymptotic to x0 and \ntechnically never quite reaches it, but that&#39;s quite common with natural \nphenomena.\n\n         The other thing is that keeping an array of values from previous \ntimesteps feels a bit unnatural to me also.  It&#39;s a bit like a &quot;bucket \nbrigade&quot; delay line (an electronic circuit) and if I was building one of \nthose I&#39;d expect to use a row of neurones.\n\n         Anyway, I would use first-order decay if I were doing it.\n\n         Ian B\n\nAt 17:01 30/10/2004, you wrote:\n&gt;I pasted the code I was playing with for &#39;leaky&#39; integration.
