As long as you do that,\ngeneration 0 will have spe=\r\ncies.  You shouldn&#39;t get the exception as\nlong as you don&#39;t call produceNex=\r\ntGeneration before finishEvaluations.\n Notice how there is a &quot;generations&gt;0=\r\n&quot; if within that for loop.\n\nSorry for making it backwards like that, but if=\r\n I put the\nproduceNextGeneration at the end of the for loop instead of doin=\r\ng it\nthe way I did, then it would produce an extra generation at the end\nth=\r\nat would not get used.\n\nAs a side note, I found out that within the Genetic=\r\nSpecies::makeBabies\nroutine, it can get stuck in an infinite loop.  I&#39;m not=\r\n sure how it\nhappend, but until I figure it out, I&#39;ve replaced the while(tr=\r\nue)\nloops with for loops which try 1,000,000 times and then bail by\nchoosin=\r\ng the most fit in the species and doing asexual reproduction. \nIt&#39;s only ha=\r\nppend once so it might never happen to you, but just\nthought I&#39;d let you kn=\r\now.\n\nI&#39;ve made several other improvements too, including a better random\nge=\r\nnerator.  Once I get beyond this next milestone, I&#39;ll release an\nimproved v=\r\nersion.\n\nThanks a lot for your input, if you still can&#39;t get it to run, don=\r\n&#39;t\nhesitate to reply and I&#39;ll try to help you as best I can.\n\n\n--- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason,\n&gt; \n&gt;    Review of=\r\n the NEAT portion of the HyperNEAT code indicates that \n&gt; speciate (and siz=\r\ne thereof via pushback), is only called from \n&gt; adjustFitness, which is cal=\r\nled from ExperimentRun::finishEvaluations. \n&gt; The seeming signifcance of th=\r\nis is that the size of species is zero for \n&gt; generation 0, which in itself=\r\n is not a problem, but there results an \n&gt; exception in\n&gt; GeneticPopulation=\r\n::produceNextGeneration, associated with a call to \n&gt; getSpecies. Since the=\r\n species ID is undefined for generation 0 (since \n&gt; speciate has not yet be=\r\nen called), the test &quot;if(species[a]-\n&gt; &gt;getID()=3D=3Did)&quot; will not be true.=\r\n Was this intended?
