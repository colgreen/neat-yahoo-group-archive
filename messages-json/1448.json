Have you \nconsidered getting a Ph.D? :P  Seriously, that is good research \ngetting to the bottom of these questions.\n\nI think your proposed changes to SharpNEAT make good sense.  I also \ndo not kill off the top species, so I came to the same conclusion.  \nBut the idea of only adding a % of excess and disjoint genes I am \nunsure about.  If a complex of genes has formed that are all \ninterdependent, that could be a bad move.  Maybe safer would be to \njust make adding *all* the excess and disjoint genes probabilistic.  \n\nOn the other hand, the real question of how to do it can only be \naddressed through comparisons of the types you&#39;ve been doing, i.e. \nruns with one method vs. runs with another.  \n\nIn any case, the insight on fitness functions and how they affect \ncomplexity because of the idiosyncracies of my NEAT implementation \nare quite revealing.\n\nIt seems though that the most important conclusion so far is that \nphasing is a very good idea.  But it would be good to get more \nresults backing that up so we can be confident about it.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok I&#39;ve done some more experimenting and I&#39;m starting to get some \n&gt; answers now. Firstly, I stick by what I said previously...\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I still beleive \n&gt; &gt;that the drop in population fitness is due to the phenomena I \ndescribed, \n&gt; &gt;that is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1) A rising species compatibilty threshold caused by the quickly \nrising \n&gt; &gt;complexity. This causes like species to be combined into fewer \nspecies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2) SharpNEAT culling fit species when they reach the drop off age.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;3) SharpNEATs current crossover technique which is very likely \ncausing \n&gt; &gt;complexity to rise far quicker than in other NEAT implementations \nand \n&gt; &gt;thus exacerbating (1).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; For brevity I&#39;ll refer to the two crossover techniques as, \nOriginal NEAT \n&gt; crossover (Co) and Inclusive crossover (Ci). Ci being the \ntechnique that \n&gt; SharpNEAT currently uses whereby the disjoint and excess genes are \n&gt; always included from both parents, regardless of which is fittest. \nKens \n&gt; NEAT only does this when the parents have equal fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did some runs of my OCR domain. Witha complexifying run, when \nusing Co \n&gt; instead of Ci the complexity still rises in a roughly linear \nmanner but \n&gt; does so slower. The result is that the population fitness rises \nquickly \n&gt; to about 100 and then maintains this level, perhaps with a slight \ndrop \n&gt; off (so very similar to the blended run graph in my write-up). A \nblended \n&gt; run gave a similar profile but reaching a peak fitness of 120.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok so now consider that Derek&#39;s blended runs with ANJI/Tic-Tac-Toe \n&gt; demonstrated a steady amount of complexity. Why is SharpNEAT \nshowing a \n&gt; steady rise but ANJI not?  The answer lies in the domains being \nused and \n&gt; the fitness schemes used. I tried SharpNEAT with the TTT domain \nand Co, \n&gt; the result was a steady amount of complexity, rising from a start \nvalue \n&gt; of 10 to just 11.5 in 1000 generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because TTT is non-determinstic the fitness values assigend to \neach \n&gt; genome will almost always be different, even for very similar or \n&gt; identical genomes. This means that the part of Co that includes \ngenes \n&gt; from both parents when their fitness is equal will hardly ever be \n&gt; invoked. In contrast the OCR experiment only has 27 distinct \nfitness \n&gt; values (0 to 260 in steps of  10) and within an evolving \npopulation most \n&gt; of the genomes will have about the same fitness. This means that \nCo will \n&gt; actually be performing inclusive crossover most of the time, which \nin \n&gt; turn causes complexity to rise.\n&gt; \n&gt; So OCR&#39;s fitness scheme causes the inclusive crossover to be \ninvoked, \n&gt; which in turn causes complexity to rise which  causes species to \nbecome \n&gt; merged. The overall population fitness then drops when the few \ngood \n&gt; species are culled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully this explains the discrepancies noted so far. It&#39;s \ninteresting \n&gt; that only a slight increase in the rate that complexity rises \ncauses the \n&gt; population fitness to drop off, but then this is tied to the \nspecies \n&gt; culling age, the greater the age the greater the amount of \ntolerance \n&gt; towards rising complexity. If you cross some threshold then the \npop. \n&gt; fitness will collapse.\n&gt; \n&gt; In light of all this I&#39;m going to make a few changes to SharpNEAT, \n#1 \n&gt; being the preservation of the fittest species. If  there are \nseveral \n&gt; species with the maximum species then I will just cull them as \nnormal, \n&gt; so I only preserve the fittest species if is the only one. Yeh \nthat \n&gt; should work I think. By culling the fittest species I think I was \ntrying \n&gt; to achieve to much in the context of a single search, it&#39;s better \nto \n&gt; allow the user to decide when a search has stagnated and needs \n&gt; resetting. I suppose I could add in a new, &#39;re-start age&#39; \nparameter that \n&gt; detects when the entire search has stagnated for some [large] # of \n&gt; generations and resets the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also think that getting crossover to include genes from both \nparents \n&gt; more often would be a good thing. Though perhaps not the 100% \ninclusive \n&gt; scheme I&#39;ve been using up until now, perhaps 10% of the genes from \nthe \n&gt; weakest parent and I&#39;ll parameterize this value.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
