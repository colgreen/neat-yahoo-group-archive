I am running the\n&gt; c++ implementation and the only thing I thought needed changing was the\n&gt; evaluation function more specifically how the errorsum was calculated\n&gt; i.e.\n&gt; for &quot;or&quot;\n&gt;     errorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\n&gt; and for &quot;and&quot;\n&gt;     errorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem is that when I run the program for OR and AND it rarely\n&gt; finds a solution and if it does the final network seems overly complex\n&gt; and usually takes many more generations than XOR despite being a\n&gt; &quot;simpler&quot; function.  My question is whether there should be more to\n&gt; change in the program or if neat is just better with XOR than AND or\n&gt; OR(I don&#39;t see why that would be...).  I figured since they were all\n&gt; binary logic functions the parameters could stay the same and the\n&gt; starting genome seemed as simple as it got so that didn&#39;t look like a\n&gt; problem.  I&#39;m not too familiar with neat yet; maybe I&#39;m overlooking\n&gt; something simple so any tips would help.   Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; irvin h.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
