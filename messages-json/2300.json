This is a single floating point value \n&gt;stored on each item (board or rule).  When an input node wishes to find an \n&gt;item, it uses a target FID of its own (it has two, one for rules and one \n&gt;for boards) and simply locates the closest FID in the list of items to the \n&gt;one it is looking for.\n&gt;\n&gt;I believe this technique (which is a form of what I call &quot;arbitrary \n&gt;labelling&quot;) to be very powerful, although whether 1 dimensional values are \n&gt;sufficient, I don&#39;t yet know.  But this is a different discussion.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJust wanted to comment on this idea of Ian&#39;s. I used a similar scheme in \nan old NEAT-like prototype back in 2000. Each genome described neurons \nand connections just as in NEAT. The difference was that each neuron had \na position represented by a single floating point value, so effectively \nthe neurons existised in a line (one dimension), each neuron gene then \nwas associated with a list of connection genes, each containing a length \nvalue. Negative length indicated a connection back along the line, and \npositive length a forward connection. Of course there is no guarantee \nthat a neuron exists at the end point of a connection so I used a \n&#39;linking&#39; routine that just selected the nearest neuron. I suppose you \ncould specify not to link if the nearest neuron&#39;s distance is greater \nthan some value.\n\nI arrived at this scheme because the neuron genes were in fact  arranged \nin a tree structure, with their position being determined relative to \ntheir parent gene with only the root neuron gene having an absolute \nposition defined within the genome. What this meant was that any \nsub-tree at any level could be moved around without destroying the \nnetwork topology described by that sub-tree, and that it could \npotentially connect to other parts of the network outside the subtree, \nparts that the subtree was unaware of.\n\nOk there was a bit more to it than this, but essentially that&#39;s what I \ndid, or tried to do anyway. One result of this scheme is that re-use or \nmodularity is built in but the modules aren&#39;t fixed entities, any \nsub-tree can be considered to be a module and can be copied and pasted \nto some other point on the genome.\n\nOne notable problem was deciding on connection lengths, relative neuron \npositions for new genes etc. in relation to where all of the current \nneurons are in the decoded network. If you get this wrong then the \nsystem performs a very inefficient search of the search space, e.g. \nalways connecting to the &#39;outer&#39; neurons at the ends of the 1D space.\n\nI can&#39;t say whether this works due to other problems with my set up, but \nit&#39;s definitely something I would like to get back to someday if I get time.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
