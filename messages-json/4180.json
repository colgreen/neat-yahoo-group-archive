You will see some non-oscillating behaviors a=\r\nlong \nthe way, but it is OK as these are novel early in evolution and later=\r\n \ngenetic defects lead to stabilizing substrates sometimes. \n\nI hope you wi=\r\nll enjoy it too. :) \n\nLet me answer your questions. Yes, I do mean that the=\r\n individuals \nstay in the mid-air, but their behavior is no longer distance=\r\n \ntravelled or arrival point, but the internal oscillation behavior of \nthe=\r\n output nodes. Actually the values in the behavior \ncharacterization&#39;s vect=\r\nor are a measure of the frequency of \noscillations. There are restriction t=\r\no this, too, because the \nsubstrate&#39;s nodes can have a time constant range =\r\nof (2.5 .. 5) and \nthe timestep of simulation is a kind of normal one consi=\r\ndering there \nare 8 seconds for an individual&#39;s lifetime. So cases of just =\r\nquickly \nblinking the activations should not appear. At least not frequentl=\r\ny. \n\nI think these behaviors (like walking or swimming) are a good \nsteppin=\r\ng stone for further evolution (perhaps fitness search with an \nexplicit obj=\r\nective). Once the general pattern of a walking or \nswimming behavior has be=\r\nen discovered, this itself is a good stepping \nstone for the harder task (N=\r\nS) or a fitness search. Though I am not \nplanning to do such an experiment =\r\nyet. \n\nThanks for your kind yours :) \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a fascinati=\r\nng experiment with the zero-gravity novelty \nsearch.\n&gt;  Would you consider =\r\nuploading it so we can see the walkers and\n&gt; swimmers evolve?\n&gt; \n&gt; One ques=\r\ntion I have is when you say you get walkers &quot;100% of the\n&gt; time,&quot; you mean =\r\nthey look like that are walking, but they are not\n&gt; actually walking right?=\r\n  That is, these &quot;walkers&quot; are really just\n&gt; floating in mid-air, and if yo=\r\nu actually placed them on the ground\n&gt; with gravity, they would probably no=\r\nt balance?  Similarly, the\n&gt; swimmers may or may not swim in the friction o=\r\nf water?  In other \nwords\n&gt; you are discovering the aesthetic look of vario=\r\nus activities but not\n&gt; necessarily the mechanical nuances?\n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming I=\r\n am understanding that correctly, there is still a puzzle \nto\n&gt; get them to=\r\n go straight to walking on hard ground through novelty\n&gt; search.   But I th=\r\nink you&#39;re oscillation-detection novelty\n&gt; characterization is quite clever=\r\n and is progress in that direction.\n&gt; Very interesting work overall! \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am glad that you like my program an=\r\nd enjoy it! :) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know it would be cool to browse the archive, or =\r\nhave an \nexternal \n&gt; &gt; routine that queries the archive by different criter=\r\nia to show me \n&gt; &gt; what was achieved during the run, but this program now i=\r\ns \nactually a \n&gt; &gt; stepping stone for another research project I have, evol=\r\nving \nleaky-\n&gt; &gt; integrator substrates by HyperNEAT combined with evolving =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; substrate itself, all used in one Alife simulation of mass-spring =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; creatures, sensing collision and reacting by contracting the \nsprings.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; And all this with Novelty Search searching for new and new \nbehaviors=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; I believe that this is a pretty serious test of how far \ncomplexity =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; can go in such open-ended domain. I can later mix it with fitness \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n search once a good population has evolved, on objectives \n&gt; &gt; like &quot;swimmi=\r\nng&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me mention about one interesting experiment I made with =\r\nthe \nNS \n&gt; &gt; NEVH. I restricted the substrate connectivity so that output-\n=\r\n&gt;output \n&gt; &gt; connections are not queried. Then I made the environment to 0 =\r\n\ngravity \n&gt; &gt; and removed the ground plane. The behavior characterization w=\r\nas \n&gt; &gt; changed like this. The behavior data is a vector of 15 doubles \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n representing the outputs. Each time an output oscillates (going \nto \n&gt; &gt; +=\r\ntreshold and then -treshold, or vice versa), its corresponding \nplace \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nin the vector is incremented. \n&gt; &gt; So the vector is actually counting how m=\r\nany oscillations the \noutputs \n&gt; &gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate osc=\r\nillating with high \nfrequency \n&gt; &gt; is very far in the behavior space. Diffe=\r\nrent outputs oscillating \nare \n&gt; &gt; counted too. The behavior distance metri=\r\nc is the eucledian \ndistance \n&gt; &gt; between these 15-D vectors. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So =\r\nnovelty search now has to find new ways to oscillate the \nentire \n&gt; &gt; body,=\r\n to do repeating movements. In all the runs, Novelty Search \nwith \n&gt; &gt; Hype=\r\nrNEAT finds walking gaits 100% of the time, in the first 1000 \n&gt; &gt; evaluati=\r\nons. There are also swimming gaits and all kind of stuff \n(I \n&gt; &gt; saw one i=\r\nndividual actually dancing :)) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what was stopping it from walki=\r\nng before, is the gravity. \nKeeping \n&gt; &gt; balance on one leg and trying to w=\r\nalk at the same time turns out \nto \n&gt; &gt; be very hard task. One environmenta=\r\nl constraint that would be \nuseful \n&gt; &gt; to make it walk is, when only one f=\r\noot has stepped on the ground, \n&gt; &gt; stick that foot to the ground. So the c=\r\nhance the humanoid to fall \nis \n&gt; &gt; minimized. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for the novelty=\r\n search stagnation, where getting new behaviors \n&gt; &gt; becomes hard, the popu=\r\nlation begins to do something like a random \n&gt; &gt; probing anything that is n=\r\not the same stuff. Then it begins to \nrely \n&gt; &gt; entirely on mutation to get=\r\n out somehow. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Cl=\r\nune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I finally borrowed a windows machine from =\r\nsomeone and looked at \n&gt; &gt; this.

The visualizati=\r\non I just \nproposed \n&gt; &gt; might help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on this front.
