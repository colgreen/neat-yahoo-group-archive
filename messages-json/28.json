From there, mutations could proceed as in NEAT (or\nyou could allow module mutations on module nodes\nthemselves, and have modules within modules within\nmodules).  I don&#39;t know how this would work, but I\nthink it&#39;s worth playing with.\n\n&gt; Right. That first paper definately wasn&#39;t anything I\n&gt; want to publish. It\n&gt; was more like a &quot;proof of concept.&quot; The idea works\n&gt; (more or less) so this\n&gt; semester I&#39;m going to be testing it on much larger\n&gt; domains.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep you posted.\n\nAs I said, I look forward to it. :)  Any idea of which\ndomains you would possibly apply modular NEAT to?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
