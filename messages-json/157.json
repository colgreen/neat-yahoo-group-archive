I hope one of our\nreaders will use NEAT to make a player.\n\nI think the code is easy to understand if you know C.\nI&#39;m willing to help with more explanations if\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
