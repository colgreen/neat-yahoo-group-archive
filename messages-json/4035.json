The risk is that in some domains there \nis little to gain by=\r\n evolving the substrate.  Also, it depends on \nwhat aspect of the substrate=\r\n is being evolved.  For example, the \nconfiguration of sensors has a differ=\r\nent implication than the \nconfiguration of hidden nodes, or both together.\n=\r\n\nIn general, I think the important thing is to guide the choice of \ndomain =\r\nbased on the principle you hope to demonstrate.  If it is \nthat e.g. an alg=\r\norithm that can increase the density of the \nsubstrate can evolve a very co=\r\nmplex network wherein that complexity \nis leveraged effectively, then it is=\r\n important to choose a domain \nwhere such complexity is needed.  That is no=\r\nt a trivial task, \nbecause in some domains, the problem might simply be too=\r\n hard to get \nstarted.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclun=\r\ne@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an exhilarating conversation.

When I think =\r\nabout evolving the substrate, I usually \nthink\n&gt; &gt; of a distribution of var=\r\nying densities rather than strict layers \nor\n&gt; &gt; preconceived architectures=\r\n, which is closest to Jeff&#39;s option \n(c).\n&gt; &gt; One reference for me is the h=\r\numan brain:  It has dense masses \nthat\n&gt; &gt; look different from each other a=\r\nrchitecturally and do not exist \nin\n&gt; &gt; layers with respect to each other (=\r\ne.g. the cerebellum vs. the \nbasal\n&gt; &gt; ganglia).  However, *within* particu=\r\nlar masses there is some \nlayering,\n&gt; &gt; such as in the neocortex, which is =\r\nperhaps the most important for\n&gt; &gt; high-level intelligence.  It would be ni=\r\nce if all that could just\n&gt; &gt; arise on its own to suit the task.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat you said about CPPN complexity and substrate complexity\n&gt; &gt; increasing =\r\ntogether is something I never thought of.  It&#39;s an\n&gt; &gt; interesting idea to =\r\ncorrelate the two.  You are right that in \ngeneral\n&gt; &gt; there is a problem w=\r\nith letting the nodes evolve in the substrate\n&gt; &gt; because it is so easy to =\r\nexpress a massive number of nodes, which\n&gt; &gt; would not always be needed.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; One problem I see is that we are talking about astronomical \nranges,=\r\n so\n&gt; &gt; the range in density may not really make sense to vary on a \ncontin=\r\nuum.\n&gt; &gt;  For example, if you have a number between 0 and 1 that \nrepresent=\r\ns a\n&gt; &gt; density somehow, then that density may range from several dozen\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n neurons to several billion (if we are talking about natural \nscales).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDoes this range really make sense on a continuum between 0 and 1?\n&gt; &gt; Maybe=\r\n we need to scale it exponentially or something like that, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; still, =\r\nthen you end up with a tiny mutation potentially \nincreasing the\n&gt; &gt; number=\r\n of neurons by billions.  That seems odd.  In a way, we&#39;d \nlike\n&gt; &gt; to not =\r\neven be in a circumscribed range and just let increases \nkeep\n&gt; &gt; happening=\r\n indefinitely, but not too much at a time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, the inputs and=\r\n outputs may be a special case.  We may \nwant to\n&gt; &gt; preserve the current h=\r\numan control of the geometry there and \nonly let\n&gt; &gt; evolution increase den=\r\nsity or something like that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is a great topic and a c=\r\nompletely untouched area of\n&gt; &gt; research with plenty of things left to try.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_cherve=\r\nnski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello Jeff, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I =\r\ndon&#39;t think that such assumptions about layered topology are \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; way =\r\nto achieve this. There are two fundamental things \nassociated with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any=\r\n substrate in 2D/3D. These are node presence and node \ndensity. In\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fac=\r\nt, skip the first, it just.. it can be thought of as spatial \nCPPN\n&gt; &gt;&gt; out=\r\nput where the output means the overall node density at that \nplace.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; An=\r\nd if the output there is less than 0.2, there are no nodes \n(sounds\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fa=\r\nmiliar? :)). \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; So the same connective CPPN is actually capable of=\r\n representing \nits\n&gt; &gt;&gt; own substrate. But this approach would generate too=\r\n big \nsubstrates.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Even the most simple CPPNs are able to generate a su=\r\nbstrate with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1000s of nodes and now imagine how many connections there=\r\n could \nbe.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; And this is for the simplest (!) CPPN. That sounds like a =\r\nhuge \nwaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of computational effort, doesn&#39;t it? ;)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; So what=\r\n is needed is a way to restrict the substrate complexity \nfor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; small CP=\r\nPNs. Of course more complex CPPNs can be allowed to \ngenerate\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more com=\r\nplex/dense substrates.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is actually just like complexificati=\r\non. First the major \nconcepts\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are established on a substrate with very=\r\n low resolution and as \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; CPPNs complexify, the substrate becomes mo=\r\nre complex. In fact \neach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; CPPN will generate a substrate based on its =\r\ncomplexity (say,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; num_nodes+num_links). Oh I think I mentioned that.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; What I am thinking is, if we actually allow substrates to \nevolve,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; does this mean that humans cannot inject that priory geometric\n&gt; &gt;&gt; k=\r\nnowledge any more? Or only for the inputs/outputs?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; It essentialy=\r\n becomes like.. like just a good indirect encoding.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nHello-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Many of you have said that it would be nice if the subs=\r\ntrate\n&gt; &gt;&gt; configuration\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of HyperNEAT was not pre-defined.
