I&#39;m working on a project and initially we were going to use acyclic networks to make things simpler, but when we tried activating it, it\n&gt; crashed. Switching to fast cyclic fixed the issue, so we have gone with that since. I just assumed that acyclic was still a work in progress.\n\nYes it&#39;s all completed, checked into SVN and is also part of the 2.1\nrelease zip.
