I tried HyperNEAT myself and there wasn&#39;t much \nbetter=\r\n result than regular NEAT. Besides, in HyperNEAT you are \nrestricted to a f=\r\nixed substrate topology (i.e. the networks that you \nevaluate will have the=\r\n same number of neurons) which may not be the \nright thing for this domain.=\r\n I believe there is an ongoing research \nabout evolving substrates but ther=\r\ne is still not a best method for \ndoing this. \nOf course HyperNEAT can lear=\r\nn basically everything that regular NEAT \ncan, but it is the computational =\r\neffort that must be considered. \nBuilding phenotypes in HyperNEAT is expens=\r\nive. Evaluating them is \nexpensive too, if the first individuals (with even=\r\n the simplest \nCPPNs) generate many connections. \nHyperNEAT is designed to =\r\ntackle problems that have geometric \nregularities, this is what it is best =\r\nof. In other domains without \nregularities it will perform worse than regul=\r\nar NEAT. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your last post was how I wanted to respond to Petar, =\r\nbut your\n&gt; explanation is much better.  From reading the published papers, =\r\nI\n&gt; can&#39;t find a penalty for using HyperNEAT even if NEAT by itself may\n&gt; s=\r\nuffice.  Am I correct here?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Todd\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, J=\r\neff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are other benefits to HyperNEAT th=\r\nat have nothing to do with\n&gt; geometry,\n&gt; &gt; no? It is an indirect encoding, =\r\nand thus is more likely to create\n&gt; modular\n&gt; &gt; phenotypes that exhibit rep=\r\netitions and symmetry (with and without\n&gt; &gt; variation).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unless I a=\r\nm mistaken, these benefits can cause HyperNEAT to\n&gt; outperform NEAT\n&gt; &gt; eve=\r\nn on problems where geometry is not being exploited.
