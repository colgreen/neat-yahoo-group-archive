They =\r\nhave a\nvery strong group in the area, especially when it comes to evolving\n=\r\nneural nets for autonomous agents (as opposed to pure pattern\nrecognition),=\r\n and a lot of interdisciplinarity - people from biology,\nphilosophy and inf=\r\normatics really take an interest in each other&#39;s\nwork.
