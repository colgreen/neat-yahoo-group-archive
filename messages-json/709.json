I am on a windows \nsystem, and would like some help in getting all the correct packages \nand version etc. in order to compile and run the NEAT experiments.\n  I would prefer to use cygwin g++.  Can anybody who has \nsuccessfully compiled NEAT under cygwin tell me the exact versions \nof what I need?  Links to any necessary packages would be good too.\n  I think the main problem I am having is incompatible versions of \nlibraries and the like.\n  I am not fussed about whether or not I use GTK-- or Guile, but I \nwould need help in modifying the source code.\n  I would like to experiment with NEAT, but after several days of \ncompiling problems and reading the archives of this list for help, I \nam nearly ready to give up.\n  Something that would be great is a zip file, or similar, where all \nI have to do is uncompress it and then run &quot;make&quot;.  Once I can run \nthe XOR experiment or similar, then I can focus my attention on \nwriting new code for my own experiments rather than spending most of \nthe time just trying to get the existing code to work.\n\nCheers,\nRobert.\n\n\n"}}
