It is often (in books, documentaries, etc) \ndiscussed as \n&gt; some intangible concept that is probably beyond the human mind to \n&gt; comprehend. I often recall a sentence in &#39;Plan and Purpose In \nNature&#39; by \n&gt; George Williams regarding early work on embyology:\n&gt; -----------\n&gt; The &quot;intrinisc processes&quot; of development so impressed the early \npioneers \n&gt; of experimental biology that many thought it obviously required \n&gt; supernatural guidance.\n&gt; -----------\n&gt; \n&gt; Although development in biology is still not even close to being \nfully \n&gt; understood, we do understand some of the underlying principles \nthat are \n&gt; at work and it&#39;s quite inconceivable (to me anyway) to suggest \nthat some \n&gt; supernatural forces are at work. And yet this is precisely what \nsome \n&gt; have suggested is behind the phenomenon of conciousness. I&#39;m going \nback \n&gt; probably 10 years here but one case of this was Roger Penrose&#39;s \nbook \n&gt; Shadows Of The Mind in which he attempts to prove mathematically \nthat \n&gt; conciousness cannot be described by an algorithm. He then goes on \nto \n&gt; suggest that neuron mitochondria may be somehow describing a much \nfiner \n&gt; (than relatively large neurons) information processing network \nthat \n&gt; operates at the quantum physical level, perhaps tapping into some \n&gt; unknown physical dimension.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, while it&#39;s an interesting idea it was my interpretation that \nthe \n&gt; book was effectively saying that conciousness is something which \nis \n&gt; supernatural and mysterious and it just feels like passing the \nbuck to me.\n&gt; \n\nI know consciousness is very controversial, and also a bit off the \nNEAT trail, so to speak, but just to put in my 2 cents it&#39;s probably \nnot fair to characterize the philosophical argument that \nconsciousness is not a physical phenomenon as &quot;supernatural.&quot;  It is \nnot contradictory to a scientific view that some phenomenon are \nguided by rules and phenomena that are currently not characterized.  \nThat wouldn&#39;t make such phenomena any more supernatural than energy \nor mass, which once had not been characterized scientifically either.\nAnyway, you make a valid point (and I don&#39;t mean to defend \nPenrose)..I&#39;m just trying to say that calling one \nside &quot;supernatural&quot; makes the debate sound a lot less legitimate \nthan I think it actually is.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This more abstract level of processing is what I reckon we would \ncall \n&gt; conciousnessness, although I do think that any system that senses \nit&#39;s \n&gt; surrounding in some way in order to drive it&#39;s behaviour \nis &#39;concious&#39; \n&gt; to some degree. So I think a croc would percieve me as a pice of \n&gt; possible prey, but it wouldn&#39;t percieve any fine detail such as, \nsay, \n&gt; the colour of my t-shirt :) (if they can even see in colour?). \nTaken to \n&gt; an extreme a plankton is &#39;concious&#39; of it&#39;s immediate surroundings \nand \n&gt; my central heating thermostat is &#39;concious&#39; of the temp in this \nroom.\n&gt; \n\nActually I don&#39;t think the consciousness debate is about abstract \nprocessing or awareness.  I don&#39;t think anyone serious on either \nside is claiming that abstract processing or awareness cannot be \nexplained mechanistically or computationally.  Usually the &quot;weird \nstuff&quot; gets introduced when talking about phenomenal experience, \ni.e. qualia, which may well have nothing to do with level of \nintellect at all.  For that reason, I am betting that AI has a lot \nless to say about consciousness, at least the controversial aspects, \nthan some people think.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
