I&#39;m modeling phone dialing; you hear a\n&gt; phone\n&gt; &gt;number, 7 sounds in sequence, then after only a\n&gt; very\n&gt; &gt;short delay you repeat it back in the same\n&gt; sequence,\n&gt; &gt;either by speaking it or dialing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not so sure about it being a different problem. \n&gt; E.g. for short \n&gt; sequences at least, I can answer questions like\n&gt; &quot;what digit was third&quot; or \n&gt; &quot;what came after the seven&quot; as easily as I can\n&gt; repeat the sequence \n&gt; back.  And I would not assume that this is three\n&gt; separate mechanisms acting \n&gt; on the same data.\n&gt; \n&gt; e.g. to go back to a point discussed a while back,\n&gt; breaking a problem into \n&gt; small pieces can make it harder.  So, for example, a\n&gt; net which can answer \n&gt; &quot;what came after the seven&quot; might make a necessary\n&gt; stepping-stone on the \n&gt; way to one which can recall the whole sequence.\n\nIt would be possible to evolve a net that could recall\npatterns given an index rather than sequentially.  It\nis also possible, that evolving such a network for\nvery small data sets, and then growing it, might work\nvery well.  One would have to try it.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m very interested in any ideas or experiments for\n&gt; how brains are able to \n&gt; apply different concepts together like this.  It&#39;s\n&gt; just the same as the \n&gt; discussion we had about whether 4play could exploit\n&gt; symmetry or not and \n&gt; whether a human brain can learn board-symmetry from\n&gt; checkers and apply it \n&gt; to chess.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is very similar to what is done by my\n&gt; 4Play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;program, except 4Play did more complex logic\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;repeating memorize values.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d say this was asking for a more complex net,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; however...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Which do you think is more complex?\n&gt; \n&gt; The phone numbers are more complex.  Assuming I\n&gt; remember 4play correctly, \n&gt; it only had to recall the positions of 4 symbols\n&gt; amongst 4 \n&gt; places.  Treating that naively, it&#39;s only 8 bits of\n&gt; data.  A seven-digit \n&gt; phone number is 28 bits of data, even without\n&gt; questions of remembering the \n&gt; &quot;cursor&quot; position...\n\nThe phone number has more data, but the 4Play problem\nhas more complex processing to apply to the data. \n\nm\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
