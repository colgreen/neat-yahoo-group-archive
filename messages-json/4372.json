I&#39;m sure 30 is even\n&gt; safer.  \n...\n&gt; For pole b=\r\nalancing, it\n&gt; turns out that you can solve it fastest with a minuscule pop=\r\nulation of\n&gt; size under 20 total (that&#39;s for the whole population!).   That=\r\n is\n&gt; because smaller populations are greedier (they concentrate resources\n=\r\n&gt; on a small part of the search space) and apparently pole balancing\n&gt; bene=\r\nfits greatly from greedy search.  \n\nThat&#39;s really interesting. I have alway=\r\ns thought the higher the\npopulation size the better. In a project I did lat=\r\nely I had 1200\npopulation and species to (min 110, max 125). It needed abou=\r\nt 5 days\nof training with 200 input and 5 output neurons.\n\nWould you say th=\r\ne more in/output neurons you have the more species you\nneed or the higher p=\r\nopulation?\n\nI have problems to decide the right population and species coun=\r\nt, too.\n\nIs the following assumption correct?\n\nIf we have much neurons (in,=\r\n out, hidden) then the species will tend\nto drift apart so there will be ve=\r\nry less crossover with other\nspecies. So this will result in having each sp=\r\necies just develop the\nnetwork on its own. \n\nIs that correct? And is it the=\r\n same if you train 5 times a net with\none species and a population of 100 o=\r\nr if you have a population of 500\nwith 5 species (with the assumption that =\r\nthe is less inter species\ncrossover).\n\nThank you,\n\nChris\n\n\n"}}
