To a=\r\ncquire a better\n&gt; understand of the NEAT function.\n&gt; \n&gt; I read the paper th=\r\nat explains the first demo, but there are some things\n&gt; that i wish to see =\r\non the source code.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you remember, i&#39;ve wrote some time ago, telling=\r\n you that i&#39;m doing my\n&gt; master thesis using NEAT. Now i almost finish that=\r\n work, but not so much\n&gt; satisfied with the results, and with the certain o=\r\nf a failure on the\n&gt; implementation by me.
