The question is, as you point out, whether we\nshould take the hard view that such information is the only thing that\nevolution needs. \n\nThinking along these lines, there are two related but importantly distinct\nquestions: \n\n1) Can evolution produce all desired forms only with geometric information?\n2) Does evolution have an easier time if you combine both geometric\ninformation and environmental information?\n\nMy post was more getting at the second question. My hunch is that it may in\nsome cases be easier to base heuristics off of environmental information\nthan to make the same distinction only using geometric information. But,\neven if that is true, it does not undermine the huge advance of your CPPN\nwork that shows how much easier development is if we provide global\ngeometric information (and evolve increasingly complex coordinate frames\nfrom it). \n\nSo we are in full agreement about this statement:\n\n&gt; Yet I believe such functionality can complement and extend CPPNs without\n&gt; replacing their central role in encoding neural structures.\n\n\nI also agree with you that we need to get learning working in conjunction\nwith evolution to produce intelligent neural networks. This statement is\nlargely true because the learning takes care of figuring out things that are\nchanging on a timescale that is too fast for evolution to get a bead on.\n\n-jeff\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The article below is interesting. It suggests that lung cells know to become\n&gt;&gt; lung cells based on the air passing back and forth over them. It is\n&gt;&gt; intriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows that sometimes\n&gt;&gt; nature does not use geometric position (provided by complex protein\n&gt;&gt; patterning) to make differentiation decisions, but uses environmental cues.\n&gt;&gt; Of course, HyperNEAT could create the same end product just with positional\n&gt;&gt; information, but it might be easier to accomplish this with simple\n&gt;&gt; environmental-based tricks like this one. Thoughts?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; New Scientist\n&gt;&gt; Breath of fresh air transforms stem cells\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 14:32 09 November 2009 by Andy Coghlan\n&gt;&gt; For similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n&gt;&gt; Mimicking the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough to\n&gt;&gt; transform stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physical&quot;\n&gt;&gt; techniques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth factors\n&gt;&gt; alone aren&#39;t enough.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Lindsey Van Haute of the Free University of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium and\n&gt;&gt; colleagues spread human embryonic stem cells onto a porous membrane. The\n&gt;&gt; cells were fed from beneath by nutrients and from above by a fluid that\n&gt;&gt; encouraged them to multiply. Removing two chemicals from the growth fluid\n&gt;&gt; kickstarted differentiation.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Four days later, the team removed the fluid covering the cells, leaving them\n&gt;&gt; open to the air while still being sustained and supported from below, as\n&gt;&gt; they would be in the trachea. After 24 days the cells had developed surface\n&gt;&gt; proteins that identified them as specific types of lung cell, including\n&gt;&gt; alveolar cells, which allow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\n&gt;&gt; bacteria and dirt.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Physical influence\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Our study proves differentiation into lung cells is influenced by physical\n&gt;&gt; forces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have been made to\n&gt;&gt; differentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different growth factors,\n&gt;&gt; but Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot;Physical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung lining to be\n&gt;&gt; fully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London, who has made\n&gt;&gt; alveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth factors alone. &quot;But I find\n&gt;&gt; it difficult to believe that raw stem cells would differentiate through to\n&gt;&gt; these uncommon types of cells solely in response to physical forces.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Haute&#39;s team plans to use the cells they created to study lung diseases,\n&gt;&gt; such as cystic fibrosis. Such cells might one day be used to treat people\n&gt;&gt; with damaged lung tissue, but only if the cells can be made from a person&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; own tissue. This could be done by converting the cells first into induced\n&gt;&gt; pluripotent stem cells.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Journal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI: 10.1186/1465-9921-10-105\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
