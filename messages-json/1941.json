Or do you\n&gt; mean the private sector?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did my MSc at the University of Sussex, Brighton,\n&gt; UK. They have a\n&gt; very strong group in the area, especially when it\n&gt; comes to evolving\n&gt; neural nets for autonomous agents (as opposed to\n&gt; pure pattern\n&gt; recognition), and a lot of interdisciplinarity -\n&gt; people from biology,\n&gt; philosophy and informatics really take an interest\n&gt; in each other&#39;s\n&gt; work. Brighton is a nice place to live as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Julian\n&gt; \n&gt; On 5/6/05, Roger R.
