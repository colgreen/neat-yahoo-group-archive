I&#39;ve\n&gt; tinkered with solutions similar to your&#39;s of averaraging past fitness\n&gt; scores, and although I&#39;ve never been entirely happy with it I think it&#39;s\n&gt; the best way of solving the problem if no appropriate deterministic\n&gt; evaluation is available.\n\nWell, one thing to do is not even handle the stagnant species issue.\n:)  We have yet to implement this aspect of NEAT.  After reading on\nthis list that it has helped with performance gains, we went back and\nlooked at our evolving populations, to see what was going on with\nspecies.  We were afraid that perhaps stagnant species were\noverstaying their welcome and that we weren&#39;t getting good turnover in\nthe population.\n\nBut that turned out to not be the case.  We seem to have plenty of\ndynamism in our populations...that is, new species arising and old\nones going extinct.  We also don&#39;t clamp the number of species, so we\noften have 20-30 species in an evolving population.\n\n&gt; Actually I&#39;ve been quietly working on Tic-Tac-Toe, following in Derek\n&gt; and Philips footsteps, and this has come up again. I started out with\n&gt; mostly deterministic strategies for the opponents but the evolved NN&#39;s\n&gt; quickly take advantage of the fact that, say, a given strategy will\n&gt; always make a certain move in a given scenario, so although the NN&#39;s\n&gt; achieve good scores quickly they aren&#39;t very good when playing against\n&gt; other opponents, e.g. me :)\n\nWill you be posting ongoing results somewhere...at least here? :)\n\n&gt; So I thought maybe I should introduce an element of randomness, but then\n&gt; I encounter the problem of some NN&#39;s getting an unrepresenitive score\n&gt; through good or bad luck. Another ay of minimising this problem is to\n&gt; play more games per evaluation, which has the same or similar effect as\n&gt; averaging scores from previous evals.\n\nWell, because the board is so small and games are played so quickly,\nrandom and semi-random opponents are a pretty good idea.  In our LBP\nfor GECCO, each generations our networks were playing 100 games each\nagainst 5 difference hand-coded players, all of which had some degree\nof random play.  So there was a fair amount of noise in the\nevaluation, but good, solid play bore out because there were so many\ngames played for each evaluation.  This type of approach obviously\nisn&#39;t going to work very well with much larger board game domains,\nthough.\n\nAlthough I think *some* degree of randomness needs to be introduced in\nopponent play, no matter what approach you&#39;re taking, or you&#39;re\nprobably going to be evolving extremely brittle strategies.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
