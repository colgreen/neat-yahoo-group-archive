I would\nhowever like to amplify that novelty searches can also identify structural\nsimilarities and differences, including RBF that encode distances in\naddition to weight of the network topology.  This means that clustering\npatterns and various &quot;geographic&quot; features can be associated / disassociated\nwith the genome and its behaviors.\n \nThis can be used to avoid overly focused &quot;sunny day paradoxes&quot; in the\nsolution space.  In other words, it helps us understand the concept of\n&quot;fitness&quot; in various contexts, so not only is the search open-ended, but the\ncriteria may be open-ended as well.\n \nKen Lloyd\n \n \n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\njoel278\nSent: Wednesday, March 17, 2010 12:12 AM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [neat] Re: Novelty Search\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe basic concept of novelty search is to explore the space of behaviors in\na particular domain. This is accomplished by rewarding individuals that\ndisplay behaviors that are different from those seen prior in a search. \n\nIn contrast, fitness-based search will generally reward individuals\naccording to some fixed measure of progress. A significant benefit of\nnovelty search when compared to fitness search is that novelty search is not\ngenerally susceptible to the problem of &quot;deception&quot; where following the\ngradients of the fitness function lead to dead-ends in the search space.\nDeception is the reason that fitness functions must often be carefully\ncrafted and tweaked in order to solve difficult problems.\n\nInterestingly, sometimes exploring the behavior space may lead novelty\nsearch to find the solution to a problem, though it was not directly trying\nto. Counter-intuitively, it may consistently be faster at finding the\nobjective than an objective-based search in deceptive problems.\n\nSearching for behavioral novelty is different from an exhaustive search of\nthe genotype space for many reasons. As you wrote, many genotypes may map to\nthe same behavior; novelty search may avoid many of these equivalent\nbehaviors because once that area of behavior space has been thoroughly\nexplored, it will not reward individuals displaying those behaviors, and\nwill instead focus search on variations of genotypes that are demonstrating\nmore novel behaviors.\n\nIn addition, the domain itself imposes limits on behaviors; for example,\nphysics constrains our behaviors, we cannot walk through solid objects.\nFurther, demonstrating novelty may often require learning about a domain.\nFor example, to appear novel, a maze navigational robot may need to learn\nabout walls and how to avoid them . In fact, this is what happens in the\nmaze domain explored in the ALifeXI paper. So, novelty search may be in some\nsense about transferring information from the domain into genotypes.\n\nAn exciting aspect of novelty search is that the search is open-ended and\ncan potentially continue endlessly finding novel behaviors that may grow in\ncomplexity. While a fitness-based search may have little to do after it has\nsolved a particular problem, novelty search can continue to find new\nbehaviors even after it is has uncovered a solution. \n\nI hope that this addressed some of your questions.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com,\n&quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I read the original article and thread about novelty search and found it\nvery interesting.

A brute force search of\nthe genotype will certainly run on many occasions into the same phenotypes.\nThe question is to what extent can novelty search avoid this and does it\nhave other benefits?\n&gt; \n&gt; ps.\n&gt; I attended Ken&#39;s tutorial on developmental systems on GECCO2008, and in my\nopinion, it was by far the best presentation I saw on that conference.\nThat&#39;s how I got introduced to NEAT.
