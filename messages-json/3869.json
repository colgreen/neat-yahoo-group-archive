Species are allowed to \nexist =\r\nuntil they stagnate for too long time. If some new structure \nappears throu=\r\ngh mutations, the mutated individuals are separated in \nanother species. Ea=\r\nch species is a local protected competition among \nindividuals grouped by s=\r\nimilarity. Consider it as a GA performed on \nnear identical topologies. The=\r\nn you can see NEAT as a algorithm \nrunning multiple GAs. So this is actuall=\r\ny what you mean by dynamic \nprogramming.. or something. In fact this scheme=\r\n is far better than \nit. \nAs for the idea of speculative structure, this is=\r\n the core of NEAT \nand it is actually Ken&#39;s idea :) \nColin Green&#39;s idea is =\r\nabout phased searching, as far as I know. It is \nthat after some structure =\r\nis added through complexifying, a \nsimplifying phase kicks in, removing any=\r\n unnecessary structure, thus \nreturning the search down to a baseline low d=\r\nimentional space while \nretaining the fitness (because of elitism). \n\nPeter=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, c f &lt;christofer_fransson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In =\r\ndynamic programming the idea is to divide the\n&gt; solution in steps and then =\r\nfor each step present a\n&gt; fixed number of possible solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Collin G=\r\nreens idea is that speculative nodes are added\n&gt; to the solutions but it mi=\r\nght take time/generations\n&gt; before an added node are shown to be useful. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Is it possible to apply dynamic programming approach\n&gt; to this area, to=\r\n evolve NEAT driven networks?\n&gt; \n&gt; To combine local optimization and dynami=\r\nc programming\n&gt; ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Br,\n&gt; Christofer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given t=\r\nhe simplest topology (a perceptron\n&gt; &gt; structure), the local \n&gt; &gt; minima is=\r\n just one.

But increasing the dimentionality\n&gt; &gt; of the solution \n&gt; &gt; incre=\r\nases the error surface&#39;s curvature as well. So\n&gt; &gt; more dimentions \n&gt; &gt; mea=\r\nns more complex error surface. The coolest thing\n&gt; &gt; in NEAT is that \n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nhen it increases the dimentionality of the\n&gt; &gt; solution, the individuals \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; are already located in a promising area of the new\n&gt; &gt; space. In fact \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; those spaces are related to each other - you don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know how the erro=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; surface is going to look like when you enter the new\n&gt; &gt; space with =\r\nmore \n&gt; &gt; dimentions. There are unlimited possibilities. \n&gt; &gt; So what local=\r\n gradient search will do in essence is\n&gt; &gt; pushing the \n&gt; &gt; weights towards=\r\n the *local* minumim..
