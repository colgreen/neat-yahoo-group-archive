And an in=\r\ncrease in the complexity of architecture didn&#39;t do much good to the perform=\r\nance of the robots, instead it just increased the computation overhead. \n\nO=\r\nne of the interesting neural nets that got evolved for flocking with 5-6 ro=\r\nbots, and performed very well with 100+ robots had just the input layer (6 =\r\nneurons), one neuron in the hidden layer, and the output layer(3 neurons). =\r\nInterestingly enough, no recursion was required for this behavior. \n\n&gt;Final=\r\nly, like Derek, I also wonder which version of NEAT you used, or\n&gt;if you wr=\r\note your own?\n\nI used your implementation for single machine.
