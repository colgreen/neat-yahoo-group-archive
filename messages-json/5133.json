If it didn&#39;t do this, all substra=\r\ntes created by CPPNs would be fully connected.  If you look at NEAT_Layered=\r\nSubstrate.h, you will see convertOutputToWeight(...), which converts the ou=\r\ntput form the CPPN into a substrate weight magnitude.\n\nI believe part of th=\r\ne reason why values are set to -3 or 3 is more complex:  Because there isn&#39;=\r\nt normalization in the basic HyperNEAT algorithm, there is competition betw=\r\neen the link weights to have influence, so there&#39;s an arms race towards ver=\r\ny high (or low) link weights.\n\nAlso note that if you do not have a bias cod=\r\ne in your CPPN, the connection going from (0,0) to (0,0) will be 0 every ti=\r\nme because the network has no inputs of value.\n\nJason G.\n\n--- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; I was just l=\r\nooking at some NEAT genomes and noticed that they have many link\n&gt; values o=\r\nf exactly -3 (min), 3 (max), and 0.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does NEAT have something that faci=\r\nlitates the production of max, min and 0?\n&gt; I know HyperNEAT facilitates th=\r\ne production of zeros...does NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; PS.
