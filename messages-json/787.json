This uses a \nsensor arc like you describe, the only difference being that it is not \negocentric - which is something which should improve things.\n\nThe URL is \nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=35\n\nSharpNEAT contains (C#) code for this experiment, and it&#39;s close enough \nsyntactically to C++ or Java that you should be able to cut/paste the \nrelevant sections of code into a C++ source file with minimal trivial \nchanges. If you want download the latest zip take a look at \nPreyCaptureBase and RandomPreyCaptureEvaluator classes, you should be \nable to rip the sensor math code out of these with ease.\n\nThe latest zip is at www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com\n\nAlso there are compiled .Net binaries in the zip, one of which is a \npreycapture simulator. To run it you will need a windows machine with \nthe freely available .Net redistributable installed.\n\n&gt;a separate question, what is the best solution for a light-weight, drop-in \n&gt;with as little change as possible c++ implementation of neat? hehe no \n&gt;offense, \n&gt;Ken, but i saw your code a few years ago - hope you cleaned it up since \n&gt;then :) if there isn&#39;t an existing implementation that has a very clean \n&gt;interface, are there any plans to develop one?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSharpNEAT is designed with some nice clean interfaces for this sort of \nstuff, just implement the very minimal INetworkEvaluator and IExperiment \nand you&#39;re away. Unfortunately SharpNEAT isn&#39;t currently a candidate \nhost for such a problem because there is not yet any support for \nco-evolving populations. The evolution algorithm is currently geared up \nonly for evolving one genome at a time.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
