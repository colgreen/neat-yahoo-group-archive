The objectives are two-fol=\r\nd. \nFirst,\n&gt; &gt; to expand the scope of problems in which the HyperNEAT appro=\r\nach \nmay\n&gt; &gt; be applied. Second, to enable evolved partition of the design =\r\n\nspace,\n&gt; &gt; so as to enable application of the HyperNEAT approach to proble=\r\nms\n&gt; &gt; which contain highly discontinuous and divergent natures in \ndiffere=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; portions of the design space. It is intended to provide a starting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; point for further thought and interchange of ideas, with the \nfocus on\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; achieving the stated objectives by whatever means or changes which\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nay emerge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1 - Preliminary Definitions: Given an arbitrary point &quot;P=\r\n&quot; in \ndesign\n&gt; &gt; space, comprised of the following:\n&gt; &gt; (a) problem specifi=\r\nc inputs (PSIs);\n&gt; &gt; (b) auxiliary additional parameters associated w/ PSIs=\r\n (i.e. \nincludes\n&gt; &gt; geometry);\n&gt; &gt; (c) problem specific outputs (PSOs);\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (d) auxiliary additional parameters associated w/ PSOs (i.e. \nincludes\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; geometry);\n&gt; &gt; (e) Substrate Inputs: comprised of PSIs, &quot;a&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; (f=\r\n) Substrate Outputs: comprised of PSOs, &quot;c&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; (g) CPPN Inputs: com=\r\nprised of auxiliary additional parameters\n&gt; &gt; associated w/ PSIs & PSOs, &quot;b=\r\n&quot; & &quot;d&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; (h) CPPN Output: weight between current pair of substrat=\r\ne nodes;\n&gt; &gt; (i) An &quot;experience_point&quot; is defined as a struct containing \ni=\r\ntems &quot;a&quot;\n&gt; &gt; through &quot;d&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; (j) The &quot;Experience&quot; is defined as a ve=\r\nctor of experience_points;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2 - Current HyperNEAT Implementation:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (a) CPPN Inputs comprised of (1-b) and (1-d) are each constant in\n&gt; &gt; num=\r\nber and meaning as you loop over the links in the substrate\n&gt; &gt; network (i.=\r\ne. 3D CPPN &quot;From&quot; Input: quan. =3D 3, meaning =3D X, Y & Z\n&gt; &gt; coordinates)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3 - Proposed Generalization For CPPN Input:\n&gt; &gt; (a) the quantity a=\r\nnd meaning of auxiliary additional parameters\n&gt; &gt; associated w/ PSIs (1-b) =\r\ncan vary over the substrate network (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; dimensionality of substrate i=\r\nnputs, hidden and output nodes);\n&gt; &gt; (b) the quantity and meaning of auxili=\r\nary additional parameters\n&gt; &gt; associated w/ PSOs (1-d) can vary over the su=\r\nbstrate network (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; dimensionality of substrate inputs, hidden and ou=\r\ntput nodes);\n&gt; &gt; (c) CPPN Input &quot;From&quot;: the quantity and meanings are defin=\r\ned to be\n&gt; &gt; the superset of possible auxiliary additional parameters \nasso=\r\nciated\n&gt; &gt; w/ PSIs and PSOs (i.e. 5D CPPN &quot;From&quot; Input: quan. =3D 5, meanin=\r\ng =3D \nX,\n&gt; &gt; Y, Z, apples & oranges);\n&gt; &gt; (d) CPPN Input &quot;To&quot;: the quantit=\r\ny and meanings are defined to be \nthe\n&gt; &gt; superset of possible auxiliary ad=\r\nditional parameters associated w/\n&gt; &gt; PSIs and PSOs (i.e. 5D CPPN &quot;To&quot; Inpu=\r\nt: quan. =3D 5, meaning =3D X, \nY, Z,\n&gt; &gt; apples & oranges);\n&gt; &gt; (e) the me=\r\naning of any given CPPN Input node, for both &quot;From&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or &quot;To&quot;, remains co=\r\nnstant (i.e. only apples are presented on the\n&gt; &gt; apples input node);\n&gt; &gt; (=\r\nf) the quantity of zero is presented on any CPPN Input node whose\n&gt; &gt; dimen=\r\nsionality, or meaning, is not present/applicable for the \ncurrent\n&gt; &gt; CPPN =\r\nInput &quot;From&quot; or &quot;To&quot;;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4 - Proposed Generalization For Evolved Parti=\r\ntion of Design Space:\n&gt; &gt; (a) Evaluation of speciation of CPPN population a=\r\nlong design space\n&gt; &gt; partition lines, as defined by allocation of experien=\r\nce_points\n&gt; &gt; addressed by a specific species (i.e. species &quot;0&quot; by default\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; addresses all experience_points, species &quot;1&quot; through &quot;n&quot; addresses\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nonly those experience_points which yield a higher absolute fitness\n&gt; &gt; than=\r\n species &quot;0&quot;;\n&gt; &gt; (b) species fitness computed based upon percentage of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n experience_points yielding a highest absolute fitness among all\n&gt; &gt; specie=\r\ns (i.e. if species &quot;1&quot; gave best fitness for 25 percent of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; experie=\r\nnce_points, then the species fitness would be the \nsummation of\n&gt; &gt; fitness=\r\n for those specific experience_points);\n&gt; &gt; (c) objective to maximize overa=\r\nll fitness of &quot;Experience&quot; as\n&gt; &gt; summation of best individual from each sp=\r\necies over those\n&gt; &gt; experience_points for which they were evolved and main=\r\ntained the \nbest\n&gt; &gt; fitness (i.e. all experience_points addressed only onc=\r\ne);\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jason G\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
