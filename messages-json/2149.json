I have been &#39;playing&#39; around with NN&#39;s\nand GA for a few years now and came accross NEAT through Mat\nBuckland&#39;s excellent book.  I have implemented my own version (as\nthat&#39;s what I am good at) in Java.  Been reading the posts for the\nlast few days and there is obviously a wealth of talent and\ninformation out there, hopefully I can use it.\n\nI am using NEAT to predict FTSE 100 movement and weather forecasting.\n I have tested my implementation with XOR and it works just fine. \nObviously, the domain(s) that interest me are somewhat more complex.\n\nMy biggest confusion is about speciation.  I understand the\ncompatability metric, but what I haven&#39;t grasped is the role of\nfitness sharing and its effect on a specie/population.  Ken&#39;s paper\nsays that the fitness is reduced by the size of the specie.  Is that\nmeant to be a penalty to more populous species?  My fitness function\ncurrently tends towards zero for more fit memebers.\n\nAs I save (to disc) the best from each genration it is important that\nI save the correct best member.  i.e. the one with the best raw\nfitness or the one with the best shared fitness.\n\nSorry if this is rambling, but I want to clear this in my own mind.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
