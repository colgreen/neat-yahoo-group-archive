Thanks for the recap. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;Yeah, I understand that this is just a sort of test domain.  If you\n&gt;had any variance in your input, it wouldn&#39;t work.\n&gt;\nWell, it would require a more complex network to handle variance. \nWhether such a network could be found I don&#39;t know.\n\n&gt;  This is probably\n&gt;more akin to a memorization task than a pattern recognition one, since\n&gt;there&#39;s no noise or variance in your samples.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, In formal NN lingo I think it comes under pattern classification.\n\n&gt;&gt;50x50 represnts a massive input space, but since I understand you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;using a roving eye technique that seems reasonable to me, although\n&gt;&gt;personally I would be tempted to start a bit smaller.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You think that&#39;s big...some of the images for other patterns we want\n&gt;to experiment with are an order of magnitude bigger: about 300x400. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHave you decided on a resolution/size for your roving eye yet? I was \nthinking about how a human eye recognises characters and it occurs to me \nthat when reading we can actually read not only whole characters but \nwhole words at a time, certainly our eyes don&#39;t &#39;rove&#39; to detect \nindividual characters. Therefore if I was going to try and construct a \nrobust OCR network I think I&#39;d tend towards a roving eye with quite a \nhigh resolution(good enough to distinguish all of the characters anyhow) \nthat could see whole characters at a time - but then could rove (move \nand zoom in/out) in order to frame characters within the eye&#39;s field of \nview. I wonder if this technique could then be extended to read text \nfrom a printed sheet - or even handriting?  I know there are already \ntechnqiues for reading printed text, what I don&#39;t know is how good they \nare and if a roving eye technqiue could perhaps improve on the current \nbest technique.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
