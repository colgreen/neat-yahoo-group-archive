In Picbreeder, some of these include the skull, the car, the butterfly, =\r\netc.\n\nSecond, I assume that all would agree that we would like to discover =\r\nsuch artifacts if we can.  Not necessarily those particular artifacts, but =\r\nones like them.\n\nThird, the evidence in the paper supports the fact that ob=\r\njective-based search has almost no hope of discovering any such artifacts -=\r\n not just the ones that have been discovered by Picbreeder - but anything e=\r\nven like them.\n\nYet while in the past, say 5 years ago, we would have said =\r\nthat we simply do not know how to discover such artifacts (a fact which the=\r\n paper plays on), we can no longer say that because they *have* been discov=\r\nered on Picbreeder, and consistently.  Thus we see that a whole class of in=\r\nteresting discoveries are within reach yet only if we abandon objective-bas=\r\ned search.\n\nNow you may say that the issue boils down to a distinction betw=\r\neen &quot;objectively and subjectively interesting&quot; but I think that distinction=\r\n is misleading.  Ultimately *any* objective at which we aim is subjectively=\r\n interesting.  You cite traveling salesman as objectively interesting, but =\r\nultimately whether or not we care about traveling salesman is just as subje=\r\nctive as whether we care about the Skull.  We cannot separate these types o=\r\nf achievements so easily because some of the artifacts discovered through n=\r\non-objective search will in fact be direct solutions to &quot;objective&quot; problem=\r\ns, such as the biped walker evolved through novelty search.  So I think the=\r\n desire to &quot;objectify&quot; science ultimately is distracting us from our princi=\r\nple concern, which is to discover things we care about in the search space,=\r\n both for pleasure and for practical or scientific purposes.\n\nThe concern i=\r\ns that there are analogous discoveries to the Skull in the space of neuroco=\r\nntrollers.  And they will be just as impossible to reach through objective =\r\nsearch.  That should be ringing alarm bells, because we want to find those =\r\n&quot;Skulls&quot; of control; they are the true needles in the haystack.\n\nWhat is co=\r\nming into focus for me is that I think we are facing a stark and previously=\r\n unrecognized trade-off:\n\n-We have shown convincingly as a community that w=\r\ne can find nice solutions to medium-range objective problems like pole-bala=\r\nncing or Keepaway soccer through objective search.  These problems are anal=\r\nogous to the Simple and Crescent patterns in the paper: not so interesting,=\r\n but solved reliably.  Thus one choice is to continue to play in the playgr=\r\nound of mediocre problems where we get exactly what we ask for and nothing =\r\nmore or less.\n\n-On the other hand, it appears that many interesting things =\r\nare possible to discover that are far beyond Simple and Crescent, such as t=\r\nhe Skull and Butterfly.  These are real discoveries that are consistently s=\r\nurprising when they happen.  However, we can only discover such artifacts i=\r\nf we submit to the principle that we may *not* define a priori what we expe=\r\nct to find.  In other words, search is able to discover wonderful things, b=\r\nut only if you stop trying to tell search what it is supposed to find.  (e.=\r\ng. No one told nature that it was supposed to find human brains.)\n\nThus we =\r\nface a trade-off:  We can find anything we want as long as it is modest, or=\r\n, we can find things well beyond modest as long as we do not try to control=\r\n what those things are from the start.  Evidence is accumulating that this =\r\ntrade-off is real, and the paper supports that trend.  It is not proof, but=\r\n it is evidence, and it is a major concern for a field focused almost exclu=\r\nsively on objectively-driven discovery.\n\nYou finally had some concerns with=\r\n disentangling the &quot;interactive&quot; and\n&quot;objective-driven&quot; variables.  That is=\r\n a indeed a valid concern and they could be better disentangled than in the=\r\n paper.  However, unless you believe that humans actually can reach these p=\r\narticular images as objectives better than computers (for which there is no=\r\n evidence and plenty of counter-evidence), then this concern exists in prin=\r\nciple but is unlikely in practice.\n\nFor example, here is the counter-eviden=\r\nce: You would have to argue that somehow the user who evolved the &quot;dish&quot; \n\n=\r\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D541\n\nactually intended it=\r\n to evolve into a skull, which is a far-fetched hypothesis.  Or that the us=\r\ner who evolved the alien\n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=\r\n=3D375\n\nwas actually thinking ahead to discovering a car.  \n\nThat is, becau=\r\nse we know the intermediate stepping stones in dozens or hundreds of cases =\r\nthat were published by users who had no way to know what ultimately would b=\r\ne evolved from their own stepping stones, it would be fantastical to assert=\r\n that those users knew where the search was ultimately going to go.  It is =\r\nclear from Picbreeder that those who lay the stepping stones have no idea w=\r\nhere those stepping stones may lead.  Of course, this idea should not be su=\r\nrprising: It&#39;s always been the story of innovation.  Who knows where any gr=\r\neat discovery might lead?  \n\nken\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tu=\r\nohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; My response consists primarily of =\r\nclarifying questions, depending on the\n&gt; answer I may or may not go back on=\r\n the offensive :)\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 2, 2011 at 5:17 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Daniel, I appreciate very much you sharing your though=\r\nts. We were hoping to\n&gt; &gt; provoke just such discussion with this paper and =\r\nyour questions highlight\n&gt; &gt; important issues. Let me try to respond below.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Kenneth Stanley [ma=\r\nilto:kstanley@...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, April 02, 2011 2:57 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &#39;=\r\nKenneth Stanley&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: todelete2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Firs=\r\nt off, I&#39;ll say that what I take as the central point, that EAs can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\niss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; critical intermediate objectives because they are awkwardly place=\r\nd on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness landscape, is a good one. However, I have some conce=\r\nrns about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experimental design in this paper:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) You =\r\nappear to be manipulating two variables at once. (a) whether the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; EA\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; has an objective and (b) whether there is a human in the loop. Surely =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to pick only one at a time and control for everything else, =\r\nright?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s only a problem if you believe that somehow a huma=\r\nn would do better at\n&gt; &gt; evolving to these objectives, which of course huma=\r\nns would not. Good luck to\n&gt; &gt; anyone who wants to re-evolve the skull from=\r\n scratch again. It will never\n&gt; &gt; happen. Nor will anyone evolve any reason=\r\nably complex *preconceived* picture\n&gt; &gt; from scratch no matter where it cam=\r\ne from, whether once evolved in the past\n&gt; &gt; or not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, intere=\r\nsting.  I think I have misjudged the scope of the experiment.  I\n&gt; assumed =\r\nyou were trying to *prove* something significant about the fact that\n&gt; GAs =\r\ncan&#39;t evolve the solutions produced in picbreeder.  This was the basis\n&gt; fo=\r\nr my primary objection (3).  But you admit that the IGA won&#39;t evolve those\n=\r\n&gt; specific images either, with or without an objective.  Instead, you&#39;re ju=\r\nst\n&gt; trying to persuade the reader of a suspicion based on just how bad the=\r\n\n&gt; performance is.  So really this paper would fall more under the category=\r\n of\n&gt; &quot;evidence-based musings&quot;, is that fair?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the other=\r\n hand if you want to see non-objective search without a human\n&gt; &gt; in the lo=\r\nop, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing with novelty search, so there is\n&gt; &gt; plent=\r\ny of literature on that combination at this point. You can find a lot\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nere:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/noveltysearch/userspage/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Let me suggest to you or anyone who remains a skeptic (which is perfectly=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; reasonable) to check out my talk on the topic (recorded in video), whi=\r\nch\n&gt; &gt; lays out the ideas much more broadly. It&#39;s only 70 minutes and I thi=\r\nnk you\n&gt; &gt; will find it worth the time to see how I try to defend this\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncounter-intuitive position, if nothing else to stimulate some thinking even=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; if you still feel skeptical:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.infoq.com/presentation=\r\ns/Searching-Without-Objectives\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t seen your talk on nove=\r\nlty search, I&#39;ll take a look at this.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Furthermore, i=\r\nf it&#39;s IGA v. GA and &#39;interestingness&#39; is the\n&gt; &gt; evaluation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; criteria=\r\n, that ain&#39;t a fair fight. Why should I believe there is more to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; than that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But interestingness wasn&#39;t the evaluation cri=\r\nteria. This paper played by\n&gt; &gt; the traditional ground rules to whose defen=\r\nse you are now jumping. The\n&gt; &gt; objective was definitively the skull (or th=\r\ne butterfly, or the eye..), not\n&gt; &gt; &quot;interestingness.&quot; The fact that the re=\r\nsults come out so abysmally and leave\n&gt; &gt; you wanting to argue about intere=\r\nstingness just shows how unreasonable\n&gt; &gt; peddling these objectives as mean=\r\ningful benchmarks can be. That&#39;s the whole\n&gt; &gt; point - the paper is a play =\r\non the traditional algorithmic evaluation scheme\n&gt; &gt; that leaves the reader=\r\n squirming, as it should.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, if you really think that IGA vs.=\r\n GA isn&#39;t a &quot;fair fight&quot; when we\n&gt; &gt; are aiming for interestingness, then y=\r\nou are in part in agreement (though\n&gt; &gt; inadvertently) with the spirit of o=\r\nur message. That is, if you are really\n&gt; &gt; convinced that IGA is so far sup=\r\nerior to GAs at doing something interesting\n&gt; &gt; that it isn&#39;t even fair to =\r\ncontrast them, then unless we are somehow\n&gt; &gt; intentionally trying to avoid=\r\n evolving anything interesting, what are we\n&gt; &gt; doing wasting our time with=\r\n objective GAs? Does it not highlight a central\n&gt; &gt; paradox in our position=\r\n that we might actually care more about being &quot;fair&quot;\n&gt; &gt; than being &quot;intere=\r\nsting?&quot; Why are we even running these algorithms?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s a dif=\r\nference between objectively and subjectively interesting.  The\n&gt; former inc=\r\nludes the conventional optimization domains (e.g. travelling\n&gt; salesmen) an=\r\nd the latter include things like evolutionary art and music.  Is\n&gt; this bra=\r\nnch of your research only concerned with the latter type of problem\n&gt; (at l=\r\neast currently)?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) How do we know that intermediat=\r\ne objectives are in any way\n&gt; &gt; significant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to discovering interestin=\r\ng pictures in Picbreeder? I have a sneaking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suspicion that totally ra=\r\nndom search, followed by focused objective based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search when somethin=\r\ng &#39;pops&#39; might be just as effective, and that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;intermediate objec=\r\ntives&#39;, while certainly necessary to find a particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; image, are not=\r\n very helpful in general to finding interesting images. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so, this i=\r\ns no chink in the armor of objective based search. I suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without =\r\nintermediate objectives there can be no exaptation, but does that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mat=\r\nter? What percentage of evolved features in biological organisms have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n any exaptation at all in their history?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When you say the ran=\r\ndom search followed by objective-based search would be\n&gt; &gt; &quot;just as effecti=\r\nve,&quot; I don&#39;t really understand: just as effective at what?\n&gt; &gt; At doing som=\r\nething &quot;interesting?&quot; At achieving a specific objective? Surely\n&gt; &gt; you don=\r\n&#39;t believe that random search will produce images as interesting as\n&gt; &gt; Pic=\r\nbreeder? The stepping stones (i.e. intermediate objectives) in Picbreeder\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; are in effect fundamental discoveries of important regularities that are=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; later elaborated. For example, this simple face-like stepping stone le=\r\nads to\n&gt; &gt; a whole family of subsequent faces:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.or=\r\ng/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D542\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here you can get a family-tree ex=\r\npansion from that individual:\n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/familytree.p=\r\nhp?sid=3D542\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you are willing to skip bridges like that because t=\r\nhey are intermediate,\n&gt; &gt; you would never find any of the treasures on the =\r\nother side of the bridge.\n&gt; &gt; If you look back in the lineages of almost an=\r\ny interesting image on the site\n&gt; &gt; you will find a similar story wherein f=\r\nundamental regularities that were\n&gt; &gt; later exploited were first discovered=\r\n in a different context.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This point seems to beg for some contr=\r\nols for bias.  Would we not expect\n&gt; users to choose interesting pictures t=\r\no start from most often?  And then\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t we be unsurprised when most =\r\nof the new interesting images have\n&gt; these in their lineages?  And shouldn&#39;=\r\nt we be least surprised of all that\n&gt; they share fundamental regularities w=\r\nith these ancestors?\n&gt; \n&gt; Complicating this even further is the fact that s=\r\nmall genotypic changes in\n&gt; picbreeder genomes create significant divergenc=\r\ne in phenotype (correct me if\n&gt; I&#39;m wrong).  So a varied set of interesting=\r\n pictures can readily proliferate\n&gt; a short evolutionary distance away from=\r\n a single ancestor, which exaggerates\n&gt; the representation of interesting p=\r\nictures of the type you describe.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just compare figure =\r\n6 and figure 7 in the paper to see how horrible it is\n&gt; &gt; to start from a r=\r\nandom place and then lock in on an objective (figure 7). It\n&gt; &gt; takes 29,00=\r\n0 generations to do the same thing it took 12 to do better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (4) Finally - and this is the big one - one of the deadly sins of Science=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; claiming a result as the objective a posteriori, a point wh=\r\nich eludes\n&gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some very famous scientists. It&#39;s what allows pub=\r\nlications like this,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;prove&#39; psychic phenomena by mining =\r\ndata for &#39;statistically significant&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; results. The problem is, a resul=\r\nt isn&#39;t significant unless you were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specifically attempting to confir=\r\nm it when the experiment was designed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always follow up ex=\r\nploratory experiment with a confirmatory experiment!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hearti=\r\nly endorse exploring for/marvelling at results you weren&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; initially\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; looking for, but one should never use such results as the basis for any=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sort\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of comparison. In the case of the eye experiment, who car=\r\nes if the GA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t evolve the eye? The IGA can&#39;t either, and the f=\r\nact that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; did is immaterial! I could be persuaded tha=\r\nt the IGA is better at\n&gt; &gt; evolving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting images, but I do not =\r\nbelieve it&#39;s any better at evolving the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;eye&#39; (or &#39;dolphin&#39;, or &#39;appl=\r\ne&#39;). In fact, I would bet that&#39;s it&#39;s worse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolving those s=\r\npecific images, intermediate objectives notwithstanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shou=\r\nld we really believe your statement? : &quot;I heartily endorse exploring\n&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nr/marvelling at results you weren&#39;t initially looking for, but one should\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; never use such results as the basis for any sort of comparison.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Is not our entire infatuation with evolution, the very reason we choose to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; explore it as an algorithm, for the very reason that you say we should=\r\n never\n&gt; &gt; use such comparisons? After all, natural evolution is just such =\r\na gallery of\n&gt; &gt; &quot;results you weren&#39;t initially looking for&quot; yet it is the =\r\ncore inspiration\n&gt; &gt; for all our hopes and dreams for the field and the exa=\r\nmple against which\n&gt; &gt; many of us compare our algorithms. Thus I strongly d=\r\nisagree with the\n&gt; &gt; principle you want to impose that marvels attained wit=\r\nhout explicit a priori\n&gt; &gt; intent are outside of the realm of scientific in=\r\nterest.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; No, not out of the realm of scientific interest!  Just =\r\nout of the realm of\n&gt; naive scientific experimentation (unless, as I suspec=\r\nt is the case here, you\n&gt; are reporting the results because they are *inter=\r\nesting*, not because they\n&gt; prove anything).  Note that I am not using &#39;nai=\r\nve&#39; perjoratively, just\n&gt; pointing out that this problem that you&#39;ve decide=\r\nd to tackle will require\n&gt; exceedingly clever experimental design if you wa=\r\nnt to prove something.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the contrary, in fact the point o=\r\nf the paper is that our mistake is\n&gt; &gt; precisely that we have been misled b=\r\ny such a restrictive and dogmatic\n&gt; &gt; doctrine. It is time that we did begi=\r\nn to contemplate the marvel of what is\n&gt; &gt; discovered a posteriori. Asking =\r\nwhy such amazing discoveries as human beings\n&gt; &gt; happens in nature is nothi=\r\nng like entertaining psychic phenomena.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just as an aside, I was=\r\n not suggesting that it was.  The fact that the paper\n&gt; I cited was about &#39;=\r\npsi&#39; was incidental, it was just the most\n&gt; fresh-in-my-mind example of a m=\r\nistake I thought you were making.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if we had left o=\r\nut the part about Picbreeder and simply run some\n&gt; &gt; experiments to see if =\r\nNEAT can evolve a set of pictures. After it failed\n&gt; &gt; miserably every time=\r\n, following the traditional interpretation, we would\n&gt; &gt; conclude that NEAT=\r\n cannot evolve such pictures, or even pictures *like*\n&gt; &gt; them. The fact th=\r\nat Picbreeder did evolve many such pictures is thus\n&gt; &gt; relevant and scient=\r\nifically interesting; it shows why the traditional\n&gt; &gt; implications we draw=\r\n from such &quot;failures&quot; are far too expansive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You say that you could=\r\n be persuaded that the IGA is better at evolving\n&gt; &gt; interesting images yet=\r\n then you say that you don&#39;t think it is better at\n&gt; &gt; evolving the eye. Ye=\r\nt the whole point is that it is better at evolving\n&gt; &gt; interesting images. =\r\nBeware of missing the forest for the trees: It is not\n&gt; &gt; important whether=\r\n the IGA is good at evolving the eye (or dolphin, or\n&gt; &gt; apple); it is impo=\r\nrtant that it is good at evolving images *like* those.\n&gt; &gt; There is no othe=\r\nr algorithm on Earth that can do that. That is, there is no\n&gt; &gt; other appro=\r\nach that we know of that could get NEAT to actually encode images\n&gt; &gt; *like=\r\n* cars and butterflies in a CPPN. That fact should be startling to us,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnot dismissed as a mere curiosity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I mostly agree with t=\r\nhis, but I must reiterate my discomfort with the\n&gt; fact that the experiment=\r\n does not disentangle the &quot;interactive&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;objective-driven&quot; variables.=\r\n  Without doing so, how are we to know what is\n&gt; really doing the heavy lif=\r\nting of creating these interesting pictures?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyw=\r\nay, though I have a lot of doubts about this particular paper, I\n&gt; &gt; really=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate these sorts of research directions. Keep up the good work=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sure, I understand. A good hard defense of the status quo i=\r\ns healthy to\n&gt; &gt; ensure that no one gets away with taking unjustifiable pot=\r\nshots :) Yet at\n&gt; &gt; the same time, questioning the status quo is sometimes =\r\nimportant if progress\n&gt; &gt; is to be made.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
