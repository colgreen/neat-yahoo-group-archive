I though=\r\nt, it&#39;s more the different cell types and their layering (e.g. Brodmann Are=\r\nas) that allow us to define several anatomical areas within the cortex (whi=\r\nch can also be related to different functions). But I am not an expert in a=\r\nnatomy. \n&gt; \n&gt; \nI&#39;m not an expert either. I&#39;d be interested to hear the pers=\r\npectives of neuroscientists on this issue. I do know that neuroscientists c=\r\nonstantly say that the brain is modular, so that is not in question. I gues=\r\ns you are wondering how they go about identifying/defining that modularity,=\r\n which is a subject I&#39;d love to know more about. \n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; ok, I think I mis=\r\nunderstood here something. Influenced by the paper of van Ooyen, I regarded=\r\n the number of connections in a network as a property that arises from pure=\r\nly self-organizing principles (which are only little influenced by the enco=\r\nding). From this perspective, your paper would state that modules can arise=\r\n without any definition of modules in the genetic code (arguing against glo=\r\nbal pattern formation as the driving factor for the evolutionary origin of =\r\nmodules). However, I think you regard the number of connections (and possib=\r\nly the targets of connections) as part of the genetic code (as you do it in=\r\n your simulations). In this case, connection cost influences the genetic co=\r\nde towards lower connections and thereby producing an encoding for modules.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \nYes. I do agree that a fitness cost for connections can lead evolut=\r\nion to encode phenotypes that tend to have few connections (e.g. by evolvin=\r\ng growth rules that tend to produce sparse networks). \n\n&gt; This leads to the=\r\n question, how much depends the number of connections in a neural network o=\r\nn the encoding (and how much just on environmental factors / physical laws)=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; \nSee my conversation with Ken about that. I&#39;m not sure those have to=\r\n be separate things. The latter can cause the former (as in the example you=\r\n just sketched out above). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it is possible that this conne=\r\nction cost idea may also apply to many different types of structures (e.g. =\r\norgans and kinematic linkages). \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, maybe. Have you followed the dis=\r\ncussions in the article of your paper over at technologyreview.com? There a=\r\nre some nice comments relating this work to the second law of thermodynamic=\r\ns (and suggesting you for the Nobel Price :)). Indeed, physical limitations=\r\n in the number of connections (in any system) constrain the search space in=\r\n evolution. Still, I don&#39;t see how a factor - like connection cost - could =\r\nfacilitate the emergence of large scale networks (e.g. something like diffe=\r\nrent cytoarchitectures). Therefore, I am wondering what kind of other facto=\r\nrs drive modularization.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nNot only did the commenter think we should w=\r\nin a Nobel prize for this work, he/she argues that we deserve four! Let&#39;s h=\r\nope the Nobel committee wades through the 60 comments on that article. ;-)\n=\r\n\n&gt; Anyway, I really enjoy thinking about these kinds of questions and discu=\r\nssing them here with you.
