But I\ndidn&#39;t have the opportunity to check your work mainly because I need to work\nwith the RobotSoccer simulator developed by Dr Jun Jo for competition (you\ncan download it here http://www.fira.net/soccer/simurosot/overview.html).\nI&#39;ve done work exclusively for this league (Simurosot 5x5) so we have to get\nused to that particular simulator. I&#39;m not planning to work with real robots\nbecause we cannot afford any of that around here.\n\nIn this simulator the output consists in the power of each robot&#39;s wheels\n(two wheels per robot, differential drive, range -125,125), so we had to\ndevelop all the primitives for navigation. The inputs are current and last\nball position (cartesian coordinates), robot position an rotation (for\nopponents too) and of course team players current wheel power. You may also\nquery field bounds to the simulator (and you may set a predicted ball\nvariable if you do the calculation yourself).\n\nOne of the main disadvantages for applying a neuroevolution technique with\nthis simulator is that you can only run the simulator in real time (no\noffline fast non-graphic simulation available) so it should take a long time\nand patience.\n\nAnyway I&#39;m interested in your work specially if you&#39;ll be doing\nneuroevolution, perhaps we can share some material later on when I have\nsomething to share! ;-) (we should discuss what are our points in common,\nperhaps we can establish a common NEAT framework for 5x5).\n\nNice to hear from you!\n\nGerman\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 27, 2004 12:31 PM\nSubject: [neat] Soccerbots\n\n\n&gt; --- German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; My name is German Viscuso and I would like to\n&gt; &gt; introduce myself to the group\n&gt; &gt; members.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi German...welcome to the group. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a degree in Computer Science and I &#39;m now\n&gt; &gt; researching neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; techniques for application in the robotic soccer\n&gt; &gt; domain. I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; hardware?\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; it).\n&gt;\n&gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; forward).\n&gt;\n&gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt;\n&gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt;\n&gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; interest in this domain.  Anybody else have\n&gt; experiences or thoughts on robot control domains?\n&gt; Robot soccer?
