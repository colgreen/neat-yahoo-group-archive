It turns out that\nimplementing this is actually pretty difficult, because there is no\nstandardized way to represent the larger graph of modules connecting to\neach other. So instead I opted to work with a simplified subset of\nmodule-chromosome bindings that would still be very powerful.\n\nIt actually turns out that this kind of simplified binding is more useful\n(not to mention easier to search), because there few times when you need\nmore complexity than a single hidden layer.\n\n&gt; But if I understood your paper correctly, the modules\n&gt; can only connect directly to the input and output\n&gt; layers.  Is that right?\n\nCorrect. Modules represent a complete path from a set of input neurons to\na set of output neurons. There is some independent work by another one of\nRisto&#39;s students (Steetskamp) with SANE that actually show that SANE\nacting on any modular structure smaller than a single complete neuron is\nalmost useless.\n\n&gt; I like the way the modules start minimally, just as\n&gt; NEAT itself does, and complexify throughout the run.\n&gt; This seems like the right approach.\n\nYeah I think minimal starting and gradual complexification are definately\nsome of Ken&#39;s really big innovations with NEAT. Its really obvious when\nyou think of it.\n\n&gt; Are you going to continue working with modularity in\n&gt; NEAT?\n\nYes, this semester I&#39;m going to do some theoretical work with it\n(incomplete-knowledge Pareto dominance in modules) based on some symbiotic\ncomposition ideas I read about (Richard Watson). Also I plan on applying\nit scalably large domains so I can get some real information about how\nfeasible it a method it is.\n\nJoseph\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
