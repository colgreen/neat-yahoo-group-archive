That is,=\r\n being able to build a frontier in principle is\nnot equivalent to being abl=\r\ne to discover the particular frontier shape\nthat you want.  Since the shape=\r\n of the frontier is a function of the\nchemical concentrations in the cells,=\r\n as you point out, then the shape\nultimately depends on a delicate balancin=\r\ng act of chemical\ndistributions through reactions, diffusions, signaling, o=\r\nr whatever\nmechanisms are in a particular model that ultimately distribute\n=\r\nchemical through the cells in the system.  The search space induced by\nthis=\r\n complex dynamical system may or may not be nicely structured.\n\nAlso, could=\r\n you clarify what you mean by &quot;all 0 borders?&quot;  I am not\nsure I understand =\r\nthe idea for using 0&#39;s to move from wallpaper to\ndiscrete objects.\n\nken\n\n--=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Alexandre Devert &lt;marmakoide@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;ni=\r\ntpicking mode on&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that the capacity to build sharp frontier=\r\ns is a real\nissue.

You\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; make a good point- my statement was too broad, in part because\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;cell=\r\nular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\n&gt; \n&gt; potentially ref=\r\ner to many types of systems.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just to clarify my statement, I w=\r\nas responding the line of discussion\n&gt; \n&gt; with Peter about encodings that a=\r\nctually create distinct bodily shapes\n&gt; \n&gt; that are self-contained and have=\r\n clear structural boundaries (which\n&gt; \n&gt; reaction-diffusion systems tend no=\r\nt to produce; rather they produce\n&gt; \n&gt; wallpaper-like patterns).  Often whe=\r\nn growth-based models are used to\n&gt; \n&gt; define actual bodies with distinct b=\r\norders, they are studied in the\n&gt; \n&gt; context of blobs with a particular foc=\r\nus on how the blob knows when to\n&gt; \n&gt; stop growing so that a border shape c=\r\nan be created.  That kind of\n&gt; \n&gt; systems goes along with the &quot;skin&quot; issue =\r\nthat we were discussing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, the field is quite broad =\r\nand there are many possible\n&gt; \n&gt; interesting examples of such systems.  If =\r\nI could revisit my\n&gt; \n&gt; statement, I would reword it such as to avoid imply=\r\ning any sweeping\n&gt; \n&gt; generalization.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups. com, Alexandre Devert &lt;marmakoide@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHello\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Along these lines, I have rarely seen a cellular grow=\r\nth model\n&gt; \n&gt; produce anything more than a blob or an amorphous shape witho=\r\nut clear\n&gt; \n&gt; parts.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you consider reaction-diffusion sys=\r\ntems as a cellular growth\n&gt; \n&gt; model, then you might consider the following=\r\n publications :\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Interactive Evolution of Dynamical Systems, Karl Si=\r\nms&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Advanced Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture Synthesis, Allen=\r\n R.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sanderson et al.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Those patterns are a bit above th=\r\ne average blob and features very\n&gt; \n&gt; compact description.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; R=\r\negards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Alexandre Devert\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
