(url: \nhttp://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/user/Antonia.J.Jones/GammaArchive/IndexPage.htm )\n\nbasically it is a way of making a (fast) good guess at what the noise \nvariation from a non-linear function in a data set is, without knowing \nwhat the actual function is.\n\nthe main application she made to neural nets is that if you have an idea \nof what the noise variance is you can know when to stop training your \nnet to prevent overtraining, thus arriving at a faster, better solution.\n\nanother application she made, although not NN specific, is that when \nusing this algorithm you can notice potential places of interest in a \nnoisy data set, when the specific results in an area don&#39;t match the noise.\n\nanyway, enjoy.\n\n-KB-\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------\n  k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n  msc natural computation : the university of birmingham\n  http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
