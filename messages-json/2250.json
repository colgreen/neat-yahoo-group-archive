If he means the network is static topologically, then he could \nbe including recurrence.  If by static, he means feedforward only, no \nrecurrence...then I would disagree with his initial assertion as it \nwould preclude circuits holding state from some previous &quot;context&quot; and \napplying it to the current &quot;context&quot;.\n\n From what I have been able to see, a standard feedforward network is \njust a state machine.  Precisely the same input will result in precisely \nthe same output.  And without recurrence, the ANNs I have seen \nimplemented with NEAT behave essentially the same as a standard \nfeedforward network.  It is essentially the equivalent of a ROM, Read \nOnly Memory.  Some very fascinating things can be done with process and \nROM.  However, the one thing that cannot be accomplished is any form of \ndynamic state management upon which *my* understanding of the word \n&quot;learning&quot; depends (at least withing a single &quot;specimen&quot; of an \nevolutionary run).\n\nWith recurrence, things substantially change.  With any degree of \nrecurrence, the network is very unlikely to provide precisely the same \noutput for precisely the same input.  The network is no longer a pure \nstate machine.  Here it is like a ROM with some RAM (recurrent \nconnections are a form of memory), albeit the Random part of Random \nAccess Memory is inaccurate.\n\nSo, Jeff - Does your definition of a &quot;static neural network&quot; include \nrecurrence?\n\n\nJim\n\n\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow this logic.  A computer isn&#39;t just made out of\n&gt; NAND gates.  It also has flip-flops for storing data.  Therefore, I\n&gt; don&#39;t think it follows that a feedforward neural network can act as\n&gt; a programmable computer.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;jeff@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Well, I&#39;m sure people are getting weary of hearing us go on about\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; particular topic so I&#39;ll just say one last thing on it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - One can recreate any arbitrary circuit with a static neural\n&gt; network (in case\n&gt; &gt; there is any doubt about this, try creating a NAND gate).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Therefore, one can recreate a computer with a neural network.\n&gt; &gt; - A computer can be programmed to learn.\n&gt; &gt; - Therefore, a static neural network can learn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unless there is some error in that logic, I&#39;m not sure what the\n&gt; real issue is.\n&gt; &gt;  If we could refrain from talking about nebulous concepts like\n&gt; constructive\n&gt; &gt; signal reinforcement in the brain, that would really make this\n&gt; easier for me\n&gt; &gt; too.
