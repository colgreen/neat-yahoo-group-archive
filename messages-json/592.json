That way, when returning\n&gt; the evaluation results, it \n&gt; can return it to a single point of contact that then\n&gt; knows where to put \n&gt; them.  Then, it won&#39;t be necessary for the server to\n&gt; maintain a list of who \n&gt; took what and then run the risk of getting things\n&gt; confused.\n\nThanks for the input.\n\nThe way we&#39;re currently doing our runs and generating\nXML, all the information you&#39;re talking about is\nstored in the run XML.  I would think the way it would\nwork, if someone wanted to share an evolved population\nwith someone else, is that they could zip up all the\nXML files for individuals (e.g. network XML)...and\nthese could include simply the individuals from the\nfinal generation, or all individuals from the entire\nrun...and a single run XML doc, which serves as an\nindex to all the individuals, contains all the\nparameters, etc.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
