The idea is that if the fitness \n&gt;function varies but there is some underlying theme that is conserved \n&gt;(such as symmetry) the organisms will need to evolve to be able to \n&gt;represent that underlying theme efficiently even though they can&#39;t \n&gt;rely on any particular instance of it.  This does imply that \n&gt;calamities can lead to robustness, but it appears than an important \n&gt;ingredient in such a system is an encoding that can encapsulate \n&gt;information about underlying themes, i.e. an indirect encoding.  \n&gt;Here&#39;s the paper:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco05\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCheers, I&#39;ll add it to the reading list :) I guess there are different \nlevels at which this changing of the fitness function can have an \neffect, or at least there are different ways of thinking about what is \ngoing on. E.g. A fitness function may differ in that the local maxima \nare in different places, so switching acts as a gentle way of keeping \nthe population moving and not getting stuck (maybe). What you seem to be \ntalking about is the evolution of individuals that have an increased \nability to adapt.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
