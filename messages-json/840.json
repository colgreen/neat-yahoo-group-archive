N & M will be parameters\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;we will begin with very small values, then raise\n&gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;  The patterns will be presented sequentially,\n&gt; i.e.,\n&gt; &gt;not simultaneously.  There is at least one\n&gt; additional\n&gt; &gt;input which is a control input to let the net know\n&gt; &gt;that the sequence has ended.  Hence there are M+1\n&gt; &gt;binary inputs.  After the sequence has ended then\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;net is expected to repeat it.  Don&#39;t forget that a\n&gt; &gt;recurrent ANN can be a signal generator; that&#39;s\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt;is supposed to happen here.  The ANN will generate\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;sequence of outputs that is supposed to reproduce\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;input sequence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;There are also M+1 outputs.  M of these are\n&gt; supposed\n&gt; &gt;to replicate one of the input patterns during the\n&gt; &gt;&quot;recall&quot; phase.  The other output is a &quot;ready&quot; line\n&gt; &gt;indicating that the output is valid or that the net\n&gt; &gt;has completed its processing.  During the initial\n&gt; &gt;presentation of the sequence the ready output is\n&gt; used\n&gt; &gt;to indicate that the net is ready to accept the\n&gt; next\n&gt; &gt;pattern.  The other outputs are ignored during this\n&gt; &gt;phase.  In the second, or &quot;recall&quot; phase, the ready\n&gt; &gt;output signals that the pattern is ready to be read\n&gt; &gt;from the pattern outputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is very interesting experimental design.  Did\n&gt; you also consider \n&gt; inputting the start sequence with indices (e.g. M\n&gt; inputs for data and N \n&gt; inputs for &quot;address&quot; -- probably just setting one\n&gt; address-line high, not \n&gt; full binary numbers) and then ask for the data back\n&gt; by repeating the \n&gt; address sequence.\n\nNo.  That would be a different problem, also worth\ndoing.  I&#39;m modeling phone dialing; you hear a phone\nnumber, 7 sounds in sequence, then after only a very\nshort delay you repeat it back in the same sequence,\neither by speaking it or dialing it.\n \n&gt; One other question, you say start small and scale\n&gt; up, but to get back to a \n&gt; thread from a couple of weeks ago, do you have any\n&gt; way of carrying progress \n&gt; over from a net evolved for small examples to larger\n&gt; ones?\n\nYes, I simply don&#39;t re-initialize the population, or\nmaybe I re-initialize a large part of it, but I keep\nthose ANNs that did well on the smaller problem.\n\n&gt; &gt;This is very similar to what is done by my 4Play\n&gt; &gt;program, except 4Play did more complex logic than\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt;repeating memorize values.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d say this was asking for a more complex net,\n&gt; however...\n\nWhich do you think is more complex?\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
