Get the highest high and the lowest low over the \nperiod.\nRescale all the data so that the lowest low is -1 and the highest high \nis +1 then present the normalised high, low, open, close and volume \n(normalised with max volume over period=1, lowest =0) as inputs.\nIf you look at any random stock graph, take off the scale on the axes \nand squint your eyes a bit they all look pretty much the same. This is \nwhat I&#39;m &#39;showing&#39; the net.\nSo the question to be asked is whether it can pick out any patterns in \nthe rises and falls that suggest whether the stock is about to go up or \ndown.\nI&#39;m hoping that within it&#39;s weights it will be holding info such as the \nmomentum, MACD histogram, bollinger bands - all that sort of thing and \nwill be able to come up with some idea of when movements are afoot.\nIdeally, it would return 0 most of the time which would mean that it \nhasn&#39;t got a clue what&#39;s going to happen next. But occasionally when It \nthinks there&#39;s definitely something in the works it will come up with a \nhigh or low score.\nThat&#39;s the theory. I have no idea if it will work in practice.\nOnly 1 way to find out....\n\n\nColin Green wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Emyr, All\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a quick note to say I&#39;ve been working on evolving ANNs that give\n&gt; buy,sell,close signals against London shares. The exact set of inputs\n&gt; has varied widely but right now I&#39;m using close bid/offer price\n&gt; (adjusted), spread (as a proportion of the mid price), # of buy/sell\n&gt; trades (adjusted), buy/sell volume (adjusted) + N day avergaes for\n&gt; volume and # of trades. I also have prices for each day from 10 mins\n&gt; into trading, this means that if a buy/sell signal is generated from a\n&gt; previous day&#39;s close price that the evaluation routine accurately\n&gt; reflects the actual price you would have had to have paid the following\n&gt; day - which is most certainly not the same as the close price a lot of\n&gt; the time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I do happen to have access to seperate buy and sell volume & trade\n&gt; figures which contain some errors but which theoreticaly could give more\n&gt; information about what is going on with a specific share. E.g.\n&gt; conceivably a price can move without any (or few) trades occuring or\n&gt; vice versa, and genrally the price movements don&#39;t necessarily mirror\n&gt; the trades that are taking place.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason (and this is a factor I haven&#39;t, err, factored in yet) is the\n&gt; trading mechanism in use. The London Stock Exchange uses a variety of\n&gt; different methods for trading stocks mostly depending on the size of a\n&gt; company and the volume of trades. SETS is the automatic system used to\n&gt; handle the largest most liquid companies and so it might be wise to only\n&gt; train against SETS companies(or not!). The other main trading mechanism\n&gt; is old fashioned market makers were actual people decide on bid/offer\n&gt; prices - thus the price can move immediately on a piece of news(or\n&gt; because one of the market makers is bored), whereas in SETS the price\n&gt; will react to the trades going through the system. There are other\n&gt; mechanisms that [I think] are basically hybrids of those two systems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Performance so far is great on the training data but the jury&#39;s out so\n&gt; far on the validation data - basically because I don&#39;t have enough data.\n&gt; The results I do have suggest the ANNs perform about as well as a random\n&gt; trader (e.g. a bell curve around 0ish percent), maybe very slightly\n&gt; better - which is potentially all you need to start making money.\n&gt;\n&gt; One note on Emyr&#39;s message:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Assuming that I can get a net that can give good buy / sell signals\n&gt; &gt;based on what the normalised stock graph I show it as input looks like,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Be very careful not to give your ANN&#39;s *any* knowledge of the future.\n&gt; E.g. if you normalise the price of a share over the entire history then\n&gt; the ANN can make the assumption that if it has only seen the price in a\n&gt; low range so far that the prcie will rise at some point in the test\n&gt; data. I went through a couple of phases early on of weeding out any\n&gt; possible routes that information about the future could be supplied in\n&gt; the test data.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this incoming message.\n&gt; Checked by AVG Free Edition.\n&gt; Version: 7.1.394 / Virus Database: 268.10.7/411 - Release Date: 07/08/2006\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
