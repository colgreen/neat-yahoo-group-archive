First of all, this is a novel idea, \nthanks for publishing it.\n\nMy first thought as reading through the paper: Does this simply boil \ndown to an extra (albeit useful) level of indirection?  Of course, the \nnext question: Is this indirection helpful?\n\nThe things not addressed, that I&#39;m wondering..\n\n* So, this is probably most useful for generating meganode networks. \nThe kind of stuff you might put on an FPGA.  Or, is it beating straight \nNEAT even on smaller problems?\n\n* But, let&#39;s say in that case (meganode networks)..  with the complexity \nof the substrate configuration, comes required complexity and detail in \nthe CPNN.  So, I&#39;m wondering, on non &quot;toy&quot; problems, how complex do \nCPNNs need to become, and does NEAT get them there?\n\n* And, again in the meganode case.. what if you cannot a priori \ndetermine a suitable substrate configuration?  The more &quot;unnatural&quot; (I&#39;m \nmissing the right word for this) the configuration, the more depth and \ncomplexity needed in the CPNN.\n\n* So, we&#39;re left with manual substrate configuration.. and perhaps \nthat&#39;s answered in the yet-to-be-published part of your research?  I \nsuppose you might be able to come up with some evolvable substrate \nencoding schemes.\n\n* Finally, I&#39;d sure like to hear more on your ideas about hidden nodes \nin the substrate.  In the one paper I read (&#39;D&#39;Ambrosio), it&#39;s only \nbriefly mentioned in a few spots.\n\nThanks again for the papers.  I like the concept.  I particularly like \nthe feeling when I get when I read it, that this idea probably stemmed \nfrom that 2d function evolver/plotter thing you used to make the \nspaceship some years ago.\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
