PPSN 2008). I would like to introduce a new\npaper that will be at ECAL 2009 which shows one way to remedy this problem:\ncombining a generative encoding (HyperNEAT in this case) with a direct\nencoding (FT-NEAT in this case).\n\nThe resulting algorithm, which we call HybrID (Hybridization of Indirect and\nDirect Encodings), combines the best of both encodings, and outperformed\nHyperNEAT on all of the problems we tested it on, sometimes by as much as\n40%. \n\nI&#39;d be really interested to hear what the people on this list think of the\nwork. For example, I&#39;ll bet there are interesting ways to remedy the problem\nof making exceptions within HyperNEAT, and it would be interesting for us as\na community to explore them. But in the interim, if any of you are deploying\nHyperNEAT on some task and want a possible performance boost, HybrID is easy\nto implement and may lead to a significant improvement.\n\nHere is a link to the paper:\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HybrID-ECAL-2009.pdf\n\nHere is the abstract from the paper:\n\nEvolutionary algorithms typically use direct encodings, where each element\nof the phenotype is specified independently in the genotype. Because direct\nencodings have difficulty evolving modular and symmetric phenotypes, some\nresearchers use indirect encodings, wherein one genomic element can\ninfluence multiple parts of a phenotype. We have previously shown that\nHyperNEAT, an indirect encoding, outperforms FT-NEAT, a direct-encoding\ncontrol, on many problems, especially as the regularity of the problem\nincreases. However, HyperNEAT is no panacea; it had difficulty accounting\nfor irregularities in problems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, a\nHybridized Indirect and Direct encoding (HybrID), which discovers the\nregularity of a problem with an indirect encoding and accounts for\nirregularities via a direct encoding. In three different problem domains,\nHybrID outperforms HyperNEAT in most situations, with performance\nimprovements as large as 40%. Our work suggests that hybridizing indirect\nand direct encodings can be an effective way to improve the performance of\nevolutionary algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
