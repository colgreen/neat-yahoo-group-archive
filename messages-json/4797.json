The only purpose of the cut-off is\n&gt; to restrict the number of connections in the resulting ANN that must\n&gt; be simulated.\n\nI just assumed the cut-off was there to make it really easy to eliminate\nlinks (for functional, fitness-enhancing purposes, not for CPU performance\nreasons). But that assumption could be wrong.\n\n&gt; Sure. Assuming you did use a cut-off of +-0.2 (or so) then I&#39;m\n&gt; suggesting that this may be a disadvantage to HyperNeat because it\n&gt; cannot express connection weights in the +-0.2 range - because they\n&gt; get zeroed. If it is a significant disadvantage then perhaps some of\n&gt; the advantage of HybrID is due to it&#39;s adjusting some of the\n&gt; connections weights (zeroed or otherwise) into the +-0.2 range.\n\nAh. I see what you are suggesting. As Ken just wrote in another email,\nHyperNEAT with the cut-off can actually create links in this range. The link\nvalues after the cut-off are expanded to fill the range of [-1, 1].\n\nFor all of our HyperNEAT papers, we left the cut-off in place. But the\ncut-off was actually producing problems for us in terms of translating\nHyperNEAT genomes into FT-NEAT genomes, so on the HybrID paper we did not\nuse it. \n\nSo the issue you raise is not the reason HybrID does so well, but I can see\nwhy you thought it might.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s trivially simple to add a genome size punishment factor into the\n&gt; fitness function, just use something like:\n&gt; \n&gt;      fitness = fitness / (connectionCount + C)\n&gt; \n&gt; and maybe scale the fitness back up with some fixed multiple, so:\n&gt; \n&gt;   fitness = (fitness * A) / (connectionCount + C)\n\nIt would be cool to see if it works. I&#39;m currently filling our cluster as it\nis with other experiments, but I&#39;d be interested to hear if this works for\nyou (or someone else).\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve also used this approach to limit overfitting of target data, put\n&gt; simply, smaller ANNs are less likely to specialize and overfit than\n&gt; larger ones. I guess you could say it&#39;s a form of regularization.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea. Did you find that it worked?\n\n-jeff\n\n\n\n"}}
