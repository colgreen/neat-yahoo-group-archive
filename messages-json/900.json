I think I covered most of what I \nwanted to comment on in my previous posts but there are a few other \nminor points I had noted...\n\n1) I noticed that you don&#39;t clamp the number of species, so I was \nwondering why you made this decision. Is this because the experiments \nyou compare against also do this?\n\n2) You square the fitness value obtained for XOR. What is the thinking \nbehind this?\n\n3) The Tic-Tac-Toe experiment uses the &quot;standard hyperbolic tangent&quot; \nactivation function. Again, is this to give a more accurate comparison \nwith other experiments?\n\n\nColin.\n\n\nDerek James wrote:\n\n&gt;Our paper &quot;A Comparative Analysis of Simplification and\n&gt;Complexification in the Evolution of Neural Network Topologies&quot; has\n&gt;been accepted as a late-breaking paper to GECCO &#39;04.\n&gt;\n&gt;We&#39;ve posted it in the Files section of the Yahoo Group for anyone\n&gt;who&#39;s interested:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
