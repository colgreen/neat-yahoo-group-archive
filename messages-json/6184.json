There&#39;s been a lot of talk recently about novelty search\n&gt; versus objective search, and maybe mixtures of the two. I myself\n&gt; talked about how in the natural world organisms are separated in both\n&gt; behavioural space (i.e. novel behaviour is less likely to compete for\n&gt; the same resources as existing behaviours) but also geographical\n&gt; space, and I think that geographical space is a key factor that is\n&gt; missing from NEAT based search currently, and possibly EC as a whole,\n&gt; with the caveat there may be other research groups with work in that\n&gt; area that I&#39;m unaware of.\n&gt;\n&gt; My current plan is to focus on this geographical space idea for this\n&gt; iteration because it is the simplest to implement. Dealing with\n&gt; behavioural space is potentially more complicated because how to\n&gt; compare behaviour varies across problem domains and how you identify\n&gt; the key factors to compare is probably a non-trivial problem. I want\n&gt; to try and tackle this at some point, but I&#39;m also keen to explore the\n&gt; geo-space idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does this all mean in practical terms?\n&gt;\n&gt; SharpNEAT is a kit of parts that allows you to swap in replacement\n&gt; parts such as an alternative genetic representation and/or associated\n&gt; genetic operators (recombination, mutation, etc) with minimal impact\n&gt; on other parts in the kit (in principle anyway). I&#39;m proposing to\n&gt; provide an alternative evolution algorithm class that replaces NEAT&#39;s\n&gt; genome based speciation (which clusters genomes into K clusters in\n&gt; genetic space), with a geographical space alternative (I&#39;ll call it\n&gt; geo-space for short).\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea is that we have some cartesian/euclidean space (probably a\n&gt; square 2D space initially to keep the code simple, but 3D or &#39;globe&#39;\n&gt; space (2-sphere) are reasonable alternatives). The seed genomes are\n&gt; each assigned a random coord in the geo-space and this will be fixed\n&gt; for the life of that genome. So we are basically adding a physical\n&gt; attribute to the genome such that our population members are probably\n&gt; better referred to as organisms (or agents or population members).\n&gt; I&#39;ll use &#39;agent&#39; because it&#39;s easier to type :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Agent fitness is now adjusted by population density at the agent&#39;s\n&gt; geo-location, this allows really bad agents to survive so long as they\n&gt; are in a sparse region of geo-space, thus allowing for some diversity\n&gt; of the genome pool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reproduction - I haven&#39;t put much thought into this but the two\n&gt; options I see are to create offspring agents near to their parent(s)\n&gt; versus randomly scattered. Probably some &#39;dispersion&#39; variable will\n&gt; define the amount of scattering with 0 being atop of the parent (or\n&gt; between the two?) and 1 being totally random. (Question: Is e.g. seed\n&gt; scattering in nature gaussian?). Clearly if agent&#39;s are spawned near\n&gt; their parent&#39;s we would expect to see clusters of agent&#39;s with similar\n&gt; behaviour, and that clustering will increase population density and\n&gt; therefore lower the fitness of agent&#39;s in that cluster. So there is a\n&gt; form of fitness sharing going on, but as I say, I haven&#39;t really\n&gt; thought through the implications and dynamics of that. But it would be\n&gt; interesting to set up, play with and observe what happens.\n&gt;\n&gt; Factoring in behavioural space considerations should be possible at a\n&gt; later date, e.g. fitness at a geo-location is not adjusted down if an\n&gt; agent has novel behaviour compared to other agent&#39;s at that\n&gt; geo-location.\n&gt;\n&gt; As per usual - any thoughts and feedback are welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b5d63c48fcbcb04e4ec2d5e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi Colin,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like your ideas on geograph=\r\nical space-based evolution.
