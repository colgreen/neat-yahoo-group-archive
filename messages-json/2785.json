Full spiking networks are also called &quot;leaky \ni=\r\nntegrate-and-fire&quot; networks, and are mathematically related to \nCTRNNs but =\r\nare more biologically realistic than even CTRNNs.\n\nYou can find references =\r\nfor CTRNNs in the Discussion section of my \ndissertation.  In fact, Tyler S=\r\ntreeters &quot;leakyNEAT&quot; code for CTRNN-\nevolving NEAT is in our Files section =\r\non this group:\n\nleakyNEAT.zip \n\nHowever, I do not know of anyone who has ev=\r\nolved full-fledged \nspiking networks with NEAT, which would be interesting.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G.
