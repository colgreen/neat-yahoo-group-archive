It might be easier if there was a plain EXE version since I \ntend to use Remote Connection to my workhorse PC and then \nlogoff/disconnect leaving processes running with no display - and hence \nno screensaver. Also it has other (low CPU) jobs to do, so keeping the \nCPU priority low would be nice.\n\n&gt;\tIt&#39;s not as fully automatic as Seti@Home, in that you will need to \n&gt;mail the results back to me (which will typically zip down to about 1/2 a meg).\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBTW 7-zip (www.7-zip.org) is a nice tool for zipping up files. I&#39;ve seen \nit compress files to a quarter the size of an equivalent zip at max \ncompression, so it might help alleviate the load on your mailbox.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
