So e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt;    f(G, x, y) =3D (f1(=\r\nG) * x) + (f2(G) * y)\n\nOn relfection this isn&#39;t quite right. One weigting w=\r\nould adjust the balance between two fitness functions, e.g.\n\n    f(G, x) =\r\n=3D (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * (1-x))\n\nSo for a 2D space you&#39;d have something l=\r\nike:\n\n    f(G, x, y) =3D (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * (1-x)) \n               + (f=\r\n3(G) * y) + (f4(G) * (1-y)) \n\n\nWe also need a way to make selection not bec=\r\nome biased towards Individuals in one part of the space because they get be=\r\ntter fitness there - maybe the fitnesses need be normalized in some way (ma=\r\nx in each region is the same) but that doesn&#39;t feel quite right (needs more=\r\n thought).\n\nI&#39;ll also give an example of a domain to try and explain why th=\r\nis might work. Consider a fitness function with just 1 dimension f(G,x) and=\r\n we&#39;re tryign to evolve a bipedal walker. f1 could be a standing still test=\r\n (not falling over), f2 could be the walking distance test. So you&#39;re genom=\r\nes start out by doing well on f1 and then some migrate over to f2 to popula=\r\nte that region of the fitness space. It does mean more CPU effort having to=\r\n evaulate f1 and f2, and you also need to define network inputs such that y=\r\nou can tell the biped whether to stand or walk, so it&#39;s not an entirely tri=\r\nvial swap in replacement of G based fitness sharing, but I&#39;m warming to the=\r\n idea the more I think about it.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
