My main point was not about\n&gt; &gt; reaching any particular long=\r\n term goal.  My point was that there \nis\n&gt; &gt; an analogy between the *proces=\r\ns* of IEC and natural evolution.\n&gt; &gt; Remember that the original statement t=\r\nhat spawned this discussion\n&gt; &gt; was about IEC being more natural than TBE.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you mention that IEC can no better reproduce an image than \nT=\r\nBE\n&gt; &gt; (and that you had trouble with your tiger), you are really \nmaking m=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; point.  As soon as you start setting a target (such as your \ntiger),\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; you are in effect imposing TBE.  That is, an individual who \nstarts\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n playing with an IEC interface from scratch who is intent on\n&gt; &gt; achieving =\r\na particular image will be disappointed because they \nare\n&gt; &gt; basically jus=\r\nt doing TBE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right. So I guess it depends on the human in your IEC has=\r\n a long \nterm goal\n&gt; in mind. Thus, the issue is not IEC, but a type of IEC=\r\n. And this \ntype of IEC\n&gt; is similar to co-evolution and alife and even som=\r\ne types of TBE \n(those that\n&gt; leave a good cookie crumb trail).\n&gt; \n\nBut you=\r\n see IEC always turns into the type of IEC I&#39;m talking about \nif it is the =\r\nkind of collaborative branch-based IEC in Picbreeder \nbecause it is impossi=\r\nble for the system as a whole to be driven by a \nparticular goal.  The wors=\r\nt that can happen is that an individual \nuser simply doesn&#39;t publish someth=\r\ning because their personal goal \nwasn&#39;t satisfied.  However, that has no ef=\r\nfect on the collective \ndynamic, which is that what *is* published is fodde=\r\nr for everything \nelse.\n\n&gt; Maybe I misread you, but I also got the drift th=\r\nat you were saying \nthat one\n&gt; of the reasons TBE is wrongheaded is because=\r\n it seeks a particular \ngoal. But\n&gt; this criticism seems a bit odd, since t=\r\nhey are interested in a \nparticular\n&gt; goal (e.g. A car part that does x, y =\r\nand z). While the processes \nyou herald\n&gt; might be better for producing hig=\r\nher levels of complexity in \ngeneral, they\n&gt; won&#39;t produce a car part that =\r\nworks for our mechanical engineer. \nAs such,\n&gt; TBE seems the right choice i=\r\nf you do have a goal in mind. I think \nmost\n&gt; people would agree with you t=\r\nhat if you want to evolve complexity \nin general\n&gt; it is a bad idea to have=\r\n it try to produce something specific.\n&gt; \n\nYou&#39;re basically saying that TBE=\r\n is doing the best they can because \nthey have a goal and therefore what el=\r\nse can they do?  That&#39;s fine, \nI can accept that for now.  :)  I&#39;m just say=\r\ning that non-TBE is \nexciting and deserves more attention, not that we shou=\r\nld abolish TBE \ncompletely.\n\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I said, &quot;Stop telling evolution=\r\n what you want and let\n&gt; &gt; evolution show you what it can do.&quot;  Evolution c=\r\nan do a lot of\n&gt; &gt; amazing things if we just let it show us the paths it is=\r\n \ndisposed to\n&gt; &gt; take.  IEC is a way of exploring all those paths with no =\r\n\nparticular\n&gt; &gt; purpose in mind (just like nature).\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok. I think I agre=\r\ne with you with some types of EC. But there are \nmany types\n&gt; of EC that ar=\r\ne not TBE and do not suffer from this problem (e.g. \nmost Alife,\n&gt; like Avi=\r\nda). In those systems we still don&#39;t see things complexify \nlike they\n&gt; do =\r\nin the natural world (i.e. We see nothing like open-ended \nevolution). So,\n=\r\n&gt; the problem is not ONLY TBE.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was hoping to hear whether you put pr=\r\nojects like Golem or sims \nin the TBE\n&gt; category...what do you call somethi=\r\nng that has a more abstract \ngoal like\n&gt; &quot;move far, fast.&quot; Do you think tha=\r\nt suffers from the problems you \noutline\n&gt; with TBE?\n&gt; \n\nI do consider Gole=\r\nm to be TBE, yes, because it has an explicit \ngoal.  Sure, there are many w=\r\nays to achieve the goal, but the goal \nis what makes it TBE.\n\nHowever, it&#39;s=\r\n true there are alife systems that try to \nimplement &quot;open-ended evolution&quot;=\r\n (as Cesar, Peter, and Greg were \ndiscussing on this group recently).   Tho=\r\nse systems probably are not \nTBE.  However, most that have been produced so=\r\n far suffer from other \nproblems, which is why they don&#39;t show the kind of =\r\ncomplexity \nexplosion we wish they did.   \n\n&gt; &gt; In fact, I can even demonst=\r\nrate to you that it is not just the \nCPPN\n&gt; &gt; encoding that is allowing the=\r\n impressive results on Picbreeder\n&gt; &gt; because one such project on the inter=\r\nnet actually already used\n&gt; &gt; DelphiNEAT-based encoding, but they implement=\r\ned the collaboration\n&gt; &gt; with the traditional averaging method.  It&#39;s calle=\r\nd the &quot;Living\n&gt; &gt; Image Project.&quot;  Look at the massive difference between w=\r\nhat this\n&gt; &gt; system produces and Picbreeder (the Living Image Project has b=\r\neen\n&gt; &gt; going more than a year):\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://w-shadow.com/li/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  I think these are pretty cool...and complex...and even show \nthings like\n=\r\n&gt; radial and bilateral symmetry! All this without hyperneat?!?  What \nwas I=\r\n\n&gt; supposed to find lacking here?  I clearly do not have the trained \neye f=\r\nor\n&gt; these things that you do.\n&gt; \n\nActually this project does use almost th=\r\ne exact same encoding as \nPicbreeder, which is why I mentioned it.  It uses=\r\n DelphiNEAT, which \nis where the idea for CPPNs was inspired.  I guess I&#39;m =\r\nnot sure what \nyou mean when you say you don&#39;t see the difference between t=\r\nhis and \nPicbreeder, where we have distinct objects like cars, insects, and=\r\n \nfaces.  You don&#39;t a see difference between those pictures and the \nones o=\r\nn this site?  \n\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s important to note that I don&#39;t mean to pick on thi=\r\ns project.\n&gt; &gt; It was one of the very few of its kind when it began and was=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; genuinely groundbreaking.  Its author deserves to be commended \nand\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; its a lot of fun to follow.  Yet it does show that when you are\n&gt; &gt; colla=\r\nting a mass of opinions, you cannot go off in a myriad of\n&gt; &gt; different dir=\r\nections.  In fact, you can barely move anywhere at\n&gt; &gt; all.  Collaborative =\r\nGenetic Art installations of the past \ngenerally\n&gt; &gt; used this collating me=\r\nthod (in one way or another) and produced\n&gt; &gt; images that look generally pr=\r\netty, but don&#39;t show any real\n&gt; &gt; progression.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I have been saying=\r\n has been lurking behind this discussion \nfor a while,\n&gt; so let&#39;s bring it =\r\nto the surface: how do you quantify progression? \nHow do\n&gt; you know (or why=\r\n do you think) that picbreeder has more _____ \n(complexity?\n&gt; Diversity?) t=\r\nhan this project?\n&gt; &gt; \n\nGood question.  The significant observation is that=\r\n Picbreeder \nproduces images that look like real things and that there woul=\r\nd have \nbeen no other way that I know of to evolve such representations.  \n=\r\nProgress means creating a foundation upon which discoveries become \npossibl=\r\ne that were not possible before.  Picbreeder is doing that \nover and over a=\r\ngain, and you can actually see it visually. \n\nMuch more could obviously be =\r\nsaid on this topic.  It&#39;s deep and \nfundamental to all of evolution; it&#39;s r=\r\nelated to the definition of \ncomplexity, which has never been pinned down (=\r\nno definition yet has \nreally captured what it is).  Nevertheless we genera=\r\nlly recognize it \nwhen we see it, which is exactly why we are so interested=\r\n in what it \nis.\n\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, the main point is that the multi-user branchi=\r\nng-style of \nIEC\n&gt; &gt; (like Picbreeder) leads to a process that is more anal=\r\nogous to\n&gt; &gt; natural evolution than TBE.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you have created is a la=\r\nrge world with different niches \n(niches being\n&gt; users, types of users, etc=\r\n.) It is more natural because the large \nnumber of\n&gt; different niches incre=\r\nases the diversity of the population..and \nthese niches\n&gt; change and grow, =\r\npartly in response to the existing \npopulation....all that\n&gt; has a lot of t=\r\nhings that the natural world has. So, I see where \nyou are\n&gt; coming from. A=\r\nnd I can see how having the entire population shoot \nfor one\n&gt; goal could p=\r\nrevent that type of diversity. So, I understand some \nof the\n&gt; reasons you =\r\nthink a form of IEC (e.g. not the form I employed when \nsearching\n&gt; for the=\r\n Tiger) have natural elements in them.

Could we then\n&gt; &gt; evolve a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; CPPN (or ANN if you prefer=\r\n) that produces the desired image?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The answer is surprising (w=\r\ne&#39;ve tried it!).  It turns out to be\n&gt; &gt; very\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; hard with anything but =\r\nthe simplest of images.  What you \ndiscover\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; quickly is that the fitne=\r\nss function isn&#39;t rewarding the right\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; things.  The images tends to de=\r\nvolve into a gray cloud that\n&gt; &gt; minimizes\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; error by choosing an inter=\r\nmediate shade- not what you want at\n&gt; &gt; all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yet the issue is =\r\ndeeper than that.  In fact, here is what is\n&gt; &gt; really\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interesting: I=\r\nf you take any image (except the simplest ones) \non\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Picbreeder- image=\r\ns that were evolved through IEC with NEAT- you\n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not be able t=\r\no evolve to those same images through TBE with\n&gt; &gt; NEAT!  I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; challenge=\r\n anyone to disprove me on this; I&#39;d be very \ninterested.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That =\r\nis a remarkable observation: NEAT can&#39;t reproduce it&#39;s own\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; results!  =\r\nThe only conclusion is that the selection method is \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; culprit.  Th=\r\nat is, it has to do with how you decide what&#39;s good\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; any partic=\r\nular generation, which of course is different in IEC\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; TBE.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; But I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t reproduce images using IEC either...I \ntried=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to get to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a tiger looking shape and did not get very far (though =\r\nI only\n&gt; &gt; stuck around\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for about 40 generations). Note: a tiger&#39;s ent=\r\nire body in \nprofile,\n&gt; &gt; not a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; face. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So let&#39;s look more =\r\nclosely at this issue:  How did we evolve\n&gt; &gt; images\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interactively th=\r\nat could not be reached through regular TBE?  \nThe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; answer is that hum=\r\nans have a different way of rewarding\n&gt; &gt; intermediate\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; results.  In p=\r\narticular, human breeders in IEC examine what is\n&gt; &gt; good\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; *in the pre=\r\nsent* and make their decision based on that whereas\n&gt; &gt; TBE\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; compares =\r\nwhat you have in the present to a long-term future \ngoal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Perh=\r\naps if you&#39;ve used Picbreeder or IEC you may think that you\n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nactually evolving to a target and thus that I am wrong.  But\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Picbreed=\r\ner disproves this view.  As soon as *someone else*\n&gt; &gt; branches\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from =\r\nyour image, whatever &quot;target&quot; you may have had in mind (if\n&gt; &gt; any)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i=\r\ns irrelevant.  They have their own ideas about what is good.\n&gt; &gt; So it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; isn&#39;t possible that what the next person in the chain evolved \nwas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nyour original intent.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand I may not need to go t=\r\nhat far to make the \npoint\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; because if you&#39;re like me, you kind of dis=\r\ncover what&#39;s cool as\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; go.  I may have a vague idea in mind, bu=\r\nt on the road to that\n&gt; &gt; idea I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see that something cool I hadn&#39;t tho=\r\nught of before pops up, so \nI\n&gt; &gt; go\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; off in that direction instead.  =\r\nWhat matters most is what&#39;s \ngood\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the present.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No=\r\nw here is the connection to natural evolution:  Natural\n&gt; &gt; evolution\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n is also completely unconcerned with ultimate goals or targets.\n&gt; &gt; It\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; only concerns itself with whether the present candidates are\n&gt; &gt; good in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the present.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I am going to argue that that is a major =\r\nsource of its power; \nit\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; explains in part its prolific creativity and=\r\n its astounding\n&gt; &gt; ability\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to elaborate indefinitely.  Yes, I am cla=\r\niming that it can do \nall\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that because it *doesn&#39;t* have a target.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; True, but the problem is not IEC vs TBE...it is long-term \ntargets=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; vs.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something like co-evolution.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So then what&#39;s so gr=\r\neat about not having a target?  What&#39;s \ngreat\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that you get rew=\r\narded for doing what you *can* do.  And a good\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; encoding can do a lot.=\r\n  However, what&#39;s very difficult, even \nfor\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; good encoding, is t=\r\no do a completely arbitrary complex thing\n&gt; &gt; that is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nowhere close t=\r\no the current population in the search space.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That is why I ca=\r\nlled TBE a liability:  It evaluates the current\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; candidates against so=\r\nmething that ignores their current \nstrengths\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; completely.  For exampl=\r\ne, imagine if the first bilateria\n&gt; &gt; (bilaterally-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; symmetric organis=\r\nms) were evaluated for their humanity.  They\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; all fail miser=\r\nably and they would all therefore be eliminated.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Humanity would never=\r\n have evolved even though we in fact did\n&gt; &gt; evolve\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from the first bi=\r\nlateria!  If TBE were in charge and humans \nwere\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; goal, we wou=\r\nldn&#39;t exist right now.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Try going back even farther.  Can you i=\r\nmagine evaluating single\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; celled organisms for their &quot;human-ness?&quot;  Th=\r\nat would be silly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yet that is exactly what we are doing in mo=\r\nst evolutionary\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; experiments.  We do nothing to capture good intermedi=\r\nate ideas\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which it would be possible to build our ultimate o=\r\nbjectives.  \nSo\n&gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; are hampered from getting anywhere truly inter=\r\nesting.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is that true in experiments like Karl Sims, or in the Go=\r\nlem\n&gt; &gt; Project, were\n&gt; &gt;&gt; goals were things like &quot;whatever can move the fa=\r\nrthest from the\n&gt; &gt; starting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; point in x seconds is more fit&quot;? It seems=\r\n like you can equally\n&gt; &gt; judge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; bilaterals vs. humans on this goals (a=\r\nnd man do those bilaterals\n&gt; &gt; suck...but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they are probably better tha=\r\nn single cells).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Then you might ask, that&#39;s all well and=\r\n good, but how in the\n&gt; &gt; world\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can we reward the intermediate serend=\r\nipitous discoveries if we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; know what they should be?  The  a=\r\nnswer is: Respect the fact \nthat\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know what they are.  S=\r\ntop trying to *tell* evolution what\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can do and let it *show* y=\r\nou what it can do.  When it shows you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; something cool, then keep that =\r\nfor later.  Keep everything with\n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; promise for later.  You neve=\r\nr know what might be a foundation\n&gt; &gt; for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; next level up.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; That&#39;s exactly what natural evolution did and that&#39;s exactly\n&gt; &gt; what =\r\nIEC\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (Picbreeder variety) does:  In nature what happened was that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthere\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; were many ways of doing a good job (at surviving) and there was=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; room\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; enough on Earth to support a lot of them at once.  \nNobody =\r\n&quot;knew&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; which ones would form a good foundation for something more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n complex\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (and many lineages didn&#39;t go anywhere), but because a lot of=\r\n \ncool\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ideas were able to hang around, some of them happened to be \ng=\r\nood\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; stepping stones to the next big thing.  The issue was where the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; DNA\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; encoding could go next from where it is now.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Same=\r\n with IEC in Picbreeder:  We don&#39;t know what we want to\n&gt; &gt; evolve\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; co=\r\nllectively.  I think it&#39;s fair to say that we have no\n&gt; &gt; collective\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\ncommon goal at all.  We are all just trying different paths.\n&gt; &gt; Some of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; us, when we see a cool path, take that path a bit farther and a\n&gt; &gt; bit=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; farther still.  We keep all the intermediate stages around\n&gt; &gt; forev=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and we therefore preserve all possible stepping stones.  Some\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhappen\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to be genuinely good foundations for future progress, like \nth=\r\nose\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; produced the car, or the recent skull.  Yet who would ha=\r\nve seen\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; coming?  If we had tried to evolve to them from the =\r\nstart, we&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nowhere (we&#39;d be in the usual TBE trap).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For this reason, what&#39;s going on in Picbreeder is really\n&gt; &gt; intriguing=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the first artificial evolutionary experiment that is \nreally\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; doing something like natural evolution!  We may have some \namazing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karl Sims had exhibits where the length of time people stood in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n front of an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; image determined its fitness...and there have been others=\r\n that \nput\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fitness evaluation in the hands of distributed user=\r\ns (one at \nGecco\n&gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; year, for example)...so, while I think that =\r\n(because of the \nCPPN)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; picbreeder&#39;s images are cooler than what others=\r\n are producing,\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t it a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stretch to call it the first?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; encodings out there, but we don&#39;t get to see it because all we\n&gt; &gt; do is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; TBE, where we keep losing the intermediate foundations we would\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nneed\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to get to a new level.  Picbreeder is the first time that we \nle=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evolution show us what it can do instead of telling it what we\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwant\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it to do.  We are respecting the encoding just as nature\n&gt; &gt; res=\r\npected\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; DNA.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; There are some important corollaries: First,=\r\n TBE is not just\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; images.  In effect, all regular fitness fu=\r\nnctions have the same\n&gt; &gt; TBE\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; liability.  Do you think you can evolve=\r\n an amazing neural \nnetwork\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with NEAT or with HyperNEAT?  Or somethin=\r\ng else?  Well, if you\n&gt; &gt; have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; target behavior that you evaluate ag=\r\nainst, you are never going \nto\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; know how amazing things could be.  Thi=\r\ns is a sobering\n&gt; &gt; realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s just as true with behaviors=\r\n as it is with images.  \n(This\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; insight suggests that evolving behavio=\r\nrs interactively instead \nof\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through a fitness function is a really p=\r\nromising path)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One exception is competitive coevolution, where=\r\nin individuals\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actually are evaluated against other individuals, so i=\r\nt&#39;s not\n&gt; &gt; really\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; target-based.  In a sense individuals are recogniz=\r\ned for being \nas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; good as they can be in the present.  Of course, natu=\r\nre is a \nkind\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; coevolution.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yet I don&#39;t want to pr=\r\netend that competitive coevolution is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perfect pathway to complexi=\r\nty because the task may be defined \nin\n&gt; &gt; such\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a way that it might a=\r\ns well be necessary to solve some gigantic\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; problem to become good.  F=\r\nor example, competitive coevolution \non\n&gt; &gt; Go\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; may not really end up =\r\nrewarding individuals for finding really\n&gt; &gt; basic\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; regularities that =\r\nare necessary to eventually evolving a good \nGo\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; player.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Th=\r\nis is a good place to reiterate my claim from above: would\n&gt; &gt; humans be an=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt;&gt; better at providing the right pathway to complexity for Go? I\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nink you and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree that the hard part is knowing what cookie crumb tr=\r\nail to\n&gt; &gt; leave the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; populations...but I don&#39;t know that IEC is better=\r\n than co-\n&gt; &gt; evolution or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (well-done) TBE at rewarding good intermedi=\r\nate steps. Maybe a \ngood\n&gt; &gt; Go\n&gt; &gt;&gt; teacher could do a good job because it=\r\n knows the correct path to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; complexity...but that is simply because the=\r\ny have learned how to\n&gt; &gt; teach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (reward) Go players...so using them se=\r\nems to be cheating a bit.\n&gt; &gt; Ironically,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it is because they know the =\r\nlong term goal, and how to get \nthere,\n&gt; &gt; that they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can help players =\r\ntake longer routes through many valleys to \nhigher\n&gt; &gt; peaks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instead o=\r\nf rushing up the closest peak. So, here, it seems like\n&gt; &gt; long-term\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nargets might actually be one of the reasons IEC is better! \nExcept\n&gt; &gt; in h=\r\numans\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it is a knowledge of long term goals *plus* a decent idea of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; path to get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there. For example, if an engineer was able to intera=\r\nctively\n&gt; &gt; evolve Karl\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sims creature it could, with the right represe=\r\nntations, make\n&gt; &gt; something like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a ferrari....but the whole point of =\r\nevolutionary computation to\n&gt; &gt; figure out\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how nature did it without l=\r\nong-term goals. No? As such, it seems\n&gt; &gt; less\n&gt; &gt;&gt; natural to me. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; As for why things complexified on Earth and they don&#39;t in \nEC...my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nleading\n&gt; &gt;&gt; theory (theories?) is that the Earth is just more massive (whi=\r\nch\n&gt; &gt; leads to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more parallel processing), spatially structured (which=\r\n allows \nmore\n&gt; &gt;&gt; diversity), co-evolving, has been running for a long tim=\r\ne (if \nyou\n&gt; &gt; chop off\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the last 20% of the run you don&#39;t get most hig=\r\nher-order life), \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fine-grained (which increases the possibilities)=\r\n. Much of that\n&gt; &gt; does not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; exist in EC yet.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The key to natural evolution was that there were a lot of easy\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nays\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to do well in the beginning.  So we got a diversity of viable\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n jumping\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; off points.  That is also true on Picbreeder:  You can easil=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; get a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; picture that&#39;s good enough to be worth showing others.  S=\r\no it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; got a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; very natural property: It proliferates jumping-off p=\r\noints too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you like, you can think of Picbreeder as an ecol=\r\nogy where \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; environment is just the preferences of its myriad user=\r\ns.  The\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; environment in nature is just Earth and physics.  These are \n=\r\nquite\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; different environments, but their effect on the dynamics of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n selection\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; form an analogy.  So at that level, it doesn&#39;t matter if a=\r\n \nhuman\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the loop or not.  What humans like is just the envi=\r\nronment.\n&gt; &gt; And\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the nice things is, humans are very sensitive to reg=\r\nularity and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; organization at all levels: exactly what a good environme=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; should\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; reward if we want to build up.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw where Picbreeder will go because part of it \ndepends\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; how man=\r\ny users we get and how much they persevere.  So it may\n&gt; &gt; never\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; prod=\r\nuce great works of art; I&#39;d be surprised if it did.  Yet it\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhese intriguing ingredients that we have not had before, so it\n&gt; &gt; is a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; much more significant experiment than just a bunch of people\n&gt; &gt; playing=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with an art toy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully this endless message answers=\r\n the question with some\n&gt; &gt; extra\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; food for thought to boot.  I know t=\r\nhere are a lot of\n&gt; &gt; controversial\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ideas here and please forgive me =\r\nfor not reminding you as I \nwent\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; many such claims were merel=\r\ny speculation: I realize that they\n&gt; &gt; are,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; but if I acknowledged tha=\r\nt every time I speculated this near-\n&gt; &gt; novel\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would be twice as long=\r\n!  You can be sure that I am not trying \nto\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; present these ideas as se=\r\nttled facts by any means.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I enjoy the conversation. Thanks for s=\r\ntarting it. :-)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course the reason it was possible is because humans are\n&gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluation- which yields another lesson: The fitness functi=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; most\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolutionary computation is a liability agains=\r\nt getting to\n&gt; &gt; high-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; level\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complexity. There are deep reaso=\r\nns that human evaluation is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; actually\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more analogous to what h=\r\nappened over natural evolution than \nany\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type of evalua=\r\ntion scheme we run on computers. We are often\n&gt; &gt; misled\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into belie=\r\nving that interactive evolution is less &quot;natural&quot;\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; normal E=\r\nC. Actually, the opposite is true.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Jeff, I&#39;d be interes=\r\nted in hearing you expand your\n&gt; &gt; thoughts on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this.  I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think =\r\nthe demonstration is no less impressive, but it seems to\n&gt; &gt; me\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distinction between natural and artificial selection is an\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nmportant\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conceptual one.  Natural selection is based on the attribut=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment, while artificial selection is the result =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; attributes\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; selected\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by an agent (akin to animal breedin=\r\ng or horticulture).  In\n&gt; &gt; fact, in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Origin of Species, Da=\r\nrwin used many many examples of rapid\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evolutionary\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change in d=\r\nomesticated species such as pigeons and dogs to\n&gt; &gt; bolster\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; argument for his theory.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you&#39;re taking issue with th=\r\ne terms &quot;natural&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;artificial&quot;, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe there are better=\r\n ways to make the distinction (&quot;agent-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; directed&quot; vs.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;environm=\r\nent-directed&quot;, &quot;conscious&quot; vs. &quot;unconscious&quot;\n&gt; &gt; evolution...I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know).  But while I don&#39;t think artificial selection is any \nless\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; effective\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or powerful, probably moreso in some cases, I think it=\r\n&#39;s \nuseful\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; maintain\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that distinction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --=\r\nDerek\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
