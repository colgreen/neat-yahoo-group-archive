SharpNEAT now always keeps at least one \n&#39;best&#39; species so that the best fitness for a population will never be \nseen to drop. It seems to work quite well, in fact using this in \ncombination with a higher connection addition mutation rate I was able \nto evolve a network that solves the simple OCR problem perfectly, 26 out \nof 26 characters correct.\n\nAnyway, the new graphs tell pretty much the same story but are less \nconfusing, so I thought it would be a good idea to update them.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
