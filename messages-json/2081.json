And there is one or more correct\n&gt; &gt;answer(s) for each (at least if we include &quot;resign&quot; for those where we know\n&gt; &gt;we already lost).  So how about ordering those 608 in reverse order of how\n&gt; &gt;&quot;simple&quot; they are to answer and then just testing the network against each\n&gt; &gt;of those in order, the score being the number of boards the network gets\n&gt; &gt;through before giving a wrong answer.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I know this may not seem in the spirit of what you&#39;re after.  e.g. just\n&gt; &gt;chasing the perfect game and ignoring any question of alternative\n&gt; &gt;strategies along the way, but the fact that it would be possible to chase\n&gt; &gt;the perfect game in this way might suggest that there may be no alternative\n&gt; &gt;strategies to find.  e.g. that the game is too simple...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;I /think/ the approach you describe is one step away from using\n&gt;backpropogation to learn all of the correct responses! If a NEAT search\n&gt;has found it&#39;s own strong strategies for playing then that is really\n&gt;cool because an algorithm has learned something all by itself. Perhaps\n&gt;we can then apply our approach to other games for which no known strong\n&gt;algorithmic strategies exist, e.g. Go. Unlikely right now, but these are\n&gt;the sort of things that motivate me. If we place knowledge of a good\n&gt;strategy into the system and then NEAT finds this then what have we\n&gt;really achieved? Sorry if I&#39;m emitting anti-motivational vibes today ;)\n\nNo problem.\n\nWhat I was wondering, however, is whether the fact that my unsuitable \napproach exists doesn&#39;t imply that the game is too simple for there to be \nmuch in the way of alternate strategies for the NEAT to find.\n\nThis brings up questions of the nature of TTT and the I/O.  I think you \nsaid input was was 9 nodes with +1 for mine, 0 for empty and -1 for \nyours?  Or was it 27 nodes with a separate node set to 1 for empty, mine, \nyours on each cell?\n\nHow are you handling output, is it 9 nodes and you take the highest as the \nselection?  I assume your networks are non-recurrent so you don&#39;t have any \nquestion of when to take the output?\n\nHow do you respond when the net chooses a non-empty cell?  Do you just take \nthe next highest output?  If you do, is that hiding something of the game \ndetail from the network -- e.g. that picking a full cell is bad?  Is there \nan argument for first training the network to play in legal spaces and only \nthen worry about winning?\n\nDid you need to make any consideration of the fact that a &quot;solution&quot; for \nTTT only involves stalemates and never wins/losses?  e.g. rewarding a \nnetwork for winning might be a false lead, because as better opponents are \nadded it will become impossible to win, so aiming to win should take second \nplace to trying _not to lose_.\n\nAlso, is the game for naughts different from the game for crosses?  e.g. \nonly crosses ever gets to play on an empty board - only crosses is ever a \npiece ahead...\n\nAs you can see, I&#39;m getting quite interested in this.\n\nIf we want to extend to more complex games, then we could really do with a \ngame that was scalable.  Maybe TTT is, e.g. could we generalise it to being \nplayed on an MxM grid and needing to complete a line N long?\n\nM &gt;= N :)\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
