CPPNs have the\n&gt; nice property that they are fairly straightforward.  You can look at\n&gt; each hidden node and look at the intermediate structure that it\n&gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, on the other hand, it&#39;s\n&gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to explain, and therefore more\n&gt; difficult to bias.\n\nHave you done this Ken? Was it helpful to understand what was going on?\n\nDo you guys have a tool that makes this easy to do? I think it would be very\ninstructive to be able to look at the contribution of hidden nodes and\nsubgraphs of the CPPN network.\n\njeff\n\n\n\n\n"}}
