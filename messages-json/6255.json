The domesticated birds can le=\r\narn the songs of the wild birds\nbut the wild birds are often unable to lear=\r\nn the songs of the domesticated\nbird, so it seems to be due to a physiologi=\r\ncal difference.\n\nIn the paper they hypothesise that this increase in song c=\r\nomplexity can be\naccounted for by the removal of selection pressure in the =\r\ndomesticated\npopulation, allowing more genetic drift. They use a simulation=\r\n of evolution\nto lend weight to their argument. The birds in a new generati=\r\non learn from\nsong samples, selected according to a genetically encoded fil=\r\nter, of the\nbirds in the previous generation. The simulation starts out wit=\r\nh birds\nwhich only produce simple songs and whose fitness is determined by =\r\ntheir\nability to recognise using their own filter, and be recognised by acc=\r\nording\nto the filters of other birds, their own species via the songs they =\r\nsing.\nWhile this selection pressure is in place the songs remain simple.\nSe=\r\nlection pressure is completely removed part way through evolution and an\nin=\r\ncrease in song complexity is then observed.\n\nThe simulation seems a little =\r\ncontrived and simplistic, but I&#39;m not sure\nhow much this affects the interp=\r\nretation of the result. It perhaps provides\nan interesting example of how s=\r\ntrong selection pressure can constrain\nevolution to a &quot;corner&quot; of the searc=\r\nh space, in this case the corner of\nsimple songs: pressure to recognise, an=\r\nd be recognised by, other members of\nthe same species is best met by produc=\r\ning simple songs. Although in this\ncase evolution is producing individuals =\r\nthat are &quot;fit&quot; in the context of\nthe fitness function, it doesn&#39;t appear to=\r\n be getting stuck in local\noptima; the point isn&#39;t to improve the performan=\r\nce of the evolved\nindividuals according to some metric that doesn&#39;t influen=\r\nce evolution (=E0 la\nnovelty search).\n\nOne potentially significant aspect t=\r\nhat their simulation doesn&#39;t explain or\nattempt to model is that the domest=\r\nicated birds can learn more complex\nsongs than their wild counterparts (onl=\r\ny the filter for selecting songs to\nlearn from and recognising other member=\r\ns of the same species is genetically\nencoded).\n\nCheers,\nOliver\n\nT: 0421 972=\r\n 953 | E: oliver.coleman@... | W: http://ojcoleman.com\n\r\n--001a11c258f01bb77704f228b240\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi all,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I came across a paper which mig=\r\nht be relevant to novelty search and other methods to reduce or change sele=\r\nction pressure:=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/Papers/Ritchie/=\r\nSelection,%20domestication,%20and%20the%20emergence%20of%20learned%20commun=\r\nication.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/Papers/Ritchie/Selection,%20dom=\r\nestication,%20and%20the%20emergence%20of%20learned%20communication.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There&#39;s a kind of bird (a white-backed munia)=\r\n which has a fairly simple song, and a domesticated variant of it which has=\r\n apparently evolved over just a couple of hundred years (of domestication) =\r\nto produce much more complex songs.
