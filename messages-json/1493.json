Perhaps switching between\n&gt;different types of mutation could be beneficial, the search could spend\n&gt;time finding a local optimum in the current landscape, and then we\n&gt;change the landscape to search for wdier solutions, if we find one then\n&gt;switch back to searching for local solutions. This is a generalisation\n&gt;of course, you could have many different fitness landscape schemes to\n&gt;choose from. So just periodically cycling through different schemes\n&gt;might be better than any one scheme on it&#39;s own. One very rudamentary\n&gt;implementation of this idea would be to periodically take a champion\n&gt;genome from NEAT and to just perform weight mutation (no topology\n&gt;mutations), in order to find the optimal weights fro the current best\n&gt;toplogy.\n\nI think that&#39;s a really good insight.  However, there&#39;s a downside as well.\n\nOne of the things about higher-dimensional spaces is that our intuition \nabout them is really poor.\n\nIn this case, how much &quot;volume&quot; grows with increasing radius is very much \ndisproportionate to the 3D spaces we are used too (in fact, most people \nvisualize in 2D and even underestimate 3D volumes).\n\nThus, in a 3D space:\n\nradius * 2 implies volume * 8\n\nin a 100D space:\n\nradius * 2 implies volume * 1267650600228229401496703205376\n\nWhich brings me to the down-side of long-ranged mutations.  E.g. suppose in \none phase we use mutations equivalent to &quot;short&quot; steps across the space, in \nthe phase and there could be (say) 1 billion &quot;local&quot; genomes accessible \n(again, say) 10 are fitter than us.  Suppose that then we &quot;stall&quot; and \nswitch to another phase using mutations equivalent to &quot;long&quot; steps across \nthe space, now there are (yet again say) 1E50 genomes accessible and (yet \nanother figure off the top of my head) 100 are better then the current one.\n\n[[I base &quot;100&quot; on the idea that (i) an interesting problem might have 100 \ndifferent &quot;strategies&quot; meaning 100 different remote &quot;meta optima&quot;, and (ii) \nvery optimistically, I&#39;m supposing we can hit each of those meta optima at \nleast once with the &quot;long steps&quot;, and (iii) also very optimistically, I&#39;m \nsupposing that when we do hit a meta optimum, we hit it far enough up the \nslope that it looks better than the current solution]]\n\nSo basically what I&#39;m saying is that once a population gets &quot;locked in&quot; on \na particular &quot;strategy&quot;.  Any steps long enough to walk it out of the local \nmeta-optimum, unless the meta optimum is really low, has no chance of \nhitting a genome which will out perform the current population champion.\n\nOf course, this is where species come in, because a new species arising \nfrom a &quot;long step&quot; can compete amongst itself until it out-performs the \nprevious best species.  However we must consider the vastness of the space \nagain, that species might take along while to get out of the doldrums, and \nmay itself &quot;stall&quot; several times on the way to it&#39;s sun-lit uplands...\n\nOn this basis, do people agree that strategies which leave species alone \nfor absolutely as long as possible might be the way to go?\n\nWhat about the idea that speciation should be a matter of degree.  e.g. you \nreach it&#39;s own really good peaks, a &quot;species&quot; might itself need jolting out \nof lesser optima a few times, so the species taken in isolation might need \nto enter a different &quot;phase&quot;, but not such a drastic phase as to be made \nimmediately extinct in competition with the population winner...\n\ni.e. we may have species:\n\n1.1\n1.2\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n\netc and:\n\n1) individuals in 2.1 compete only with one another -- in every generation\n2) 2.1 enters a &quot;broad phase&quot; only when it stalls\n3) sub-species 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 compete with one another, but only on a \nlong time scale\n4) the whole of species 2 can enter a &quot;very broad phase&quot; only when all its \nsub-species are stalled\n5) species 1 and 2 compete with one another, but only on the longest time scale\n6) the whole population can enter a &quot;broadest phase&quot; only when the whole \nthing is stalled\n\nIf I were really implementing this, I would not stop at just two levels of \nspeciation.  I also would not use anything as rigid as an a.b.c type \nsystem.  I would probably just track the descent of individuals from common \nancestors.  Thus a set of brothers would form the smallest \n&quot;sub-sub-sub-...-sub-species&quot; and the whole thing would proceed \nhierarchically through cousins, uncles... up to some threshold where I \nwould call them &quot;unrelated&quot;.\n\nThoughts anybody...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
