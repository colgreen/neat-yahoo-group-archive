Sounds fair enough.\n\n&gt; Also the bias is always connected\n&gt; to the outputs.  So on average each network has the bias and one other\n&gt; input connected.  Any network with only the bias connected is forced\n&gt; to have one other connection connected.  So the initial population is\n&gt; minimal but diverse.\n\nOK\n \n&gt; Here&#39;s another thing Shimon suggested:  Instead of training one big\n&gt; OCR network, train a separate network for each letter.  And do the\n&gt; training separately, i.e. an &quot;is it a &#39;b&#39;?&quot; network and a separate &quot;is\n&gt; it an &#39;a&#39;?&quot; network.\n\nIntereting - it would cut down the size of the networks significantly - \neven fully connected networks would be feasable - even though I like the \nideas of starting minimally.\n\nHowever, this wouldn&#39;t work with my current demo, because it only inputs \none image of each letter. I&#39;d have to add alternative letters, either \ndamaged &quot;a&quot;:s or &quot;a&quot;:s from other fonts.\n\nInterestingly enough, it would be trivial to merge 26 such networks into \na single network that solves all letters at once - why you would want to \ndo that is unclear...\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
