Or do you set it very =\r\nhigh and just look to get a very low difference in the outputs of current a=\r\nnd last iteration (one calculation of the net, one step)?\n\nBut using one ou=\r\ntput for choosing the ID of the input the net wants to see is to less for 3=\r\n000 inputs, isn&#39;t it?\n\nOtherwise I need to use 0.0006666 as the step size t=\r\no differentiate if it is input x or x+1 or x-1 the net wants to see.
