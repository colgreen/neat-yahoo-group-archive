So \nactually it means, if you didn&#39;t add a node, then you have a 5% \nchance of adding a link.  Note the 3% and 5% numbers are only from \npole balancing and other values were used in other experiments.  \n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Philip Tucker&quot; &lt;ptucker@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Before getting to my question, a belated congratulations on your \nPhD!\n&gt;  A much deserved honor, I&#39;m sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m just getting around to making the changes for our \nimplementation\n&gt; of NEAT to do mutations more like yours; i.e., at most one \ntopological\n&gt; mutation can occur per individual per generation.  Here&#39;s my \nquestion:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;In smaller populations, the probability of adding a new node \nwas \n&gt; &gt; 0.03 and the probability of a new link mutation was 0.05. In the \n&gt; &gt; larger population, the probability of adding a new link was 0.3.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for the final question of whether you can add a link and a \nnode \n&gt; &gt; at the same time, in my system you can&#39;t.  However, it would \nhardly \n&gt; &gt; make a difference.  What makes a difference is adding big globs \nof \n&gt; &gt; structure all at once vs. adding just one or on a rare occasion \ntwo \n&gt; &gt; pieces.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given a population, we have 2 sets of mutated individuals.  3% get \na\n&gt; new node, 5% get a new connection.  How do you handle the \nintersection\n&gt; if no individuals can have both?  I can see 2 ways of doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) For those that would get 2 mutations, flip a coin and choose \none. \n&gt; This would mean that slightly fewer than 3% and 5% are actually\n&gt; getting the mutation.  \n&gt; 2) Ensure there is no intersection.  Take 8% of the population to \nbe\n&gt; mutated, then to 5/8 of those add a connection and to 3/8 add a \nnode.\n&gt;    This could get counterintuitive with larger mutation rates; \ne.g.,\n&gt; if we had a 60% rate for add node and 60% rate for add connection,\n&gt; we&#39;d actally wind up with 50% for both.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a fine point, and won&#39;t matter much if we always use very \nsmall\n&gt; mutation rates.  But I&#39;d like my imlementation to make sense even \nif\n&gt; we decide to have larger rates, and I want it to be as close to \nyours\n&gt; as possible for comparing results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Philip\n\n\n"}}
