If you know your opponent is suboptimal, it is\n&gt;always beneficial to know that they are suboptimal, and even moreso to\n&gt;know their particular weaknesses so that you can exploit them.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is an  important aspect to consider, especially going forward \nlooking at other more complex games. In fact it&#39;s absolutely crucial for \nsome (most?) types of game. At this point in time though I favour \nfactoring out this aspect of gameplay by assuming no knowledge of an \nopponent. Given this stipulation what is a perfect player?  A perfect \nplayer must assume that the opponent is strong, and therefore must play \ndefensively whilst trying to keep winning lines open as a secondary goal \nonly - and only making a winning move if the opportunity arises.\n\nEvaluating against defensive players will only give defensive players at \nbest - they won&#39;t know to make a winning line if the opportunity arises, \nexcept out of pure luck maybe. So a perfect player (with no opponent \nknowledge) is defensive but also knows how to win, thus a range of poor \nto good strategies need to be represented during evaluation.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
