One of the most important issue is the bat=\r\ntery energy, which\nwill be affected by the communication consumption in mos=\r\nt of the case. \nTherefore, we need to reduce the frequence for communicatio=\r\nn among\nsensor nodes as much as possible. \n\nSo &#39;you are running a separate =\r\nevolution population inside each sensor\nnode&#39; is the way that we WANT to ru=\r\nn our experiments. But problem is\nthat sensor node might not have much proc=\r\nessing ability as PC, we\nswitch to your second option &#39;all the sensor nodes=\r\n part of one large\npopulation&#39; but with each sensor node (they might measur=\r\ne different\nquantities) will have its own prediction system. \n\nI guess this=\r\n is one of the difference between project of sensor\nnetwork with those in y=\r\nour group, that in most of your projects one\npopulation will have one sole =\r\nsolution --- the best one among them ---\nand deploy this best solution into=\r\n robot, and therefore in a real\nproject, e.g. vedio game, there are many of=\r\n such population to support\nmany robots. Am I right?\n\nthe communication in =\r\nsensor network is local (so is the measurement\nand fitness of each sensor),=\r\n the result from each sensor will be a\nlocal solution. But the global solut=\r\nion will be given by all the\nsensor nodes in the newtork. We hope we can so=\r\nlve this &#39;global&#39;\nproblem in the future.\n\nsorry that I have misunderstood w=\r\nhat &#39;real-time&#39; means in rtNEAT. The\nreason why I concern about &#39;real-time&#39;=\r\n is because I want to find\nsolution that can be trained continuously with o=\r\nne or couple piece of\nmeasurement data (not a long history of data in offli=\r\nne case). \n\nJoe\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Joe, from your description I am not certain whether you ne=\r\ned \n&gt; the &quot;rt&quot; (real-time) part of rtNEAT.  Am I understanding right that \n=\r\n&gt; you are running a separate evolution population inside each sensor \n&gt; nod=\r\ne?  Or are all the sensor nodes part of one large population?  In \n&gt; the la=\r\ntter case, it is more likely that rtNEAT might help, but there \n&gt; are still=\r\n a lot of issues specific to the domain.  (For example, if \n&gt; communication=\r\n is only local than global variables cannot be \n&gt; guaranteed.)  \n&gt; \n&gt; My gu=\r\ness without a lot of background is that this will be a \n&gt; difficult domain =\r\nto fit into rtNEAT&#39;s framework.  However, I could \n&gt; be wrong as I don&#39;t kn=\r\now exactly what would be measured as fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;ghuaien&quot; &lt;ghuaien@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am currently =\r\nworking on the project of sensor network where I \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; like to use n=\r\neural network as forcast system in each sensor node.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like =\r\nto compare my result with that of rtNEAT (if rtNEAT \n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; meet our req=\r\nuirement in sensor system).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To my best knowledge, rtNEAT can do re=\r\nal time processing if the\n&gt; &gt; computational power is strong enough (because=\r\n of the population is\n&gt; &gt; generally large, e.g. 100 --- even though it is n=\r\not a large \n&gt; population\n&gt; &gt; in terms of statistics). But since sensor node=\r\n will only possess \n&gt; basic\n&gt; &gt; processing ability, I am not sure if rtNEAT=\r\n can be applied in such\n&gt; &gt; scenario or not .. AND, just to want to make it=\r\n clear: we are \n&gt; looking\n&gt; &gt; for the solution system which can do training=\r\n online and which \n&gt; will be\n&gt; &gt; deployed inside one sensor node (so that e=\r\nach sensor will have\n&gt; &gt; embedded rtNEAT model, e.g.).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (in my case=\r\n, I will deploy one neural network system with roughly \n&gt; 100\n&gt; &gt; number of=\r\n sypnaptic connections inside the sensor node, in order to\n&gt; &gt; keep the com=\r\nputation cost --- for training --- low)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can any one help me throug=\r\nh ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks alot\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
