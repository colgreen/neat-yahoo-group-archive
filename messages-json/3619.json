These 3 values are \nthen multipli=\r\ned by their importance factors and summed up to produce \nthe distance value=\r\n. If that distance value is less than the \ncompatibility threshold, then th=\r\ne genotypes are in the same species, \nelse they are in two separate species=\r\n.\nSo what you need to adjust is the importance factors and the \ncompatibili=\r\nty threshold. \nThere is no general rule on how to adjust the importance fac=\r\ntors, but \nnotice that if you set them all to 1.0, this basically means tha=\r\nt a \nweight difference of 1.0 is as important as one excess or one \ndisjoin=\r\nt gene. (I assume that the numbers of excess/disjoint genes \nare absolute, =\r\nthey are not divided by genome size). \nYou can also make the compatibility =\r\ntreshold dynamic, that is, choose \na target number of species and alter the=\r\n compatibility threshold each \ngeneration, if there are too many species, r=\r\naise it, or lower it if \nthere are too few. \n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;psyphiroth.nebu&quot; &lt;psyphiroth.nebu@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Check your =\r\nspeciation parameters and the importance factors for \n&gt; &gt; speciation. Somet=\r\nimes there are too many species, sometimes there \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; too few. The d=\r\nropoff age is important, too. The overall slow down \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; because the =\r\nnetworks grow in size and the simpler species reach \n&gt; their \n&gt; &gt; dropoff a=\r\nge and get killed of by NEAT. This is the explanation \nwhy \n&gt; &gt; the fitness=\r\n drops, too. You can have an absolute elitism where \nthe \n&gt; &gt; best species =\r\nnever get killed, no matter how old it is. It seems \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; a fitness =\r\nplateau is being reached and NEAT finds it difficult to \n&gt; &gt; optimize in a =\r\nhigh-dimentional space, the smaller species already \n&gt; &gt; being dead and the=\r\n more complex are left.\n&gt; &gt; A possible thing to try is to implement a pruni=\r\nng mechanism. The \n&gt; &gt; phased pruning techniqe by Colin Green (found in Sha=\r\nrpNEAT) is \nthe \n&gt; &gt; one I recommend. This will improve the speed as well a=\r\ns the \nquality \n&gt; &gt; of the overall search. With phased pruning, the lower d=\r\nimentional \n&gt; &gt; space is searched better. This helps finding the best start=\r\ning \n&gt; point \n&gt; &gt; for future generations. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Could you be kind enough=\r\n to explain how speciation parameters work \nin \n&gt; NEAT? What if I change th=\r\nese parameters? And should there be a \n&gt; general rule to determine the para=\r\nmeters, in what manner do they \nvary \n&gt; in different problems?\n&gt; Ken said t=\r\nhese paremeters are chosen by experimentation, but I \nthink \n&gt; there should=\r\n be a principle to select approximate values, I mean \n&gt; different problems =\r\nneed different parameter settings, so how would \na \n&gt; specific problem affe=\r\nct the parameters?\n&gt; I think my work is very similar to double-pole balanci=\r\nng, both need \n&gt; an output which varies in a certain range, though my outpu=\r\nt nodes \nare \n&gt; more. But when I used the parameter settings of the DPM, th=\r\ne \nfitness \n&gt; just went to an endless plateau.\n&gt; Well, I have to admit I ha=\r\nve so poor knowledge in NE, please don&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; tired of answering my quest=\r\nions.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
