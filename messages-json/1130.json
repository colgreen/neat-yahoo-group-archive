Let me give you an example:\n\nBefore I can evaluate my networks, I&#39;ve got to calculate the expected \nresults.  I do that once and only once, and then refer back to those \ncalculations for each network.  That saves me from doing it 999 times more \nthan I need to, which is good.\n\nMy inputs are converted from pixel values to a &#39;relative intensity&#39; in the \nrange of +/- 1.  So, naturally, I want the expected output to be in that \nsame range.  So, after I shrink the 144x144 to 9x9, I convert the 9x9 into \nthe +/-1 range, and use those same parameters to shrink the original inputs. \n  Then, I have to calculate the expected results, which requires taking the \naverage of every possible square area within the 144x144 region.  There are \n1,005,720 such regions.  Calculating those expected results was taking \naround 10 minutes...  I could have just settled for that.  But I didn&#39;t...\n\nI decided to keep things as integers until the last possible step.  Leave \nthe pixels as 16 bit unsigned integers.  To take the average, add them up \nand store the result in a 32 bit long.  Convert to a double when dividing by \nthe number of pixels that make up the area.  Then convert that average to \nthe +/-1 range.  WOW!  It did the same amount of work in about 10 seconds!  \nTalk about orders of magnitude!\n\nThe next thing to attack is the time it takes to generate the evaluation \ncode.  Generating code that evaluates 500 networks on a single sample takes \non average of about one minute for my laptop.  It takes less than 5 minutes \nto compile and execute that code.  So a savings there is significant, and \nthere is definitely inefficiencies in the process.  So next on my agenda is \nto speed up that process.  I&#39;m contemplating writing code which outputs code \nthat is specific to a topology, and then calling that generated code with a \nspecific network in order to output the optimized activation function.  \nThat&#39;ll be a debugging nightmare! But cool, in a morbid way...\n\nBut I&#39;m glad I&#39;m obsessive, I have saved myself boatloads of time in this \nexperiment!\n\n\n\n"}}
