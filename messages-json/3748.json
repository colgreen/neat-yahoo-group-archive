If\n&gt;  advertisements are hanging on the end of long strings of quoted text,\n&gt;  this may be causing problems for the spam filter.\n\nI noticed recently that when replying within googlemail the default\neditor is a HTML editor which maintains all of the yahoo adverts that\nget attacehd to each post. A couple of times recently I didn&#39;t notice\nthis and posted replies with pages of junk on the end because google\nmail attempts to collapse quoted text - and thus you don&#39;t always\nrealise now much there is.\n\nPersonally I prefer to click the &#39;Plain Text&gt;&gt;&#39; option when replying\nas it allows me to see exactly where all of the junk is and delete it\n- but then I&#39;ve always disliked HTML based editors :)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
