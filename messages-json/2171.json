Of course, there is no need to rush.\n\nHow does your version compare to the other 2 Java versions JNEAT and \nANJI?  Have you looked at those?  People may have a tough time \ndeciding what to use with 3 options in Java.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hi Ken\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for that.  The fog is now beginning to lift.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes I do intend on making my version of NEAT available.  It is \npart of\n&gt; a much larger AI library so I need to strip out any irrelevant code\n&gt; etc.  I&#39;ve just moved house, so it may take a few weeks.  I have no\n&gt; personal web page, would it be ok to host it on your site?\n&gt; \n&gt; My version of NEAT is in 2 parts.  The training and the \ntesting/using.\n&gt;  Both read in a csv file of data and process it accordingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone is interested in an early version of it, let me know and \nI&#39;l\n&gt; l send them the whole kit.  There is no docs with it currently, so \nI\n&gt; will put some rudimentary instructions in with any emails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Matt, fitness sharing is meant to penalize a species the \nlarger \n&gt; &gt; it gets.  Of course, species only tend to get very large if they \n&gt; &gt; have high fitness, which is what fitness sharing keeps in \ncheck.  If \n&gt; &gt; a species gets too large, it won&#39;t be able to keep expanding, \n&gt; &gt; thereby allowing other species a chance to explout their own \nniches.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But you are right that the correct fitness value to use for \n&gt; &gt; identifying the champion is the *raw* fitness.  Once fitness is \n&gt; &gt; adjusted, it&#39;s just an internal number used by NEAT to assign \n&gt; &gt; offspring.  It is no longer useful for knowing who was the \nobjective \n&gt; &gt; best.  So use unadjusted (raw) fitness for determining the \nchampion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It should be noted that there are equivalent formulas for \nfitness \n&gt; &gt; sharing that involve a slightly different process than I used in \nmy \n&gt; &gt; version of NEAT (and other version of NEAT may be based on how I \ndid \n&gt; &gt; it).  These alternative forumulations actually do exactly the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; thing, but they just involve a different set of steps.  You can \n&gt; &gt; refer to the question, &quot;Is there another way to do fitness \nsharing?&quot; \n&gt; &gt; in the NEAT FAQs on the NEAT Users Page at:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This question answers a slightly different question, but it \nnotes \n&gt; &gt; that the following formula is equivalent to adjusting fitnesses \nand \n&gt; &gt; doing what I did in my NEAT code, even though there is no \nadjustment \n&gt; &gt; step:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Offspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / \n&gt; &gt; Total_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss) * PopulationSize \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, do you plan to open your version of NEAT to the \npublic?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a quick intro to myself.  I have been &#39;playing&#39; around \nwith \n&gt; &gt; NN&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and GA for a few years now and came accross NEAT through Mat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Buckland&#39;s excellent book.  I have implemented my own version \n(as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I am good at) in Java.  Been reading the posts for \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; last few days and there is obviously a wealth of talent and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information out there, hopefully I can use it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am using NEAT to predict FTSE 100 movement and weather \n&gt; &gt; forecasting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I have tested my implementation with XOR and it works just \nfine. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously, the domain(s) that interest me are somewhat more \n&gt; &gt; complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My biggest confusion is about speciation.  I understand the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compatability metric, but what I haven&#39;t grasped is the role of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness sharing and its effect on a specie/population.  Ken&#39;s \npaper\n&gt; &gt; &gt; says that the fitness is reduced by the size of the specie.  \nIs \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meant to be a penalty to more populous species?  My fitness \n&gt; &gt; function\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently tends towards zero for more fit memebers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I save (to disc) the best from each genration it is \nimportant \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I save the correct best member.  i.e. the one with the best raw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness or the one with the best shared fitness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry if this is rambling, but I want to clear this in my own \nmind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt\n\n\n\n\n"}}
