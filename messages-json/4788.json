Not too =\r\nsuccessful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Go to Metatrader4.com and learn the meta trader language (=\r\npretty much c). It will allow you create scripts and backtest with historic=\r\nal data to see how they perform. If you write a DLL you can even call NEAT =\r\nvia Metatrader.\n&gt; \n&gt; I used to work for a company trading futures and I can=\r\n tell you all the easy data mining type trading strategies are tapped out. =\r\nYou&#39;ll have to find something interesting to make it work. Ideally some sor=\r\nt of leading indicator or something very strongly co-ordinated so you can d=\r\no pairs trading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sliding window would be my advise. But that is a pret=\r\nty inconsequential detail as you&#39;ll need much more than a sliding window to=\r\n make money in my experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tell me how you do and I can give you my=\r\n advice. Though take it with a grain of salt because I didn&#39;t make my billi=\r\nons through this :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shane\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;gururise&quot; &lt;gururise@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; Browsing the archives,=\r\n its obvious other&#39;s have worked on this problem using NEAT with varying de=\r\ngrees of success.  I&#39;m using the rtNeat C++ package under linux and am tryi=\r\nng to evolve a time-series predictor applicable to either the stock market =\r\nor forex markets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of the published research used Neural Netwo=\r\nrks trained via backprop.  These networks typically used a sliding window t=\r\nechnique. For example, if you have 1000 days of historical data, a sliding =\r\nwindow of 100 would feed the first 100 days of data as input, and the 101st=\r\n day would be the predicted output from the net. Then the window would slid=\r\ne by 1 day, and you feed the next 100 days and so on an so forth.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to use a similar technique with NEAT with very limited s=\r\nuccess.  For inputs, I use change in price and normalized volume.  The fitn=\r\ness function is basically the inverse of the mean squared error of the pred=\r\nicted outputs vs. the actual data.  The output is trying to predict the cha=\r\nnge in price at the next time period (it could be positive or negative).  I=\r\n&#39;ve also switched from the default sigmoid activation function to a bi-pola=\r\nr sigmoid activation that allows for outputs in the range of [-1,1].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; How are others using NEAT for time series prediction?  Are you using a s=\r\nliding window technique, or just have a large input with one output?  Has a=\r\nnyone had success using NEAT to evolve a time-series predictor?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
