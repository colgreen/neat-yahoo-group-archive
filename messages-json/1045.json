XOR is fully Perl based, and does a \ngeneration \n&gt; with a population size of 100 at a rate of about 5-6 per second.  \nFast \n&gt; enough to not bore me, anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve added more configurable items, and I&#39;ve tested it enough to \nmake sure \n&gt; it behaves as I expected it to.  And it does.  Problem is, it \ndoesn&#39;t solve \n&gt; XOR.  The best solution is structured as I would expect:  one \nhidden node.  \n&gt; The output node is connected to all input and bias and hidden, and \nthe \n&gt; hidden is connected to all input and bias.  00 returns 0.11, 01 \nand 10 \n&gt; return 0.99, but 11 returns 1.0!  ug...\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I am killing off the stagnant species too fast?  Or maybe I \nneed to \n&gt; use a non-linear penalty function...  have the penalty kick in as \nit nears \n&gt; the end.  I&#39;ll do some more experimenting.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the mean time, anybody have any tips for me?  Are \nthere &#39;issues&#39; \n&gt; surrounding XOR that I should know about?  Parameters that if \naren&#39;t set \n&gt; correctly render it impossible to find a solution?\n\n\n"}}
