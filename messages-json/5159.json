This is accomplished by rewarding individuals that =\r\ndisplay behaviors that are different from those seen prior in a search. \n\nI=\r\nn contrast, fitness-based search will generally reward individuals accordin=\r\ng to some fixed measure of progress. A significant benefit of novelty searc=\r\nh when compared to fitness search is that novelty search is not generally s=\r\nusceptible to the problem of &quot;deception&quot; where following the gradients of t=\r\nhe fitness function lead to dead-ends in the search space. Deception is the=\r\n reason that fitness functions must often be carefully crafted and tweaked =\r\nin order to solve difficult problems.\n\nInterestingly, sometimes exploring t=\r\nhe behavior space may lead novelty search to find the solution to a problem=\r\n, though it was not directly trying to. Counter-intuitively, it may consist=\r\nently be faster at finding the objective than an objective-based search in =\r\ndeceptive problems.\n\nSearching for behavioral novelty is different from an =\r\nexhaustive search of the genotype space for many reasons. As you wrote, man=\r\ny genotypes may map to the same behavior; novelty search may avoid many of =\r\nthese equivalent behaviors because once that area of behavior space has bee=\r\nn thoroughly explored, it will not reward individuals displaying those beha=\r\nviors, and will instead focus search on variations of genotypes that are de=\r\nmonstrating more novel behaviors.\n\nIn addition, the domain itself imposes l=\r\nimits on behaviors; for example, physics constrains our behaviors, we canno=\r\nt walk through solid objects. Further, demonstrating novelty may often requ=\r\nire learning about a domain. For example, to appear novel, a maze navigatio=\r\nnal robot may need to learn about walls and how to avoid them . In fact, th=\r\nis is what happens in the maze domain explored in the ALifeXI paper. So, no=\r\nvelty search may be in some sense about transferring information from the d=\r\nomain into genotypes.\n\nAn exciting aspect of novelty search is that the sea=\r\nrch is open-ended and can potentially continue endlessly finding novel beha=\r\nviors that may grow in complexity. While a fitness-based search may have li=\r\nttle to do after it has solved a particular problem, novelty search can con=\r\ntinue to find new behaviors even after it is has uncovered a solution.  \n\nI=\r\n hope that this addressed some of your questions.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I read the original art=\r\nicle and thread about novelty search and found it very interesting. It woul=\r\nd be interesting to hear if there are better insights about the idea now.\n&gt;=\r\n In particular I want to understand how is the novelty search better than a=\r\n systematic or a random search of the genotype space. A brute force search =\r\nof the genotype will certainly run on many occasions into the same phenotyp=\r\nes. The question is to what extent can novelty search avoid this and does i=\r\nt have other benefits?\n&gt; \n&gt; ps.\n&gt; I attended Ken&#39;s tutorial on developmenta=\r\nl systems on GECCO2008, and in my opinion, it was by far the best presentat=\r\nion I saw on that conference. That&#39;s how I got introduced to NEAT. Now I de=\r\ncided to take a look at it again and I am finding many interesting ideas.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
