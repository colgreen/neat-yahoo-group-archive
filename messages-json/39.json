In a non-recurrant\n&gt; network you can define it by the length of the\n&gt; shortest path from an input\n&gt; to neuron to whatever neuron you&#39;re classifying. \n\nYes, that&#39;s true.\n\n&gt; Basically what I&#39;m asking is when you\n&gt; add a new neuron, where\n&gt; do you put it? Does it go on the same line as the\n&gt; neuron being mutated or\n&gt; does it make a parallel line. \n\nI haven&#39;t thought it through all that explicitly, but\nmy first thought was that subnets, or modules, would\nonly work with particular numbers of inputs and\noutputs. \n\nFor example, a subnet like this:\n\n(X) (X)\n  &#92; /\n  (X)\n\ncould only replace a neuron with a minimum of one\nincoming connection and two outgoing connections, so\nit could replace (A) in the following network, but not\n(B):\n\n\n(O) (O) (O)\n  &#92; /    |\n  (A)   (B)\n    &#92;   /\n     &#92; /\n     (I)\n \nBasically, a subnet would be associated with a\nparticular number of incoming and outgoing connections\n(be they recurrent or forward), and could only mutate\nto replace a single neuron that also had that same\nnumber of incoming and outgoing connections.  Does\nthis make sense?\n\nI was thinking that by only replacing a single node,\nthis would mitigate the impact of the initial\nmutation, in line with the general philosophy of NEAT.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
