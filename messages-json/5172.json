If there are no bias values, and the hidden layer computes unsigned =\r\nsigmoids (i.e. sigmoids that range between 0 and 1), then every sigmoid in =\r\nthe hidden layer should output 0.5 (since they all have zero activation com=\r\ning on).  If that is not the case, then there is something else at play.\n\nT=\r\nhen you can check what the output nodes are generating from there.  For exa=\r\nmple, look at a single output node and the 81 or so inputs that go into it,=\r\n and compute for yourself the correct output based on the weights and the a=\r\nctivations going over them (which would all be 0.5).\n\nYou may then find out=\r\n why it is saturating.  Or you may find a bug.   But it can help to isolate=\r\n the problem.\n\nYou can also try manipulating the substrate weights by hand =\r\nto isolate the issue.  For example, you can set all of the hidden-layer-to-=\r\noutput weights to zero except those going into a single one of the output n=\r\nodes.  In that case, only that node should have a unique output value.  If =\r\nthat does not happen, then you may isolate what went wrong.\n\nken\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using a 3 la=\r\nyered sandwich substrate with biases, each layer 9x9 nodes, generated by a =\r\nCPPN with sigmoid outputs. The weights are computed in exactly the same fas=\r\nhion as in the checkers experiment,\n&gt; with a formula like: (w-0.2)/0.8 * 3.=\r\n0 for positive weights w &gt; 0.2 (etc) \n&gt; \n&gt; The output is all 1&#39;s, and the s=\r\nubstrate does indeed seem to have more positive weighted links than negativ=\r\ne ones. I am facing the same &#39;issue&#39; in later generations. \n&gt; \n&gt; The substr=\r\nate inputs are all between -1 and 1, but I do not normalize the 9x9 input m=\r\natrix. Might this be the issue. \n&gt; \n&gt; I changed the formulas to something l=\r\nike: (w-0.2)/0.8 * 0.01 and now I get values around 0.44 on all output node=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this &#39;issue&#39; suggest any misuse of (Hyper)NEAT to anyone?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thanks, \n&gt; Andrei\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
