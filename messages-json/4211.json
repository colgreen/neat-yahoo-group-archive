In fact \nrunning \n&gt; &gt; such an evolution, in the matter of c=\r\nomputational effort, that \nwould \n&gt; &gt; come as close as exhaustive search, b=\r\nut I think there is \nsomething \n&gt; &gt; beatuful in the way it is done. The CPP=\r\nN can be re-queried each N \n&gt; &gt; timesteps or when some criteria in the envi=\r\nronment is met. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You know, I actually changed my entire phylosophy=\r\n about EC since \nyour \n&gt; &gt; last paper about NS came out.

The only downside \nis \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all that querying will get expensive.  However, it&#39;s very \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\nteresting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it means that the learning rules themselves become =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; distributed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a pattern, and are &quot;made up&quot; by HyperNEAT rather =\r\nthan being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preselected by the experimenter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The CPPN mig=\r\nht also be able to output Hebbian parameters; \nalthough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is less =\r\ngroundbreaking, though it might work well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is an interesting idea to=\r\n see what if the phenotypes \nproduced \n&gt; &gt; by the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPNs change ove=\r\nr their lifetime. There are two approaches to \n&gt; &gt; this: the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN =\r\ncan output hebbian learning parameters to the \nconnections or \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; CPPN can be re-queried every time step, so the connections \nwill \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basically different every time, depending on the environment, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be input to the CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any ongoing=\r\n research into this? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
