Yes, sticky. Funny how stuff you implement turn out to have\nimplications far beyond what you realize. I was happy to find a method of\nguaranteeing &quot;no recursions&quot; which I could implement in two minutes...\n\nA static method (average or incremental like Ian mentions in the previous\nmail) is far easier to crossover than a dynamic method (based on node\nanalysis). With the static method, any two networks can be crossed and all\nconnections will be valid. With the dynamic method, each connection will\nbe suspect, this could lead to two networs being genetically &quot;incompatible&quot;;\n\nSay network A re-orders node 1 but network B keeps it in it&#39;s original order.\n\nOn crossing A and B, connections to and from 1 must potentially be deleted\nto avoid them being recurrent. While this is straight forward, though\ncostly, it could adversly effect evolvability.\n\nSo the questions are;\n1. How much evolvability is lost by using a static method?\n2. How many CPU cycles are lost by using the dynamic method?\n3. How much evolvability is lost by using the dynamic method?\n\nMy guess is that the static method, being so extremely cheap, makes it the\nbetter candidate when CPU time is limited. \n\nI&#39;d also guess that the dynamic method might come out on top if the number\nof generations instead are the limit (in effect, ignoring the cost of the\nalgorithm).\n\nThanks for listening ;)\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n&gt; You could have a sequence like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; starting topology:\n&gt; A[0.0] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; B[0.0] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; \n&gt; A[0.0] -&gt; D[0.5] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; A[0.0] -&gt; D[0.5] -&gt; E[0.75] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; A[0.0] -&gt; D[0.5] -&gt; E[0.75] -&gt; F[0.875] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; \n&gt; B[0.0] -&gt; G[0.5] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; B[0.0] -&gt; H[0.25] -&gt; G[0.5] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; B[0.0] -&gt; I[0.125] -&gt; H[0.25] -&gt; G[0.5] -&gt; C[1.0]\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think your scheme would allow any recurrent connections, but it\n&gt; would disallow several valid connections such as E[0.75] -&gt; G[0.5].\n\n\n\n"}}
