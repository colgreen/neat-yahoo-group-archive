It&#39;s good for the field too to get this kin=\r\nd of prominent exposure doing something with real-world relevance.  The com=\r\nbination of evolution and later policy-search RL also looks like a nice pra=\r\nctical idea with many future applications.\n\nThank you for the kind words!\n\n=\r\n&gt; One detail I&#39;m particularly interested in learning more about is the use =\r\nof this approach with SUPGs on a real robot.  I guess I&#39;ll have to wait for=\r\n the ECAL paper but I&#39;d love to learn more about that.  I know your group h=\r\nas done a lot of work already investigating the properties of SUPGs, and se=\r\neing how they work in a MAP-Elites map would be very interesting.\n\nAs I sai=\r\nd on Tuesday =93it works=94 but:\n- We have troubles to fill the map with SU=\r\nPG with some behavioural descriptors. Nevertheless, it works well with the =\r\n=93orientation=94 behaviour descriptor. We definitely need to understand wh=\r\ny it is that hard to combine SUPG and MAP-Elites (I expected this to be tri=\r\nvial).\n- We have some technical problems to sense the contact between the f=\r\neet and the ground with our real robot. We plan to buy a few sensors for th=\r\nis but it is expensive (7000 euros). For now, we are exciting the SUPG with=\r\n a clock instead of the contact sensor, but this makes it =93open-loop=94, =\r\nwhich is less interesting than a closed-loop controller.\n- Danesh Tarapore =\r\nwill give a short talk about this at the EPS workshop at Ecal and we have a=\r\nn arxiv report about this =93in preparation=94.\n\nBest regards,\n=97 Jean-Bap=\r\ntiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/\n\n\n"}}
