Colin did say it didn&#39;t work so well to make =\r\nit open-ended (which might mean something more like novelty search), but at=\r\n least our group has found novelty search is often better for these types o=\r\nf walking domains.  We basically always use it now for evolving walkers and=\r\n it seems to be create nicer gaits in general.  It does have to be set up w=\r\nith care, but my guess is that it would lead to nicer walkers.
