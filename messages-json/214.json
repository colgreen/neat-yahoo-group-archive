I would like to make my\nown suggestions, which I will try to do in a few days when I get back \nfrom my trip to California.  I&#39;ve been visiting UCLA and UCSD and I \ngave talks on NEAT in both places.  Anyway, one brief suggestion is \nto have a section or sections for NEAT-based systems that aren&#39;t \nnecessarily standard NEAT, as I know several people working on such \nsystems.  Although, I don&#39;t know if any are ready for release.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
