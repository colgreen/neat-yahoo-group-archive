When I \n&gt; watch \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; animaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it \nlooks \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; like it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be descr=\r\nibed as \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mexican \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wave travelling across the hidden nodes.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As the CPPNs complexify, so do the activity patterns \nexibited. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using regular NEAT for the problem of keeping the human=\r\noid \n&gt; model \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balanced, it has moslty erratic behaviour, and the lu=\r\ncky ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high fitness) usually find a way to trick th=\r\ne system and stay \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balanced position forever, without =\r\nmoving at all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But when HyperNEAT is used for this, it looks reall=\r\ny \n&gt; interesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and.. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; natural! The model is trying to bala=\r\nnce using its arms, and \nit \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moving.. It looks like a drunk g=\r\nuy, but you note the \n&gt; difference. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve arranged the nodes in a g=\r\neometric way.. Let me explain - \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; left \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and right arm&#39;s=\r\n outputs are separated in the left and right \nin \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrat=\r\ne space, and close to each other. So do the legs. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hidden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; nodes are in the center in a star/cirlular shape. I also \n&gt; included \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs (head velocity) in the center around 0.0, but with \n&gt; =\r\nsmaller \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pe=\r\nter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
