Until you actually implement code infrastructure to \nattempt \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nquantify such things as: a) exact genome duplication as measured \nby \n&gt; &gt; v=\r\nisitation of design points, not just genome structure, b) \n&gt; effective \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n genome duplication (i.e. so close to be effectivily a duplicate), \n&gt; and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; c) coverage of the design space, you will not uncover just how \n&gt; &gt; red=\r\nundant and limited coverage of the design space is for \nstandard \n&gt; &gt; NEAT =\r\nparams for a given population size and number of generations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am=\r\n a huge fan of the NEAT method.
