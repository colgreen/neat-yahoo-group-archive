However, in general, as long as you=\r\nr domain is deterministic and your fitness function is static, there is not=\r\nhing wrong with only updating the new genomes&#39; fitness values.   However, t=\r\nhere are many situations where you would want to reevaluate all genomes dur=\r\ning every generation.  This post: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/m=\r\nessage/4956 contains an example of one, basically you should reevaluate eve=\r\nryone if there is any chance that you will get a different fitness value by=\r\n doing so.\n&gt; \n&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rvonwah=\r\nlde&quot; &lt;rvonwahlde@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In Bucklands Windows NEAT, the fittest ge=\r\nnomes in each species are kept from the previous generation (elitism). Thes=\r\ne are not mutated.  Therefore, is it correct that there should be no reason=\r\n to update their fitness scores?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My NEAT application uses the neur=\r\nal nets in a simulation.  An unmutated neural net will return the same outp=\r\nut and therefore fitness each time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To save run time, I only updat=\r\ne newly mutated or crossovered genomes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
