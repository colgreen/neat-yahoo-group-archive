Genes\nexist to persist.  Junk DNA could essentially be parasitic (or at\nleast commensal), persisting only to serve itself.\n\nIt could also be that, as we&#39;ve been discussing on this list,\npopulations do better if their individuals have a &quot;toolbox&quot; of old\ngenes with which to experiment building new phenotypes, so that the\nsource of new traits isn&#39;t always novel mutations, but the\nexploitation of old traits that lay dormant in junk DNA.  But this\nexplanation requires a population-based view of selection, which I\ndon&#39;t think is very widely held.\n\nDerek\n\n\nOn Thu, 3 Jun 2004 09:49:40 -0700 (PDT), Jim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.\n&lt;jim_oflaherty_jr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek,\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought you might like this article at New Scientist:\n&gt; http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99995063\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is pretty relevant to the &quot;junk DNA&quot; discussion in biology.\n&gt; \n&gt; A relevant quote:\n&gt; &quot;He thinks it is pretty clear that these [DNA] sequences have no major role in growth and\n&gt; development. &quot;There has been a circular argument that if it&#39;s [DNA] conserved it has activity.&quot;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
