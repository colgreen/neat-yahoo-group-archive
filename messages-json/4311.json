You\n\nmake a good point- my statement=\r\n was too broad, in part because\n\n&quot;cellular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambigu=\r\nous term that can\n\npotentially refer to many types of systems.  \n\n\n\nJust to=\r\n clarify my statement, I was responding the line of discussion\n\nwith Peter =\r\nabout encodings that actually create distinct bodily shapes\n\nthat are self-=\r\ncontained and have clear structural boundaries (which\n\nreaction-diffusion s=\r\nystems tend not to produce; rather they produce\n\nwallpaper-like patterns). =\r\n Often when growth-based models are used to\n\ndefine actual bodies with dist=\r\ninct borders, they are studied in the\n\ncontext of blobs with a particular f=\r\nocus on how the blob knows when to\n\nstop growing so that a border shape can=\r\n be created.  That kind of\n\nsystems goes along with the &quot;skin&quot; issue that w=\r\ne were discussing.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the field is quite broad and there are =\r\nmany possible\n\ninteresting examples of such systems.  If I could revisit my=\r\n\n\nstatement, I would reword it such as to avoid implying any sweeping\n\ngene=\r\nralization.\n\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. com, Alexandre Devert &lt;marma=\r\nkoide@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Hello\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &quot;Along these lines, I have rarely see=\r\nn a cellular growth model\n\nproduce anything more than a blob or an amorphou=\r\ns shape without clear\n\nparts.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you consider reaction-diffusion sy=\r\nstems as a cellular growth\n\nmodel, then you might consider the following pu=\r\nblications :\n\n&gt; &quot;Interactive Evolution of Dynamical Systems, Karl Sims&quot;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Advanced Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture Synthesis, Allen R.\n\nSander=\r\nson et al.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Those patterns are a bit above the average blob and feat=\r\nures very\n\ncompact description.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Regards,\n\n&gt; Alexandre Devert\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n      \n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
