That is the two\nspecific \n&gt; symmetries:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) that the world retains the same nature as you translate the\nviewpoint around\n&gt; 2) that the world retains the same nature as you rotate the view\n&gt; \n&gt; \t(one could call these &quot;relativities&quot; &#39;cos they are just like the \n&gt; assumptions underpinning relativity...)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tThe egocentric eye does not have full exploitation of them,\nhowever, \n&gt; because for any situation that requires considering the situation at\ntwo \n&gt; points (or orientations) it is as badly off as the global viewpoint.\n What \n&gt; this means is, if a piece of learning requires the consideration of\nthe \n&gt; properties of more than one &quot;position&quot; -- for example a position#1\nwhere \n&gt; the prey could not see me, and a position#2, where I could eat the\nprey -- \n&gt; then the eye can move to one of the positions, and get free\n&quot;relative&quot; \n&gt; processing, but it has no way of performing any simultaneous\ncalculations \n&gt; at a second position, except by evolving its own understanding of\nthe \n&gt; symmetry the hard way.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n\nJust to be devil&#39;s advocate, are you sure it couldn&#39;t all just be done\nby a roving eye with memory?  Maybe you never really do make\nsimultaneous computations for this type of thing.  Maybe it&#39;s all\nsequential: look at the first perspective, remember it, then transform\nthe view and look at the second.  In memory, perhaps both views are\nstored in some kind of normalized reference frame so they can be\nthought of at once.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
