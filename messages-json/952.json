I&#39;ve actually been\ntalking with Phil Husbands off and on, and he seems like a really great\nguy. That school would be great if you want to lay off the CS because they\nhave one of the best evolutionary biology departments in the world.\n\n&gt; That&#39;s too bad.  That does sound like it might be a significant issue\n&gt; for me.  Do they not offer research assistantships, or work programs,\n&gt; or something similar?\n\nI can&#39;t say much about Birmingham (I&#39;m sure Kennon will chime in), but the\nusual process in the UK for international students is to apply for an ORS\n(Overseas Research Award) which covers the difference between UK and\ninternational tuition, and then from there apply for something like a\ndepartmental or school fellowship. Both University College London and\nSussex do it that way.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
