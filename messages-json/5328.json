I tried the library included in HyperNEA=\r\nT, but that wont compile because the tinystrdll.cpp file requires a tinystr=\r\n.h file that is not in the HyperNEAT archive. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;jgmath2000&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; NEAT supports being built a=\r\ns a DLL but it isn&#39;t necessary, in fact the existing build system builds NE=\r\nAT as a static library.  Are you using the cmake scripts to build HyperNEAT=\r\n? The manual has instructions on how to use cmake scripts to build HyperNEA=\r\nT and these scripts build NEAT and Tinyxmlplus to static libraries.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Note that I&#39;m using tinyxmlplus, which is a different library from tinyxm=\r\nl and adds support for creating .xml.gz files (compressed xml files), as we=\r\nll as a host of other changes.  I do not think that using the regular tinyx=\r\nml library will work with HyperNEAT.  The tinyxmlplus library is included i=\r\nn the HyperNEAT download.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jason G.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;erikcss&quot; &lt;erikcss@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am makin=\r\ng some progress here on my project. The examples for HyperNEAT are very goo=\r\nd and helpful. Some technical questions will follow once I get this whole t=\r\nhing to compile. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So far, I have been able to compile tinyxml =\r\nto a DLL. Apparently NEAT has to be compiled to a DLL as well, and that is =\r\nwhere I ran into a road block. When I attempt to compile NEAT, I get a numb=\r\ner of errors. They are all related to Tinyxml. Any advice on how to overcom=\r\ne this would be greatly appreciated.
