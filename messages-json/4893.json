This is largely because the HyperNEAT algorithm its=\r\nelf has evolved with each of the experiments and, as a result, there is a l=\r\not of duplicate code and the HyperNEAT algorithm is not general.  In the pa=\r\nst few months I&#39;ve managed to pull the HyperNEAT algorithm out of the exper=\r\niments and into the NEAT library.  I&#39;ve also made a host of changes to add =\r\nstructure to the code.  These changes will be in the next version that I ho=\r\npe to release within the next few weeks.\n\nWhat I haven&#39;t done is made an at=\r\ntempt to document.  I will try to add documentation in the code as well as =\r\na small writeup in the README file explaining what the different files in t=\r\nhe library do.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Andrei Rusu &lt;andrei.rusu@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I should have specified that I was talking exclusively  about th=\r\ne HyperNEAT 2.6 C++ implementation. I read some of the publications and the=\r\n ideas are conceptually clear, also read the website, but the implementatio=\r\nn is very confusing to me. Maybe it&#39;s because I am new to evolving CPPNs an=\r\nd also to NEAT. Anyway, I tried to get some insight out of the code in &quot;Hyp=\r\nerNEAT/Hypercube_NEAT/src/Experiments&quot;, but I find it hard to get a clear p=\r\nicture of how the library is supposed to be used correctly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe thi=\r\ns is because I am not an experienced NEAT user. Shoud I start with that? \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; Many thanks?\n&gt;     Andrei.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sat=\r\n, November 7, 2009 3:47:29 PM\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HyperNEAT Tutorial?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Andrei, which version of HyperNEAT are you interested in and w=\r\nhat references have you looked at so far?  We can potentially improve the d=\r\nocumentation based on your comments (and a tutorial is a good idea), but fi=\r\nrst I want to understand which &quot;comment-less examples&quot; you are referring to=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that several experiments with complete source code are availabl=\r\ne in two existing HyperNEAT releases of which I am aware.  These and a vari=\r\nety of publications from several groups are linked from the HyperNEAT Users=\r\n Page, which also provides a brief introduction:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex. cs.ucf.=\r\nedu/ hyperNEATpage/ HyperNEAT. html\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand you may have already =\r\nbeen through this site and its associated software and papers, but I wanted=\r\n to point it out in case you had not been aware of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to make=\r\n the algorithm as accessible as possible so your comments are appreciated.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@ ...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can anyone please recommend some HyperNEAT documentation, a tut=\r\norial, diagram, some clue, or anything that does not mean reverse engineeri=\r\nng the comment-less examples ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!
