Each \none is a pie slice coming out of the robot at a certain angle.  If \nthere is an object within that pie slice, the sensor registers it, \nwith a higher value for closer distance.  If there are multiple \nobjects in the same slice, the sensor adds up their values.  So for \nexample, if there are two enemies between 30 and 60 degrees from the \nrobot&#39;s heading, then the sensor representing the slice between 30 \nand 60 degrees will add up the values of the two objects and feed \nthat value to the network.  There may be several radars of this \ntype, for example, between 0 and 60, 60 and 120, and 120 and 180.  \n(Note that&#39;s just an example, not meant to be literally used).  The \nrobot knows where things are by seeing which sensor is lighting up, \nand thereby knowing within which angle range objects are located.  \nOf course, it is possible that several such sensors may light up at \nthe same time if there are multiple objects at different angles.\n\nLet me know if this helps.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hey ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; yeah i read you&#39;re paper and looked over it several more times. i \n&gt; guess what i don&#39;t understand is how exactly the camera&#39;s work. \nfor \n&gt; example, how are they coded to take in information and how does \nthe \n&gt; distance to the object only come down to one input into the neural \n&gt; network.\n&gt; \n&gt; timmy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Timmy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Did you read our paper &quot;Competitive Coevolution through \n&gt; Evolutionary \n&gt; &gt; Complexification?&quot;  I believe it describes the robot duel domain \nin \n&gt; &gt; detail.
