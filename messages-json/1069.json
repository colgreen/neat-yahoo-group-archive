I&#39;d\nlike to formalize it a little bit further here...\n\nWhat we have to do is distinguish between the spaces of the genotype\nand the phenotype, since they can be quite different in dimensionality\ndepending on the mapping between them.  Then, as long as we are clear\nabout which space we are talking about, there will be no ambiguity\nabout the meaning of a dimension.\n\nIn general, all of my arguments about the need to evolve variable\nlength genomes are about *genotypic* space.  Of course, with NEAT in\nits current form, this is a trivial statement, since the dimensions of\ngenotype and phenotype are the same.  However, in a future NEAT\nwherein the genotype goes through an indirect mapping to phenotype,\nthe dimensions of the genotype may be much fewer than the phenotype. \nNeverthelsss, all the arguments still apply: we still wish to minimize\nthe number of dimensions in the genome.  It&#39;s just that now they are\ngoing to be mapped to somethin different in the phenotype.\n\nWhat this analysis suggests, and what I ultimately believe is\nhappening in this field, is that there are two parallel yet\ncomplementary directions of research that should ultimately converge:\n1) The idea of complexification through starting minimally and\nprotection of innovation inside NEAT is a generic methodology for\nevolving in any genotypic space, and 2) an (extremely) clever indirect\nmapping would allow very compact representations.\n\n1 with 2 means efficient search plus efficient representation.  Thus\nthey go together very neatly.  You may think for a moment that 2\nprecludes 1, since perhaps if the mapping is sufficiently powerful the\nnumber of dimensions necessary in the genome will be so low that 1\nwill become irrelevant.  However, that is not likely to be the case. \nEven in indirect mappings we are likely to need many hundreds or\nthousands of genes, even though those genes may be reused.  Note human\nDNA, with 30,000 genes.  These 30,000 genes are reused in such amazing\nproportions that they somehow map to 100 trillion connections in the\nhuman brain.  Yet even with this brilliant reduction, 30,000 is still\na lot of dimensions, and still is unlikely to be optimized through\ndirect search in the genotype space of 30,000 dimensions.\n\nTherefore, I believe the field should head towards NEAT-style\nevolution of indiretly encoded genomes.  I don&#39;t know if you saw when\nI mentioned our paper, &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny,&quot; but it\nis a large review of this area that you may be interested in:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:alife03\n\nI agree that modularity is a big deal in evolution, and it should\ndefinitely be at the forefront of future researh.  However, sometimes\nthe way we think about modularity may be misleading since we are\ntempted to think as engineers whereas evolution is not like an\nengineer.  We have a short paper on this topic as well:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04ws\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \t(I&#39;ve been on holiday so I&#39;m a bit out of daye, this is from\nKenneth&#39;s \n&gt; long discussion of about a week ago)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tGreat analysis!  Just one small additional thought:  what do we\nmean by \n&gt; &quot;dimensions&quot; in the search space?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tExample, suppose we&#39;re doing some vision processing and by whatever\nmeans \n&gt; we arrive at a good solution.  Then we analyze the solution and we\ndiscover \n&gt; that, although it contains 1000 neurones, they are actually 10\ncopies(*) of \n&gt; the same 90-neurone structure (say an edge-detector) and a control\nnetwork \n&gt; linking them together(**).  That&#39;s not really anything like as\nlarge a \n&gt; solution-space as it looked before the analysis, for two reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt; (* or 10 &quot;iso-neural&quot; networks, e.g. not copies but functionally \n&gt; equivalent....)\n&gt; \n&gt; (** current systems are unlikely to produce this, see below)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The 10 copies of the edge detector are 10 copies of the same set\nof \n&gt; dimensions, and thus a sub-space with 10-fold less dimensions than\nit \n&gt; originally appeared\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The edge-detector and the control network are (arguably) not in\nthe same \n&gt; search-space -- they are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.  e.g. the modularity of the\nproblem \n&gt; only requires them to respect the same &quot;interface&quot; connections, if\ndoes not \n&gt; required the edge-detector internal works to be finely tuned to\nmatch the \n&gt; control network.  Or, to put it another way, any functional edge\ndetector \n&gt; would work with any functional control network.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tStronger examples of modularity producing orthogonality can easily\nbe \n&gt; dreamed up.  Consider the case of N sub-nets, each evolved to\nrecognize a \n&gt; different input class, and a control net which just checks for\nwhich \n&gt; sub-net is reporting the highest confidence.  There is no\ndependency(***) \n&gt; between the sub-nets.  (Their internal dependencies are (i) report\ntheir \n&gt; confidence on a connection to the control net, (ii) the input data\nformat.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (*** dependency is the opposite of orthogonality)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tHowever, one cannot expect a homogeneous evolution procedure to\njust \n&gt; happen to produce orthogonal modules.  You need a modular evolution\nsystem:\n&gt; \n&gt; \t(slowest) mutate modularity\n&gt; \t(medium) try topologies within each module\n&gt; \t(fastest) play with the weights in each module\n&gt; \n&gt; \t- as people have begun to tinker with.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan Badcoe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n"}}
