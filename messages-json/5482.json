Thanks for posting =\r\nit.\n\nI had a few thoughts that I think could improve future versions of you=\r\nr\nargument. I know you are interested in constantly optimizing these pitche=\r\ns,\nso here are my thoughts, whatever they are worth.\n1. synthetic solar pan=\r\nels are much more efficient than photosynthesis. so it\nseems odd to use tha=\r\nt as an example of something nature dominates us on.\nthere are so many exam=\r\nples where we don&#39;t compare at all to natural designs,\nthat you might raise=\r\n fewer red flags by going with an undebatable one.\n2. we know a lot about c=\r\nancer and I think we will solve it soon (~20-40\nyears). I would say that is=\r\n more like the moon mission. we could solve it in\nless than 20 years if we =\r\ndedicated an inordinate amount of resources to it.\nI think you do better to=\r\n pick things like levitation, time-travel, or\nsomething in between, because=\r\n in that case I cannot bring to mind the steps\nthat need to be taken to get=\r\n there, which is exactly your point. with\ncancer, many researchers will tel=\r\nl you that we do know a ton of things that\nneed to be done, and it is just =\r\na matter of doing them (and building the\ntechnology to allow them to scale)=\r\n.\n3. the mission to the moon wasn&#39;t one stepping stone away, but many. your=\r\n\nargument works, but should be &quot;a handful of stepping stones away&quot; vs. a\ndo=\r\nzens/hundreds of stepping stones away&quot;\n\nAll of those are very minor points,=\r\n however. Overall I like the pitch.\n\nHere is a question I got when telling =\r\nsomeone about your speech. They\npointed out that directed evolution works a=\r\nll the time in animal breeding\n(think chihuahuas and great danes vs. their =\r\nancestors). Experimental\nbiologists also often find that animals can be bre=\r\nd in all sorts of\ndirections. A prof at MSU who does that recently told a r=\r\noom of people that\n&quot;we can basically get the animals to vary on any dimensi=\r\non we focus on.&quot;\nThat seems to contradict the argument that goal-oriented s=\r\nelection will\nnever work. \n\nI can think of rebuttals to this argument (I in=\r\n fact gave them to the person\nwho raised the issue), but I would be interes=\r\nted to hear your take.\n\nPS. I can&#39;t believe you were so nice to the creatio=\r\nnist. I would have said\nsomething like &quot;People who deny the overwhelming an=\r\nd obvious evidence for\nevolution have not reviewed the evidence with a rati=\r\nonal, open mind. They\nhave simply come to the wrong conclusion, because the=\r\ny are intentionally\nmisleading themselves or because whoever controls their=\r\n access to\ninformation is misleading them.&quot;  That sounds less nice, but I d=\r\non&#39;t think\nwe should be so nice to people who are so willfully ignorant, or=\r\n the\nconverts of those who are.\n\n\nPPS. You made any progress on thinking up=\r\n an algorithmic way to quantify\ninterestingess?\n\n\n\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clun=\r\ne\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Laboratory\nCorn=\r\nell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\nFrom:  Ken &lt;kstan=\r\nley@...&gt;\nReply-To:  &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n\nDate:  Thu, 24 Feb 2011 23:57:31 +0000\nTo:  &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&gt;\nSubject:  [neat] Online Video of Keynote Talk on &quot;Searching=\r\n Without\nObjectives&quot;\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt; I was very fortunate last year=\r\n to have the opportunity to deliver a keynote\n&gt; talk to the SPLASH conferen=\r\nce about a number of issues of interest to NEAT\n&gt; Users, including novelty =\r\nsearch and Picbreeder (both of which run with NEAT),\n&gt; and I took that oppo=\r\nrtunity to try to connect these ideas to larger issues of\n&gt; innovation and =\r\nhuman discovery, and misconceptions that we tend to have about\n&gt; search in =\r\ngeneral.
