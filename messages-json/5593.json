(this does make it easier to visualise the expressed phenotype - bu=\r\nt that wasn&#39;t a reason). I test-drove my implementation and got quite far w=\r\nith Node Genes not really performing any value - but eventually I did need =\r\nthem and to assign them and Connections Genes innovation-ids I needed to ha=\r\nve some notion of equality.  I could have used a Node ID.   However there a=\r\nre some nice side effects of position - because I back my genotype up with =\r\na connectivity map (which amongst other things allows me to make structural=\r\n mutations without having to search for them) duplicate nodes can not exist=\r\n implicitly (the connectivity map is keyed on Node).  Also using the positi=\r\non for Node equality works well for distributed runs (no need for a master =\r\nsequence of IDs shared across the cluster) - although you still need one fo=\r\nr IIDs.  One downside is obviously extra information in the genotype - but =\r\nI haven&#39;t seen an issue with this so far - the system is quite efficient at=\r\n re-using Node Genes and the structural part of Connection Genes regardless=\r\n of the IID - so maybe there is a saving there.\n\ncheers\nPhill\n\n  \n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Phill, assigni=\r\nng an (x,y) coordinate to nodes is indeed unusual in NEAT.  However, my gue=\r\nss (without being 100% sure) is that it will not have an overall harmful ef=\r\nfect, so I don&#39;t believe it will cause a major problem with the algorithm. =\r\n However, my main question is what advantage you see for giving nodes an (x=\r\n,y) position?  I&#39;m not sure that it adds anything useful, in particular the=\r\n x component.  While I do see a role for the y position in identifying recu=\r\nrrence, I am not sure the purpose of x?\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I don&#39;t think the=\r\n issue of whether adding a new node to a previously disabled connection is =\r\ngoing to have major consequences regardless of exactly how such a situation=\r\n is handled.  If you just end up doing nothing in that case (and then perha=\r\nps trying a different mutation instead) the system should more or less func=\r\ntion without any major problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;Phill&quot; &lt;feelipg@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi guys - great group!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve sea=\r\nrched the group in case these questions have already been answered - apolog=\r\nies if I missed them!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have added my own implementation of NEAT t=\r\no my AL framework (I&#39;m a hobbyist) - like most people who implement their o=\r\nwn I&#39;ve done this so I can fully understand the algorithm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve re=\r\nad Ken&#39;s paper, stepped through the original code and also read the chapter=\r\n in AI Techniques for Game Programming along with other articles/blogs etc.=\r\n  My implementation seems to run pretty well - although I haven&#39;t compared =\r\nit&#39;s performance (in terms of efficiency at finding solutions) to any other=\r\n implementations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Although I treat both Node Genes and Connection =\r\nGenes as innovations for completeness - the system doesn&#39;t make use of the =\r\ninnovation IDs for nodes - as to me an innovation resulting from a new node=\r\n is the associated connection innovations created.  Something makes me thin=\r\nk this may be a mistake and I&#39;m missing something.  However a Connection is=\r\n defined by the two nodes it connects - and a Node is defined by it&#39;s posit=\r\nion in a 0-1 x 0-1 2d space.  This means that nodes are considered the same=\r\n if they occupy the same space (x,y) - there is no concept of a unique Node=\r\nID.  When a Node is created during a mutation it is given the X,Y position =\r\nhalf way between nodes defining the connection it is splitting.  It is poss=\r\nible that in the future I will add other attributes to Nodes which will be =\r\ntaken into account for Node equality too - but for now it is just X,Y.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; So I have two questions:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)  When a Connection is disabled an=\r\nd then re-enabled in the future from crossover - if this connection is subs=\r\nequently split again by a new node mutation - my implementation effectively=\r\n looses this mutation because the new node and connections have already bee=\r\nn added to the genotype in the original mutation.  So all that happens is t=\r\nhe connection is disabled - again.  Mat&#39;s book mentions this and implies th=\r\nat a new innovation should be created - which i guess means the network end=\r\ns up with an additional node?  I couldn&#39;t see where this explicitly happene=\r\nd in Ken&#39;s code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Is the approach of defining a node by its posi=\r\ntion flawed? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt; Phill\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
