I just finished readin=\r\ng it.  I like the idea of applying HyperNEAT to the individual\nmodules of a=\r\n multi-module robot.  Inputting the module location into the CPPN (which is=\r\n reminiscent of multiagent HyperNEAT) is a clever idea (which you call &quot;mod=\r\nular differentiation&quot;) for creating robust robots of this type and it looks=\r\n like your results came out well.  I was wondering if you plan to make avai=\r\nlable any videos of the modular robot from this experiment?  I&#39;m looking fo=\r\nrward to seeing your future work in this direction.\n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;evertwh2004&quot; &lt;evert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; We are very pleased to an=\r\nnounce our new  publication &quot;HyperNEAT for Locomotion Control in Modular Ro=\r\nbots,&quot; which will appear in the proceedings of the 9th International Confer=\r\nence on Evolvable Systems (ICES 2010). The manuscript is available here:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; http://www.few.vu.nl/~ehaasdi/papers/Modular-Locomotion.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; In this=\r\n paper we introduce the idea of modular differentiation with HyperNEAT: we =\r\nuse a HyperNEAT encoding to generate homogeneous (in the literal sense) but=\r\n varying neural network controllers for individual robot modules that are l=\r\ninked together into a larger `organism.&#39; These controllers allow the multi-=\r\nrobot to locomote purposefully and even somewhat reactively.\n&gt; This paper c=\r\nonstitutes a proof of concept and we hope to expand on this work to allow H=\r\nyperNEAT-based control in arbitrary and ultimately developing multi-robot o=\r\nrganisms.\n&gt; \n&gt; We would like to thank Jeff Clune for pointing HyperNEAT out=\r\n to us and everyone on this list  - Ken Stanley especially - for the fruitf=\r\nul discussions.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
