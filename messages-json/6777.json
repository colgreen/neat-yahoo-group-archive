various dimensions of variation. In these\ncanalized genomes, different genes have distinct, meaningful effects on the\noverall image, such that they directly determine the size, shape, color,\nand position of the various objects in the image. Take a look at these\nvideos to see what we mean:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5278ezwmoxSRZ_mD56FyNGDkId_AC4wL. We\nfurther show that canalization can result from the structural organization\nof these genomes, and that the structural organization of these genomes\npositively correlates with their fitness.\n\nThe paper is now up on arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05143.\n\nIn addition, the tool we created to examine these genomes is up on github:\nhttp://github.com/Evolving-AI-Lab/cppnx. We call the tool  CPPN-X, for CPPN\neXaminer. Feel free to download it and experiment with the genomes yourself!\n\nAbstract:\nNatural evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of functional\norganisms. Many believe an essential component of this process was the\nevolution of evolvability, whereby evolution speeds up its ability to\ninnovate by generating a more adaptive pool of offspring. One hypothesized\nmechanism for evolvability is developmental canalization, wherein certain\ndimensions of variation become more likely to be traversed and others are\nprevented from being explored (e.g. offspring tend to have similarly sized\nlegs, and mutations affect the length of both legs, not each leg\nindividually). While ubiquitous in nature, canalization almost never\nevolves in computational simulations of evolution. Not only does that\ndeprive us of in silico models in which to study the evolution of\nevolvability, but it also raises the question of which conditions give rise\nto this form of evolvability. Answering this question would shed light on\nwhy such evolvability emerged naturally and could accelerate engineering\nefforts to harness evolution to solve important engineering challenges. In\nthis paper we reveal a unique system in which canalization did emerge in\ncomputational evolution. We document that genomes entrench certain\ndimensions of variation that were frequently explored during their\nevolutionary history. The genetic representation of these organisms also\nevolved to be highly modular and hierarchical, and we show that these\norganizational properties correlate with increased fitness. Interestingly,\nthe type of computational evolutionary experiment that produced this\nevolvability was very different from traditional digital evolution in that\nthere was no objective, suggesting that open-ended, divergent evolutionary\nprocesses may be necessary for the evolution of evolvability.\n\nBest regards,\nJoost Huizinga\n\r\n--001a114d8e664c1721054d9ccb1e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is our pl=\r\neasure to announce the following new paper, by Joost Huizinga, Ken Stanley,=\r\n and Jeff Clune, in which we reveal how genomes evolved on Picbreeder.com h=\r\nave &quot;canalized&quot; various dimensions of variation.
