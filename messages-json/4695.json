I think you&#39;re probably right th=\r\nat trying to correlate node density to CPPN complexity is not the best appr=\r\noach.  On the other hand, making changes in node density correlated somewha=\r\nt with fitness seems potentially sensible.  But it still doesn&#39;t seem to an=\r\nswer the big question of where within the substrate to add the nodes?  Or w=\r\nould you just increase overall density uniformly?  My concern is that biolo=\r\ngical brains did not increase in density (which for them may just mean size=\r\n) uniformly.  That is, some parts of the brain got bigger while others did =\r\nnot.  That would seem to imply that a substrate should be able to add densi=\r\nty selectively to specific regions that evolution decides on itself.  Or pe=\r\nrhaps your idea incorporates that kind of regional growth somehow already?\n=\r\n\nAbout saturation of the sigmoid- that is indeed an important issue.  Right=\r\n now we are investigating some techniques to mitigate saturation, which I t=\r\nhink will end up being effective and also which will facilitate the kind of=\r\n massive substrate complexification that would be really cool to see in the=\r\n future.\n\nStill, we still do not have any elegant algorithm to evolve the s=\r\nubstrate, though I am confident it will be possible.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I was gone for a while, but before a day or so I had some spare time to=\r\n continue my research about automated substrate evolution. \n&gt; \n&gt; My latest =\r\nresearch so far ended up with a system capable of approximating any spatial=\r\n CPPN picture with a developing mesh based on the Growing Neural Gas algori=\r\nthm. While this worked well and could be used for evolving substrate config=\r\nurations right away, there was still a problem about deciding the right num=\r\nber of nodes for particular individuals. With GNG, it is more like a proble=\r\nm of deciding when to stop development or approximation of the CPPN picture=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; When we discussed the issue some time ago, I had the idea that CPPN=\r\n complexity can be directly linked to substrate density. More complex CPPN =\r\n=3D more dense substrate. This seems like a solution but it I think it is a=\r\nctually a bad idea. A CPPN containing many nodes and links does not always =\r\nproduce a complex pattern in space. It can be an entirely white or black pi=\r\ncture, due to genetic defects. Plus, it is not sure that the problem requir=\r\nes that many nodes to be solved - the CPPN may have enormous complexity but=\r\n producing a simple well-shaped picture that solves it. \n&gt; \n&gt; So what I thi=\r\nnk now is, that substrate density should be related to fitness instead. How=\r\n exactly? Well here is my idea. \n&gt; \n&gt; All individuals start with a minimal =\r\nnumber of nodes in the substrate, say 50. There will be a mutation increasi=\r\nng the number of nodes with about 0%-10% or decreasing with 0%-10%. The mut=\r\nation rate will vary across species. Species that are stagnating for too lo=\r\nng time will have the probability of this mutation increased - because they=\r\n may just lack the number of nodes to solve the problem. Or have too many n=\r\nodes. \n&gt; \n&gt; You know, there is a problem with having the number of nodes in=\r\ncreasing and this is the over saturation of the sigmoid. Increasing the den=\r\nsity with 2x will have very big impact if the weights are not altered, espe=\r\ncially in case recurrence is present. How can we cope with that? \n&gt; \n&gt; I do=\r\nn&#39;t have any experimental data yet, I am too busy programming some bullshit=\r\n but please tell me if this ideas make sense to you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
