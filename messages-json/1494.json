Modularity entails a trade off very like\n&gt; &gt;(5) in that the presence of modularity increases the size of the overall\n&gt; &gt;search space (adding choices about how to define modules) but hugely\n&gt; &gt;decreases the size of the parts that are considered at one time (e.g. each\n&gt; &gt;modules fitness landscape is much, much smaller than the overall fitness\n&gt; &gt;landscape.).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;In the mean time it&#39;s a good idea to investigate the limits of direct\n&gt;encoding techniques such as NEAT. With a great many experiments and all\n&gt;ideas exhausted research can them move on to modular or indirect\n&gt;approaches, using the best direct encoding technques as a benchmark.  I\n&gt;also think that NEAT could form the core of an indirect encoding\n&gt;technique in the future, finding sub-solutions that can then be\n&gt;recombined into larger solutions. I think I just walked into that trap\n&gt;of thinking in a &#39;divide and conquer&#39; / engineering manner again :)\n\nI&#39;m not sure that I agree.\n\nHmm, let me rephrase, I agree that NEAT is an exciting technique and well \nworthy of all the exploration we can get.\n\nBut..., I&#39;m not sure that the progression to modular systems is necessarily \na _consequence_ of sufficient non-modular research.\n\nMaybe this is the same doubt as you imply in your final sentence?\n\nI&#39;m also not sure I necessarily equate the &quot;indirect&quot; with &quot;modular&quot;.  I \nmean there is some quite solid thought suggesting that indirect encoding is \na major approach to modularity (e.g. in nature).  Or even, reversing the \nviewpoint, that by the time you&#39;ve added enough bells-and-whistles to \nsupport modularity, you will find the representations no longer very \ndirect.  But I think it&#39;s worth taking care to keep the concepts separate \nfor the moment...\n\n&gt;Anyway I have serious doubts about how well indirect techniques can work\n&gt;without much faster computers\n\nHmm, you are of course right, but I would also argue that CPU has made \ngreat strides in the last few years, and nobody has yet really plumbed the \ndepths of what&#39;s practical at our current level.  That and the fact that \nMoore&#39;s law catches up faster than one thinks, so there&#39;s no harm trying to \nhave a few &quot;impractical&quot; approaches ready for the year after next.\n\n&gt;  or at least enough money to buy computers\n&gt;fast enough. e.g. see\n&gt;http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2004Jul/bch20040730026275.htm\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyone got $3.5 million to spare? :)\n\nSure, I&#39;ll put it in the mail, oh, wait, sorry, I need to buy some socks.\n\nGrid computing _can_ get you that sort of CPU for free.  OK, not &quot;free&quot; you \nhave to work for it and you do have to hit exactly the right note on the PR \nfront.\n\nGrid computing also adapts most neatly (no pun intended) to an &quot;islands&quot; \napproach to subpopulations.  Which is another take on that whole \nspecies/sub-species discussion in my earlier post.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
