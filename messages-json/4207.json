In fact running \nsuch =\r\nan evolution, in the matter of computational effort, that would \ncome as cl=\r\nose as exhaustive search, but I think there is something \nbeatuful in the w=\r\nay it is done. The CPPN can be re-queried each N \ntimesteps or when some cr=\r\niteria in the environment is met. \n\nYou know, I actually changed my entire =\r\nphylosophy about EC since your \nlast paper about NS came out. I am about to=\r\n add dynamic re-quering to \nthe CPPN-&gt;HyperNEAT substrates, while being in =\r\nNovelty Search. \n\nI don&#39;t really have to say too much good words, but it is=\r\n obvious, NS \navoids all deception and it reaches solutions that FS has no =\r\nhope to \nreach. Great work, you people over there in the Eplex group! Cheer=\r\ns \nto Ken, David, Joel and Jason! I am not a PhD or anything like that, \nI =\r\nam just a bulgarian freelancer but I really admire what you have \ndone in t=\r\nhis area. \n\nPeter \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanle=\r\ny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, I think re-querying the CPPN over time is a great =\r\nidea.  \nWe&#39;ve\n&gt; talked about it in our research group but we don&#39;t have any=\r\n ongoing\n&gt; projects with it, and I don&#39;t know of any.  The only downside is=\r\n \nthat\n&gt; all that querying will get expensive.  However, it&#39;s very \ninteres=\r\nting\n&gt; because it means that the learning rules themselves become \ndistribu=\r\nted\n&gt; in a pattern, and are &quot;made up&quot; by HyperNEAT rather than being\n&gt; pres=\r\nelected by the experimenter.\n&gt; \n&gt; The CPPN might also be able to output Heb=\r\nbian parameters; although\n&gt; that is less groundbreaking, though it might wo=\r\nrk well.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pet=\r\nar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is an interesting ide=\r\na to see what if the phenotypes produced \nby the \n&gt; &gt; CPPNs change over the=\r\nir lifetime. There are two approaches to \nthis: the \n&gt; &gt; CPPN can output he=\r\nbbian learning parameters to the connections or \nthe \n&gt; &gt; CPPN can be re-qu=\r\neried every time step, so the connections will \nbe \n&gt; &gt; basically different=\r\n every time, depending on the environment, \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; will be input to the=\r\n CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; Is there any ongoing research into this? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
