I&#39;ve uploaded a sample to the files section \nof the group so you guys can see it.  This is the &#39;simplified&#39; one, with \nonly 147 nodes and their relationships.  The full data set has 63k \nnodes...there&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever be able to view that one!!!\n\n&gt;I&#39;m happy to answer any questions as well.\n\nDo you have a good SVG online reference that you use?  I like to be able to \nlook up all the attributes of a tag so I know what kinds of things I can do \nwith it.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs your PC infected?
