The proposed dialect \ndescribes genomes of the structure used by &#39;traditional&#39; NEAT. If other \ntypes of *genome* (as opposed to phenome) are to be used then an XML \ndialect will need to be described for each one - and that can then be \ncombined with the more generic parts of the XML such as search \nparameters along with an identifier that describes which type of genome \nstructure is being used in a particular XML file.\n\n&gt;-Support dynamic addition of domains tags (as proposed by Colin).\n&gt;\n&gt;  seems necessary and straight forward since people like you Derek\n&gt;are working with indirect encoding; I&#39;m not sure if supporting both type of\n&gt;encodings may generate some kind of conflicts in the standard (seems not to\n&gt;be a problem).\n&gt;The second is a little more delicate because I think domain specific tags\n&gt;may get out of control and make the standard useless.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI guess you can think of the dynamic tags as the providing some \nflexibility to the fixed &#39;standard&#39; XML. Long term it would be nice if - \nas with the genome structure - each type of domain and evaluation scheme \nhad it&#39;s own sub-dialect defined that could be inserted into the XML and \nbe identified by an ID.  However, whilst a structure is being \nexperimented with it&#39;s nice not to have it pegged to an XML dialect, \nsimply because it becomes one more thing to update whenever you want to \nchange things. So think of the dynamic tags as being there to support \nexperimentation.\n\n&gt;Right now I do not have more specific comments until I start using the\n&gt;proposed xml template (in about 15 days).\n&gt;\n&gt;So far I think it looks good.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks. All feedback is gratefuly received :) \n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
