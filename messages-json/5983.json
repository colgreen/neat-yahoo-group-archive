That way, in effect it learns a pattern of roles (which we =\r\ncalled the &quot;policy geometry&quot;) across the agents of the team.  \n\nIn this pap=\r\ner we highlight the benefits of this kind of multiagent learning by compari=\r\nng to a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach called multiagent=\r\n SARSA, yielding the first such comparison of its kind.  While multiagent S=\r\nARSA does well at training small teams, the larger the teams become, the le=\r\nss SARSA can succeed.  In contrast, multiagent HyperNEAT does something int=\r\neresting as team size increases:  It fundamentally reorganizes its team-wid=\r\ne strategies into more complex and effective divide-and-conquer strategies =\r\nthat take into account the holistic cooperation of the team.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
