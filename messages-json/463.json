I quote him here:\n&gt;\n&gt; ------begin quote-----\n&gt; One thing to keep in mind about robots and robot simulators is that\n&gt; their inputs and outputs are not necessarily in a format that is\n&gt; natural or useful to an NN.  In many cases, it is worth converting\n&gt; from the coordinate system of the robot to an alternative coordinate\n&gt; system that is better for an NN.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, we have found that having two outputs for two wheel\n&gt; powers is not the best format for a neural network to express\n&gt; movements.  Rather, the best seems to be a single outputs for\n&gt; forward/back, and another for left/right.  So like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; Output 1:\n&gt; -1            0                1\n&gt; Backward   Don&#39;t Move          Forward\n&gt;\n&gt; Output 2:\n&gt; -1            0                1\n&gt; Left          Forward          Right\n&gt;\n&gt; So the move is a combination of the 2: move forward or backward\n&gt; and turn the requested angle.\n&gt;\n&gt; This coordinate frame can easily be converted into the left\n&gt; motor/right motor frame, so the right signals can be given to the\n&gt; robot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, cartesian coordinates are not necessarily the best.\n&gt; (Although you should try them to see if they do work)  But an\n&gt; alernative is to set up several radar sensors surrounding the\n&gt; robot and let the radars light up if e.g. the ball is within\n&gt; their arc of sensitivity (the closer the higher the activation).\n&gt; This may be more natural for the NN than cartesian coordinates.  If\n&gt; the simulator gives you cartesian coordinates, they can easily be\n&gt; converted in the more natural radar sensor format.\n&gt;\n&gt; These suggestions are not guaranteed to work best, but my main point\n&gt; is that you should try a variety of sensor/motor configurations and\n&gt; not assume that just because the simulator offers a particular\n&gt; configuration that that is necessarily the best for the NN.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt; ------end quote------\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to hear your comments about this topic (if that in not much\nto\n&gt; ask ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot!\n&gt;\n&gt; German Viscuso\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 10:12 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps in the future we&#39;ll be able to see evolved monolithic\n&gt; controllers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for soccer players, have you tried this before?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In both the GECCO and the journal papers we try monolithic approaches\nand\n&gt; &gt; they fail abysmally.  These experiments were done on keepaway, an\n&gt; important\n&gt; &gt; subtask of robot soccer.  In a full soccer domain, I think a monolithic\n&gt; &gt; approach would do even worse.  Of course, NEAT might do much better than\n&gt; ESP\n&gt; &gt; but I think it would still have a lot of trouble learning a monolithic\n&gt; &gt; controller.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am optimistic that yet-to-be-developed learning algorithms will reduce\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; need for manual decomposition.  However, even humans, the best learning\n&gt; &gt; systems in the world, do not learn soccer by simply playing games\n&gt; &gt; repeatedly.  They do drills, practice basic skills, and decide on\n&gt; &gt; higher-level strategies in a fashion that is relatively independent of\nhow\n&gt; &gt; they carry out lower-level actions.  Hence, they benefit from the &quot;task\n&gt; &gt; decomposition&quot; that their coaches, based on domain expertise, know will\n&gt; help\n&gt; &gt; them learn.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it is an important goal to develop learning systems that do not\n&gt; &gt; require human designers to have a lot of domain expertise.  But I think\nit\n&gt; &gt; is even more important to find algorithms that can easily and reliably\n&gt; &gt; exploit the domain expertise that we *do* have.  No matter how difficult\na\n&gt; &gt; problem your algorithm can master from a tabula rasa approach, I think\nyou\n&gt; &gt; will always be able to go even further if you exploit human expertise\ntoo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Shimon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Nate Kohl&quot; &lt;nate@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 8:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My name is Shimon Whiteson.

All this work was done with ESP and not NEAT so\nobviously\n&gt; &gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relevance in somewhat limited.

I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hardware?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forward).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interest in this domain.
