I am not surprised you learned a lot with that tool. I think\nit would greatly facilitate an understanding how CPPNs accomplish certain\nthings. I also think it would help in talks to show the audience how the\ncomplexity, symmetry, repetition, etc. arises. In effect, this is the\nembryogenesis of CPPNs shown in slow motion...or experimental embryology, if\nyou like, since you could also see the effects of changing the CPPN\nmanually.  \n\nPlease do let us know if you ever get it back up and running!\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 25 Aug 2008 21:55:55 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Benchmarks for Artificial Embryogeny Systems\n&gt; \n&gt; We actually did at one time create an internal app that lets you do\n&gt; this with Picbreeder images.  We could click on a node in a CPPN and\n&gt; see the pattern generated at that internal node (which is like an\n&gt; intermediate stage of development).  It&#39;s very enlightening.  One\n&gt; thing it taught me is that a lot of the shapes are created through\n&gt; additions and subtractions, in addition to compositions.  But those\n&gt; additions and subtractions are very important.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately that app has not been further developed at this time and\n&gt; is no longer compatible with Picbreeder.  Perhaps we will get back to\n&gt; it so that it can be made available at some point.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m thinking that the benchmark result is less important than the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; comprehension of how the encoding built its results.  CPPNs have the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nice property that they are fairly straightforward.  You can look at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; each hidden node and look at the intermediate structure that it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, on the other hand, it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to explain, and therefore more\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to bias.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Have you done this Ken? Was it helpful to understand what was going on?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do you guys have a tool that makes this easy to do? I think it would\n&gt; be very\n&gt;&gt; instructive to be able to look at the contribution of hidden nodes and\n&gt;&gt; subgraphs of the CPPN network.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jeff\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
