(Of course, you might want to put the caveat \nthat\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t work *exactly* like NEAT.) ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; We look forward to anyone who uses the implementation and might \nwish\n&gt; to contribute to helping improve future versions.  At the very \nleast,\n&gt; we wouldn&#39;t mind using you guys as guinea pigs to just download it \nand\n&gt; give it a spin, then offer any feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
