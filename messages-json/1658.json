In other words, they \nhave temporal properties, so they can be used effectively for \npattern generation.\n\nUnfortunately, most papers that involve leaky integrator neurons \ndon&#39;t bother to give the equation!  One exception is this one:\n\nJesper Blynel , Dario Floreano.  (2002)  Levels of Dynamics and \nAdaptive Behavior in Evolutionary Neural Controllers.  Proceedings \nof the Seventh International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive \nBehavior on From Animals to Animats.  p.272-281.\n\n(I think that paper can be googled)\n\nTyler Streeter (who is on this list and works on the Verve biped \nwalking project) has managed to put leaky integrator neurons into \nNEAT, so it can be done.  I&#39;m checking with him right now whether \nthat code will be available.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
