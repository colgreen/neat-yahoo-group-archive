The &#39;pure&#39; approach is to leave them in, the\n[...]\n\n&gt; While I agree that there could be a performance boost for very large and\n&gt; sparse networks by eliminating links, I do not think the current code base\n&gt; gets any performance boost from &#39;missing&#39; links, because the links are still\n&gt; there and are just set to 0.\n\nIf I&#39;m remembering right, if the links are still there then there is\nno need to apply the +-0.2 cut-off. The only purpose of the cut-off is\nto restrict the number of connections in the resulting ANN that must\nbe simulated.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;However\n&gt;&gt; there may be better alternatives:\n[...]\n&gt;&gt; 3) Use HybrID to refine *all* of the weights over their full range,\n&gt;&gt; regardles of whether they were eliminated during the HyperNEAT phase.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understand you correctly, this is what we did in the paper.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;&gt; This then raises the question of how much HybrID&#39;s performance is down\n&gt;&gt; to this effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not understand what you mean by this comment. Can you expand it a bit?\n\nSure. Assuming you did use a cut-off of +-0.2 (or so) then I&#39;m\nsuggesting that this may be a disadvantage to HyperNeat because it\ncannot express connection weights in the +-0.2 range - because they\nget zeroed. If it is a significant disadvantage then perhaps some of\nthe advantage of HybrID is due to it&#39;s adjusting some of the\nconnections weights (zeroed or otherwise) into the +-0.2 range.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; Even more broadly, given the potentially huge resource cost of ANNs\n&gt;&gt; generated by CPPNs perhaps we should consider factoring that cost into\n&gt;&gt; the fitness functions. That way we allow evolution to find the sweet\n&gt;&gt; spot between good performance on the objective function and lousy\n&gt;&gt; resource utilisation (which slows down search speed and thus the power\n&gt;&gt; of the overall search method)\n&gt;\n&gt; That is a cool idea. It would be cool to see someone try it.\n\nIt&#39;s trivially simple to add a genome size punishment factor into the\nfitness function, just use something like:\n\n     fitness = fitness / (connectionCount + C)\n\nand maybe scale the fitness back up with some fixed multiple, so:\n\n  fitness = (fitness * A) / (connectionCount + C)\n\nI&#39;ve also used this approach to limit overfitting of target data, put\nsimply, smaller ANNs are less likely to specialize and overfit than\nlarger ones. I guess you could say it&#39;s a form of regularization.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
