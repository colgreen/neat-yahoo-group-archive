Since \nthe traditi=\r\nonal BP networks are constructed with clear layers. Now I&#39;m \npuzzled that i=\r\nt seems more complex for a abnormity topology structure \nnetwork to workout=\r\n the output of a input although it has less nodes and \nconnections.It takes=\r\n more memory and longer time. Although the networks \nwith layers have more =\r\n&quot;complex&quot; topology, them have regular algorithm \nand can workout a output m=\r\nore quickly with less memory. What benefit do \nthe abnormity topology struc=\r\nture networks bring to us? Only becaues \nthey are &quot;simpler&quot; only when we se=\r\ne them with our eyes?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
