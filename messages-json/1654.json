Semiann uses a\nsparse matrix to fill out the nodes,   connections, weight, biases and\nactivation functions for an ANN.\n\nThere are three basic concepts to Semiann:\nA) Graph\nB) Network Configuration\nC) Network\n\n\nThe graph defines the nodes (input, hidden and output) and their\nconnections.  The related XML structure may be both read and written.\n This set of classes are designed such that their instances are read\nonly to facilitate ease of use in multi-threaded environments.\n\nThe network configuration defines the attributes to decorate a related\ngraph.  An activation function and an optional bias value are\nassociated to a particular node.  A weight value is associated to a\nparticular connection.  The related XML structure may be both read and\nwritten, and internally must refer to the graph upon which it depends.\n This set of classes are designed such that their instances are read\nonly to facilitate ease of use in multi-threaded environments.\n\nThe network is a statically created highly optimized java instance\nmaximizing computational throughput by eliminating any &quot;optional&quot;\nand/or &quot;conditional&quot; instructions.  Internally, a factory looks at the\nnetwork configuration and is able to determine which network\nimplementation class is ideal (from a performance perspective) for the\nconfiguration.  This version does not currently implement XML\npersistence of the current activation state.  This set of classes are\ndesigned to be read/write.  As such, the instances are not\nmulti-threaded aware.\n\nPlease see the javadocs (Semiann/docs/index.html) to peruse the\nSemiann API in more depth.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
