In nature extinctions occur at a steady \nrate anyhow, and this is like our species getting old and dieing. A mass \nextinction event disrupts the balance that naturally exist between \nspecies and perturbs the whole system. This in turns creates new \nopportunities for lifeforms that previously were in some evolutionary \nniche. E.g. mammals are though to have evolved from a slug like \ncreature, but this creature probably didn&#39;t get an opportunity to \nmultiply and flourish until it&#39;s predators had been made extinct. So \nwhile new predators are evolving there is a bit of a window of opportunity.\n\nHmm, on the other hand there are no reltionships between our species, \ne.g. one species does not eat another allowing population levels to \nbalance out. So all we are left with is large gaps in the search space \nthat remaining species can spread or explore into. That *is* similar to \nour existing species culling technique, it&#39;s just a more \ndisruptive/dramatic form of culling.\n\nGetting back to the idea that a change in environment (I don&#39;t know, say \nmore acidic sea, less predators, etc) creates new areas for species to \nexplore, this is equivalent to us modifying the fitness landscape. This \nbrings me to a couple of ideas:\n\n1) Firstly my idea of fencing off areas of the search space where past \nspecies had explored and died of old age. This is one form of modifying \nthe fitness space. But this is a way of avoiding where you&#39;ve already \nbeen and doesn&#39;t fit in with the idea of extinction events to well.\n\n2) Changing the fitness function. We choose a function based on the \nproblem at hand, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a different \nfunction. But often we come up with different ways of evaluating netwoks \nfor a given problem and we often have discussions about what is the best \nfunction. What if we were to code up a few of theses different functions \nand allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This then could be \nsomething akin to an extinction event occuring in nature and changing \nthe fitness landscape.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
