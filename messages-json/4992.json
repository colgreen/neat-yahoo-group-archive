Ultimately I do no=\r\nt think it is essential that crossover operators are strictly one way or an=\r\nother because the general alignment provided by the historical markings is =\r\nthe most important part.  Some techniques try to keep the genomes short by =\r\ntaking into account which parent is most fit or most short when considering=\r\n disjoint genes, but I do not think it will make a big performance differen=\r\nt either way, though with some variants you might notice a bit more bloat o=\r\nver time than with others.\n\nIndeed crossover is usually applied only to ind=\r\nividuals in the same species.  My version of NEAT allows some inter-species=\r\n mating that is controlled with an inter-species mating rate, and others mi=\r\nght have something similar.  In general, you do not want too much mating be=\r\ntween different species because even if you know how to align the genomes, =\r\nthey are often going to be totally incompatible, like trying to mate a bird=\r\n with a pig and hoping for a flying pig.  Once genomes are sufficiently dif=\r\nferentiated, even the most parsimonious combination is likely nonfunctional=\r\n (e.g. because pig subsystems do not integrate with bird subsystems).\n\nOn t=\r\nhe other hand, at the fringes of species, i.e. when the genomes are differe=\r\nntiated but not too differentiated, combination can still work and be quite=\r\n interesting, like a lion mating with a tiger (which is possible in nature)=\r\n.   In versions of NEAT with a dynamic compatibility threshold (which means=\r\n the criteria for being considered in the same species gradually change ove=\r\nr generations), it is as if some species steal the offspring of other speci=\r\nes that are right in that borderland where they are not too differentiated.=\r\n  So that can lead to something similar to inter-species mating.\n\nken\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rvonwahlde&quot; &lt;rvonwahlde@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As best a=\r\ns I can determine, the Crossover operator in Buckland&#39;s Windows NEAT does n=\r\not function quite like that described in Stanley&#39;s &quot;Efficient Evolution of =\r\nNeural Networks through Complexification&quot; report.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I created two pare=\r\nnt genomes like those in Figure 3.3.  Buckland&#39;s code does not allow &quot;each =\r\ndisjoint and excess gene&quot; to be &quot;inherited from either parent randomly&quot; eve=\r\nn when they have equal fitnesses. For equal fitnesses it can only inherit t=\r\nhem from the shorter genome (Parent 1) otherwise it will inherit only from =\r\nthe fitter genome.  Thus one could never get the child pictured in Figure 3=\r\n.3.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone made a similar conclusion or have I perhaps coded Buckl=\r\nand&#39;s program incorrectly.  I am making a version of NEAT in Labview using =\r\nBuckland&#39;s code and conventions as a guide. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, why is the Crossove=\r\nr only applied to members within the same species?  Doesn&#39;t the speciation =\r\nprocess tend to group members with the same topology?  Would cross-species =\r\ncrossovers allow for new hybrids to arise?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
