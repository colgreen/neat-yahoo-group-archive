What I picture is patterned after the biological\nneuron, attempting to model the role of neurotransmitters in\nconnection growth.\n\nFirst, a quick summary of the model I have in mind:  The system would\nstart out with neurons that are placed in space relative to one\nanother.  There is a &#39;distance&#39; between each neuron and every other\nneuron, calculated based on the spatial distance.  But there are\ninitially no connections.\n\nSome neurons are connected to particular inputs, some to particular\noutputs.  Then the simulation is allowed to play out, and as inputs\ncome in, it starts stimulating the network.\n\nWhen a neuron fires, two things happen.  First, it releases\nneurotransmitters to all of its connected-to neighbors, just like a\nnormal network.  Then, it also prompts growth of new connections\nand/or strengthening of existing connections.  The strengthening is\nproportional to the neurotransmitter density at each neighbor,\nmodified by distance to that neighbor.\n\nThis means that if there are three neurons, A, B, and C, and both A\nand B fire at nearly the same time, then as A is growing dendrites, it\nwill be more likely to grow them in the direction of B than of C. \nLikewise B will grow them towards A.  Hence, a connection will\nultimately form between A and B.  If my understanding is correct, this\nis approximately what Hebbian learning is.\n\nAdditionally, each neuron will &#39;accumulate&#39; the received\nneurotransmitters, moving them from the surface to the center for use\nin its own firing, at a rate that is directly related to the density\nof neurotransmitters on the surface.  This gives the activation\npotential a &#39;half-life&#39; so to speak.  This gradual fall-off allows a\ntime-delay aspect so that temporally related firings do in fact\ninfluence one another without having to have complex methods of\ndetecting &#39;concurrence&#39; for the sake of the Hebbian learning.\n\nSo, my question to the group is:  Does this sound familiar?  If so, do\nyou have any links or keywords I can search on to read more about work\nalong these lines?\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
