The \ncompatibility threshold is given an initial (user chosen) value and if \nthe number of species goes outside of the min/max range then the \nthreshold is adjusted up/down as necessary in order to try and get the \nspecies between the limits. From memory I think Ken&#39;s code I think had a \nsingle target &#39;# of species&#39; parameter, I could be wrong. I do remember \nhe increased/decreased the compat. threshold in fixed increments, thus \nif the threshold was miles away from where it should be then it takes \nmany generations to adjust. I tried to address this by &#39;accelerating&#39; \nthe movement of the threshold value, unfortunately I think this \nsometimes causes the threshold to overshoot and oscillate around a bit, \nso some minor adjustments may be necessary to &#39;dampen&#39; the oscillations.\n\nClamp to me suggests a hard/fixed value, whereas the adjusting of the \ncompatibility threshold to achieve a target # of species is a softer, \nslightly indirect way effecting the # of species. E.g. Kind of what \nmight happen if the steering column in your car was made from rubber - \nthe wheels /sort/ /of/ point in the direction you&#39;re indicating. \nEventually :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
