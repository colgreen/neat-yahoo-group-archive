I found the steps that evolution \nwent through interesting enough to make a web page chronicling the \ndevelopment of the final form:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/rocket.html\n\nThere are a couple particularly interesting things about this.  One \nis that it is quite easy to see how important complexification is in \nintroducing new phenotypic features, and that&#39;s kind of cool.  \nAnother is the sometimes astounding meaningfulness of some of the \nfeatures that randomly appear.  But I think perhaps the most \ninteresting thing has to do with artificial embryogeny: You can see \na process of elaborating on a theme, much like what Joe Reisinger \nand I talked about in our short paper &quot;Exploiting Morphological \nConventions for Genetic Reuse&quot;:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04ws\n\nBut what&#39;s interesting in this case is that the &quot;encoding&quot; is \nnothing like any of the usual indirect encoding method usually \ndiscussed.  In fact the encoding *is* a NEAT neural network.  Yet, \ninterestingly, it has sufficient power as an encoding to show many \nof the properties that we desire in an effective encoding: Repeated \nparts, symmetry, and a great deal of variation on the same theme are \nall exhibited.  But what about &quot;reuse?&quot;  Reuse *does* occur in this \nencoding, but it&#39;s quite different than the usual kinds of reuse \ndiscussed with respect to indirect encodings, that is, the whole \nnetwork is reused at every pixel, and there is no fractal-like or \nembryo-like expansion process occurs.  Nevertheless, it exhibits \nmany of the same properties that result from such processes.  It&#39;s \nsomething to think about.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
