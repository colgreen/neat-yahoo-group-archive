Would you provide me a \nbri=\r\nef guideness on how to implement that myself and use it? \n\nSo what matters =\r\nthe most is the additions and subtractions of the \nvalues that get into the=\r\n hidden nodes? I assume you mean the &quot;output \n=3D function( sum(i1 * w1 + i=\r\n2 * w2 + ... + in * wn + bias) )&quot;. Then \nactually the weights of the connec=\r\ntions inputting into the node are \nreally more important than the preceeedi=\r\nng functions above it. Of \ncourse, if a weight is close to zero then it has=\r\n almost no influence \nto the node. In a stream of conciosness I am continui=\r\nng with some \nquestions. OK then when 2 or more links output to the same no=\r\nde, it \nis combining them or in other words, adding/subtracting them, right=\r\n. \nDid you see any difference with lower &quot;add-link&quot; mutation rates? \nWhere =\r\nmore nodes are being added with only one input and one output \nlink? \nI kno=\r\nw what the weights themselves mean, they are scalars of the \ncoordinate fra=\r\nmes. I am also aware of what happens when a function (a \ncoordinate frame) =\r\nis laid on top of another. But how do you explain \nthe situation where 2 or=\r\n more coordinate frames are being added \ntogether? Are we able to actually =\r\nanalyze that in a deterministic way \nwithout using evolution to see stuff? =\r\nSee, I know this is possible, \nbut I am looking for the easy and clean way,=\r\n you know.. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanl=\r\ney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; We actually did at one time create an internal app that =\r\nlets you do\n&gt; this with Picbreeder images.  We could click on a node in a C=\r\nPPN and\n&gt; see the pattern generated at that internal node (which is like an=\r\n\n&gt; intermediate stage of development).  It&#39;s very enlightening.  One\n&gt; thin=\r\ng it taught me is that a lot of the shapes are created through\n&gt; additions =\r\nand subtractions, in addition to compositions.  But those\n&gt; additions and s=\r\nubtractions are very important.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately that app has not been =\r\nfurther developed at this time \nand\n&gt; is no longer compatible with Picbreed=\r\ner.  Perhaps we will get back \nto\n&gt; it so that it can be made available at =\r\nsome point.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I&#39;m thinking that the benchmark result is less importa=\r\nnt \nthan the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comprehension of how the encoding built its results.  CP=\r\nPNs \nhave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nice property that they are fairly straightforward.  Yo=\r\nu can \nlook at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; each hidden node and look at the intermediate structur=\r\ne that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, on the other hand, i=\r\nt&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to explain, and \ntherefor=\r\ne more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to bias.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you done this Ken? Was it hel=\r\npful to understand what was \ngoing on?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you guys have a tool tha=\r\nt makes this easy to do? I think it \nwould\n&gt; be very\n&gt; &gt; instructive to be =\r\nable to look at the contribution of hidden \nnodes and\n&gt; &gt; subgraphs of the =\r\nCPPN network.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jeff\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
