And it&#39;s not necessarily the easiest thing in the world to \nread.\n\nAlso included is a line on the status of each of the client machines \nparticipating in the experiment.  Colin, if you update to the latest version \nof the client, your machine will show up there, too.  &lt;hint, hint&gt;  ;)\n\nTake a look.  Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement.  \nOther than the obvious, like a champion topology visualization, a sample \nenlargement using the champion network, and a more scientific evaluation of \nhow close the network is in its enlargement (signal to noise ratio and all \nthat stuff).\n\nIf it takes a while to load, it may be because my upstream bandwidth is kind \nof burdened at the moment.  Which is kind of a good thing...\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
