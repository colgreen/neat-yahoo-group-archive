I am not sure what you are referring to when you talk \nabout the Archives being open to the public?  Do you mean the \nYahoo!Group posting archives?  Or is there a documentation and/or files \narchive separate from this Yahoo!Groups forum which I am not recalling \noff the top of my head?\n\nIn other words, are you talking about taking this Yahoo!Group private \nand invitation only?  Or perhaps even shutting it down?  I am not clear \non what is being referenced in your original email as there were no \nlinks and I could not quite tell what was &quot;in&quot; the mentioned Archives to \ngain sufficient context to know what I was supposed to be evaluating.\n\n\nJim\n\n\nJohn Arrowwood wrote:\n\n&gt; One other possibility is that in December people went on vacation (so \n&gt; to speak), and nobody has really returned yet...  Thus, nobody has \n&gt; said anything to spark discussion.  I&#39;ve seen in the past where \n&gt; something happens (or doesn&#39;t happen) and that causes stagnation and \n&gt; quiet.  Then later, the noise level starts to rise again, but only \n&gt; when somebody actually starts talking about something that enough \n&gt; people are interested in.\n&gt;\n&gt; After all, I&#39;m guessing that people don&#39;t join inactive lists, so the \n&gt; fact that the list wasn&#39;t very active may be the real reason why the \n&gt; new people were so greatly reduced.  Here&#39;s an easy way to find out.  \n&gt; Leave the archives public for now.  But find a way to spark discussion \n&gt; that gets all the long-time members engaged.  Get the volume of \n&gt; messages back up THAT way, and keep it there for a while, and see if \n&gt; new user rate goes up.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- John\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2/22/06, *Kenneth Stanley* &lt;kstanley@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:kstanley@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hi Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt;     I&#39;ve spoken to Derek James (who runs this group) about this issue,\n&gt;     and he suggested I bring it up for discussion.  So please feel free\n&gt;     to share your thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I have come to the conclusion that opening the archives to public\n&gt;     viewing was probably not the best idea in retrospect.  There is one\n&gt;     good motivation for doing so, which is that it makes them\n&gt;     potentially searchable from outside engines.  However, on balance I\n&gt;     believe it is now apparent after we have run this experiment for a\n&gt;     couple months that this benefit is outweighed by the downsides:\n&gt;\n&gt;     In particular I think opening the archives has significantly\n&gt;     deterred non-members from joining the group.  The surface-level\n&gt;     effect of this deterrence is simply that the group grows less\n&gt;     quickly.  However, there is a more concerning secondary effect,\n&gt;     which is that when you do not join, you are less likely to post even\n&gt;     if you have something worth contributing, because it would require\n&gt;     joining to do so.  Therefore, the net effect is stagnant growth and\n&gt;     a general squelching of broader discussion and fresh new input from\n&gt;     outside.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I also believe there is a more subtle tertiary effect on existing\n&gt;     members, which is that now that you don&#39;t need to log into yahoo to\n&gt;     view the latest messages, you are more likely not to post something\n&gt;     that you think of offhand, because that would require logging in.\n&gt;     In the past, since you had to log in in order to view the archives,\n&gt;     you were already logged in once ideas popped into your head, but now\n&gt;     you are likely not logged in, and therefore it isn&#39;t worth going to\n&gt;     the trouble just to make a casual point.  I know that I have found\n&gt;     even myself falling into that kind of pattern and not posting since\n&gt;     I wasn&#39;t logged in.  Again, the net effect is muting discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt;     The statistics appear to back up this theory.  Of course, statistics\n&gt;     prove correlation and not causality, but the argument for causality\n&gt;     is strenghened by the precise alignment between the time that we\n&gt;     opened the archives and the time that membership growth and posting\n&gt;     suddenly plummeted.  Here are the numbers:\n&gt;\n&gt;     New Members by Month\n&gt;     --------------------\n&gt;     Oct: 11\n&gt;     Nov: 14\n&gt;     Dec: 5\n&gt;     Jan: 4\n&gt;     Feb: 3 (so far)\n&gt;\n&gt;     New Posts by Month\n&gt;     ------------------\n&gt;     Oct: 76\n&gt;     Nov: 77\n&gt;     Dec: 25\n&gt;     Jan: 38\n&gt;     Feb: 22 (so far)\n&gt;\n&gt;     Both statistics show a sudden and dramatic drop right at December,\n&gt;     right about when we opened the archives.  That seems to support the\n&gt;     idea that doing so had a negative effect on overall participation.\n&gt;     Of course there are other possible explanations such as the natural\n&gt;     ebb and flow of discourse or just a general downward trend as people\n&gt;     change interests, but the coincidental correlation in timing makes\n&gt;     it likely that even if those are true, they probably are not the\n&gt;     only contributing factors.\n&gt;\n&gt;     My view is that this group is first and foremost a discussion group,\n&gt;     and only secondarily a reference site.  It&#39;s nice to be able to\n&gt;     search for old discusison, but what we&#39;re really here for is to\n&gt;     interact with each other in the present.  Therefore, it doesn&#39;t make\n&gt;     sense to sacrifice the interactive quality for a slightly more\n&gt;     convenient reference, at least in my opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt;     So I am recommending we close the archives to the public again and\n&gt;     return to our old system.  However, since we have been genuinely a\n&gt;     thriving community for several years now (just look at most yahoo\n&gt;     groups and we are almost unmatched in consistent quality content and\n&gt;     friendly discussion), it is only right to let everyone have their\n&gt;     two cents before such a decision is made, so we can decide together\n&gt;     rather than make a unilateral decision.  Derek will ultimately\n&gt;     decide what to do based on your input.  If no one has input, it will\n&gt;     just be a decision between myself and Derek, which is fine, but this\n&gt;     is your opportunity to participate.\n&gt;\n&gt;     ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Yahoo!
