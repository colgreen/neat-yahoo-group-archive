Just think in term of series and the way we c=\r\nompute such series. Each term of the serie is the phenotype at a given stag=\r\ne.\n    - Environment awareness can bring informations to the development pr=\r\nocess such as the well performing genotypes are not &quot;fragile&quot; : they don&#39;t =\r\nbecame really bad after a small mutation. Think about it, it&#39;s rather a rar=\r\ne feature. Most genotypes express pure crap if slightly modified, *especial=\r\nly* when we are close to the optimum.\n\n* How I did that :\n  - Toy problem t=\r\no keep my point simple :  block stacking\n  - Same optimizer same settings f=\r\nor all experiments\n  - 5 representations, we look at the average optimality=\r\n and scalability of the solutions when increasing the problem size.\n\n\nCheer=\r\ns,\nAlex\n\n--- En date de=C2=A0: Dim 17.1.10, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; a =\r\n=C3=A9crit=C2=A0:\n\nDe: Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt;\nObjet: Re: Re : [neat] I=\r\ns environmental information helpful for developmental complexity?\n=C3=80: &quot;=\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nDate: Dimanche 17 Janvier 2010=\r\n, 1h43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Hello Alexandre -\n\n\n\n=\r\nThanks for sending this out.

It suggests that lung cells kn=\r\now to become\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; lung cells based on the air passing back and forth over=\r\n them. It is\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; intriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows=\r\n that sometimes\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; nature does not use geometric position (provided by =\r\ncomplex protein\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; patterning) to make differentiation decisions, but u=\r\nses environmental cues.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Of course, HyperNEAT could create the same e=\r\nnd product just with positional\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; information, but it might be easier =\r\nto accomplish this with simple\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; environmental- based tricks like this=\r\n one. Thoughts?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; New Scientist\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Breath of fresh air tra=\r\nnsforms stem cells\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 14:32 09 November 2009 by Andy Coghlan\n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; For similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Mimicking=\r\n the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough to\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; t=\r\nransform stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physical&quot;\n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; techniques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth fa=\r\nctors\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; alone aren&#39;t enough.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Lindsey Van Haute of the F=\r\nree University of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium and\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; colleagues spread hu=\r\nman embryonic stem cells onto a porous membrane. The\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; cells were fed =\r\nfrom beneath by nutrients and from above by a fluid that\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; encouraged =\r\nthem to multiply. Removing two chemicals from the growth fluid\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; kicks=\r\ntarted differentiation.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Four days later, the team removed th=\r\ne fluid covering the cells, leaving them\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; open to the air while still=\r\n being sustained and supported from below, as\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; they would be in the t=\r\nrachea. After 24 days the cells had developed surface\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; proteins that =\r\nidentified them as specific types of lung cell, including\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; alveolar c=\r\nells, which allow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; bact=\r\neria and dirt.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Physical influence\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &quot;Our study =\r\nproves differentiation into lung cells is influenced by physical\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; for=\r\nces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have been made to\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; diffe=\r\nrentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different growth factors,\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; but Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &quot;P=\r\nhysical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung lining to be\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; fully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London, who has =\r\nmade\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; alveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth factors alone=\r\n. &quot;But I find\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; it difficult to believe that raw stem cells would diff=\r\nerentiate through to\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; these uncommon types of cells solely in respons=\r\ne to physical forces.&quot;\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Haute&#39;s team plans to use the cells t=\r\nhey created to study lung diseases,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; such as cystic fibrosis. Such ce=\r\nlls might one day be used to treat people\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; with damaged lung tissue, =\r\nbut only if the cells can be made from a person&#39;s\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; own tissue.
