Because the number of offspring that a species will=\r\n produce collectively is proportional to its average fitness (which follows=\r\n from fitness sharing in NEAT), scaling fitness in different ways will caus=\r\ne offspring to be allocated to species in different proportions.  \n\nI don&#39;t=\r\n think there is a harm in exponential fitness if you want to emphasize the =\r\ncurve in certain ways.  The same motivations that apply in regulars EAs can=\r\n apply to NEAT.\n\nHowever, the place where fitness scales can hamper NEAT is=\r\n if they are proportionally too narrow.  For example,  if every species has=\r\n an average fitness between 1001 and 1005, then they will look practically =\r\nthe same to fitness sharing and will all get roughly the same number of off=\r\nspring.  In that case, speciation won&#39;t really distinguish much between bet=\r\nter and worse species.  However, if the average fitnesses were instead betw=\r\neen 1 and 5, then the allocations would vary a lot, with many more offsprin=\r\ng going to the 5 species than the 1 (because 5 is 5 times 1).  This example=\r\n shows that the range of fitnesses is not the only important consideration.=\r\n  It is also important how big the range is compared to the absolute magnit=\r\nude.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThanks for this answer Ken, and I apologize for the belated reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; If =\r\nyou don&#39;t mind, I would still like to try to determine whether it helps\n&gt; t=\r\no make fitness functions exponential.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if you had an evalu=\r\nation that produced a score, would the\n&gt; following two fitness functions be=\r\n equivalent?\n&gt; \n&gt; Fitness =3D 2^score\n&gt; Fitness =3D score\n&gt; \n&gt; Or would it =\r\nbe better to use the former? In many EAs (at least those with\n&gt; fitness pro=\r\nportional selection or something similar), people use the\n&gt; exponential ver=\r\nsion to magnify the difference in fitness and ensure that\n&gt; similar increas=\r\nes in fitness are always just as important, even as the base\n&gt; fitness incr=\r\neases. \n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that within a species, if truncation selection is use=\r\nd, it will not\n&gt; make a difference. How about at the higher level allocatio=\r\nn of how many\n&gt; organisms each species will get (i.e., between-species comp=\r\netition)?\n&gt; \n&gt; I know it is hard for you to give a general answer, since di=\r\nfferent NEAT\n&gt; implementations may differ in their selection schemes (at bo=\r\nth levels?), but\n&gt; how about for the original NEAT? I am also interested in=\r\n how things work in\n&gt; Jason&#39;s HyperNEAT code, if you happen to know the ans=\r\nwer to that.

Of course the code is a\n&gt; &gt; bit complicated and figurin=\r\ng out what it does is difficult to do quickly.  In\n&gt; &gt; particular here are =\r\ncorrections for b and c:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (b) Species are not killed off if their a=\r\nverage fitness falls below a certain\n&gt; &gt; level.  Rather, there is a rule th=\r\nat, if turned on, would kill off a species\n&gt; &gt; if its maximum fitness has n=\r\not improved in some number of generations.  That\n&gt; &gt; is a way to dump stagn=\r\nant species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (c) &quot;Stolen babies&quot; is almost never used in any exper=\r\niment that I have seen\n&gt; &gt; published or published myself, so it isn&#39;t reall=\r\ny an important mechanism.\n&gt; &gt; However, it is a way to increase greediness. =\r\n As Daniel rightly infers, it\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t steal actual genetic code from on=\r\ne species, but rather it steals the\n&gt; &gt; *right* to reproduce from the worse=\r\n species and redistributes that right to\n&gt; &gt; the better ones.  So sort of R=\r\nobin Hood in reverse (steal from the poor to\n&gt; &gt; help the rich).  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n In terms of &quot;weighting the number of offspring produced towards the strong=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; species,&quot; that is correct, but that is just a property of fitness sh=\r\naring,\n&gt; &gt; which NEAT uses. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, the most important select=\r\nion mechanism in NEAT is in fact fitness\n&gt; &gt; sharing, which makes it diffic=\r\nult for good species to take over the entire\n&gt; &gt; population because individ=\r\nuals must share the fitness of their species.  So as\n&gt; &gt; a species gets big=\r\nger, the fitness of everyone within it drops.  I would\n&gt; &gt; consider fitness=\r\n sharing essential to NEAT&#39;s &quot;identity.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, all fitness shar=\r\ning does is adjust the fitnesses of everyone in the\n&gt; &gt; population.  So aft=\r\ner that, there is still a need to decide how many\n&gt; &gt; offpspring individual=\r\ns get.  It is at this point that versions of NEAT may\n&gt; &gt; diverge and I do =\r\nnot have a strong opinion because I do not consider the\n&gt; &gt; choice essentia=\r\nl to NEAT&#39;s identity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my own implementations, first, offspring =\r\nnumbers are assigned on a\n&gt; &gt; per-species basis (proportionally to *adjuste=\r\nd* fitness after fitness sharing)\n&gt; &gt; and then they are assigned within to =\r\nspecies to individuals.  My version of\n&gt; &gt; NEAT usually uses truncation sel=\r\nection within species.  So it just cuts out\n&gt; &gt; the bottom n% of the specie=\r\ns from being eligible to reproduce and the rest get\n&gt; &gt; to reproduce.  (rtN=\r\nEAT is different of course since it only produces one at a\n&gt; &gt; time - it pr=\r\nobabilistic).  The remaining individuals are selected as parents\n&gt; &gt; random=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps most appealing for me about this approach is the idea =\r\nthat each\n&gt; &gt; species can be treated as its own little mini-population in w=\r\nhich whatever\n&gt; &gt; selection scheme you choose is implemented.  I think it m=\r\nakes conceptual sense\n&gt; &gt; to think of a species as a population because *wi=\r\nthin* a species one wants the\n&gt; &gt; same kind of healthy phenomena to happen =\r\nthat one wants in a regular GA with a\n&gt; &gt; full population.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of cour=\r\nse, you could alternatively choose roulette wheel selection within\n&gt; &gt; spec=\r\nies (after adjusting fitness for fitness sharing) or something else.  That\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; choice is not that important, and I have tried a number of schemes and =\r\nfound\n&gt; &gt; that, at least with NEAT, it makes limited difference which one i=\r\ns chosen.\n&gt; &gt; But the fitness sharing is still key.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So Jeff, there=\r\n is no simple to answer to &quot;what kind of selection scheme does\n&gt; &gt; NEAT use=\r\n&quot; because it is a multi-level scheme that first acts at the level of\n&gt; &gt; sp=\r\neciation and then at the level of individuals within species.  So no one\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; blanket terms really covers the whole thing.  To distill it to a short ph=\r\nrase,\n&gt; &gt; perhaps we could say it uses &quot;fitness sharing and any other schem=\r\ne after\n&gt; &gt; fitness-sharing.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m hel=\r\nping with the overhaul of JNeat.
