Unlike the other neurons, the input neurons are constantly firing, their signals don&#39;t reset to 0 after they fire.\n\nThis makes the connections to the input neurons useless, and also, the network is forced to be re-inundated with input signals during every step. I guess this is OK because if the network didn&#39;t want to keep getting signals, it could somehow trigger another recurrent neuron whose connection weights exactly cancels out ALL the input neuron&#39;s outgoing connection weights--but this is a complicated overhead to evolve. Whereas, if we treated input neurons like other neurons, to evolve the same constant-firing behavior, the network would only have to evolve a single recurrent neuron that the input neuron itself connects to. This recurrent neuron, created only if it is evolutionarily advantageous, will then constantly fire.\n\nA side question is that if I save a population in SharpNEAT as an XML file, is some information lost? Whenever I reload a population from file, it&#39;s not as fit as when it left off.\n\nThanks,\nRichard\n\r\n--0-1086265501-1165084241=:18233\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\r\n\r\nHey,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why it is that when NEAT (or maybe just sharpNEAT, what I&#39;m looking at) runs networks, the input neurons&#39; signals don&#39;t get changed even though there are connections to them?
