I&#39;ve read a significant number of published academic papers on the subject of using neural networks to forecast financial markets, and it appears to me that the majority of experiments produce results which are better than chance.\n&gt;\n\nI have to admit to not having read any papers on the subject for some \nyears. Largely on the basis that anyone with a profitable system will \nprobably keep the details to themselves and the institution/fund they \nwork for - or they may approach some fund managment company on finding a \ngood system, e.g. if it only works on a short term real time basis and \ntherefore needs expensive data feeds and other infrastructure to be useful.\n\nJust out of interest are there any papers in particular that you would \nsuggest reading?\n\n\n&gt;  I&#39;ve also read several news articles in recent past about these techniques being used by financial institutions, but the actual information on how they work is always missing.  Clearly there is a natural human instinct to defend information which is advantageous to survival, and I believe the evidence for this occuring here is intuitively obvious.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nIndeed.\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve been working on an application (a toolbox of sorts) which is capable of evolving trading strategies based on common technical indicators  with variable time frames through the use of basic genetic algorithms.  I am interested in creating component indicators based on simple neural networks and intend to utilize the ShaprNEAT code (btw, thank you to the author who ported this) to build these networks.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nOk perhaps you could explain in a bit more detail what you mean by \n&quot;component indicators based on simple neural networks&quot;? Do you mean \nevolving ANNs produce a technical indicator, the outputs of which can \nthen be used elsewhere? Sounds a bit like modular NEAT.\n\n\n&gt;Since you are already doing this I was wondering if you would be willing to share the code you&#39;ve developed so far.  You mentioned that you were lacking in market data to train your networks.  I&#39;ve developed a simple tool to import US market data from YAHOO finance if you are interested.  Compressed, the data is approximately 500 megs and contians the nasdaq, nyse, amex, nasdaq fund market, and some of the otcbb issues.  I have a tool to scan this data for logical anomalies and the data seems very clean. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYes I&#39;d be interested in some form of collaboration, about how far back \ndoes your collected data go? Also if you have a reasonably fast PC you \nshould be able to compress that data down to a more manageable size \nusing 7zip (www.7zip.org), although 500mb is fairly manageable in these \ndays of broadband.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
