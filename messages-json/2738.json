Another thing you need to deal with (and this is very\n&gt;tricky) is that there is an inherent bias the data set acquired by\n&gt;obtaining history: you don&#39;t have data on shares that are no longer\n&gt;traded, either because of takeover, privatisation or just plain going\n&gt;bust! So when you acquire a historical data set, you&#39;re only getting\n&gt;data for companies that have existed - largely unchanged - over the\n&gt;whole period. Don&#39;t forget share price changes due to stock splits,\n&gt;either (Mann Group, to my certain knowledge, have split 5 or 6 to 1\n&gt;this year).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI do have data for companies that have gone bust or have been bought so \nfar this year, but yes right now for my current experiment I only use \ncompanies that have data over the whole period that I have been logging \n(Jul &#39;05 to the present). As for stock splits and consolidations I \nactually adjust the share price in my database so that historic prices \nare rebased to the new share structure. I noticed that some trading \nwebsites that provide graphs do this to their data as well - whereas \nother just log the raw data and nothing more (e.g. ft.com I think).\n\n\n&gt;&gt;One problem I envisage with longer histories is that older data may be \n&gt;&gt;fairly useless in evolving a trading strategy for the present, since no \n&gt;&gt;doubt automated trading and semi-automatic analysis/trading has probably \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;been progressing in leaps and bounds in the last 5 years or so, thus \n&gt;&gt;fundamentally altering the short term dynamics of the markets. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe, but the bulk of the money in the markets tends to be from\n&gt;institutions such as pension fund managers, who have to find somewhere\n&gt;to invest for our retirement! Systems (IT ones) that manage\n&gt;investments are probably less likely to be effecting large changes in\n&gt;the market. The rise and rise of the hedge fund may be starting to\n&gt;have an impact, and the current environment where tidal waves of\n&gt;private equity are washing over the market must be having some\n&gt;different kind of impact as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAbsolutely, but these are all factors that are likely to make the market \ndynamics different to in the past. And yes a great deal of deal of money \nis managed by fund managers but I wonder how much of that trading occurs \nvia semi-automated systems. E.g. A fund manager decides to buy a block \nof shares but instead of instructing a team of traders to buy he \ninstructs an semi-automated trader who&#39;s job it is to trickle buy the \nshares in an optimal way. Thus the very short term dynamics are still \nbeing affected by algorithmic traders.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;So on the whole it&#39;s very interesting that NEAT has found a strategy \n&gt;&gt;that performs really well over the provided data set, but all this does \n&gt;&gt;for now is provide food for thought for the next round of experimentation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;That&#39;s the name of the game, though, isn&#39;t it!\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n\nYup. No clear signal from the extra 9 days worth of trading BTW (10 days \nminus a bank holiday). I also increased the threshold on my company \n(trading amount) filter so that I&#39;m testing 555 companies instead of \n521. Interestingly the champ ANN has not performed any additional trades \nat all on that data set and therefore scores exactly the same. This is \nsort of positive I suppose in that it didn&#39;t make any losses. Oh and one \nof those two losing trades is a suspended share that I couldn&#39;t have \ntraded at the time the signal was given (it signalled a short after a \nlarge fall).\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
