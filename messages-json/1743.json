That is, instead of feeding in the angles and cart position, I&#39;m \ngoing to use a &quot;video feed&quot; of the system. I say &quot;video feed&quot; in quotes because I&#39;m going to \nuse an inverted pendulum simulator to keep track of the physics and feed corresponding \nstill frames as input.\n\nOver email, Ken told me that some work they&#39;ve down with low-rez video. It seems that \nthe results don&#39;t generalize well. \n\nKen wrote: &quot;However, we noticed an interesting problem.  It is learning which pixel means \nwhat.  In other words, it is not learning an abstraction at all.  It&#39;s just learning off the \nspecific pixels.  That means you get really bad generalization performance if you test it on  \nstuff it hasn&#39;t seen before. &quot;\n\nKen - when you were running NEAT in the car domain, did you try to perturb the way the \nvideo was presented? While it would certainly increase the number of generations needed \nto get something acceptable, it might also make a solution that is able to generalize. That \nis, it might make a solution where there isn&#39;t a pixel-feature correspondance.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n-Reuben\n--------------\nReuben Grinberg\nreuben.grinberg@...\nTrumbull College, Yale University\nComputer Science, Class of &#39;05\n\nYale Social Robotics Lab - http://gundam.cs.yale.edu\n\n\n\n\n"}}
