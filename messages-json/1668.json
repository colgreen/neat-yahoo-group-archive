A collection function describes how \nthe input signals on a neuron are combined, e.g. traditionally we add \nthe inputs, but we could do other things such as multiply them. Input \nCollection Function seems like a good term to use, I wonder though if \nthere is an existing term I should be using?\n\nOnce the inputs have been combined we apply the activation function, and \nagain there are all kinds of functions we could use here.\n\nThe recent discussion on leaky integrator neurons got me thinking about \nwhere these would fit into this model. Although they could be described \nas an activation function I think it might be more useful to extend out \nneuron model to include a pre-activation function - and to apply the \nleaky-integrator funtion there.\n\nSo the complete model of a neuron would be:\n\n      &#92;  |  /       [Inputs]\n        &#92;|/\n[Input collection function]\n         |\n         |\n[Pre-activation function]\n         |\n         |\n[Activation function]\n         |\n   output signal\n\n\n\nSo that now the shape of the activation function is completely \nindependent of how we combine the inputs and whether we use a \nleaky-integrator function.\n\nSome obvious questions then are:\n\n1) What set of functions should we provide NEAT  with at each stage?\n[Collection Functions] - Some of these taken from an ealier post by Ian B.\n-----------------------\nAdd\nMultiply (can also perform division by using input&lt;1.0)\nLogical AND\nLogical OR\nVariance\nMin\nMax\nSum squares\n\n[Pre-activation functions]\n--------------------------\nLinear (do nothing).\nLeaky-integrator (probably with fixed parameters)\n\n[Activation functions]\n----------------------\nLinear\nInverse Linear\nSigmoid\nStep\n\nor instead of Inverse Linear, perhaps the inverse of each fn should be \nmade available instead?\n\n\n\nI&#39;d be interested in other people thoughts on this. Does the neuron \nmodel make sense? Are there other functions that should be in the above \nlists, or should I drop some of the functions?\n\nKeep in mind that you could (I think) ultimately drop all of the \nfunctions (except the sigmoid) and still be able to describe all of the \nfunctions using combinations of a standard neuron. The point is that I \nwant to try and take some of the pressure of finding solutions away from \nNEAT&#39;s topology searching, because certain functions are hard to \ndescribe (and therefore discover) using standard neurons - a simple case \nbeing multiplication.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
