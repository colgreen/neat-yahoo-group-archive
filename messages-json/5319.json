Coevolution can sometimes hide underlying bugs or issues t=\r\nhat are therefore difficult to rule out.  If you try an exhaustive approach=\r\n like Jason&#39;s, you can at least know that the system is otherwise functioni=\r\nng properly.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jgmath2000&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You might want to try to evolve a player without coevolution =\r\nfirst  to make sure that everything else is working.  In my HyperNEAT libra=\r\nry, I have a tic tac toe experiment where the evaluation plays against an &quot;=\r\neverything&quot; player.  Basically, whenever it is the everything player&#39;s turn=\r\n, that player creates a new game for every possible action.  In other words=\r\n, if the everything player moves first, he creates nine copies of the game =\r\nstate, one for each first move, and the hyperneat player plays all nine of =\r\nthese games (which then expand into more games, etc.)  This is tractable be=\r\ncause tic tac toe is such a small search space.  I like this approach becau=\r\nse it is easy to know when you have achieved a perfect player, since every =\r\npossible game state that could be reached given the individual&#39;s current po=\r\nlicy is presented.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tans=\r\ney@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anthony,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the kind words. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; There is at least one more tutorial coming. I have the HyperNEAT code \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; implemented, it&#39;s actually very simple. The problem is that even the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n HyperNEAT Tic-Tac-Toe player still sucks, and I was kind of implicitly \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; promising a near-optimal player next. It&#39;s funny how sometimes simple \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; domains turn out to be so difficult. If I don&#39;t come up with anything in =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; a few days, I&#39;ll write it up anyway.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be happy to hear sug=\r\ngestions from the group on better ways to \n&gt; &gt; coevolve a better player. I&#39;=\r\nve been toying around with dual populations \n&gt; &gt; where one is O and the oth=\r\ner is X, similar to the host-parasite setup I \n&gt; &gt; posted at the end of par=\r\nt 2, but no luck so far. The only other ideas I \n&gt; &gt; have left are to drast=\r\nically increase the population size or to add in \n&gt; &gt; an optimal opponent w=\r\nith random noise like Fogel did originally. I \n&gt; &gt; hesitate to do the latte=\r\nr though, as coevolution is generally a more \n&gt; &gt; elegant solution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anthony Ison wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks so =\r\nmuch for these tutorials Wesley.

Specifically, I show how to create a pa=\r\nrallel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two-player competitive coevolution evaluator and a hall of fam=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evaluator that you can wrap around other evaluators.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne resulting AI is still not very strong, but it is at least as good as\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; the part 1 player. The next tutorial will cover HyperNEAT and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (hope=\r\nfully) evolving an optimal player.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts, comments, and ques=\r\ntions are always welcome.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
