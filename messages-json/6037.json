The robot inputs will have two &#39;eye=\r\ns&#39;, that are represented as 32 x 32 retinas. The eyes see in two different =\r\ndirections, the right and left walls of the maze. It would have a sensor th=\r\nat is true when the robot is touching a forward facing, non-visible wall. T=\r\nhe &#39;colors&#39; the robot can see are red, green, and blue. Not all of the grad=\r\nations of these colors, each element is just one of these three colors, wit=\r\nh green being about 50% of the field. There would be four outputs: right, l=\r\neft, forward and backward. The walls would have symbols, maybe arrows, that=\r\n point to the way out of the maze. The arrows may be in different colors on=\r\n different walls, but always visible to a human with normal vision.\n\nThe ro=\r\nbots task would be to navigate out of the maze.\n\n1. How would I encode the =\r\n3 colors, -1, 0, +1 ?\n2. Would the c++ version be much faster or better tha=\r\nn the java version?\n\nAny other suggestions on how to encode and decode the =\r\nenvironment?\n\nRegards,\n\nRon\n\n\n\n"}}
