We could click on a node in a CPPN and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; see the pattern generated at that internal node (which is like an\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nintermediate stage of development).  It&#39;s very enlightening.  One\n&gt; &gt; thing=\r\n it taught me is that a lot of the shapes are created through\n&gt; &gt; additions=\r\n and subtractions, in addition to compositions.  But those\n&gt; &gt; additions an=\r\nd subtractions are very important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately that app has not =\r\nbeen further developed at this time and\n&gt; &gt; is no longer compatible with Pi=\r\ncbreeder.  Perhaps we will get back to\n&gt; &gt; it so that it can be made availa=\r\nble at some point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff =\r\nClune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So I&#39;m thinking that the benchmark resul=\r\nt is less important than the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; comprehension of how the encoding built =\r\nits results.  CPPNs have the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nice property that they are fairly strai=\r\nghtforward.  You can look at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; each hidden node and look at the interme=\r\ndiate structure that it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, on the=\r\n other hand, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to explain,=\r\n and\ntherefore more\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to bias.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you done this =\r\nKen? Was it helpful to understand what was\ngoing on?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you guys=\r\n have a tool that makes this easy to do? I think it would\n&gt; &gt; be very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ninstructive to be able to look at the contribution of hidden\nnodes and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n subgraphs of the CPPN network.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeff\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
