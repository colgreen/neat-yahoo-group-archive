If we don&#39;t need to re-use those regularities then\n&gt; the CPPN can evolve connections to the activation fn output(s) that\n&gt; are completely isolated from the connection weight (sub)network.\n\nYes. Reading Ken&#39;s email and thinking about it more convinced me that you\nand Ken are right. I do think there is something to be said that we are\nasking the CPPN to serve many different masters simultaneously, which may\nprevent it from being good at all of them, but I think the benefits of\nkeeping it baked into the CPPN here outweigh this (potential) cost. Plus,\nevolution tends to deal well with high levels of entanglement (pleiotropy\nand epistasis). \n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  Do you have any test problems in mind? Problems that require the use of many\n&gt;&gt;  different types of activation functions?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This goes back to a discussion ages ago about using neurons with\n&gt; different activation functions or neurons with multiple input\n&gt; connection points (collectors?) with each collector totalling its\n&gt; input and feeding a parameter into diffeerent activation functions.\n&gt; E.g. you might have a neuron with two collectors and the activation\n&gt; function might be to multiply the inputs from the two collectors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such a model would perhaps be a good generalisation of both\n&gt; traditional artificial neural nets and Genetic Programming. At some\n&gt; point I did have a think about where CPPNs fit in with that idea and I\n&gt; think using extra outputs from a CPPN to specify activation functions\n&gt; per node is part of the answer. Thinking about it some more now I can\n&gt; also see that in addition to an x,y target coordinate being output\n&gt; from a CPPN we could also have a collector index output as well. So\n&gt; x,y --&gt; x,y,c\n&gt; \n&gt; Really you need a flexible codebase to play about with all of these\n&gt; possibilities and the various combinations of systems, hence the\n&gt; earlier discussion about future SharpNEAT development.\n\nCool. I look forward to seeing what comes of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n\n"}}
