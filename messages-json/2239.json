That is the neuron at the top of the hier=\r\narchy.  If this is\n&gt; the &quot;elvis&quot; neuron, even when I say &quot;elvis&quot; you get a =\r\npicture of\n&gt; Elvis in your head.  This is the feedback from that one neuron=\r\n back\n&gt; to the outputs simulating the visual input IMO.  This feedback also=\r\n\n&gt; allows us to fill in missing pieces...i.e.- i show you a picture of\n&gt; ha=\r\nlf of elvis&#39; face, your brain fills in the rest.\n\nI remember that story, to=\r\no.\n\nThat is an oversimplification.  The memory isn&#39;t stored in that one\nneu=\r\nron.  But that neuron always gets activated whenever that one\nCONCEPT is ac=\r\ntivated, whether it be via a picture or a name or the\nsound of a voice or w=\r\nhatever.  That is because of the &#39;shape&#39; of the\nconcept.  What do I mean by=\r\n shape?  I mean in the generalized sense of\nthe word, meaning &#39;structure&#39; o=\r\nr how the N dimensions of a thing are\nconnected in the &#39;space&#39; of the world=\r\n in which it lives.  In the case\nof concepts in the brain, it may not be a =\r\n3-D space and it WILL NOT be\na 3 dimensional &#39;shape&#39;.  Part of the &#39;shape&#39; =\r\nwill be like the power\ndistribution you get when you look at a spectrum ana=\r\nlyzer of a sound. \nBecause of course, time is a factor.\n\n&gt; If a NEAT + Hawk=\r\nins approach works in something like visual\n&gt; recognition, this would be gr=\r\noundbreaking for sure.  Mainly because\n&gt; if it works there it should work i=\r\nn other seneory domains as well.\n\nAgain, NEAT just evolves topology.\n\nKen, =\r\nin your game where you embed NEAT in into characters, do you\nevolve the cha=\r\nracter over time as opposed to keeping it fixed for its\nlifetime?  If so, r=\r\noughly how have you done this?\n\n&gt; I also think it might be necessary to see=\r\nd NEAT with a somewhat more\n&gt; complex beginning structure here because I be=\r\nlieve a certain minimum\n&gt; of links/nodes both recurrent and otherwise will =\r\nbe necessary as a\n&gt; baseline...then let NEAT expand from there.\n\nYes and no=\r\n.  Part of the &#39;structure&#39; may exist in the &#39;real world&#39; in\nthe form of sen=\r\nses that provide feedback which are in fact impacted by\noutputs.  For examp=\r\nle, a robot that used an output to cause the wheel\nto turn, would also have=\r\n an input that is triggered when that wheel\nturns.  Thus, the &#39;brain&#39; learn=\r\ns to associate the input and the\noutput.  The feedback happens by means of =\r\nthe body, not the brain\nitself.  Brain-only feedback would evolve from ther=\r\ne.\n\n"}}
