If not, I&#39;m seriously \nconfused.\n\nThe NEAT FAQ question you refer to says:\n\n&quot;Each node adds up the activation from all incoming nodes from the \nprevious timestep.&quot;\n\nBut you just said: &quot;...you don&#39;t need to keep activation in memory \nfrom the previous timestep.&quot;\n\nHow are these two statements compatible?\n\n&gt; It sounds like what Derek and Philip are doing is trying to send\n&gt; activation all the way through the network by traversing the \nnetwork\n&gt; on each activation.  \n\nTo be honest, I need to check with Philip about exactly how we are \nhandling recurrent activation.  I could be misstating how we have it \nworking.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
