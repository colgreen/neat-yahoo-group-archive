It&#39;s very existence is\n&gt; its own nemesis. So if you reward for innovation, what is there to\n&gt; prevent the innovative streak, or the behaviour that was innovated, from\n&gt; being mutated away in future generations. As once the reward has been\n&gt; given for innovation, that behaviour ceases to earn a reward?\n\nRob,\n\nThink of genomes as colonising new regions of the behaviour space. One\nyou find some new novel behaviour you really want to put a stake in\nteh ground and leave some genomes there spawning offspring that will\nmove on to new behaviours. Just like in natural evolution where simple\norganisms evolve to more complex ones, but a great many of the simple\norganisms/strategies/behaviours are still valid because they don&#39;t\ncompete with the complex ones. E.g. mammals and bacteria co-exist\nquite happily in the same world, and yet they are our ancient\nancestors in evolutiomary terms.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
