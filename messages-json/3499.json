The technology behind Picbreeder is a novel N=\r\nEAT-based Genetic\n&gt; Art applet that is integrated into a massive growing &quot;t=\r\nree of life&quot;\n&gt; that never ends. Anyone who evolves a picture they like can =\r\npublish\n&gt; it to the world and thereby permanently add their creations to th=\r\ne\n&gt; ever-expanding tree of life.\n&gt; \n&gt; What makes Picbreeder particularly po=\r\nwerful and unique is that you\n&gt; can *branch* from the published work of any=\r\n other user that has come\n&gt; before.  In other words, you do not have to beg=\r\nin from scratch.\n&gt; Instead, for example, if you want to a evolve a face, yo=\r\nu can branch\n&gt; from one of the many published faces and explore an infinite=\r\n number\n&gt; of variations from that starting point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps most intrigu=\r\ning is that we do not know what is possible to\n&gt; evolve.  As lineages are b=\r\nuilt upon lineages, complexification in\n&gt; NEAT means that images can theore=\r\ntically become more and more\n&gt; complex.  Thus, in theory, anything is possi=\r\nble.  In this sense\n&gt; Picbreeder&#39;s users are pioneers, exploring collective=\r\nly a space that\n&gt; has never been exhaustively explored and discovering toge=\r\nther\n&gt; creations that no one of us could have discovered alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope=\r\n that you will decide to join us on Picbreeder as we explore\n&gt; this space.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
