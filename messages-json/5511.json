We were hoping=\r\n to provoke just such discussion with this paper and your questions highlig=\r\nht important issues.  Let me try to respond below...\n\n&gt; -----Original Messa=\r\nge-----\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley [mailto:kstanley@...]\n&gt; Sent: Satu=\r\nrday, April 02, 2011 2:57 AM\n&gt; To: &#39;Kenneth Stanley&#39;\n&gt; Subject: todelete2\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; First off, I&#39;ll say that what I take as the central point, th=\r\nat EAs can\n&gt; miss\n&gt; critical intermediate  objectives because they are awkw=\r\nardly placed on the\n&gt; fitness landscape, is a good one.  However, I have so=\r\nme concerns about the\n&gt; experimental design in this paper:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) You app=\r\near to be manipulating two variables at once.  (a) whether the\n&gt; EA\n&gt; has a=\r\nn objective and (b) whether there is a human in the loop.  Surely you\n&gt; hav=\r\ne to pick only one at a time and control for everything else, right?\n&gt; \n\nIt=\r\n&#39;s only a problem if you believe that somehow a human would do better at ev=\r\nolving to these objectives, which of course humans would not.  Good luck to=\r\n anyone who wants to re-evolve the skull from scratch again.  It will never=\r\n happen.  Nor will anyone evolve any reasonably complex *preconceived* pict=\r\nure from scratch no matter where it came from, whether once evolved in the =\r\npast or not.\n\nOn the other hand if you want to see non-objective search wit=\r\nhout a human in the loop, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing with novelty search,=\r\n so there is plenty of literature on that combination at this point.  You c=\r\nan find a lot here:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/noveltysearch/userspage/\n\nLet =\r\nme suggest to you or anyone who remains a skeptic (which is perfectly reaso=\r\nnable) to check out my talk on the topic (recorded in video), which lays ou=\r\nt the ideas much more broadly.  It&#39;s only 70 minutes and I think you will f=\r\nind it worth the time to see how I try to defend this counter-intuitive pos=\r\nition, if nothing else to stimulate some thinking even if you still feel sk=\r\neptical:\n\nhttp://www.infoq.com/presentations/Searching-Without-Objectives\n\n=\r\n\n&gt; (2) Furthermore, if it&#39;s IGA v. GA and &#39;interestingness&#39; is the evaluati=\r\non\n&gt; criteria, that ain&#39;t a fair fight.  Why should I believe there is more=\r\n to\n&gt; it\n&gt; than that?\n&gt; \n\nBut interestingness wasn&#39;t the evaluation criteri=\r\na.  This paper played by the traditional ground rules to whose defense you =\r\nare now jumping.  The objective was definitively the skull (or the butterfl=\r\ny, or the eye..), not &quot;interestingness.&quot;  The fact that the results come ou=\r\nt so abysmally and leave you wanting to argue about interestingness just sh=\r\nows how unreasonable peddling these objectives as meaningful benchmarks can=\r\n be.  That&#39;s the whole point - the paper is a play on the traditional algor=\r\nithmic evaluation scheme that leaves the reader squirming, as it should.  \n=\r\n\nIn fact, if you really think that IGA vs. GA isn&#39;t a &quot;fair fight&quot; when we =\r\nare aiming for interestingness, then you are in part in agreement (though i=\r\nnadvertently) with the spirit of our message.  That is, if you are really c=\r\nonvinced that IGA is so far superior to GAs at doing something interesting =\r\nthat it isn&#39;t even fair to contrast them, then unless we are somehow intent=\r\nionally trying to avoid evolving anything interesting, what are we doing wa=\r\nsting our time with objective GAs?  Does it not highlight a central paradox=\r\n in our position that we might actually care more about being &quot;fair&quot; than b=\r\neing &quot;interesting?&quot;  Why are we even running these algorithms?\n\n&gt; (3) How d=\r\no we know that intermediate objectives are in any way significant\n&gt; to disc=\r\novering interesting pictures in Picbreeder?  I have a sneaking\n&gt; suspicion =\r\nthat totally random search, followed by focused objective based\n&gt; search wh=\r\nen something &#39;pops&#39; might be just as effective, and that the\n&gt; &#39;intermediat=\r\ne objectives&#39;, while certainly necessary to find a particular\n&gt; image, are =\r\nnot very helpful in general to finding interesting images.  If\n&gt; so, this i=\r\ns no chink in the armor of objective based search.  I suppose\n&gt; without int=\r\nermediate objectives there can be no exaptation, but does that\n&gt; matter?  W=\r\nhat percentage of evolved features in biological organisms have\n&gt; any exapt=\r\nation at all in their history?\n&gt; \n\nWhen you say the random search followed =\r\nby objective-based search would be &quot;just as effective,&quot; I don&#39;t really unde=\r\nrstand: just as effective at what?  At doing something &quot;interesting?&quot;  At a=\r\nchieving a specific objective?  Surely you don&#39;t believe that random search=\r\n will produce images as interesting as Picbreeder?  The stepping stones (i.=\r\ne. intermediate objectives) in Picbreeder are in effect fundamental discove=\r\nries of important regularities that are later elaborated.  For example, thi=\r\ns simple face-like stepping stone leads to a whole family of subsequent fac=\r\nes:\n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D542\n\nHere you can ge=\r\nt a family-tree expansion from that individual: \nhttp://picbreeder.org/sear=\r\nch/familytree.php?sid=3D542\n\nIf you are willing to skip bridges like that b=\r\necause they are intermediate, you would never find any of the treasures on =\r\nthe other side of the bridge.  If you look back in the lineages of almost a=\r\nny interesting image on the site you will find a similar story wherein fund=\r\namental regularities that were later exploited were first discovered in a d=\r\nifferent context.  \n\nJust compare figure 6 and figure 7 in the paper to see=\r\n how horrible it is to start from a random place and then lock in on an obj=\r\nective (figure 7).  It takes 29,000 generations to do the same thing it too=\r\nk 12 to do better.\n\n\n&gt; (4) Finally - and this is the big one - one of the d=\r\neadly sins of Science\n&gt; is\n&gt; claiming a result as the objective a posterior=\r\ni, a point which eludes even\n&gt; some very famous scientists.  It&#39;s what allo=\r\nws publications like this,\n&gt; which\n&gt; &#39;prove&#39; psychic phenomena by mining da=\r\nta for &#39;statistically significant&#39;\n&gt; results.  The problem is, a result isn=\r\n&#39;t significant unless you were\n&gt; specifically attempting to confirm it when=\r\n the experiment was designed\n&gt; (i.e.\n&gt; always follow up exploratory experim=\r\nent with a confirmatory experiment!).\n&gt; I\n&gt; heartily endorse exploring for/=\r\nmarvelling at results you weren&#39;t initially\n&gt; looking for, but one should n=\r\never use such results as the basis for any\n&gt; sort\t\n&gt; of comparison.  In the=\r\n case of the eye experiment, who cares if the GA\n&gt; couldn&#39;t evolve the eye?=\r\n  The IGA can&#39;t either, and the fact that it\n&gt; already\n&gt; did is immaterial!=\r\n  I could be persuaded that the IGA is better at evolving\n&gt; interesting ima=\r\nges, but I do not believe it&#39;s any better at evolving the\n&gt; &#39;eye&#39; (or &#39;dolp=\r\nhin&#39;, or &#39;apple&#39;).  In fact, I would bet that&#39;s it&#39;s worse\n&gt; at\n&gt; evolving =\r\nthose specific images, intermediate objectives notwithstanding.\n&gt; \n\nShould =\r\nwe really believe your statement? : &quot;I heartily endorse exploring for/marve=\r\nlling at results you weren&#39;t initially looking for, but one should never us=\r\ne such results as the basis for any sort of comparison.&quot;\n\nIs not our entire=\r\n infatuation with evolution, the very reason we choose to explore it as an =\r\nalgorithm, for the very reason that you say we should never use such compar=\r\nisons?  After all, natural evolution is just such a gallery of &quot;results you=\r\n weren&#39;t initially looking for&quot; yet it is the core inspiration for all our =\r\nhopes and dreams for the field and the example against which many of us com=\r\npare our algorithms.  Thus I strongly disagree with the principle you want =\r\nto impose that marvels attained without explicit a priori intent are outsid=\r\ne of the realm of scientific interest.  On the contrary, in fact the point =\r\nof the paper is that our mistake is precisely that we have been misled by s=\r\nuch a restrictive and dogmatic doctrine.  It is time that we did begin to c=\r\nontemplate the marvel of what is discovered a posteriori.  Asking why such =\r\namazing discoveries as human beings happens in nature is nothing like enter=\r\ntaining psychic phenomena.\n\nImagine if we had left out the part about Picbr=\r\needer and simply run some experiments to see if NEAT can evolve a set of pi=\r\nctures.  After it failed miserably every time, following the traditional in=\r\nterpretation, we would conclude that NEAT cannot evolve such pictures, or e=\r\nven pictures *like* them.  The fact that Picbreeder did evolve many such pi=\r\nctures is thus relevant and scientifically interesting; it shows why the tr=\r\naditional implications we draw from such &quot;failures&quot; are far too expansive.\n=\r\n\nYou say that you could be persuaded that the IGA is better at evolving int=\r\neresting images yet then you say that you don&#39;t think it is better at evolv=\r\ning the eye.  Yet the whole point is that it is better at evolving interest=\r\ning images.  Beware of missing the forest for the trees:  It is not importa=\r\nnt whether the IGA is good at evolving the eye (or dolphin, or apple); it i=\r\ns important that it is good at evolving images *like* those.  There is no o=\r\nther algorithm on Earth that can do that.  That is, there is no other appro=\r\nach that we know of that could get NEAT to actually encode images *like* ca=\r\nrs and butterflies in a CPPN.  That fact should be startling to us, not dis=\r\nmissed as a mere curiosity.  \n\n\n&gt; Anyway, though I have a lot of doubts abo=\r\nut this particular paper, I really\n&gt; appreciate these sorts of research dir=\r\nections.  Keep up the good work!\n&gt; \n\nSure, I understand.  A good hard defen=\r\nse of the status quo is healthy to ensure that no one gets away with taking=\r\n unjustifiable potshots :)  Yet at the same time, questioning the status qu=\r\no is sometimes important if progress is to be made.  \n\nRegards,\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
