To take your example to the extreme, how is the this population\nusefully different than the results obtained by just utilizing a random number generator?\n\nAt least that is what is there for me, attempting to use my own &quot;purpose&quot; to determine the level\nof my finding utility in the word &quot;evolution&quot;.\n\nIn light of the goal we are all trying to achieve, harnessing the awesome power of the process\nthat seems to be the nature...of...um...nature, the utility in seeing evolution largely\ndeterministically seems appropriate.  And finding useful models, mathmatical and linguistic, are\ngoing to be both challenging and frustrating.  We may end up having to find our own words to\ndescribe the process we are choosing to use, because strictly speaking...we are not technically\nusing nature&#39;s version of evolution.\n\nWe are mildly modeling it and then changing it according to our needs, right?  If so, it might be\nuseful to distinguish it with another word besides &quot;evolution&quot; which carries ages of connotation.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- Derek James &lt;blue5432@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;d also throw this question out to the group:\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re not defining evolution as genetic change in\n&gt; a population over time, then what what would you\n&gt; propose as a good working definition?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, let&#39;s take the case of an unsuccessful run (I&#39;ve\n&gt; only been using NEAT for a short while, but I&#39;ve\n&gt; already have plenty of these):\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re trying to evolve a network that solves XOR, but\n&gt; let&#39;s say you&#39;re using NEAT for the first time, and\n&gt; you&#39;re trying out some rather extreme parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Population size: 10\n&gt; Connection mutation rate: 0.5\n&gt; Neuron mutation rate: 0.5\n&gt; Weight value mutation rate: 0.9\n&gt; \n&gt; And let&#39;s say that your speciation threshold is set\n&gt; very high...that is, individuals have to be\n&gt; *extremely* different in order to be put into a new\n&gt; species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say that you use a standard XOR fitness\n&gt; function.  For each individual in each generation you\n&gt; input the four sets of inputs: (0,0; 0,1; 1,0; 1,1). \n&gt; For each output, you subtract the network&#39;s output\n&gt; from the target value, square that, and sum each of\n&gt; these values for the four sets of stimuli.\n&gt; \n&gt; And let&#39;s say that your run is 100 generations, and\n&gt; that it&#39;s a miserable failure.  None of your networks\n&gt; ever solves XOR.  In fact, the fitness of each\n&gt; generational champion never improves.  The average\n&gt; fitness of the population never improves.  But let&#39;s\n&gt; say that the average chromosome size increases by a\n&gt; factor of 10.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has evolution occurred?\n&gt; \n&gt; You had a selection pressure, but it failed to induce\n&gt; a behavioral change in the resulting networks.  And\n&gt; yet the networks changed dramatically topologically. \n&gt; They no longer resemble their ancestors in any\n&gt; respect.  And they are no better or worse than their\n&gt; ancestors at solving XOR.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have they evolved?\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
