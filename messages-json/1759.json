It is not \nspecifically about NEAT, because it is about adding a set of desirable \nfeatures to any evolving software system.  NEAT is one of the systems I \nhave had in mind throughout the writing, however.\n\n         I was hoping to have it done by Christmas, but I probably won&#39;t \nmake that now.  It won&#39;t be too deep into the new year, however.  And this \nlist will be one of the very first places I bring it looking for comments \nand oppinions...\n\n         Ian\n\nAt 00:58 06/12/2004, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi Joseph,\n&gt;\n&gt;Thans for pointing to your thesis, which I have now read. Good stuff.\n&gt;It did clear up most of the details I was wondering about, but it\n&gt;would be handy to have your code available to look at in case there is\n&gt;something more I&#39;m wondering about.\n&gt;\n&gt;I am currently working on comparing different ways of encoding\n&gt;modularity for evolving controllers in the simple game of Cellz, where\n&gt;agents have radial symmetry. One of the methods will be something very\n&gt;much like modular neat, but without the speciation and symbiotic\n&gt;coevolution parts. (If I understand your thesis right, you didn&#39;t find\n&gt;any evidence that the symbotic coevolution part actually improved\n&gt;effectiveness.)\n&gt;\n&gt;I definitely think that the general idea of modular neat is a (the?)\n&gt;key to scaling up evolutionary computation in certain domains with\n&gt;inherent symmetry, such as complex visual input. Actually, I&#39;m not\n&gt;convinced that artificially embryogenetic systems (e g GRN-based)\n&gt;neccessarily have more to offer in terms of evolvability (though they\n&gt;might be more interesting from a biological point of view) than the\n&gt;straightforward approach to modularity taken in neat.\n&gt;\n&gt;Julian\n&gt;\n&gt;On Thu, 2 Dec 2004 14:14:52 -0600 (CST), Joseph Reisinger\n&gt;&lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Hi Julian,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I wrote Modular NEAT for my undergraduate thesis at UT; so, the GECCO\n&gt; &gt;  paper was kind of a distillation of the thesis, with a little extra work\n&gt; &gt;  on measuring modularization. If you&#39;re interested, I put the thesis itself\n&gt; &gt;  is in the files section of this group (honors-thesis.ps.gz). That version\n&gt; &gt;  is a little heavier on the implementation and analysis side, so it might\n&gt; &gt;  be helpful to you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Unfortunately I haven&#39;t put any work into it since finishing the GECCO\n&gt; &gt;  paper, though I am working on a GRN-based system that I hope to get some\n&gt; &gt;  results on by the next GECCO deadline. Anyway I still have a ton of ideas\n&gt; &gt;  for modular NEAT, and I&#39;d love to see the work continue on it. I think the\n&gt; &gt;  results were pretty clear that its a powerful optimization, at least for\n&gt; &gt;  some types of domains.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  As for the source code, I&#39;ve been planning for a while now to make a\n&gt; &gt;  formal release of it, but I really haven&#39;t had a lot of time to go over\n&gt; &gt;  the code. I&#39;d be more than happy to package it up and send it to you in\n&gt; &gt;  its current state, and to answer any questions you have, but, the code\n&gt; &gt;  itself is not well-documented (much less so than Ken&#39;s original NEAT code\n&gt; &gt;  :P) and probably needs to be rewritten. Let me know if you&#39;re interested\n&gt; &gt;  though; I can at least point out the really obscure implementation details\n&gt; &gt;  for you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Joe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  --\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Joseph Reisinger\n&gt; &gt;  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  On Thu, 2 Dec 2004, Julian Togelius wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;m a beginning research student at University of Essex, UK (more on\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; me at http://julian.togelius.com) and I&#39;m also new to this group.
