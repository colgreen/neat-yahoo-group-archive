Hopefully this will\ndiscourage chance collisions forcing P=\r\nacMan to be more active in pursuit. \n \nWhen the console window was running =\r\na spontaneous crash would occur\nthe seemed to stem from the Windows message=\r\n queue. A DoEvents()\nfunction was implemented to allow window events to be =\r\nprocessed while\nthe Console was active. This seems to have solved the probl=\r\nem. \n\n\n"}}
