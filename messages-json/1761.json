Good stuff.\n&gt; It did clear up most of the details I was wondering about, but it\n&gt; would be handy to have your code available to look at in case there is\n&gt; something more I&#39;m wondering about.\n\nOk, sorry for the delay. I&#39;ve posted a tarball at:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii/mneat.tar.bz2\n\nI cleaned up the package a bit and wrote a (short) README file addressing\nsome basic issues. Please take a look if you have time. Also please feel\nfree to ask any questions at all about the code. I never really inteded to\nrelease it so its in a terrible state, but I think it still runs fine. As\nI get questions I&#39;ll add clarification to the README and comments to the\ncode, and hopefully this package can be made a little more usable.\n\n&gt; I am currently working on comparing different ways of encoding\n&gt; modularity for evolving controllers in the simple game of Cellz, where\n&gt; agents have radial symmetry. One of the methods will be something very\n&gt; much like modular neat, but without the speciation and symbiotic\n&gt; coevolution parts. (If I understand your thesis right, you didn&#39;t find\n&gt; any evidence that the symbotic coevolution part actually improved\n&gt; effectiveness.)\n\nRight exactly. Finding ways to percolate the fitness from the chromosomes\ndown to the modules was troubling, and even worse, modules had no control\nover their own expression patterns, so they could not be expected to\nevolve anything but highly generic structures. I&#39;d be really interested to\nsee an implementation of this without symbiotic coevolution; in my mind\nthat is the current greatest weakness of the method.\n\n&gt; Actually, I&#39;m not convinced that artificially embryogenetic systems (e g\n&gt; GRN-based) neccessarily have more to offer in terms of evolvability\n&gt; (though they might be more interesting from a biological point of view)\n&gt; than the straightforward approach to modularity taken in neat.\n\nHehe well the main hope is that developmental systems will eventually\nelimnate the need to have different kinds of representations for different\nkinds of problems. I imagine some system that does just as well on double\npole balancing as it does on my 7x7 board game, evolving\nfunctional modularity as required to increase the overall evolvability. In\nany case my next paper will focus on this topic so I hope I can sway you\nsomewhat :)\n\nAnyway thanks for your interest in MNEAT, and good luck with your\nresearch.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
