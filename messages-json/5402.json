I&#39;m particularly interested if \n&gt; Colin (or anyone else familiar with S=\r\nN2 and HyperNEAT) finds anything \n&gt; wrong with my experiment setup/code. Al=\r\nso, I&#39;ve made some \n&gt; simplifications to terminology. If I made any erroneo=\r\nus simplifications, \n&gt; please let me know and I&#39;ll correct them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note =\r\nthat there was some discussion about using a non-coevolution setup. \n&gt; I st=\r\nill plan on doing that, but this part doesn&#39;t have that piece. I \n&gt; figured=\r\n it&#39;s better to release the part I have done, since I&#39;ve had a \n&gt; few peopl=\r\ne ask for the HyperNEAT component.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
