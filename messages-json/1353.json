Actually, for that to be completely true, if you use a species, \nyou probably want to take a copy of it and start pruning that; whereas \nstarting/ending pruning an individual would make it a new species?\n\n\tSorry if this covers what was said before, but I went on holiday and lost \ntrack.\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
