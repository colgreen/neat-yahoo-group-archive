I&#39;m curious whether you used some \nexternal input source to get oscillations, or whether you let the \nnetwork develop its own oscillator?  I believe the best way to get \noscillators inside neural networks is using leaky integrator \nneurons, which I take it you did not use (since they aren&#39;t part of \nthe standard NEAT distribution).  Therefore, I&#39;m curious how you got \nregular periodic oscillations to evolve with NEAT.  \n\nDo you plan to post any specs on your site?  It would be cool to \nknow all about how this thing was set up.  And also, what&#39;s your \nmedium-term plan... are you working towards behaviors beyond walking?\n\nken  \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Dexter Allen &lt;vector@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Fitness is measured by recording whenever there is a collision \nbetween \n&gt; the ground and a foot.  Compare the last right and left \nfootsteps.  The \n&gt; fitness is the lesser y-distance (ie, how far the back foot&#39;s last \nstep \n&gt; was from starting point).  I found this to work a little better at \n&gt; avoiding the &quot;just fall forward&quot; local minima of CoM distance (but \nit \n&gt; does suffer from other early traps, like shuffling the feet \nforward).\n&gt; \n&gt; Mostly I&#39;ve been using NEAT directly from your linux version, plus \nthe \n&gt; constant-species-count change and some other minor tweaks.  I \nplayed \n&gt; around with different activation functions, but didn&#39;t notice any \n&gt; improvement and am using only sigmoid now.\n&gt; \n&gt; The phrase you quote is meant to say that my ESN approach can be \n&gt; evaluated by comparing its performance to that of NEAT on the same \nbody, \n&gt; muscles and physics settings, ie, using NEAT as a benchmark.  NOT \nthat \n&gt; they are equivalent.\n&gt; \n&gt; ESN&#39;s use a form of backpropagation to train the connections to \nand from \n&gt; a big, fixed &quot;clump&quot; of (often hundreds of) neurons with some nice \n&gt; mathematical properties that imply internal cyclical activation.  \nThe \n&gt; fact that they are designed to work in cyclical domains is the \nreason I \n&gt; wanted to try something with them for a locomotion controller.  My \n&gt; approach so far is just to replace backpropagation with simple \nweight \n&gt; and enabled-or-not evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not applying NEAT to the ESN stuff (yet) because I&#39;m hoping to \nfirst \n&gt; get a better intuitive feel (and some code) for evolving networks \nwith \n&gt; different &quot;plasticities&quot;, in this case the totally-fixed clumps \nand the \n&gt; evolved connections to/from the I/O.  In the long run, I&#39;d like to \nbe \n&gt; able to compose together layered behaviors-- eg, balancing, \nwalking and \n&gt; jumping.  Obviously, that&#39;s a bit of the holy grail, but I&#39;m \nhoping to \n&gt; test soon using NEAT to evolve different networks for different \ntasks, \n&gt; and then evolve them all together-- perhaps treating each NEAT-\nevolved \n&gt; network as just an ESN clump.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear any feedback-- I know similar ideas have \nbeen \n&gt; tossed around by a lot of people, anybody want to share any war \nstories?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, sorry about the movies; I know almost nothing about video \nand \n&gt; codecs, but I&#39;ll try converting them to something more common (is \n&gt; quicktime the best?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Dex\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Brian (or do you go by Dexter?),\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in your methodology: what was your fitness \nfunction,\n&gt; &gt; and did you do anything special to change NEAT&#39;s neural model or\n&gt; &gt; just use it as-is? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I notice you mention Echo State Networks.  I don&#39;t know much \nabout\n&gt; &gt; these, but you say in your research & theory section, &quot;The \nsuccess\n&gt; &gt; of the Evolved ESN approach can be compared to that of the NEAT\n&gt; &gt; algorithm on identical morphology.&quot;  It sounds as if you will \nevolve\n&gt; &gt; this ESN networok...so my question is, why not evolve it with \nNEAT?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One last thing is I can&#39;t view your videos no matter what I do.  \nAre\n&gt; &gt; they available in any other format?

I use\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; training wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; center of mass moves too far) at first until they\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; learn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; remove this external help, seed a new population with\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;m curious why you restart the population rather than just\n&gt; &gt; changing the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; fitness function in the middle of the run?  Is it that you \nwant to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; whittle away all but the best species?  Are the genes in the \nfirst\n&gt; &gt; run\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; treated differently in the second run somehow?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; (first oscillate legs, then worry about\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; balancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; teach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; block torso seems to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; does the ANN\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; joint (which\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; stop)?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; The ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; rotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; from the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; just the two hip joints.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; My ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; modified PID (proportional integral derivative)\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; controller to calculate the torque necessary to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; achieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; higher-level control system: the brain has desired\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; angles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; much force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the same type of controller but just have a constant\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; desired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; angle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; swing freely.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve been doing some similar stuff lately, same intent, but \nsome\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; different specifics from Tyler&#39;s.  FWIW, NEAT is the best\n&gt; &gt; controller\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; evolver I&#39;ve found so far. :-)  If anybody&#39;s interested, \nthere&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; couple animations up now:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; http://pantarhei.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; --\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Brian Dexter Allen\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; http://www.luminousbeings.com/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
