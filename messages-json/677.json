Also, if the population size chages\nthat&#39;s definitely a major problem that needs to be fixed.  It probably\nindicates something wrong with the way offspring are being assigned.  \nAnyway, looks like you already fixed it.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Right now I&#39;ve switched back to checking over the search\nalgorithm. A \n&gt; &gt;&gt;couple of things I need to look into are the population size\nfluctuating \n&gt; &gt;&gt;quite a bit (between 70-150 in a population that is supposed to be\n150) \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and also I have not imlemented the purging of old species\n(droppoff_age \n&gt; &gt;&gt;parameter) - which is something you mentioned on the list\nyesterday \n&gt; &gt;&gt;which I would expect to be quite an important part of the search\nalgorithm!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; Quick update on this. I fixed the pop size problem and implemented \n&gt; species culling... starting to get nice results now. As an example\nof \n&gt; the species culling working very well have a look at this log\noutput:\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; gen=775, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=61.36, species=10,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=776, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=64.93, species=10,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=777, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=63.62, species=10,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=778, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=69.39, species=5,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=779, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=67.82, species=3,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=780, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=69.45, species=3,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=781, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=71.17, species=5,\ndifficulty=8\n&gt; gen=782, bestFitness=90.00, meanFitness=68.34, species=5,\ndifficulty=8  \n&gt; &lt;-- threshold of 90 achieved and therefore the task difficulty is \n&gt; increased and the best fitness drops in the next gen...\n&gt; gen=783, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=64.32, species=6,\ndifficulty=9 \n&gt; gen=784, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.79, species=6,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt; gen=785, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.76, species=6,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt; gen=786, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.57, species=6,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt; gen=787, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=66.09, species=7,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt; gen=788, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=66.03, species=7,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt; gen=789, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=67.01, species=7,\ndifficulty=9\n&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; The search was stuck at a best fitness of 88 and then culled some\nold \n&gt; species away, almost immediately an improvement is seen.
