Or even better, run my \n&gt; =\r\nversion of NEAT to create an XOR solution and then load that into \n&gt; your s=\r\nystem and test it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then I would check into the weight mutations.  I wo=\r\nuld try very \n&gt; different uniform distribution sizes to see if one of them =\r\nworks.  \n&gt; It&#39;s possible your weight mutations are for some reason too big =\r\nor \n&gt; too small.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, first let me know if your networks activate =\r\ncorrectly on \n&gt; solutions that you know should work.  \n\n\n\n"}}
