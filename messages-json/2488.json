Just a thought.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWas just thinking about this point and about dominant and recessive \ngenes. I&#39;m wondering if maybe we could incorporate this type of idea \ninto our artificial genomes. So the offspring of two parents contains a \nmix of genes from both, some of which may clash either directly, e.g. \nmatching innovation ID&#39;s, or indirectly e.g. some sub-network is \nirrelevent in the resence of some other sub-network.  NEAT of course \nmatched innovation ID&#39;s at during crossover and therefore only select a \ngene from one of the parents (usually the fittest), but the scheme could \nbe expanded s that the presence of a gene automatically swicthes of one \nor more other genes at decode/transcribe time.  It&#39;s just a thought.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
