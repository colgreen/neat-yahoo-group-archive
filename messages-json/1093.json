So, for \nexample, the fastest one would have activated it almost 136 million times.\n\nAs you&#39;ll see from the code, I also dynamically calculate \nactivations-per-second as I go so that I can do the activations in a tight \nloop, and only probe the clock once per second.  So the overhead for the \ntiming mechanism is minimal.\n\nI could have used a larger network, but the purpose of the experiment was to \nsee what effect different ways of structuring the activation code might \nhave.  And this network size was more than adequate to this task.\n\n\n\n"}}
