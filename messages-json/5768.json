If you as=\r\nsign everything an identical fitness, then in some NEAT implementation it i=\r\ns likely that the last offspring created will be the ones that don&#39;t reprod=\r\nuce because the individuals will be sorted by their order of creation (give=\r\nn that they all have the same fitness).  So it is kind of un-random to alwa=\r\nys choose the earliest-created, though in practice it probably isn&#39;t any di=\r\nfferent from any other kind of random process.\n\nNote that in both cases, yo=\r\nu will still have the protection provided by speciation (i.e. so that more =\r\nunusual genotypes don&#39;t require the same level of fitness to survive).  How=\r\never, since that is true in normal NEAT as well, it still isolates the issu=\r\ne of the impact of fitness.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ze_dakster&quot;=\r\n &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;m far too tired to think this =\r\nthrough clearly. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking of adding a &quot;random search&quot; implement=\r\nation to my NEAT experiment for simple comparison purposes, and I&#39;ve got br=\r\nain lock on what the best way to do this would be. \n&gt; \n&gt; Provide identical =\r\nfitness values to all genomes each generation (all get a fitness of 1.0 or =\r\nthe like)? \n&gt; \n&gt; Or randomly pick fitness values?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Drew\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
