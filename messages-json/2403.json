But \nthen my thoughts crossed over a little bit.\n\nIn a nutshell I was thinking that instead of, or as well as evaluation \nby accumulating an error value over a set of sample points, I could \nevaluate the natural frequency of each network. If the frequency is \nclose to that of the target waveform then the network may still be quite \ngood even though the peaks and troffs are all out of sync and therefore \nthe accumulated error is really high.\n\nNow lets say that most mutations tend towards high natural frequencies, \nI&#39;m not sure that this the case but it&#39;s possible - new connections that \ncreate short cuts could do this. So my search for a low freq wave is now \nreally poor because this phenomenon takes over. Even topologies with a \nlow frequency that get put in their own species are soon swaped by high \nfrequency genomes within their own species.\n\nIn that situation it would be nice if my speciation measure took natural \nfrequency into account. That way each species focuses in on one \nparticular frequency band and the search is improved. Ok maybe the \nexample isn&#39;t so good. Say instead of a specific target function I have \nan indirect eval function and so the frequency dynamics I&#39;m looking for \nare unknown. In that situation I wan&#39;t to ensure searching over a wide \nrange of different frequencies.\n\nSo in the general case I would like to plug in a network or genome \ncomparison scheme to drive speciation in the same way that we tend to \nplug in fitness evaluation schemes. And in fact a given experiment may \nhave a number of different measures we would like to keep track of and \ncluster/speciate on. I think it makes sense for some problem domains, \nbut this does potentially sounds a bit like driving evolution by \ncomparing phenotypes rather than genotypes - which was another \ndiscussion we had some time ago.\n\nAnyway I thought the specific example might be interesting.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
