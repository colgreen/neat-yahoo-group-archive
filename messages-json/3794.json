I have made a number of changes which=\r\n should address\nthis problem.  Please don&#39;t hesitate to let me know if prob=\r\nlems of\nthis sort still occur.\n\nTwo representation methods are in place:  \n=\r\n\nWindowed, in which a window around PacMan constitutes the inputs. \nEach ti=\r\nle in the window (except under PacMan himself) has an input\nassociated with=\r\n dots/walls, power pellets, and ghosts.  Users can\nselect which inputs are =\r\nused through the parameters file.\n\nGlobal, in which details of the maze are=\r\n used as inputs, e.g.,\nPacMan&#39;s X and Y coordinates, ghost X and Y coordina=\r\ntes, ghost state,\npower pellet state, presence of walls or dots around PacM=\r\nan.  Again,\nthe specifc inputs used are selectable through the parameters f=\r\nile.\n\nI hope this can be useful and/or entertaining.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n\n"}}
