I think I&#39;m right in saying that in biological \nevolution mass extinction events are thought to give evolution a bit of \na kick. E.g. the cambrian explosion \n&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion&gt;. Then there&#39;s the \nargument about how far dinosaurs would have developed if they hadn&#39;t \nbeen zapped by a comet and that mammals (or some slug like ancestor of \nmammals anyhow) were able to fill in the gap left behind, amongst other \nlifeforms.\n\nSo all we need is some routine that randomly similarly zaps (I believe \nthat&#39;s the technical term) our populations/species every once in a \nwhile. You can do this automatically if a search has stagnated for N \ngenerations ans/or hours, or just have some way of allowing the user to \ntrigger an extinction manually. Worth a try I reckon.\n\n"}}
