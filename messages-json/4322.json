There\nis a t=\r\nricky issue with interpreting the pattern output by a CPPN as\nthe morpholog=\r\ny of an animal, and your thoughts make sense about ways\nto make it more &quot;mo=\r\nrphological.&quot;  I find your simulations very\ninteresting and they are though=\r\nt-provoking.\n\nHowever, I cannot help but wonder whether there is a more fun=\r\ndamental\nsolution than trying to push the CPPN closer to a traditional iter=\r\nated\ndevelopmental paradigm.  Connective CPPNs in HyperNEAT are a good\nexam=\r\nple of how it is possible that there is simply a better\n*interpretation* of=\r\n a pattern than the most obvious one.  Perhaps the\nstory of connective CPPN=\r\ns offers a good lesson in this context:  \n\nFor a long time we were scratchi=\r\nng our heads wondering how a spatial\npattern such as those output by regula=\r\nr CPPNs could possibly translate\ninto a neural network in any straightforwa=\r\nrd way.  It seemed that some\nkind of ad hoc interpretation process or perha=\r\nps some very severe new\nconstraints might need to be introduced.  However, =\r\nonce I realized\nthat a connectivity pattern is nothing more than a spatial =\r\npattern in\nhigher-dimensional space, the problem became simple and elegantl=\r\ny\nsolved by simple CPPNs without any special extensions.\n\nSo when I think a=\r\nbout animal morphologies, part of me thinks that\nthere is a similar style o=\r\nf solution that is based on simply using the\ninformation output by a simple=\r\n CPPN in the right way.    After all, a\npattern in space is a pattern in sp=\r\nace and the key question may be how\nto use it rather than how to get it.  A=\r\nnimal morphologies have special\nproperties like joints and limb lengths.  I=\r\nn some ways, they are not\nonly morphologies but perhaps more fundamentally =\r\njointed\nconnectivities.  Or perhaps something else.  But I think the first\n=\r\nquestion that needs to be answered is exactly what kind of structure\n*is* a=\r\nn animal morphology, and then the next question is whether that\ntype of str=\r\nucture is somehow isomorphic to a spatial pattern in a\nuseful way?  I am no=\r\nt yet convinced there is not such an elegant\nisomorphism in this case as we=\r\nll.\n\nNevertheless, iterated CPPNs and CPPNs that control morphological\ngrow=\r\nth are still interesting dynamic systems and deserve to be\nexplored as well=\r\n.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@.=\r\n..&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; \n&gt; I was looking for an algorithm to develop anim=\r\nal morphologies \n&gt; (generally any kind of solid physics objects) with CPPNs=\r\n. I found that \n&gt; writing a conversion routine (CPPN snapshot -&gt; object in =\r\nworld) is \n&gt; very challenging and prone to many bugs and artifacts. I reali=\r\nzed that \n&gt; object building has to be done in another way - and I came up w=\r\nith \n&gt; this simple idea. Suppose you have a set of small sticky cubes and y=\r\nou \n&gt; want to build a house, a robot or whatever your imagination has. You =\r\n\n&gt; can do it like this - place one cube and fix its position in space. \n&gt; S=\r\nee how it looks like and stick one more cube to it (where you want). \n&gt; See=\r\n how the 2 cubes look like and then stick a third one. You can \n&gt; stick the=\r\n cubes along the exposed sides of the fixed construction. \n&gt; Iterate this f=\r\nor enough time and you have the object. No separate \n&gt; parts, everything ro=\r\nck-solid (although empty spaces can be constructed \n&gt; inside), but has inte=\r\nrnal structure with regularities, and the object \n&gt; itself may be symmetric=\r\n, segmented, or perhaps just a shitty blob. \n&gt; These appear often. \n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n let me answer to your question about what kinds of shapes appear. I \n&gt; act=\r\nually saw all of the biological development patterns, symmetry, \n&gt; imperfec=\r\nt symmetry, repetition and repetition with variation. In \n&gt; particular, the=\r\n most interesting objects were created when I used \n&gt; sin(x) and sin(y) wav=\r\nes as input instead of the raw Cartesian \n&gt; coordinate frames. They were se=\r\ngmented and remarkably similar to \n&gt; biological ones. \n&gt; \n&gt; The implementat=\r\nion I uploaded currently &quot;divides&quot; cells, placing a \n&gt; random new cell in t=\r\nhe neighborhood of the cell of consideration. A \n&gt; better solution is to it=\r\nerate over the exposed surfaces and place new \n&gt; cells if the CPPN says so.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; There are several issues about this idea. First of all, there is a \n=\r\n&gt; problem with the coordinates. We had a discussion with David about \n&gt; the=\r\nm, and I agree that I should just use the range of [-1 .. 1] for my \n&gt; subs=\r\ntrate space. But the objects grow. So I have to either leave my \n&gt; substrat=\r\ne to [-infinite .. +infinite] or shrink the object every time \n&gt; it gets la=\r\nrger. Both doesn&#39;t work well, as too many garbage blobs \n&gt; appear (is it no=\r\nrmal?), so I am trying to find out an alternative. One \n&gt; is that instead o=\r\nf inputting coordinates to the CPPN, only time can be \n&gt; used as input and =\r\npossibly other information. I am thinking about this \n&gt; one in particular:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider this situation, you are about to build something with the \n&gt; =\r\nsticky cubes. You start minimally and incrementally add structure. It \n&gt; is=\r\n an iterative process, in which you first look at the intermediate \n&gt; const=\r\nruction, then *decide* what is missing and place the missing \n&gt; part. Then =\r\nrepeat this again until you run out of cubes. Like in NEAT, \n&gt; but there is=\r\n nothing else in common. I know that it looks like a \n&gt; process of explorat=\r\nion, but consider this.. You don&#39;t know how to \n&gt; build make the final phen=\r\notype, but have a clear knowledge of the \n&gt; exact *path* to building it, th=\r\ne sense where things belong as you \n&gt; build it? My idea is, that every futu=\r\nre state of the object can be \n&gt; viewed as a function of time and the curre=\r\nnt state of the object. \n&gt; Kinda confusing, isn&#39;t it? \n&gt; \n&gt; OK let&#39;s say th=\r\nat an object A turns into an object B after addition of \n&gt; one structural c=\r\nomponent, which requires 1 time step. Then B =3D f(A). \n&gt; Here is how you w=\r\nill produce the next object C: C =3D f(B). Then D =3D \n&gt; f(C). And so on.. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So the CPPN can take the role of that function f(x). The same CPPN ca=\r\nn \n&gt; be re-queried over and over again in time, producing a final phenotype=\r\n \n&gt; that is a function of time or just all of its intermediate forms \n&gt; bef=\r\nore. The challenge is how to input the object&#39;s state in a \n&gt; meaningful ma=\r\nnner. Because the CPPN takes coordinate frames as inputs \n&gt; and outputs poi=\r\nnt intensity, how a whole object can be input into it? \n&gt; Or is that a CPPN=\r\n at all? Is that just a form of recurrence without \n&gt; future? I don&#39;t know.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; But really, when you look at a sequence of photos of developing embr=\r\nyo \n&gt; , you actually see something remarkably similar to complexifying \n&gt; e=\r\nvolution of CPPNs. But instead of a genetic lineage through \n&gt; crossovers a=\r\nnd mutations, this is one single phenotype developing from \n&gt; a single cell=\r\n to a mature form. I believe that CPPNs and even just \n&gt; regular ANNs can a=\r\nbstract the transitions from one object state to \n&gt; another very compactly.=\r\n Because it is only adding structure, the \n&gt; phenotype increases in complex=\r\nity over time even without having to \n&gt; complexify the CPPN itself. It only=\r\n has to see what it did so far and \n&gt; decide what to do next. It is a hypot=\r\nhetical idea, I haven&#39;t even \n&gt; tried to implement such a thing, I actually=\r\n just talk about it, there \n&gt; are many challenges, perhaps it is totally st=\r\nupid, but I believe that \n&gt; it may be a path to an incredible AE capable of=\r\n creating highly \n&gt; complex phenotypes from very compact genomes. What do y=\r\nou think about \n&gt; it? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter C\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, you make a good point that t=\r\nhere is a challenge in \n&gt; interpreting\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary CPPN patterns as disti=\r\nnct physical objects.  I think ideas\n&gt; &gt; like yours are indeed important to=\r\n explore to potentially address \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; issue, and I found your shape-ev=\r\nolving novelty search program along\n&gt; &gt; those lines very interesting.  Sinc=\r\ne you have most experience with \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; idea, I am curious, do you get t=\r\nhe sense after playing with it a lot\n&gt; &gt; that the patterns that come out ar=\r\ne indeed sufficiently diverse and\n&gt; &gt; regular to potentially represent anim=\r\nal morphologies?  Or does there\n&gt; &gt; seem to be anything lacking from the ou=\r\ntput of such systems?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p=\r\netar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to poi=\r\nnt out that CPPNs can be combined effectively with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cellular growth m=\r\nodels. Because the cells need the answer to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question &quot;Who am I?&quot;=\r\n, the CPPN can provide that info without any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction between cel=\r\nls. It can also provide instructions about, \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; example &quot;Should I=\r\n divide or not? Should I change my type?&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While it seems like an ov=\r\nerkill, because CPPNs already abstract \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; away without having t=\r\no introduce time for development, the \n&gt; patterns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generated are hard=\r\n to interpret as distinct physical objects. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially in cases of r=\r\nepeating patterns. But objects generated \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cellular growth ins=\r\ntructed by CPPNs produce only a single object, \n&gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with its disti=\r\nnct parts and regularities. And not ripped apart \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; artifacts a=\r\ns it would be after converting it from a CPPN snapshot \n&gt; &gt; &gt; image. One mi=\r\nght say that such objects can still be infinte in \n&gt; size, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but it is=\r\n easy to put a limitation on the number of cells or cell \n&gt; &gt; &gt; divisions. =\r\nIt is also possible to make the limit dynamic, more \n&gt; complex \n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPNs=\r\n producing phenotypes with more cells.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Alexandre, thank you for bringing up reaction-diffusion systems.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make a good point- my statement was too broad, in part because=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;cellular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; potentially refer to many types of systems.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just to cl=\r\narify my statement, I was responding the line of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwith Peter about encodings that actually create distinct bodily \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shap=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that are self-contained and have clear structural boundaries \n&gt; =\r\n(which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion systems tend not to produce; rather they =\r\n\n&gt; produce\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wallpaper-like patterns).
