Sorry about the confusion!\n\n&gt;...as networks  \n&gt;increase in size, they can easily outgrow the fixed iteration count,  \n&gt;such that inputs may not make it all the way through the network.   \n&gt;This, in turn, creates a time delay or memory.\n\nIndeed. The unusual thing about the delay lines is the way they seem \nto function purely as a delay, with only one input and one output, \nrather than also performing some other processing along the way.\n\nOne could say, of course, that the inherent feedback in evaluating a \nnetwork multiple times like this does imply a kind of recurrence \nanyway, as the network&#39;s output on any given timestep naturally \naffects its input on the next.\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
