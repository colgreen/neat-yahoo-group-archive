We&#39;ve discussed the two different approach=\r\nes on the\ngroup before (mutation per genome vs per gene) and I argued for &#39;=\r\nper\ngenome&#39; on the basis that &#39;per gene&#39; is too strong a force on\nincreasin=\r\ng complexification. I guess this is how I ended up with the\nphased searchin=\r\ng where complexity increases dramatically and then is\nstripped away equally=\r\n dramatically. A system with a natural equlibrium\nseems a far more elegant =\r\nsolution, and potentially a more efficient\none - phased searching is addres=\r\nsing the symptoms of a problem whereas\na system that finds an equlibrium do=\r\nesn&#39;t exhibit the problem in the\nfirst place.\n\nI wonder though if there is =\r\nan argument for periodically resetting the\nequlibrium point to allow the se=\r\narch more free reign. A search will\nhappily complexify and search in unfit =\r\nspaces early on, but as\nselection pressure pushes us forward the propensity=\r\n to search is\nreduced. It&#39;s the old problem of how many accumulative mutati=\r\nons are\nrequried to find a beneficial modification.\n\nSo perhaps phased sear=\r\nching could still be employed, but instead of\ndramatic complexifying vs pru=\r\nning phases, we have softer phases where\nwe simply move the equilibrium poi=\r\nnt up and down.\n\n\n\n&gt; Obviously all that is in the absence of selection. \n&gt; =\r\nSelection pushes those equilibria around with great\n&gt; ease (which is why my=\r\n current run, with an expected\n&gt; size of two, is currently hovering around =\r\nan average\n&gt; size of 100...\n\nNice result. So all 100 genes must be contribu=\r\nting to fitness in some\nway *and* are lilely to not be redundant e.g. unnec=\r\nessary chains where\na single connection would do. BTW do you do semi-clever=\r\n deletions\nwhereby a chain can be collapsed to a single connection? I do th=\r\nis and\nI think it makes sense to do some simple semi-intelligent mutation\ns=\r\nlike this - so long as you don&#39;t start doing really complex\nmutations. A so=\r\nrt of keep it simple, but not *that* simple, approach.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I=\r\n&#39;m beginning to think that the\n&gt; relationship between how you run delete pr=\r\nobability\n&gt; (e.g. per gene or per genome) and how you handle\n&gt; unmatched ge=\r\nnes during cross over are pretty crucial\n&gt; for the control of genome size. =\r\n Unless you do both\n&gt; right, the ratio of m_a and m_d give far less control=\r\n\n&gt; over the rate of bloat than you would ever expect...\n\nI broadly agree - =\r\nalthough other implementation details/parameters\ncould affect the ability t=\r\no set up a system that finds an equilibrium.\n\n\n&gt; This is all assuming you h=\r\nave deletion as a mutation,\n&gt; if you do it another way then obviously there=\r\n is no\n&gt; bassis for comparison.\n\nIt still might be possible to set up and e=\r\nquilibrium because of\nspeciation (in traditional NEAT) and culling of old (=\r\nusually large)\nspecies - but it&#39;s harder to understand.\n\nThanks for taking =\r\nthe time to post.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
