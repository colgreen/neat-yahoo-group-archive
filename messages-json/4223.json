I have\nbeen experiment=\r\ning with a similar biped.  I have only implemented some\nvariations on Hebbi=\r\nan rules thus far, with little success.  However I\nhave seen evidence that =\r\ntaking the altitude across several points on\nthe multibody (head, torso, pe=\r\nlvis) seems to lend itself to refining\nthe fitness function.  I have yet to=\r\n try it but I am willing to bet\nthat if you use a fitness function that pun=\r\nishes being above a certain\ntarget altitude (or sum of altitudes) it is pos=\r\nsible to evolve\nstanding behaviors without the exploit of flipping, leaping=\r\n, and\ngenerally abusing a powerful body.\nck\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=\r\nesar G.

It&#39;s not a plug=\r\nin, though. You have\nto set\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; up a fitness function that calls the Bre=\r\nve engine from the command\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; line and passes the chromosomes by argume=\r\nnt. Once the Breve\nsimulation\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is finished, it returns the fitness fo=\r\nr each individual.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So it&#39;s a two-step problem: first set-up y=\r\nour environment within\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Breve, as you&#39;d do in a normal experiment; th=\r\nen you define a\nfitness\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; function to load that environment every time=\r\n you need to\nevaluate the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; population.
