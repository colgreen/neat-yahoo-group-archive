I =\r\nhave looked dozens of times \nover my code and still couldn&#39;t find the culpr=\r\nit yet. But your \nanswers are leading me on this search and are indeed very=\r\n helpful for \nme, so please stay tuned - even if this may seem to you very =\r\nsimple \nand boring ;-) I very much appreciate your help!\nIn order to answer=\r\n your questions: \n\n&gt;&quot;You say you&#39;ve tried a simplified version of the task =\r\nwith a single \njoint, correct? So you have a network with 3 inputs (current=\r\n joint \nangle, goal joint angle, and current speed), and 1 output (a force =\r\n\napplied to the joint?).&quot;&lt;\nYes, all of the above is absolutely correct. Mor=\r\ne details: The \nsimulator works with Radian angles [0; PI], these are then =\r\nconverted \ninto degrees [0; 180] and given to NEAT (because it seemed easie=\r\nr to \ncalculate the error distance of the angles in degree than rad). \nBefo=\r\nre being fed into the net, they are scaled down to [-1; 1]. Since \nthe outp=\r\nut is (same as the hidden nodes) sigmoid between [0; 1], it \nis scaled up t=\r\no [-175; 175], which are the maximum boundaries of \nforces allowed in the s=\r\nimulator. These forces are put into the \nsimulator, it calculates the new p=\r\nosition of the arm after applying \nthe forces, momentum and gravitation. Af=\r\nter that, it starts all over \nagain since this was only one of the 500 time=\r\nsteps of each sample.\n\n&gt;&quot;The arm starts in one position and has to move the=\r\n joint into \nanother position?&quot;&lt; \nYes, that&#39;s correct.\n\n&gt;&quot;If you have an ar=\r\nm with just one joint and it has to move from one \nstatic position to anoth=\r\ner, and you&#39;re explicitly giving the network \nthe new position as input, th=\r\nen yes, something is horribly wrong.&quot;&lt;\nYes, it has to move from one static =\r\nto another static position, the \ncurrent position is given to the net at al=\r\nl times and yes, there has \nto be something horribly wrong, but I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw where to find my \nmistake. That&#39;s the problem with being new to a materia=\r\nl, you don&#39;t \nknow where exactly to start when something goes wrong, and th=\r\nat&#39;s at \nthe same time the reason why I&#39;m so happy to have NEAT-experienced=\r\n \nusers like you showing me the right direction. \nMost of the last month I =\r\nthought the culprit would be a wrong \nparameter setting, but as Colin point=\r\ned out, there seems to exist no \n&quot;wrong&quot; with parameters. The reason why I =\r\nthought there could be \nwrong parameter settings was the fact that with ano=\r\nther fitness \nfunction and the hidden and output nodes being linear I got b=\r\netter \nresults than now, but only with some specific parameter settings and=\r\n \nnot with others. (The fitness function was basically the same, but \nonly =\r\ncalculating the mean difference of current and goal angles in \nthe second h=\r\nalf of time of each sample) But looking back, this was \nmaybe just coincide=\r\nnce and leading me into the wrong direction. \n\nI will start all over again =\r\ntoday and look over my code from the \nbeginning in order to find some error=\r\n I made. As soon as I find \nsomething suspect, I will post it here.\nThanks =\r\na lot for your help!\n\nWith best regards,\nMatthias\n\n\n\n"}}
