Consider this case: two modules (A and B)\n&gt;&gt; compose network X. Under your algorithm (if I understand correctly) A gets\n&gt;&gt; an evolution phase, B gets an evolution phase, and then X evolves one\n&gt;&gt; generation. So now when we come back to A&#39;s evolution phase, the\n&gt;&gt; population fitness rankings may have completely changed, because fitness\n&gt;&gt; is dependent on B&#39;s evolution is well. In modular NEAT this proved to be\n&gt;&gt; the biggest weak point in the algorithm, since it yielded no real module\n&gt;&gt; evolution (if you read the paper: modules evolved to be /highly/\n&gt;&gt; generalist, and then it turned out that only bindings really mattered for\n&gt;&gt; fitness).\n&gt;\n&gt; This depends a great-deal on what type of modules you are attempting to\n&gt; implement.  Remember the discussion of &quot;modularity and interfaces&quot; from\n&gt; earlier in the year (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/message/1871).  If\n&gt; the modules were just encoded by parts of the genome, then no fitness\n&gt; separate from the fitness of the whole would be required (just as, even\n&gt; though the same gene might be present in multiple genomes, there&#39;s no need\n&gt; to try to calculate a cross-population fitness for it).\n\nSure -- thats a more natural way to do it, but in this case I think Ashot \nis (or was, at least) proposing evolving the modules in a separate \npopulation. So dependent credit assignment is going to be a problem, as \nyou point out. (It can be lessened in NNs somewhat by making modules \nencode complete input-&gt;output pathways, though).\n\nActually nature has a very clever way to measure how &quot;good&quot; a certain \nmodularization is (without resorting to assigning a fitness to each \nmodule). Basically you can imagine two genotypes that map to the exact \nsame phenotype, but say genotype A encodes the phenotype in a very modular \nway, whereas genotype B uses no modules. Both genotypes would have equal \nfitness, but if the fitness regime was dynamic (i.e. the fitness-function \nchanges over time), then it turns out that genotype A is more &quot;evolvable.&quot; \nIn other words, its modular organization makes it better at adapting when \nthe selection pressure changes. This will make it more successful over the \nlong-run, even though its instantaneous fitness is the same. Thus the \n&quot;goodness&quot; of a certain modularization can actually be measured to some \nextent as evolvability (of course evolvability depends on other things, \nlike neutral traits for example, but I don&#39;t see these as being really \nseparate from modularity in biology).\n\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
