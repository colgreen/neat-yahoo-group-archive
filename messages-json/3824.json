I believe this presentation is \n&gt; applicable to NEAT=\r\n user&#39;s not based upon the subject MDO task, but \n&gt; rather based upon the e=\r\nxperience-based observations regarding the \n&gt; importance of maintaining his=\r\ntory (see pages 9, 20, 39, 40 and \n92). \n&gt; Their conclusion was that the im=\r\nplementation of a history block \nreduced \n&gt; computational requirements by a=\r\n factor of (10). This is consistent \nwith \n&gt; my own experiences with NEAT, =\r\nin instances in which the fitness \n&gt; evaluation was computationally non-tri=\r\nvial (i.e. most useful real-\nworld \n&gt; problems).\n&gt; \n&gt; Prior posts have outl=\r\nined various useful libraries applicable to \n&gt; implementation of a history =\r\nfunctionality w/ NEAT.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
