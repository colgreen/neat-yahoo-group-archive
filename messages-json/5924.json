It is indeed similar to the LEO, as you point out, but perhap=\r\ns a more blunt instrument.  As a practical tool, it may indeed work well, s=\r\no it could be worth some experimentation, but of course unlike ES-HyperNEAT=\r\n it still leaves some questions about how to lay out the initial substrate =\r\nneurons (from which the NEO might prune).\n \nOne aspect of ES-HyperNEAT that=\r\n I think is particularly interesting theoretically is that it has in princi=\r\nple no maximum density of neurons it can encode.  As long as the pattern en=\r\ncoded by the CPPN has information at a higher resolution than checked so fa=\r\nr by the quadtree information extraction algorithm, the algorithm can probe=\r\n deeper at finer and finer resolutions.  That way, ES-HyperNEAT really can =\r\n(at least theoretically) discover brains with billions of neurons or more. =\r\n The NEO would not have this interesting theoretical property because it wo=\r\nuld be picking from a pre-decided density.  Nevertheless it could still be =\r\npractically useful.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliv=\r\ner.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anybody tried using a Neuron Expression Outp=\r\nut (akin to link expression\n&gt; output) with HyperNEAT to choose which neuron=\r\ns to express?\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course there is ES-HyperNEAT, but NEO would have the =\r\nadvantage of being\n&gt; simpler (KISS) and faster to run (a relatively large a=\r\nmount of time can be\n&gt; spent decoding in ES-HyperNEAT if the evaluation fun=\r\nction is relatively\n&gt; simple/fast).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
