We have discarded the innovation numbers and thus the\nspeciation and crossover and kept only the idea of starting simple. We\nhave actually replaced all of it with an objective that rewards the\nbehavioral diversity of the robot we were evolving. We made some\ncomparisons with NEAT in this paper: &quot;Mouret, J.-B. and Doncieux, S.\n(2012). Encouraging Behavioral Diversity in Evolutionary Robotics: an\nEmpirical Study. Evolutionary Computation. Vol 20 No 1 Pages 91-133&quot;, cf\nhttp://www.isir.upmc.fr/files/2011ACLI2061.pdf\nIt revealed to be more efficient than NEAT on the different setups that\nwe did consider.\n\nSince then, if we don&#39;t have a reason to use something else, we use this\nsimple encoding either with a behavioral diversity objective or with a\nnovelty objective. It gives not bad results, see\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Trj0_A1ZfNo, for\ninstance. It has at least the advantage of being simple. If you want\nsome source code and/or look at the work we have done on this topic, you\ncan have a look at http://pages.isir.upmc.fr/evorob_db/.\n\nI know that it does not directly answer your question, but my advice\nwould be at least to test such an approach with a simpler encoding and\nsome helper objectives. It is quite straightforward to implement and\nwill give you some reference points with which to compare the\nperformance of more complex algorithms. The other advantage is that the\nday researchers in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms come up with\na new and more efficient algorithm, it should be simple to use it. By\nthe way, if you experience problem with that, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nHope it helps,\n\nBest,\n\nstephane\n\n"}}
