In\nthe early 70&#39;s I was on the faculty of biology at San\nDiego State University for 4 years; I was their math &\ncomputer guy.  I have no formal education in biology\nexcept for a 10th grade class, but I have long had an\ninterest in it, so I read the occaisional book and\npick up some info here and there.  I&#39;ve read &quot;The\nSelfish Gene&quot; and several popular biology books.  You\nwill find me listed in a book called &quot;American Men &\nWomen of Science&quot;, the life sciences edition, 1971. \nThat was for project management of a large computer\nsimulation project.  (Simulating the Arctic Tundra\nnear Barrow, Alaska)\n\nI want to make a comment on the discussion about\nspeciation.  We all agree that our field is inspired\nby, and largely patterned after, what we know about\nbiology.  When thinking about this we often think\nabout the creatures we are most familiar with, namely,\nhomo sapiens.  In my opinion it is more fruitful to\nthink about much simpler organisms, such as bacteria,\nyeast, algae, etc.  Even those are much more\ncomplicated than our models, but they are closer,\nsince we don&#39;t have sexual reproduction, nor many\nother genetic & developmental phenomena found in\nnature.  So I think we should model our work after the\nsimplest organisms that we know something about.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
