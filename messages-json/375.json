In some cases, it would only go in one place. \n  In others, as many as 4.\n\nThen, for each of those configurations, there are a limited number of moves \nthat the other player could do.  For each of them, that becomes the starting \nposition, and the process repeats.  Each possible branch proceeds until the \ngame is over.  If ever your rule-based player loses, then it is non-optimal. \n  If you exhaust all permutations without a loss, it is optimal.  This is \nNOT the same thing as trying it against random boards.  Random boards (or \nall possible board configurations) may put the player into a no-win \nsituation.\n\nAt first glance, this sounds like a lot of permutations.  But it is not.  \nThe reason is because many permutations are just mirrored or rotated \nversions of the same thing.  A person could actually find all relevant \npermutations in an hour with a pen and pencil.  You could prove your \nrule-set by hand in an evening, if you wanted to.\n\n&gt;From: Derek James &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [neat] Rule Base for Tic-Tac-Toe\n&gt;Date: Fri, 6 Feb 2004 12:10:16 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;Following up on a previous discussion on solving\n&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe, I wanted to open up to the group the\n&gt;question of the rule base for optimal play.\n&gt;\n&gt;I tried to find an optimal rule base on-line (thinking\n&gt;this would be an easy thing to find)...but no dice.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s the rule base (or very close to it) that we&#39;re\n&gt;using for our &quot;Best&quot; player:\n&gt;\n&gt;1. If you have a winning move, make it (if more than\n&gt;one exists, make the first you find)\n&gt;2. If opponent has a winning move, block it (if more\n&gt;than one exists, block the first you find)\n&gt;3. If the center is open, play there\n&gt;4. If your opponent makes a forking move, in opposite\n&gt;corners with your piece in the center, play a random\n&gt;edge to threaten.\n&gt;5. Play in a random corner.\n&gt;6. Play on a random edge.\n&gt;\n&gt;So does a player that follows this rule base play\n&gt;&quot;optimal&quot; Tic-Tac-Toe (if &quot;optimal&quot; is defined as\n&gt;winning if at all possible, and playing to a tie when\n&gt;not)?\n&gt;\n&gt;In looking around, I found another student paper that\n&gt;defined optimal play as never losing, much like\n&gt;Joseph&#39;s paper.  But a rule set for such a player\n&gt;would not necessarily resemble the rule set above.  It\n&gt;would primarily be concerned with blocking winning\n&gt;moves and preventing opponent forks (moves which\n&gt;create two possible win threats).\n&gt;\n&gt;Ken suggested testing a perfect player by constructing\n&gt;all possible game states, and making sure the neural\n&gt;net player makes an optimal move for each possible\n&gt;board configuration.\n&gt;\n&gt;But how to you determine what optimal is, without\n&gt;empirical tests?\n&gt;\n&gt;When I put two Random players against each other, the\n&gt;results fall out like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;Player 1 wins: 45%\n&gt;Player 2 wins: 45%\n&gt;Ties: 10%\n&gt;\n&gt;When I play a &quot;Best&quot; player, using the rule set above,\n&gt;against a Random player, I get:\n&gt;\n&gt;Best wins: 90%\n&gt;Random wins: 0%\n&gt;Ties: 10%\n&gt;\n&gt;Is there a way to mathematically determine the correct\n&gt;ratio of W/L/T between an optimal player and a random\n&gt;one?\n&gt;\n&gt;Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
