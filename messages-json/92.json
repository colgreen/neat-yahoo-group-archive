In other words, speciation\n&gt; facilitates starting the entire population with a \n&gt; very small genome and \n&gt; complexifying from there.  But if you *don&#39;t* start\n&gt; that way, then \n&gt; the effects of speciation are questionable, since\n&gt; many of the \n&gt; species will be protected without justification just\n&gt; because they \n&gt; happen to be in the initial population.  Does your\n&gt; system start minimally?\n\nI tend to agree with you, Ken...but I&#39;m just thinking\nout loud here.\n\nMy impression is that speciation, as implemented in\nNEAT, is meant to protect innovation.  Innovation does\nnot necessarily have to be complexification, does it?\n\nIf you had a speciated population of complex\nsolutions, with subtractive mutations that actually\nremove or disable parts of the genome, an innovation\nmight actually be a simplification of how a given\nneural structure functions, right?  \n\nIf there is a simplifying trend that might actually\nlead to increased fitness, you would also want to\nprotect that group of genotypes by speciating them.\n\nThis is analogous to nature, isn&#39;t it?  There is a\ngeneral trend of complexification, but in certain\nniches and within particular populations, a\nsimplification of morphological structure could arise\nas a mutation and actually increase the fitness of\nthat individual.\n\nIt seems that starting minimally and complexifying\nmakes a lot of sense in the early stages of a given\nrun, but perhaps in a long run, during the mid to late\nstages, simplification may be an important dynamic to\nadd, and speciation may work to protect simplified\ninnovations just as it worked to protect complexified\ninnovations early in the run.\n\nHowever, I&#39;d agree that if you start with a random\npopulation full of complex solutions, speciation is\nprobably going to be much less useful.  I don&#39;t know,\nthough...it&#39;s a very interesting area to explore.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
