Bloat is a term from\n&gt; Genetic Programming that referred to the accumulation of extraneous\n&gt; structure over the *entire population* that didn&#39;t help improve\n&gt; fitness.  In general they were looking at a situaton where everyone\n&gt; was getting bigger for no good reason.\n\nWell, this is something we&#39;ve discussed before, and I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re\ngoing to come to a consensus on the issue.  But I&#39;d argue that &quot;bloat&quot;\nis an appropriate term to use if the *average* complexity of the\npopulation is increasing unnecessarily.\n\nYou say that I was only describing a situation where the mutation\nrates are too high.  Well, wouldn&#39;t you term that bloat?  If you take\na simple problem and apply NEAT to it, and have two runs, one where\nthe mutation rates are double the other, NEAT will still solve the\nproblem.  By the end of both runs, there will be a range of\ncomplexity, as you describe.  There will be complex networks and\nsimple networks.  But in the run with doubled mutation rates, both the\n*average* complexity and the complexity of the champion will be\nunnecessarily higher.\n\nYou would consider this bloat, wouldn&#39;t you? \n\n&gt; In other words,\n&gt; addings more and more neurons during stagnation is creating space\n&gt; for discovery, not tacking on an unalterable piece of junk.\n\nBut it could be tacking on an awful lot of superflous structure that\nis slowing down your search, couldn&#39;t it?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
