This version has the following=\r\n changes:\n\n-MPI support is working again and will compile successfully.\n\n-t=\r\ninyxmldll and zlib are included in the zip so they do not have to be\ndownlo=\r\naded separately.\n\n-The default # of threads is set to &quot;2&quot;.  This can be cha=\r\nnged in\nHCUBE_Defines.cpp to however many threads your machine has.\n\nYou ca=\r\nn get the software here:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html#gaucij_Hype=\r\nrNEAT\n\nJason G.\n\n\n"}}
