Where did you download the code that is doing \nthis?  Is it my version, or maybe the version Darren recently \nuploaded to the files section that compiles under Windows?\n\nOne thing you could do is comment out the depth call and just have \nthe network activate some constant (e.g. 5) number of times.  It \ndoesn&#39;t really need to compute depth to do XOR, or for continuous \ncontrol experiments.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Everybody calls me Bull in real life&quot; \n&lt;robert_winkel@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have the C++ version of NEAT, with the visualization and Guile \n&gt; routines removed, and have successfully compiled it under Cygwin \non \n&gt; Windows XP.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I run the XOR experiment, I come into a bit of trouble.  Most \n&gt; of the time, it seems to get caught into an infinite loop and just \n&gt; prints &quot;** DEPTH NOT DETERMINED FOR NETWORK WITH LOOP&quot; to the \n&gt; screen.  Only once has this not happened, and has a xor_winner \nfile \n&gt; been generated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that there must be something wrong with the \nNNode::depth\n&gt; () method.  Can anyone help me in this area?  Any ideas for \n&gt; alternative code for this method?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Robert.\n\n\n"}}
