In other words, make it like a robot on wheels with a\n&gt;heading.  The sensors would be relative to the heading, instead of\n&gt;always pointing in the same direction, i.e. the robot could turn\n&gt;around.  I find that kind of sensor array is much more natural than a\n&gt;staticly positioned sensor array, which forces the NN to have to learn\n&gt;basically the same rule over and over again for each sensor.  With\n&gt;egocentric sensors, the robot can just say &quot;if the target is in the\n&gt;forward sensor, go to it.&quot;  The other sensors then just tell it how to\n&gt;turn.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nRight now I&#39;ve switched back to checking over the search algorithm. A \ncouple of things I need to look into are the population size fluctuating \nquite a bit (between 70-150 in a population that is supposed to be 150) \nand also I have not imlemented the purging of old species (droppoff_age \nparameter) - which is something you mentioned on the list yesterday \nwhich I would expect to be quite an important part of the search algorithm!\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
