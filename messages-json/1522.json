Since XOR\n&gt; has traditionally been the first test, most bugs or problems end up\n&gt; being exposed and fixed during XOR.  For those of you who have been\n&gt; through this process, can you comment briefly on what you remember\n&gt; about how the problems you encountered that initially stopped you\n&gt; from solving XOR?  For example, was it weight mutation parameters\n&gt; being too high/low, problems with the speciation setup, etc...?  I\n&gt; would like to compile people&#39;s experiences with this and put it in\n&gt; the FAQ since it seems to inevitably come up whenever someone tries\n&gt; to write their own version of NEAT, and it would be great if we\n&gt; could prevent people from having to go through the same trial and\n&gt; error process each time by having a record of the usual problems\n&gt; that came up.  Thanks very much, I appreciate any recollections :)\n&gt; \n&gt; (For those who don&#39;t remember what the problem was with their XOR,\n&gt; usually it was manifested as hitting a plateau level and not being\n&gt; able to get over it.  Then usually you fixed a few things and\n&gt; suddenly NEAT could easily cross the plateau.)\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n"}}
