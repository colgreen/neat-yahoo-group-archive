The problem is, the GPU executes double precision operations 8 tim=\r\nes slower than single precision.\n\nHow much will be the accuracy loss for la=\r\nrge networks if we switch NEAT to floats instead of doubles?\n\nNow, let&#39;s sa=\r\ny, i go for speed and use single precision. Then as evolution takes place, =\r\nnetworks are going to be deeper and deeper, the accuracy on the deepest lev=\r\nel will be lower and lower. Right? Or will the network evolve automatically=\r\n and correct itself adding _direct_ links from the input level to the deepe=\r\nst levels in order to refresh the lost precision??? That would be a workaro=\r\nund until Nvidia releases a true  GPU to the market.... what do you think?\n=\r\n\nThanks in advance for any comment.\n\n\n\n"}}
