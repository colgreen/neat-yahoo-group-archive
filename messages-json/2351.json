I reckon \nfunction regression fits the bill nicely here. In a past email I dreamt \nup a possible scheme that was based on the idea of NEAT trying to mimic \nthe outputs of something akin to an electric circuit, I still like the \nidea but it&#39;s probably overkill for what we want right now. I&#39;ve been \nexperimenting with regression of some simple functions such as \nsine/square waves, simple curves, lines and combinations of these \nshapes, much like the functions that Mattias uses in his function \nregression demo, in fact I took some ideas from that demo to get me \nstarted. From this it&#39;s apparent that functions with a single input and \noutput can be made to be as complex or as simple as we want, certainlly \ncomplex enought to challenge NEAT in its current forms.\n\nOk so I&#39;ve devised a function that is basically a few lines and curves \njoined together (perhaps I&#39;ll called it Frankenstein Function #1) which \nisn&#39;t rediculously complex but at that same time seems to be challenging \nenough to be used as a benchmark. Here is a url to an image of the \nfunction (the black line) and SharpNEAT&#39;s best attempt so far at finding \na fit (red line):\n\nhttp://tinypic.com/esudex.jpg\n\n From left to right the function is made up of, a couple of steps, a \nstraight rising line, a quarter of a sine wave, part of the curve an \nx^4, and finally part of the curve 1/x. Note that the red line isn&#39;t a \nvery good fit!\n\nCurently I&#39;m trying to minimize a root of the error since the error is \nalways less than 1.0. I haven&#39;t settled on which root yet, but if we can \nsettle on a precise fitness function then I think (hope) this might \nserve as the basis for cross implementation comparisons. Other variables \nare:\n\n- The sampling resolution, currently I&#39;m using 64 but we can probably \nreduce that by at least a half without effecting this particular test&#39;s \nusefulness.\n- The network topology. E.g. feedforward only?\n- Network activation. How many activations?\n\nThe last two points should probably not be a strict requirement for the \ntest since we are trying to find the best scheme, algorithm or whatever \nfor fitting the function. So if e.g. you were to find that relaxing a \nrecursive network gets a better score then that should stand as the best \nscore. Or if you have a completely new algorithm where the number of \nactivations is irrelevant then there are no issues comparing results.\n\nAny thoughts? The function was just born out of scribbles on a bit of \npaper so if anyone has any ideas for a better or more appropriate \nfunction then I&#39;m open to suggestions. Potentially Delphi NEAT and/or \nSLEAT might not have a problem with this function, so we might need \nsomething a bit more complex if Ian and/or Mattias were to find a good \nmatch.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
