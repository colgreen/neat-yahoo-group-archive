Will the same optimizations that allow\n&gt; that performance really hold after transferring it over?\n\nI can&#39;t say categorically that it would but from what I know there is\nno reason that it shouldn&#39;t. The performance is largely due to\nplatform agnsotic optimsations, e.g. using a hashtable in place of a\nloop searching for an item in a list, or keeping items (genes etc)\nsorted to speed up crossover, etc.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
