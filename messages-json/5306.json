I&#39;m managing =\r\nthe evaluations of the genomes outside of Neat entirely, and updating the f=\r\nitness explicitly after each evaluation cycle, before calling EvolutionAlgo=\r\nrithm::PerformOneGeneration. I&#39;m getting situations where I have species wi=\r\nth only one member, and the roulette selection returns no genome to use for=\r\n asexual reproduction, because the selection value is higher than the fitne=\r\nss of the single member.\n\nI&#39;ve been backtracking through the code, and I th=\r\nink I&#39;ve found where the problem arises: under EvolutionAlgorithm::PerformO=\r\nneGeneration, the fitness stats are only updated if species have been remov=\r\ned from the population.  If species haven&#39;t been removed, then offspring ar=\r\ne created /before/ the fitnesses are updated.  So, it&#39;s possible to have a =\r\nspecies that has been cut back to a single member, no other species are rem=\r\noved, and the EA tries to create offspring using the old species total fitn=\r\ness, which could be outside the bounds for the selection algorithm.  I imag=\r\nine this happens more often with larger sized species, but they are natural=\r\nly more robust as the probability distributions are wider.\n\nHas anyone else=\r\n faced this problem before, or is it something I&#39;m doing wrong?  \n\n\n"}}
