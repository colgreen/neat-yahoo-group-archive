The problem: There\n&gt; are too many opportunities, and too l=\r\nittle time. My work deals with\n&gt; massively parallel computer clusters, espe=\r\ncially using TWEANNs like\n&gt; HyperNEAT to configure compute fabrics for MPP.=\r\n I use tools like Azure and\n&gt; Eucalyptus for configuring these clusters for=\r\n private clouds, normally for\n&gt; collaborative scientific research. FWIS, I&#39;=\r\nm also the founder of the New\n&gt; Mexico Azure Users Group.\n&gt;\n&gt; We are at a p=\r\noint of discovery where we are learning about all this &quot;stuff&quot;\n&gt; all at onc=\r\ne, which is a little uncomfortable because most of the issues you\n&gt; raise a=\r\nre complex-coupled, and honestly not very well understood (at least\n&gt; by me=\r\n). It is possible to proceed too fast in identifying the fundamental\n&gt; conc=\r\nepts and make erroneous assumptions - like how one parallelizes\n&gt; HyperNEAT=\r\n experiments (either on traditional clusters, or hybrid,\n&gt; heterogeneous cl=\r\nusters that use GPUs as part of the compute fabric).  There\n&gt; have been sev=\r\neral times when I thought I understood this process, only to\n&gt; find I had t=\r\no explain the perplexing counter-examples. (I am currently using\n&gt; a third =\r\ncousin derivative of HyperNEAT trying to evolve consistent patterns\n&gt; that =\r\npoint to answers of parallelization on various topologies, as well as\n&gt; the=\r\n topology configuration itself.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the problem as I see it.  Most =\r\ndevelopers haven&#39;t learned the art of\n&gt; parallel programming to an adequate=\r\n level, yet.  The concepts of\n&gt; effectively, and efficiently unrolling task=\r\n loops and partitioning the data\n&gt; structures for genetically-inspired algo=\r\nrithms are complicated.  To do this\n&gt; right, I&#39;ve found this probably canno=\r\nt be hard-coded into the software to\n&gt; accommodate all experiments I run (t=\r\nhus, my use of TWEANNs to discover\n&gt; effective patterns). Since the compute=\r\n fabric and the experiment are closely\n&gt; coupled, this is currently just be=\r\nyond my grasp (hopefully a temporary\n&gt; situation).\n&gt;\n&gt; Others may have alre=\r\nady solved this problem - but I haven&#39;t seen it.
