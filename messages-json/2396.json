I always hate\n&gt;it when other people forget to do that. :S Oh well...\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I did search back immediately after posting and I did find\n&gt;your post on &quot;continuous speciation control&quot;, but, although your\n&gt;method looks promissing, your post did not answer The One Question:\n&gt;How well were the individuals spread out over your species? Your\n&gt;output shows that the number of species stays around your target of\n&gt;30, but it does not show the sizes of these species. Maybe half of\n&gt;your population was concentrated in single specie and all other\n&gt;species contained only 1 or 2 chromosomes? (That&#39;s the result I am\n&gt;getting using Stanley&#39;s method.) Would that even be a bad thing?\n\nI have this problem a lot and often 50% or more of individuals are in \nthe first species.  I think this is just a result of Ken&#39;s original \nmethodology of trying the species in order when assigning \nindividuals, but I forget now whether he said anything about how many \nindividuals were in each species.  Note that he did have periodic \ncomplete re-assignments of all individuals, so that would presumably \nbalance things a bit.\n\nI have been considering how to get a more even split, and I two working ideas:\n\n1) move away from presenting the individuals to species in a particular order\n\n2) move away from using similarity to assign species\n\nthe ideas behind the second of these are quite complex, and will have \nwait for another day.  For the first, I did already try assigning \neach individual to the closes matching species, rather than the first \nthat is close-enough.  But that had the effect of making it hard to \nreduce the number of species when it was too high.  This was because \nall existing species continued to receive some proportion of new \nindividuals, however wide the threshold is set.  This makes it hard \nto drive them to extinction.  Two points arise from this:\n\n1a) in the traditional scheme, reduction of species number tends to \nhappen by crow-baring all new individuals into the first few species, \nso that the last few go extinct.  This is not what I intuitively \nthought was happening and I&#39;m not sure I like it.\n1b) that was before I had continuous species control working, so my \ncurrent scheme might be able to show far more patience when it needs \nto reduce the species count.\n\nThe other plan for 1 is to add the individual to the first species \nthat matches when the species are presented in a random order.\n\nAnd the other other plan for 1 is to add the individual to the first \nspecies that matches and isn&#39;t full...\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
