It is de=\r\nfinitely worth the trip.  It is clear from Picbreeder that the more people =\r\nthat participate in a site like these, the more impressive the evolutionary=\r\n creations become.  It will certainly be interesting to see what kinds of 3=\r\nD objects evolve if enough people end up participating.  The idea of having=\r\n your evolutionary artifact printed in 3D and shipped is also a very novel =\r\nprospect!  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jeffclune@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to announce a website where you can in=\r\nteractively evolve 3D\n&gt; objects with CPPNs (the encoding for HyperNEAT):\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; http://www.EndlessForms.com &lt;http://www.EndlessForms.com&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Please tr=\r\ny the site out and publish the interesting objects that you\n&gt; discover. Doi=\r\nng so will help bolster the argument that CPPNs and other\n&gt; encodings based=\r\n on similar abstractions of developmental biology are a\n&gt; powerful way to e=\r\nncode phenotypes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been amazed by the sorts of images Picbreeder=\r\n produced, but when I\n&gt; show the images to biologists and other scientists =\r\na frequent response is\n&gt; that they&#39;re &quot;just&quot; two-dimensional pictures and t=\r\nhus don&#39;t show that CPPNs\n&gt; can produce interesting real-world (i.e. three-=\r\ndimensional) forms. I never\n&gt; felt that way, but it got me wondering whethe=\r\nr we could evolve equally\n&gt; compelling designs in three dimensions. To inve=\r\nstigate that issue, a team of\n&gt; us here at Cornell built EndlessForms.com, =\r\nwhich enables us as a community\n&gt; to explore the three-dimensional forms/ob=\r\njects/morphologies that CPPNs can\n&gt; produce. \n&gt; \n&gt; Evolving objects on the =\r\nsite is also an intuitive way to understand how\n&gt; mutation and crossover af=\r\nfect CPPN phenotypes.\n&gt; \n&gt; The site also demonstrates how 3D objects can be=\r\n automatically designed\n&gt; without a knowledge of 3D-CAD software. That&#39;s es=\r\npecially useful now that 3D\n&gt; printers are coming of age. We will soon add =\r\nthe ability to have any object\n&gt; on the site 3D-printed in a variety of mat=\r\nerials (e.g. silver, steel,\n&gt; ceramic, etc.) and shipped to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; As yo=\r\nu&#39;ll see, we are heavily inspired by Picbreeder and utilized many of\n&gt; its =\r\nsuccessful design choices. Thanks to the entire Picbreeder team for\n&gt; comin=\r\ng up with so many great ideas and sharing them. Special thanks to Ken\n&gt; Sta=\r\nnley and Jimmy Secretan for providing helpful suggestions for improving\n&gt; e=\r\narlier versions of EndlessForms. We are actively developing the site, so if=\r\n\n&gt; any of you have any feedback on how to improve it, please let me know.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Some of you may be interested in the technology behind the site. We uti=\r\nlize\n&gt; new web standards, such as WebGL, that enable the rendering of 3D ob=\r\njects.\n&gt; These technologies are brand new, so EndlessForms.com would not ha=\r\nve been\n&gt; technologically possible as recently as a year ago. EndlessForms.=\r\ncom is, to\n&gt; our knowledge, one of the first sites on the internet that uti=\r\nlizes WebGL in\n&gt; anything but a WebGL demo.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS. Please help generate t=\r\nraffic to the site by sharing it with your\n&gt; friends, posting it to Faceboo=\r\nk, etc. The goal is to really see what CPPNs\n&gt; can do by having as many peo=\r\nple exploring the design space as possible!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Postdoctoral Fellow\n&gt; Hod Lipson&#39;s Creative Machines Laboratory\n&gt; Cor=\r\nnell University\n&gt; jeffclune@... &lt;jeffclune@...&gt;\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
