I would like to\n&gt; try and implement NEAT=\r\n+Hawkins(On Intelligence) ideas on how the\n&gt; brain works.  This requires mo=\r\nre complex structures that allow, for\n&gt; instance, for recurrent connections=\r\n back to *input* nodes.  \n\nYes, outputs are inputs.  It&#39;s all a big loop.  =\r\nBut it&#39;s more than\njust that...  When the &#39;expected&#39; input (which is an out=\r\nput of an\n&#39;expectation&#39; circuit) doesn&#39;t match the input, you get one resul=\r\nt. \nWhen it does, you get another.  But that kind of thing is VERY\ndifferen=\r\nt than NEAT.\n\nI also propose that the pathway that is taken for a signal as=\r\n it\npasses through the brain has some kind of mathematical resemblance to\nt=\r\nhe actual signal, so that there is legitimacy and relevance to the\nkinds of=\r\n interactions that the signals make as they play off of each\nother in the b=\r\nrain.  Does that statement make sense?\n\n&gt; there is also a strong temporal a=\r\nspect to this according to\n&gt; hawkins.  incorporating both the feedback and =\r\ntemporal aspects into\n&gt; a net raises the level of complexity quite a bit.  =\r\nHawkins team has\n&gt; implemented a fixed structure hierarchy that is not real=\r\nly a NN.  It\n&gt; uses bayesian probabilities throughout the feedback mechanis=\r\nm.\n&gt; Their early tests show some real promise in invariant visual\n&gt; recogni=\r\ntion...but I feel their structure is too constrained and\n&gt; would like to se=\r\ne if NEAT can be applied with his concepts\n&gt; incorporated.  It may not work=\r\n or may be too complex...I dunno...\n\nI don&#39;t think NEAT is what you want.  =\r\nI think you want a dynamic\nnetwork that grows during the life of the organi=\r\nsm.  Which means you\nneed a set of rules governing that growth.  Evolution =\r\nmight best be\napplied to those rules, rather than to the structure itself.\n=\r\n\nAlso, for something like that, you want to use a mechanism like is\nused fo=\r\nr cellular automatons for optimizing the firing so you don&#39;t\ncalculate EVER=\r\nY neuron for EVERY timestep.\n\n&gt; I am running a software company, so I have =\r\nlimited time to theorize\n&gt; on this, which I would rather be doing!  But I h=\r\nave to pay the bills\n&gt; somehow ;)\n\nNo joke.  :(  Oh to be independently wea=\r\nlthy!\n\n"}}
