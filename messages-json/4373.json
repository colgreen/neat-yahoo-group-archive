I think Kenneth De Jong&#39;s textbook, &quot;Evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; Computation: A =\r\nUnified Perspective&quot; examines it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, of course as people hav=\r\ne pointed out in NEAT it&#39;s not \njust a\n&gt; &gt; question of a healthy population=\r\n but of healthy species, since \neach\n&gt; &gt; species is like its own little pop=\r\nulation.  In other words, the\n&gt; &gt; species need enough internal diversity to=\r\n drive their own\n&gt; &gt; explorations.  My own rule of thumb has been a minimum=\r\n of 15 \nmembers\n&gt; &gt; per species (on average) to keep them healthy.  I&#39;m sur=\r\ne 30 is \neven\n&gt; &gt; safer.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another thing to note is that the popul=\r\nation size you need can \nvary\n&gt; &gt; wildly by problem and it can be surprisin=\r\ng.  For pole balancing, \nit\n&gt; &gt; turns out that you can solve it fastest wit=\r\nh a minuscule \npopulation of\n&gt; &gt; size under 20 total (that&#39;s for the whole =\r\npopulation!).   That is\n&gt; &gt; because smaller populations are greedier (they =\r\nconcentrate \nresources\n&gt; &gt; on a small part of the search space) and apparen=\r\ntly pole balancing\n&gt; &gt; benefits greatly from greedy search.  However, that =\r\nis a specific\n&gt; &gt; property of pole balancing and I would not expect it to c=\r\narry over \nto\n&gt; &gt; more significant domains.  Surely in some domains having =\r\na \npopulation\n&gt; &gt; over 1000 would lead to the most interesting results, if =\r\nonly you \ncan\n&gt; &gt; afford the luxury of the added computational cost of a la=\r\nrge \npopulation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Cl=\r\nune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; That&#39;s funny.
