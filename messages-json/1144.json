Consider that if everyone in the world suddenly \nbecame deaf, we would not be any less intelligent, or any less \nstrategically sophisticated.  Similarly, no one would suggest that \nsomeone who can&#39;t move is somehow less sophisticated than anyone \nelse, although they may have fewer &quot;outputs&quot;.   So it really isn&#39;t \nabout how many inputs or outputs something has, but rather it is \nmore about the richness of the domain.  (Of course, at the extreme \nlow end, e.g. just one output, it can have a direct limiting effect)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; that make sense. does the level of strategy have to do with the \n&gt; number of inputs and outputs (ie does more inputs and outputs \nimply \n&gt; greater strategy)? also, how do you know when they agents have \nmaxed \n&gt; out the strategy of the environment?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Timmy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A big problem with setting up an experiment like that is that \nthe \n&gt; &gt; domain has to be sufficiently complex to support extremely \ncomplex \n&gt; &gt; strategies that continue to improve for millions of \ngenerations.  \n&gt; In \n&gt; &gt; Robot Duel, for example, there is only so good you can get, and \n&gt; &gt; after that the domain can&#39;t support anything more interesting \n&gt; &gt; because the game has been mastered as much as possible.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We know games like Go support a very wide range of complexity, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; in a game like that the problem is that stagnation is likely to \nset \n&gt; &gt; in as search finds certain strategic plateaus that are hard to \nget \n&gt; &gt; out of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, it is possible that stagnation we observe in 1,000 \n&gt; &gt; generation runs isn&#39;t actually stagnation when viewed from the \n&gt; &gt; vantage point of millions of generations, but who knows?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is a well-recognized and interesting challenge:  Design a \n&gt; &gt; domain, maybe a robot domain like robot duel, where there is \nroom \n&gt; &gt; for virtually *unlimited* ever-increasing complexity.  It turns \nout \n&gt; &gt; this is very hard to do, and most domains turn out to have a \nlimit \n&gt; &gt; to how much intelligence can help after a certain point.  Such \n&gt; &gt; domains are called &quot;open-ended,&quot; and designing them to be truly \n&gt; open-\n&gt; &gt; ended is perhaps as hard as AI itself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hey,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has anyone created a simulation of considerable complexity \nlike \n&gt; &gt; ken&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; robot dual domain and let it run for very long period of time \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; million generations to see what kind of strategies evolve? i \nwas \n&gt; &gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kinda curious to know how far competative co evolution could \ngo. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; timmy\n\n\n"}}
