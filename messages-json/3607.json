I believe that the creators of cmake are\n&gt; working on a script which is comprehensive enough to work on all systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the meantime, here is what you can do:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Get the boost library (either by building yourself or using a binary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Find out what library name the boost threading examples use.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) edit the CMakelists.txt inside the Hypercube_NEAT directory and in\n&gt; the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(...) section, replace the boost thread\n&gt; library name with the appropriate name.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Has anyone been able to build HyperNEAT on OS X Tiger (10.4.1,\n&gt;&gt; specifically)?
