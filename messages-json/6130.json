Whether novel=\r\nty search is performed generationally or in a steady-state algorithm, I thi=\r\nnk that taking the population into account in some way or another when calc=\r\nulating the novelty of new individuals can often be very helpful.\n\nIn parti=\r\ncular, the motivation for measuring novelty against the current population =\r\nas well as the archive is to take all available information into account. W=\r\nhile it is true that the archive alone provides some information about wher=\r\ne in the space of behaviors has *previously* been searched, the population =\r\ngives additional information about where is *currently* being searched.\n\nIn=\r\n other words, it is likely desirable to have the population itself spread o=\r\nver the space of previously unexplored behaviors. If only the archive is ta=\r\nken into account, it is possible that the population itself may converge to=\r\n searching one novel area of the behavior space (where there are few archiv=\r\ne points), which could potentially lead down blind alleys. When the populat=\r\nion is taken into account there is some repulsive force within the populati=\r\non to maintain diversity and explore different novel areas of the behavior =\r\nspace -- which may in general benefit exploring the overall search for nove=\r\nlty.\n\nThat said, the simpler algorithm you suggest is interesting. It seems=\r\n a bit more greedy in nature and may work well sometimes in practice. One s=\r\nlightly strange thing about it is that the evaluation order of individuals =\r\nwithin a generation may matter; that is, the novelty of an individual evalu=\r\nated later in the population may be affected by archive additions earlier. =\r\nI am not sure if that is bad or good. \n\nIn a generational novelty search in=\r\n particular, it may be wise to reduce selection pressure or increase the nu=\r\nmber of nearest neighbors considered in calculated novelty. The reason is t=\r\nhat unlike in the steady state variation, where the novelty of an individua=\r\nl will smoothly vary over time (as individuals are replaced individually), =\r\nin a generational model, the novelty of an individual can change abruptly o=\r\nver generations (what is novel one generation may not be novel even the nex=\r\nt generation). To provide a smoother gradient, it may thus be important to =\r\nreduce novelty pressure (e.g. by decreasing the greediness of the search th=\r\nrough the survival threshold or however you are applying pressure, or by in=\r\ncreasing the size of the neighborhood considered for calculating novelty, w=\r\nhich may also smooth novelty calculations).\n\nI hope you find this response =\r\ninformative, while novelty search is viable whether it is generational or s=\r\nteady-state, there are some factors that may increase its performance when =\r\nspecializing the algorithm to generational or steady-state evolutionary alg=\r\norithms in particular.\n\nBest,\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Col=\r\neman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question about i=\r\nmplementing novelty search in a generational GA.\n&gt; In &quot;Abandoning Objective=\r\ns: Evolution through the\n&gt; Search for Novelty Alone&quot; (Lehman and Stanley, 2=\r\n011, pg 13), it suggests\n&gt; that it&#39;s necessary (or at least a good idea) to=\r\n determine the novelty of\n&gt; an individual against the archive and the (enti=\r\nre) current population.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering why this is better than the foll=\r\nowing approach:\n&gt; for (individual I in population)\n&gt;   N =3D novelty of I m=\r\neasured against archive\n&gt;   if (N &gt; threshold)\n&gt;     add I to archive\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThat is, if you iterate through the population, adding individuals to the\n&gt;=\r\n archive as you go, then is this equivalent (or a reasonable approximation)=\r\n\n&gt; to checking each individual against the entire population and the archiv=\r\ne?\n&gt; If not, why not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ch=\r\neers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; \n&gt; T: 0421 972 953 | E: oliver.coleman@... | W: http://ojc=\r\noleman.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
