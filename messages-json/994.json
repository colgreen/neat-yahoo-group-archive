To win the contest, you must\nsubmit the neural wiring for the ants in your\ncolony---a text file containing code for a simple,\nfinite state machine that is run by all of your ants.\nIn principle, your entry can be written by hand, but\nfor complex behaviors you will probably find it useful\nto write tools that generate ant code in some way. You\nmay use any programming language you like for this\npurpose.\n\nYour ants will compete in a tournament with all the\nants submitted by other teams. In each match, two\nspecies of ants are placed in a random world\ncontaining two anthills, some food sources, and\nseveral obstacles. They must explore the world, find\nfood and bring it back to their anthill. Ants can\ncommunicate or leave trails by means of chemical\nmarkers. Each species of ants can sense (with limited\ncapabilities), but not modify, the markers of the\nother species. Ants can also attack the ants of the\nother species by surrounding them. Ants that die as a\nresult of an attack become food. The match is won by\nthe species with the most food in its anthill at the\nend of 100,000 rounds. The overall winner is the ant\nthat wins the most matches.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo!
