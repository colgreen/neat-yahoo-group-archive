I&#39;ve been thinking about this issue for a couple years =\r\n\nso it will be good to get some of it down.  Please be warned this is \na lo=\r\nng argument, but hopefully you will find it interesting enough to \nbe worth=\r\n your time.\n\nFirst, let me make sure the terms are straight.  I&#39;m comparing=\r\n \ninteractive evolutionary computation (IEC), which means evolution \nwith a=\r\n human (or &quot;breeder&quot;) in the loop, to regular evolutionary \ncomputation, wh=\r\nich means evolution with respect to a given fitness \nfunction.  I have begu=\r\nn to call the latter (at least to \nmyself) &quot;target-based evolution&quot; (TBE) b=\r\necause the fitness function \nin effect describes a target that a human desi=\r\ngner is hoping to \nreach, so I will use that term here.  \n\nNote that neithe=\r\nr IEC nor TBE are really &quot;natural&quot; in the sense that \nnatural evolution nei=\r\nther involved a sentient breeder overseeing the \nprocess nor did it involve=\r\n a predesignated target based on which each \norganism is always evaluated. =\r\n The question then is which one is more \nnatural than the other, since neit=\r\nher one is truly natural.\n\nTo get some perspective on this question, let&#39;s =\r\nconsider the simple \ntask that Colin proposed:  Imagine that we set a parti=\r\ncular desired \nimage as a target and evaluate against that.  Could we then =\r\nevolve a \nCPPN (or ANN if you prefer) that produces the desired image?\n\nThe=\r\n answer is surprising (we&#39;ve tried it!).  It turns out to be very \nhard wit=\r\nh anything but the simplest of images.  What you discover \nquickly is that =\r\nthe fitness function isn&#39;t rewarding the right \nthings.  The images tends t=\r\no devolve into a gray cloud that minimizes \nerror by choosing an intermedia=\r\nte shade- not what you want at all.  \n\nYet the issue is deeper than that.  =\r\nIn fact, here is what is really \ninteresting: If you take any image (except=\r\n the simplest ones) on \nPicbreeder- images that were evolved through IEC wi=\r\nth NEAT- you will \nnot be able to evolve to those same images through TBE w=\r\nith NEAT!  I \nchallenge anyone to disprove me on this; I&#39;d be very interest=\r\ned.\n\nThat is a remarkable observation: NEAT can&#39;t reproduce it&#39;s own \nresul=\r\nts!  The only conclusion is that the selection method is the \nculprit.  Tha=\r\nt is, it has to do with how you decide what&#39;s good in \nany particular gener=\r\nation, which of course is different in IEC and \nTBE.\n\nSo let&#39;s look more cl=\r\nosely at this issue:  How did we evolve images \ninteractively that could no=\r\nt be reached through regular TBE?  The \nanswer is that humans have a differ=\r\nent way of rewarding intermediate \nresults.  In particular, human breeders =\r\nin IEC examine what is good \n*in the present* and make their decision based=\r\n on that whereas TBE \ncompares what you have in the present to a long-term =\r\nfuture goal.\n\nPerhaps if you&#39;ve used Picbreeder or IEC you may think that y=\r\nou were \nactually evolving to a target and thus that I am wrong.  But \nPicb=\r\nreeder disproves this view.  As soon as *someone else* branches \nfrom your =\r\nimage, whatever &quot;target&quot; you may have had in mind (if any) \nis irrelevant. =\r\n They have their own ideas about what is good.  So it \nisn&#39;t possible that =\r\nwhat the next person in the chain evolved was \nyour original intent.\n\nOn th=\r\ne other hand I may not need to go that far to make the point \nbecause if yo=\r\nu&#39;re like me, you kind of discover what&#39;s cool as you \ngo.  I may have a va=\r\ngue idea in mind, but on the road to that idea I \nsee that something cool I=\r\n hadn&#39;t thought of before pops up, so I go \noff in that direction instead. =\r\n What matters most is what&#39;s good in \nthe present.\n\nNow here is the connect=\r\nion to natural evolution:  Natural evolution \nis also completely unconcerne=\r\nd with ultimate goals or targets.  It \nonly concerns itself with whether th=\r\ne present candidates are good in \nthe present.  \n\nI am going to argue that =\r\nthat is a major source of its power; it \nexplains in part its prolific crea=\r\ntivity and its astounding ability \nto elaborate indefinitely.  Yes, I am cl=\r\naiming that it can do all \nthat because it *doesn&#39;t* have a target.\n\nSo the=\r\nn what&#39;s so great about not having a target?  What&#39;s great is \nthat you get=\r\n rewarded for doing what you *can* do.  And a good \nencoding can do a lot. =\r\n However, what&#39;s very difficult, even for a \ngood encoding, is to do a comp=\r\nletely arbitrary complex thing that is \nnowhere close to the current popula=\r\ntion in the search space.\n\nThat is why I called TBE a liability:  It evalua=\r\ntes the current \ncandidates against something that ignores their current st=\r\nrengths \ncompletely.  For example, imagine if the first bilateria (bilatera=\r\nlly-\nsymmetric organisms) were evaluated for their humanity.  They would \na=\r\nll fail miserably and they would all therefore be eliminated.  \nHumanity wo=\r\nuld never have evolved even though we in fact did evolve \nfrom the first bi=\r\nlateria!  If TBE were in charge and humans were the \ngoal, we wouldn&#39;t exis=\r\nt right now.  \n\nTry going back even farther.  Can you imagine evaluating si=\r\nngle \ncelled organisms for their &quot;human-ness?&quot;  That would be silly.\n\nYet t=\r\nhat is exactly what we are doing in most evolutionary \nexperiments.  We do =\r\nnothing to capture good intermediate ideas from \nwhich it would be possible=\r\n to build our ultimate objectives.  So we \nare hampered from getting anywhe=\r\nre truly interesting.\n\nThen you might ask, that&#39;s all well and good, but ho=\r\nw in the world \ncan we reward the intermediate serendipitous discoveries if=\r\n we don&#39;t \nknow what they should be?  The  answer is: Respect the fact that=\r\n you \ndon&#39;t know what they are.  Stop trying to *tell* evolution what it \nc=\r\nan do and let it *show* you what it can do.  When it shows you \nsomething c=\r\nool, then keep that for later.  Keep everything with any \npromise for later=\r\n.  You never know what might be a foundation for the \nnext level up.\n\nThat&#39;=\r\ns exactly what natural evolution did and that&#39;s exactly what IEC \n(Picbreed=\r\ner variety) does:  In nature what happened was that there \nwere many ways o=\r\nf doing a good job (at surviving) and there was room \nenough on Earth to su=\r\npport a lot of them at once.  Nobody &quot;knew&quot; \nwhich ones would form a good f=\r\noundation for something more complex \n(and many lineages didn&#39;t go anywhere=\r\n), but because a lot of cool \nideas were able to hang around, some of them =\r\nhappened to be good \nstepping stones to the next big thing.  The issue was =\r\nwhere the DNA \nencoding could go next from where it is now.\n\nSame with IEC =\r\nin Picbreeder:  We don&#39;t know what we want to evolve \ncollectively.  I thin=\r\nk it&#39;s fair to say that we have no collective \ncommon goal at all.  We are =\r\nall just trying different paths.  Some of \nus, when we see a cool path, tak=\r\ne that path a bit farther and a bit \nfarther still.  We keep all the interm=\r\nediate stages around forever \nand we therefore preserve all possible steppi=\r\nng stones.  Some happen \nto be genuinely good foundations for future progre=\r\nss, like those that \nproduced the car, or the recent skull.  Yet who would =\r\nhave seen that \ncoming?  If we had tried to evolve to them from the start, =\r\nwe&#39;d be \nnowhere (we&#39;d be in the usual TBE trap).\n\nFor this reason, what&#39;s =\r\ngoing on in Picbreeder is really intriguing. \nIt&#39;s the first artificial evo=\r\nlutionary experiment that is really \ndoing something like natural evolution=\r\n!  We may have some amazing \nencodings out there, but we don&#39;t get to see i=\r\nt because all we do is \nTBE, where we keep losing the intermediate foundati=\r\nons we would need \nto get to a new level.  Picbreeder is the first time tha=\r\nt we let \nevolution show us what it can do instead of telling it what we wa=\r\nnt \nit to do.  We are respecting the encoding just as nature respected \nDNA=\r\n.\n\nThere are some important corollaries: First, TBE is not just about \nimag=\r\nes.  In effect, all regular fitness functions have the same TBE \nliability.=\r\n  Do you think you can evolve an amazing neural network \nwith NEAT or with =\r\nHyperNEAT?  Or something else?  Well, if you have a \ntarget behavior that y=\r\nou evaluate against, you are never going to \nknow how amazing things could =\r\nbe.  This is a sobering realization.  \nBut it&#39;s just as true with behaviors=\r\n as it is with images.  (This \ninsight suggests that evolving behaviors int=\r\neractively instead of \nthrough a fitness function is a really promising pat=\r\nh)\n\nOne exception is competitive coevolution, wherein individuals \nactually=\r\n are evaluated against other individuals, so it&#39;s not really \ntarget-based.=\r\n  In a sense individuals are recognized for being as \ngood as they can be i=\r\nn the present.  Of course, nature is a kind of \ncoevolution.\n\nYet I don&#39;t w=\r\nant to pretend that competitive coevolution is the \nperfect pathway to comp=\r\nlexity because the task may be defined in such \na way that it might as well=\r\n be necessary to solve some gigantic \nproblem to become good.  For example,=\r\n competitive coevolution on Go \nmay not really end up rewarding individuals=\r\n for finding really basic \nregularities that are necessary to eventually ev=\r\nolving a good Go \nplayer.\n\nThe key to natural evolution was that there were=\r\n a lot of easy ways \nto do well in the beginning.  So we got a diversity of=\r\n viable jumping \noff points.  That is also true on Picbreeder:  You can eas=\r\nily get a \npicture that&#39;s good enough to be worth showing others.  So it&#39;s =\r\ngot a \nvery natural property: It proliferates jumping-off points too.\n\nIf y=\r\nou like, you can think of Picbreeder as an ecology where the \nenvironment i=\r\ns just the preferences of its myriad users.  The \nenvironment in nature is =\r\njust Earth and physics.  These are quite \ndifferent environments, but their=\r\n effect on the dynamics of selection \nform an analogy.  So at that level, i=\r\nt doesn&#39;t matter if a human is \nin the loop or not.  What humans like is ju=\r\nst the environment.  And \nthe nice things is, humans are very sensitive to =\r\nregularity and \norganization at all levels: exactly what a good environment=\r\n should \nreward if we want to build up.\n\nI don&#39;t know where Picbreeder will=\r\n go because part of it depends on \nhow many users we get and how much they =\r\npersevere.  So it may never \nproduce great works of art; I&#39;d be surprised i=\r\nf it did.  Yet it has \nthese intriguing ingredients that we have not had be=\r\nfore, so it is a \nmuch more significant experiment than just a bunch of peo=\r\nple playing \nwith an art toy.\n\nHopefully this endless message answers the q=\r\nuestion with some extra \nfood for thought to boot.  I know there are a lot =\r\nof controversial \nideas here and please forgive me for not reminding you as=\r\n I went that \nmany such claims were merely speculation: I realize that they=\r\n are, \nbut if I acknowledged that every time I speculated this near-novel \n=\r\nwould be twice as long!  You can be sure that I am not trying to \npresent t=\r\nhese ideas as settled facts by any means.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course the rea=\r\nson it was possible is because humans are doing \nthe\n&gt; &gt; evaluation- which =\r\nyields another lesson: The fitness function in \nmost\n&gt; &gt; evolutionary compu=\r\ntation is a liability against getting to high-\nlevel\n&gt; &gt; complexity. There =\r\nare deep reasons that human evaluation is \nactually\n&gt; &gt; more analogous to w=\r\nhat happened over natural evolution than any \nother\n&gt; &gt; type of evaluation =\r\nscheme we run on computers. We are often misled\n&gt; &gt; into believing that int=\r\neractive evolution is less &quot;natural&quot; than\n&gt; &gt; normal EC. Actually, the oppo=\r\nsite is true.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like Jeff, I&#39;d be interested in hearing you expand your =\r\nthoughts on \nthis.  I\n&gt; think the demonstration is no less impressive, but =\r\nit seems to me \nthat the\n&gt; distinction between natural and artificial selec=\r\ntion is an important\n&gt; conceptual one.  Natural selection is based on the a=\r\nttributes of the\n&gt; environment, while artificial selection is the result of=\r\n attributes \nselected\n&gt; by an agent (akin to animal breeding or horticultur=\r\ne).  In fact, in \nThe\n&gt; Origin of Species, Darwin used many many examples o=\r\nf rapid \nevolutionary\n&gt; change in domesticated species such as pigeons and =\r\ndogs to bolster \nhis\n&gt; argument for his theory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe you&#39;re taking is=\r\nsue with the terms &quot;natural&quot; \nand &quot;artificial&quot;, and\n&gt; maybe there are bette=\r\nr ways to make the distinction (&quot;agent-\ndirected&quot; vs.\n&gt; &quot;environment-direct=\r\ned&quot;, &quot;conscious&quot; vs. &quot;unconscious&quot; evolution...I \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; know).  But while=\r\n I don&#39;t think artificial selection is any less \neffective\n&gt; or powerful, p=\r\nrobably moreso in some cases, I think it&#39;s useful to \nmaintain\n&gt; that disti=\r\nnction.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
