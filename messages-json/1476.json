You&#39;ll need the free Flash\nplayer to view it.  The quality is pretty grainy.  The actual images\naren&#39;t that noisy.\n\nWhat you&#39;re seeing is the champion network from 800 generations,\nlooking at &quot;A&quot; and other letters of the alphabet.  Each image is\nrandomly rotated slightly, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and\nthe letter position is also randomly transformed.\n\nThe eye has a resolution of 7x7 pixels, and can move horizontally and\nvertically, as well as being able to zoom in or out and rotate cw or\nccw each time step.  We calculate the number of steps that a given\nnetwork gets to look at the canvas based on its size.  This network\nhas 68 steps to view each image.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting to note that the eye invariably zooms in on the upper\nleft portion of the symbol, presumably because this area is unique to\nthe letter &quot;A&quot;.  &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; have similar peaks, but with smaller\nangles.\n\nAnyway, we&#39;re continuing to experiment...just thought we&#39;d share some\ninteresting results.  Let us know your thoughts.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
