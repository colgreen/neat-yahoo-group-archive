I replaced \nNEAT&#39;s speciation mechanism with a genotypic diversity metric computed \nas the distance to the k-nearest neighbors calculated using NEAT&#39;s \ngenomic distance measure.  This seemed to work well enough.  Though, as \nStephane mentioned, based on his and Jean-Baptiste&#39;s work it is quite \nlikely that using a behavioral diversity metric would be even more \neffective. However, in some domains it is not clear how behavioral \ndistance should be characterized.\n\nKen/Joel, I do have a question for you:  In my NSGA-II / CPPN-NEAT \nhybrid I did not use any crossover and just relied on asexual \nreproduction.  Did  you incorporate sexual reproduction in your \nimplementation?  If so, how did you determine which individuals were \nallowed to mate if speciation was not employed?\n\nBest,\nJosh\n\n\n\n\nOn 06/13/2013 10:37 PM, Oliver Coleman wrote:\n&gt; &quot;Effective Diversity Maintenance in Deceptive Domains&quot; (J.
