I am a lurker and intend =\r\non using NEAT in the future.  For now, I am using simple feedforward networ=\r\nks making an evaluation of a board state with a ply management system.  I a=\r\nm replicating the experiments in the book Blondie24 by David Fogel.  I have=\r\n developed a framework for playing &quot;generic&quot; perfect information non-random=\r\n two player games.  My first implementation is obviously checkers.  My goal=\r\n implemetation is Go.\n\nMy gut feel on your assertion is that I agree.  I se=\r\nnse that min/max (or some specialization of it like Alpha/Beta) will likely=\r\n be present in more complex game playing ANNs.  It seems it would take an e=\r\nnormous amount of searching in a game space for a GA to have an ANN of any =\r\ntype converge to the min/max mechanism regardless of the ANN meta-architect=\r\nure approach.  In fact, it seems more likely for an ANN using GA to attempt=\r\n to use the pattern recognition approach many times before stumbling on a r=\r\nudimentary version of min/max (it would require recurrent connections in th=\r\ne ANN and in unique combinations).\n\nHowever, I do think that it is possible=\r\n for ANNs to suggest moves at which to take a deeper look.  For example, in=\r\n the domain of Go, there are way too many possible moves for even a full pl=\r\ny search of depth 2 to yield any level of effectiveness.  The breadth of av=\r\nailable &quot;legal&quot; moves in Go starts at 361 and stays above 100 for almost th=\r\ne entire game.  Worse, thanks to captures and Ko, the number of legal moves=\r\n is not guaranteed to descend.\n\nAs such, some sort of mechanism to priortiz=\r\ne looking at some subset of &quot;legal&quot; moves is essential (if you are familiar=\r\n with Go, you could refer to the patterns described in &quot;Go Proverbs&quot;).  I s=\r\nuspect an ANN that specializes in small regional patterns will likely be ab=\r\nle to be evolved that reduces the &quot;legal&quot; move set substantially.  Even the=\r\nn, it would need to reduce it to less than 3% FOR EACH PLY DEPTH to make a =\r\nply search depth of 6 or 8 even reasonable computationally.  That is one he=\r\nll of an efficiency, +97% *accurate* reduction in legal moves.\n\nAt the pres=\r\nent time, I am sort of seeing an ANN sandwich; ANN #1 takes a set of all le=\r\ngal moves and prioritizes them.  A ply manager then recursively calls ANN #=\r\n1 until it reaches a certain depth.  Then the ply manager presents the resu=\r\nltant board state to ANN #2 for a full board evaluation.  This cycle contin=\r\nues until a move is deemed most effective and then utilized.\n\nThe way in wh=\r\nich ANN #1 evolves (mutation and/or feedback on a fixed topology, direct en=\r\ncoding using NEAT, indirect encoding using many different types of topologi=\r\ncal techniques including NEAT) can be completely different from the way in =\r\nwhich ANN #2 evolves.  This produces a meta-GA GA approach; a GA for discov=\r\nering the ideal GA techinique for each of the two ANNs.  As you can imagine=\r\n, we now have a HUGE computational space.  And this assumes two ANNs and so=\r\nme form of the min-max algorithm.  And there are other &quot;techniques&quot; for cap=\r\nturing static patterns in a pattern matching DB that might be more efficien=\r\nt in the long run.\n\nAnyway, using Go as the goal and realizing the amount o=\r\nf computational power required to advance on the Go goal with GA techniques=\r\n has me thinking of all sorts of ways to develop &quot;static&quot; structures as qui=\r\nckly as possible to minimize the amount of things the ANNs must evolve to s=\r\ntructure and (re)solve.  Hence, my general agreement .  :^)\n\n\nJim O&#39;Flahert=\r\ny\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Mitchell Timin \n  To: neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2003 8:45 PM\n  Subject: [neat] =\r\nboard games\n\n\n  I&#39;ve been playing connect 4 here:\n  http://www.checkers.ws/=\r\nboard_games/connect_four_games/connect_four/connect_four.htm\n\n  I had not k=\r\nnown this game before.
