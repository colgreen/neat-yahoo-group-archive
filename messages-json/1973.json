In general, US Ph.D. programs \nprovide=\r\n financial support to their students thoughout the process.  \nThe support u=\r\nsually comes from a TAship, RAship, or some kind of \nfellowship.  Usually y=\r\nou might start out as a TA and later be hired \nas an RA by your advisor.  S=\r\nupport generally includes tuition and \nfees in addition to normal salary.  =\r\nI was told when I was applying \nto grad schools that if a Ph.D. program acc=\r\nepts you without any \nassurance of support, they probably don&#39;t really want=\r\n you.\n\nYou definitely do not need a Masters degree of any type in order to =\r\n\nstart a Ph.D. in the US, although sometimes a Masters might help you \nget =\r\nin if it improved your credentials in terms of demonstrating \nresearch prom=\r\nise.  But I enrolled directly from undergrad without a \nMasters.  It&#39;s impo=\r\nrtant to note though that a lot of people acquire \na Masters in the course =\r\nof their Ph.D. as a kind of safety net in \ncase things don&#39;t work out.  In =\r\ngeneral, it&#39;s very little extra work \nto get a Masters along the way since =\r\nit overlaps with your Ph.D.  \n\nUS Universities you might consider are prett=\r\ny obvious:  University \nof Texas at Austin is the leading place for this ki=\r\nnd of research in \nthe country at this time.  University of Central Florida=\r\n will \nhopefully soon be a significant place as well after I join their \nfa=\r\nculty and build up a group.  I am hoping to focus on exactly the \nissues yo=\r\nu identified as interesting.  UCF also has the nice \nsituation that it also=\r\n has an evolutionary computation person (Annie \nWu) and a neural net person=\r\n (Michael Georgiopoulos).  The DEMO group \nat Brandeis University, headed b=\r\ny Jordan Pollack, has also produced \na lot of good work (http://www.demo.cs=\r\n.brandeis.edu/) in the area.  \n\nOther people on the group may have other su=\r\nggestions.  I know Derek \nJames recently got into a Cognitive Science progr=\r\nam in Louisiana \nthat will allow him to puruse neuroevolution research.   A=\r\n number of \npeople in this group have sought or are seeking graduate educat=\r\nion \nin this area.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gerbopel&quot; &lt;redcrocod=\r\nile@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I got quite a few things to t=\r\nalk about, so I&#39;ll get right to \nit:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) First of all, a BIG thanks to=\r\n everyone for their input on my\n&gt; Honours Project.  It went very well indee=\r\nd and I&#39;ve put it online \nnow\n&gt; so anyone who is interested can check it ou=\r\nt at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.redcrocodile.net/source/\n&gt; \n&gt; Any feedback would be g=\r\nreatly appreciated, but don&#39;t forget that \nI&#39;m\n&gt; still relatively new to th=\r\ne field of NE :)\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Right, so after this last 3 months of work (and ~=\r\n6 months of\n&gt; research) I am seriously thinking about continuing on studyin=\r\ng\n&gt; computational neuroscience and the many topics that Ken and his\n&gt; colle=\r\nagues have been working on: intelligent systems, NE, AE, \nplastic\n&gt; synapse=\r\ns, and modular NN design along with heterogeneous NN designs\n&gt; such as gas =\r\nnets (which I know very little about at the moment).  \nThe\n&gt; work/research =\r\nthat I would do would be applied to autonomous agents\n&gt; using environments/=\r\nscenarios from video games as testbeds.  The \nentire\n&gt; field fascinates me =\r\nand has done so for a significant amount of \ntime.\n&gt;  The reasons behind su=\r\nch contemplations are numerous and well \nthought\n&gt; out, but I won&#39;t dwell o=\r\nn them any further for the moment.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, now that I have a BSc (Hons) in=\r\n Computer Games Technology, my\n&gt; question to the group is where I should go=\r\n from here.  If I \ncontinue\n&gt; with education, the goal at the end of the jo=\r\nurney will be a PhD.  \nNo\n&gt; doubt about it.  I read Julian&#39;s post about the=\r\n University of \nSussex\n&gt; and that appears to be a MARVELOUS institute for s=\r\nuch studies, but \nI\n&gt; am curious to know if anyone else has any recommendat=\r\nions.  Quick\n&gt; info: Canadian student willing to study anywhere (on a reaso=\r\nnable\n&gt; budget).  Additionally, I should be receiving a first class degree\n=\r\n&gt; (knock on wood).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) I am unsure as to whether or not it is necessar=\r\ny to get an MSc\n&gt; before getting a PhD.  I am 27 now (took several years of=\r\nf to work\n&gt; before going to University) and would rather not spend a year \n=\r\ndoing an\n&gt; MSc if it is not necessary.  Then again, I know very little abou=\r\nt \nthis\n&gt; issue.  What are people&#39;s opinions about this?\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) I am not =\r\nrich.  Any universities that offer the potential for \npaid\n&gt; discussion/ass=\r\nistant positions while studying are going to have to \nbe\n&gt; tops on my list.=\r\n  Is this something that I might expect from\n&gt; Universities or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ag=\r\nain, I am very na=EFve when it comes to post graduate studies so \nany\n&gt; inf=\r\normation that anyone may offer would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks so=\r\n much for all your help so far and I look forward to \nreading\n&gt; your respon=\r\nses to this post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Michael Frayn\n\n\n\n"}}
