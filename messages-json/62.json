I completed my BS in\n&gt; Computer Systems \n&gt; Engineering from GIK Institute, Pakistan this May.\n\nWelcome to the group, Umer.  Your experiment sounds\nquite interesting.\n\n&gt; We made environments with obstacles and lights and\n&gt; many robots (going \n&gt; from 2 to hundreds). The robots had simple IR\n&gt; transmitters and \n&gt; receivers, bump sensors, light detectors. \n\nSo what was the body design of your robots?  Were they\nentirely simulated, or were you emulating robots that\nhad physical counterparts (like Kheperas) that the\nneural nets could be uploaded into and tested in\nreal-world environments?\n\n&gt; As you might have guessed, working with hundreds of\n&gt; robots for many \n&gt; generations is computationally very expensive. So,\n&gt; we made a \n&gt; distributed version of NEAT. The simulations were\n&gt; carried out on \n&gt; different client machines (mostly pIIs and pIIIs in\n&gt; our AI Lab), \n&gt; while there was one master server that carried out\n&gt; &quot;epoch&quot;s of NEAT \n&gt; and gave new chromosomes to every new coming client.\n\nThis is exactly the set-up Philip and I intend to use\nwhen we begin tackling Go.  Did you modify Ken&#39;s C++\nimplementation or write one of your own from scratch?\n\n&gt; We evolved \n&gt; some neural nets with 3-4 robots, and tried the same\n&gt; net for 50-60 \n&gt; robots and found that the neural nets didn&#39;t work\n&gt; all that bad for \n&gt; greater number of robots.\n\nDoes this mean that you used the same neural net in\nall the robots in a given population?\n\n&gt; I will write more about my work later. \n\nI&#39;d be interested in hearing more about it. :)\n\n&gt; Although, now I dont get anytime to work on NEAT.\n&gt; Since, I&#39;m working \n&gt; with a software house these days, and am preparing\n&gt; for my GRE. I hope \n&gt; to get into a Phd program where I can continue my\n&gt; work with NEAT. \n\nGood luck. :)\n\nBest,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
