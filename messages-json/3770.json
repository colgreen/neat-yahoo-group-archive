In addition you\nwant to evaluate how the agent responds when oriented differently\nrelative to the target, so for each of the N positions perform\nmultiple trials with the agent oriented pointing towards, away from,\nat 90 degrees etc.\n\nHowever, if the agent is egocentric then you don&#39;t really need the N\ntrials spaced around a circumference - they will all amount to\nevaulating the same scenario. You may however want to perform trials\nusing  3 or 4 different (and adjacent) starting poistions if the world\nis a grid system because of the subtle sensory differences caused by\naliasing.\n\nIf you do start out at a fixed distance then you can assign fitness\nbased on how close the agent gets to the target within a fixed amount\nof time - averaged out for each of the different starting\norientations. Does this seem reasonable?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
