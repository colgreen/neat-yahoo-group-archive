But they were mostly \nvery uninteresting experiments, such as classification.  I think the \nmost interesting neuroevolution outside of NEAT is coming from \nFloreano and his group, who do evolutionary robotics using \nneuroevolution.  Our own group from UT also had several \npresentations, including one by Faustino Gomez on transferring \nneuroevolved controllers to the real world.\n\nIt&#39;s true that half of GECCO is Genetic Programming.  That&#39;s \nbecausee GECCO is a combination of the old GA and GP conferences, \nwhich used to be separate.  GP is kind of strange in that it&#39;s just \none method yet it is treated like a whole area.  This distinction \nbetween GA and GP may be fading though over the long term as \nindirect encoding becomes more prominent.\n\nIn fact, attention to indirect encoding was the big thing I noticed \nchanging at this conference.  For the first time since I started \nattending 4 years ago, it got a lot of attention and communities are \nstarting to form.  People seem to have suddenly taken notice that \nit&#39;s going to be a big deal.\n\nCoevolution is also getting a lot of attention, but mostly at a more \ntheoretical level than practical.  Still, there was interesting work \non cooperative and competitive coevolution, which are definitely \nboth relevant to neuroevolution, and most of the leaders in this \narea go to GECCO.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, 06 Jul 2004 21:04:55 +0100, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Did you discover any new NEAT or NEAT like research going on or \nany\n&gt; &gt; interesting commercial connections?\n&gt; \n&gt; Not really.\n&gt; \n&gt; I attended a &quot;Genetic Algorithms in Industry&quot; tutorial, which \nactually\n&gt; turned out to be two guys from Dow Chemical, so it was \nreally &quot;Genetic\n&gt; Algorithms in the Chemical Industry&quot;.  They spoke in very vague \nterms\n&gt; for the first half hour, and when they finally put some data up on \nthe\n&gt; slides, when someone asked what they were representing, they \nmumbled\n&gt; something about how they couldn&#39;t say what the graphs actually \nshowed\n&gt; because it was proprietary.\n&gt; \n&gt; GECCO is apparently a fusion of different conferences, and it \nseemed\n&gt; to me that many more of the papers and workshops/tutorials were \ngeared\n&gt; more toward Genetic Programming than any other use of GAs.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was an interesting presentation in my LBP session by a guy \nfrom\n&gt; a company that had successfully used GP techniques to identify\n&gt; unexploded ordnance in military artillery ranges that were to be\n&gt; converted to civilian use.  I spoke to another guy from somewhere\n&gt; called Aerospace Corp who said he was skeptical of ANNs and mostly\n&gt; looking for GP-based approaches to analyzing aerial and satellite\n&gt; photography.  It seems to me that ANN-based approaches to these \nsorts\n&gt; of fuzzy recognition problems would be more promising than GP\n&gt; approaches...so if anything I got a lot of ideas about potential\n&gt; commercial connections, if anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe Ken or Joseph had different experiences, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
