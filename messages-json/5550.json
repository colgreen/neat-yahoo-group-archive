Here I want to start by\ndefining a parameterised fitness function, so for each combination of\nparameters we have a fitness space and thus a &#39;space of spaces&#39;\n(hyperspace) (For ease of visualisation I&#39;ll also assume the\nparameters are continuous).\n\nSo more formally we have:\n\n  G - Genetic data. Position in encoding space.\n  f(G) - Orthodox fitness function.\n  f(G, x, y) - Parameterised fitness function. Here I use two\ndimensions as I find it easier to think about this stuff in 1 or 2D\nbut the idea isn&#39;t constrained to any particular dimensionality.\n\n\nTypically the x,y here could be weightings given to different aspects\nof a fitness function or we could combine two distinct fitness\nfunctions with weights (which amounts to the same thing). So e.g.\n\n   f(G, x, y) = (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * y)\n\nWhere f1() and f2() are fitness functions and f() is a fitness\nfunction which is simply the weighted combination of f1() and f2().\nOther combinations are possible, this is just a nice trivial example\nto put the idea across.\n\nNow lets consider (x,y) to be coordinates in some world where the\nfitness varies depending on where you are in that world, are you in\nthe sea, on land, a desert, rainforest, etc. Different strategies\napply to these different regions.\n\nConsider that each G has an (x,y) associated with it (a position in\nthe world), I&#39;ll refer to this combination is an Individual (I). When\nwe initialise a new population we can distribute I&#39;s in (x,y) using a\nuniform random distribution.\n\nWe now have a basis for a new form of fitness sharing based on\nposition in the (x,y) space rather than the G space. In a nutshell for\na given Individual we can vary fitness depending on how densly\npopulated the neighbourhood of I is. So where there are &#39;easy&#39; regions\nin (x,y) you would get a cluster of I&#39;s, but the fitness sharing\nprovides a selection pressure to explore regions around those\nclusters.\n\nFor asexual reproduction I would suggest that offspring(x,y) should be\na gaussian distribution around parent(x,y). And for sexual\nreproduction we could take some point on the line between the two\nparents.\n\nThis method potentially stands as an alternative to fitness sharing\nbased on G only, or you might conceive of a combination of the two\nmethods.\n\nWhat are the benefits of this?... I believe this could provide more\ncomplex fitness landscapes which in turn may help avoid local maxima.\n\nFinally there&#39;s another component we can add in here which is\nvariation of f() over time, so f(x,t) or f(x,y,t).\n\nColin\n\n"}}
