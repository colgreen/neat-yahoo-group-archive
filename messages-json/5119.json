N=\r\no problem. Thanks for the answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In response to comments 1-3, we&#39;v=\r\ne actually run several preliminary\n&gt; &gt; experiments with the intent of answe=\r\nring the questions you&#39;ve asked.  We hope\n&gt; &gt; to have a publication with fo=\r\nrmal results based on those experiments soon.  In\n&gt; &gt; general though, we do=\r\n feel that this approach is superior to the one discussed\n&gt; &gt; in the previo=\r\nus multiagent HyperNEAT paper and would recommend anyone who\n&gt; &gt; wants to w=\r\nork with multiagent HyperNEAT to use the z-based substrate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cool. I lo=\r\nok forward to seeing the paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4.  Way back when I first converted =\r\nSharpNEAT to HyperSharpNEAT I tried a\n&gt; &gt; number of values and found that t=\r\nhere wasn&#39;t a large difference between them,\n&gt; &gt; although 20% seemed to be =\r\nslightly better.  For any new domains I&#39;ll try a few\n&gt; &gt; values to see if t=\r\nhey make any difference, but I haven&#39;t found any where the\n&gt; &gt; elitism valu=\r\ne made a significant difference.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will say that I&#39;ve never tried =\r\njust saving the best organism.  One reason is\n&gt; &gt; that the SharpNEAT specia=\r\ntion code isn&#39;t really designed to only save one\n&gt; &gt; genome.  The other is =\r\nthat I think saving at least the best genomes in your\n&gt; &gt; best species woul=\r\nd help prevent promising species from accidentally dying off\n&gt; &gt; too early.=\r\n  On the other hand, I know you have several successful HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; exper=\r\niments, so I guess I&#39;ll turn the question back on you: Have you found\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\naving just the best genome to generally be better than saving more?  I&#39;m\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; certainly willing to give it a try if you&#39;ve seen much better results.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I have never changed these parameters. But now that we are discussing it=\r\n I\n&gt; am realizing I don&#39;t actually know how much elitism I am using. I thin=\r\nk I am\n&gt; using the same parameters from Jason&#39;s experiments. I was focusing=\r\n on this\n&gt; parameter, which is why I said I keep only the best org:\n&gt; \n&gt; Fo=\r\nrceCopyGenerationChampion 1.0\n&gt; \n&gt; But I now also see these parameters in m=\r\ny experiment config files:\n&gt; \n&gt; SmallestSpeciesSizeWithElitism 5.0\n&gt; Mutate=\r\nSpeciesChampionProbability 0.0\n&gt; \n&gt; How do I figure out my % elitism, so I =\r\nknow how my number compares to your\n&gt; 20%?  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5.  The answer to wheth=\r\ner we renormalize the sheets or insert the new sheets\n&gt; &gt; between the old i=\r\ns technically both.  In general we renormalize, that is\n&gt; &gt; however many ag=\r\nents there are, they are evenly spaced between -1 and 1.  While\n&gt; &gt; it may =\r\nseem like a good idea to leave the original sheets where they were and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ninsert the new ones among them, in most cases it is difficult to determine\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; where the new sheets should go.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, if there were 5 a=\r\ngents located at z=3D{-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1} and the\n&gt; &gt; team needed to be sc=\r\naled to 7 agents, where should the two new agents go?\n&gt; &gt; There are two age=\r\nnts, but four spaces (-0.75, -0.25, 0.25, 0.75) to put them\n&gt; &gt; and no real=\r\n reason to choose any of the spaces over the others.  By\n&gt; &gt; redistributing=\r\n the agents evenly we eliminate such ad hoc decisions.  However,\n&gt; &gt; if the=\r\n 5 agent team were to be scaled up to 9 agents, they would be placed at\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n z=3D{-1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1}.  Thus, even though we&#39;=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; renormalizing, the placement works out the same as if we had inserte=\r\nd the new\n&gt; &gt; agents among the old.\n&gt; \n&gt; That makes sense, and seems like t=\r\nhe right way to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6.  The sign function simply returns the sign=\r\n of the node&#39;s activation: -1 if\n&gt; &gt; the activation is negative, 0 if it is=\r\n 0, and 1 if it is positive.\n&gt; &gt;The reason \n&gt; &gt; for this function and the s=\r\ntarting structure is to establish a team with\n&gt; &gt; mirror symmetry i.e. the =\r\nANN of the agent at z=3D 1 is the horizontally flipped\n&gt; &gt; version of the a=\r\ngent at z=3D-1 and so on.  We found that team mirror symmetry\n&gt; &gt; was benef=\r\nicial in both domains that were tested in this paper, so it was\n&gt; &gt; logical=\r\n to allow it to start with symmetry (which can be broken or ignored\n&gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh mutations).\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok. I get it. Thanks for clarifying.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope I&#39;ve =\r\nanswered your questions,\n&gt; \n&gt; You did. Thanks again for all the answers, an=\r\nd congrats on the great work.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; David\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Congrats on th=\r\nis paper. It features a lot of nice results.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A few questions/com=\r\nments:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) The issue of interpolation is extremely interesting. I=\r\nn this paper you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; explicitly discuss how it would be beneficial to add =\r\nnew agents, and have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; their roles be intermediate versions of other age=\r\nnts (e.g., adding a 12th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; soccer player between the forwards and the mi=\r\ndfielders would create a player\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that was a hybrid of the two roles). I=\r\nt would also be cool to see if teams\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can gracefully re-divide the stra=\r\ntegy-space when they lose agents. For\n&gt; &gt;&gt; example, in soccer/futbol, after=\r\n a few red cards are assigned, each player\n&gt; &gt;&gt; does not play the usual rol=\r\ne that they would play on a team of 11, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instead re-divide the spac=\r\ne up amongst the fewer players. For example, after\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the red cards their=\r\n may be a left and right forward instead of a left, right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and center f=\r\norward. It would be cool to see if you can see such a result\n&gt; &gt;&gt; using you=\r\nr method.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) You mention the benefits of interpolated roles, but=\r\n do you have any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evidence that such interpolation is occurring? One co=\r\nol way to test this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would be to compare two different treatments: T1) =\r\ntake your original N\n&gt; &gt;&gt; agents and multiply them to achieve the desired s=\r\ncaled-up number of agents\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (e.g., 9, 25, 100, 1000). If you start with =\r\n10 agents, and scale to 1000,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you thus get 100 identical copies of age=\r\nnt 1, 100 identical copies of agent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2, etc. Compare the performance of=\r\n this treatment to T2) interpolate 1000\n&gt; &gt;&gt; agents into the z coordinate r=\r\nange, so you have 1000 slightly different\n&gt; &gt;&gt; agents. The difference in pe=\r\nrformance between these treatments will help you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; figure out whether yo=\r\nu are seeing a boost due to interpolation. If the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performance increase=\r\n due to scaling is not different between T1 and T2, then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you know your=\r\n performance boost was simply due to having more agents, not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; due to in=\r\nterpolation (you note something similar when you say &quot;adding more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; agen=\r\nts that all do the same thing will eventually cause a pile-up&quot;...my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; su=\r\nggestion is a way to test this claim).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) Why do you feel this n=\r\new technique is better than your old technique? Is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it possible to comp=\r\nare the two experimentally? Have you done so?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) I notice you me=\r\nntion that you use 20% elitism. I usually only save the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; best organism.=\r\n Have you found 20% to work a lot better, generally?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 5) When you=\r\n add new agents, do you leave the previous sheets in the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; place, a=\r\nnd interpolate new sheets between them, or do you renormalize all of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe sheets such that it may be the case that no new agent is in the exact z\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coordinate of one of the original agents? It might be interesting to t=\r\nry\n&gt; &gt;&gt; both and see which tends to work better.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 6) What is the =\r\n&#39;sign&#39; function you mention in Figure 2? In general, I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; having troub=\r\nle figuring out what this means: &quot;The starting structure of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; initia=\r\nl heterogeneous CPPN (Figure 2b) includes some additional structure to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n start evolution with knowledge of mirrored team symmetry; in particular, t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sign function of z connected to multiplication operators on the x-a=\r\nxis means\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that the CPPN knows which side of the team is which and can =\r\nopt to reflect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one side across the midline.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Congrats again=\r\n on this nice work.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dig=\r\nital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; www.msu.edu=\r\n/~jclune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To=\r\n: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 28 Jan 201=\r\n0 02:59:22 -0000\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] Multiagent HyperNEAT Revisited\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Our 2008 GE=\r\nCCO paper by David D&#39;Ambrosio and myself introduced the idea that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; single HyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of neural networks (instead of =\r\njust\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one) that represent a pattern of policies for an entire team.
