I evolved controller networks for quadruped and\nhexapod robots focusing on modularity.  The literature suggests that\nleaky integrators are useful because of their richer dynamics, and\ntherefore they use CTRNN networks to generate the oscillatory patterns\nrequired for walking.  However, confirming what Ken said, I have found\nthat they are not necessary when joint angles are provided.  In this\ncase, the required oscillations with proper phase relations between\nlegs are generated by the overall dynamics of the modular controller.\n\nThe modular controller uses the same module for each leg, which allows\nits behavior to be explained in terms of coupled cell systems, which\nare dynamical systems used by Martin Golubitsky, Ian Stewart and\nothers to model central pattern generators in animals.  In effect, the\nmodular controller is a neural network implementation of their coupled\ncell system, each cell corresponding to a module of the network.\nAlthough I used it for a quadruped, they used the same coupled cell\nsystem to model biped locomotion.  So you might also find it useful.\nThe details and references are in our forthcoming GECCO paper:\n\n     http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/valsalam.gecco08.pdf\n\nThe videos mentioned in the paper are available here:\n\n     http://www.dailymotion.com/walkingtables\n\nVinod\n\n\nAt Wed, 14 May 2008 16:44:03 -0000,\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter C&#39;s message brings up another issue that might be useful to\n&gt; Peter B:  For ambulation, it might be more effective to use leaky\n&gt; integrator neurons than the usual feedforward neurons that are used in\n&gt; most ANN models.  The leaky integrators are better for precise timing.\n&gt;  However, they may not be necessary if joint angles are being provided\n&gt; as input.  But when joint angles are not provided, I do not think I\n&gt; have ever seen a regular recurrent ANN (i.e. non-leaky or not some\n&gt; other special type of neuron) be able to make something walk.  In\n&gt; fact, the &quot;flailing&quot; motions are often reduced significantly by leaky\n&gt; integrator neurons.  Tyler Streeter saw this when he worked on his\n&gt; biped with NEAT, which actually stopped flailing after switching to\n&gt; leaky integrators.  However, in his project the network had no inputs\n&gt; and worked entirely through internal pattern generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I cannot add more to what Ken said, this is an entirely new field and \n&gt; &gt; a cutting edge of research but I suggest you take a look at my NEVH \n&gt; &gt; project as well (it is located in the files section in this group). \n&gt; &gt; It is written in C++ and utilizes HyperNEAT for constructing the \n&gt; &gt; phenotypes. It also uses leaky integrators for the phenotype neuron \n&gt; &gt; model.

I only wrote the toribash-esque \n&gt; &gt; experiment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a few changes and features added to python-neat. The actual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; python-neat backend is written by Cesar Gomez and is really \n&gt; &gt; terrific,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as python has a certain elegance about it that makes it seem easier \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grasp. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to get it to work you need to download the linux version of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Command Line Breve:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.spiderland.org/download.php\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then unzip this in the breve_2.7.2/ directory:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://peter.berrington.googlepages.com/tori.7z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To evolve, open a shell and navigate to the breve directory, then \n&gt; &gt; call\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ToriExp with python, like this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; python tori/toriExp.py\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To view the last best individual, instead type this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ./bin/breve tori/viewlastbest.py\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Theres a HUGE amount of parameters for which I have no idea what the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good values are. The creator of Toribash is giving me a description \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how his game works but is not at all forthcoming with the specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation details; I suppose he is reluctant to give away code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for something he makes money on, but it&#39;s frustrating as his game is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually very well balanced, allowing some very nimble and natural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looking acrobatics. Trial and error is probably the only solution at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I encourage people to fool around with this; I&#39;m a complete beginner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to programming this kind of stuff and I&#39;ve got a lot of really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible code I&#39;m sure, so please submit any changes that you think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would make sense.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Peter, that&#39;s a good question and of course learning to \n&gt; &gt; control a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; virtual creature with novelty search is a complicated issue (and \n&gt; &gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appealing idea as well). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, you have to deal with all the representational and \n&gt; &gt; physical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issues outside of novelty search, like how many inputs, how many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outputs, and whether the body itself is not physically flawed in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way (which is possible).  As you are experiencing, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selection.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does not care about the # inputs or outputs (and can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potentially exploit geometric regularities), but configuring the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate then becomes the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming all of that stuff is set up well with whatever system, \n&gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty search is a potentially winning approach.  Yet as you \n&gt; &gt; point \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In fact, we are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to these questions \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general principles might help for now: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not not need to contain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every point ever visited.  Therefore, it tends to grow much \n&gt; &gt; slower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations.  However, if it is indeed getting too \n&gt; &gt; big  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreasonable to collapse some of the archive \n&gt; &gt; points, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although there is no standard method yet for how that should be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done.  But we have reason to believe there will be effective and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple ways to do that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, the issue of one individual looking different just \n&gt; &gt; because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same behavior is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated.  For certain phase disaparities, the two individuals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but it is true that at some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disparity, they may look very different.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether that fact is actually problematic to the novelty search \n&gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it would simply reward both types of behavior.  It \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the phase difference is a result of some useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, which could make it a stepping stone to \n&gt; &gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  Or, it is possible that it is superfluous information \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply takes some extra time exploring the area around the phase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shifted individual.  So it is hard to say a priori whether it is \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major concern.  We will have better answers to such questions as \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; technique is further explored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I agree that it would be nice to be able to say the two \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase-shifted individuals are largely the same if that is indeed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you want to say.  And for that, you would need a pattern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. something \n&gt; &gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  There are \n&gt; &gt; certainly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available.  However, it&#39;s important to recognize \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident at this point that ignoring the phase shift is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than taking it into consideration, because taking \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means adding more information to the \n&gt; &gt; novelty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So overall I think novelty search is a very promising direction \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go for such problems, but it is still in the realm of research \n&gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no existing precedent), so it will involve considerable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error to get it right until all these issues are \n&gt; &gt; fleshed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out more clearly.  Ultimately, though, if our hypothesis about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty vs. fitness is correct, novelty search may turn out to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way to get certain highly complex types of behavior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in some domains, which is a sobering thought.  But if it \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true, then there is not much to do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new approach. For the past couple of months I&#39;ve been working on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; virtual creature controllers; specifically I have a ragdoll rig \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve set up in Breve Simulation Environment (available at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://spiderland.org )\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This ragdoll is modelled after the one in Toribash, a free game \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uses the open dynamics engine for physics, like breve. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So far a lot of the results I&#39;ve been having discouraging; as \n&gt; &gt; Ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; points out early on in his latest paper, trying to make a \n&gt; &gt; walking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biped usually results in it falling over perpetually. You can \n&gt; &gt; see \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WIP videos at my youtube page here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/user/thehaircrow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ultimately, I would like to package AI&#39;s with the Toribash game \n&gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are fun to play against in single player- I think \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is attainable despite being difficult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deception is a BIG problem here; if my fitness criteria is time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; integrated distance from a goal, it encourages the behaviour of \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Tori&quot; balancing in a stable configuration forever, rather than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking, which is what I&#39;m trying to encourage. As there is 20 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this rig, I am providing joint position and velocity \n&gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for each joint, as well as a bias, a sine-wave, the x, y, and z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components linear velocity in the reference frame of the Tori&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and finally 3 variables which correspond to the vertical, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and forward orientation of the tori&#39;s head with respect to world\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current experimental configuration I am started out as \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll control where neural net outputs correspond directly \n&gt; &gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity; a tanh activation function is used to allow positive \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negative joint movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then remodeled the experiment to perform as in the Toribash \n&gt; &gt; game;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the net will receive inputs (and effect joint movements) only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time steps. More importantly, I increased the amount of outputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40, in order to accomodate the 4 possible \n&gt; &gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions which can occur on a turn: holding, relaxing, \n&gt; &gt; extending, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that gives a staggeringly \n&gt; &gt; huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Due to the \n&gt; &gt; implementation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large nets as the starting net \n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram on the heap. Realizing this was a bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature selection and phased pruning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, even with this, deception seems to prevent any useful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour; the Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using a python implementation of neat developed by Cesar \n&gt; &gt; Gomez\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the GPL, which is available at \n&gt; &gt; http://code.google.com/p/neat-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This implementation is a WIP and I&#39;ve already done a lot of \n&gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to incorporate the linear genome encoding taken from the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EANT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method. I&#39;ve also been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in order to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimize weights but I haven&#39;t had much success meshing this \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later today when I am home I will post my source files for \n&gt; &gt; anyone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represented\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount of \n&gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method \n&gt; &gt; proposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a new \n&gt; &gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of discovered behaviours. This \n&gt; &gt; works \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I imagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of information to hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I can compare the behaviour of 2 \n&gt; &gt; ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; is there any compact encoding that \n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work? Since it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluations to get \n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this right now, theres going to have to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate behaviours in some way that is \n&gt; &gt; fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has identical behaviour to \n&gt; &gt; another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later instead? Just \n&gt; &gt; comparing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviours it would appear that they were 100% unique, yet \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer would instantly notice the similarity in how they act.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
