I think we are =\r\nin agreement that if only one is to be used, behavioral diversity is the pr=\r\niority.  The way I look at it, behavioral diversity is a way to mitigate de=\r\nception, which is such a profound problem for evolution that it is almost e=\r\nssential to do something about it.  On the other hand, genetic diversity is=\r\n mainly a way to protect structural innovation, which can help with achievi=\r\nng behavioral diversity, but on its own is not enough to deal with the prof=\r\nound problem of deception.  So we seem to be pretty much in agreement overa=\r\nll.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, St=E9phane Doncieux &lt;stephane=\r\n.doncieux@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I certainly did not want to say that=\r\n genetic diversity is not important.\n&gt; I just wanted to say that behavioral=\r\n diversity should not be neglected\n&gt; and that genotypic diversity, in my op=\r\ninion, should not be preferred\n&gt; over behavioral diversity if one only is t=\r\no be used. I have the feeling\n&gt; that genotypic diversity is not the main bo=\r\nttleneck, but I do also think\n&gt; that it is important (and the performance o=\r\nf NEAT prove it). The thing\n&gt; is that keeping a good diversity in the genot=\r\nype space is not enough to\n&gt; guarantee a good diversity in the behavioral s=\r\npace, as many different\n&gt; neural networks may have the same behavior (think=\r\n about neurons that are\n&gt; not connected to outputs or neural network parts =\r\nconnected to sensors\n&gt; that are not activated for a while) and likewise ver=\r\ny close neural\n&gt; networks may result in very different behaviors. \n&gt; \n&gt; By =\r\nthe way, I completely agree with you, Ken, genotypic and behavioral\n&gt; diver=\r\nsity are very probably complimentary. Combining both will certainly\n&gt; lead =\r\nto better results and it would be interesting to further\n&gt; investigate it.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; stef\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Stef,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I changed the subject agai=\r\nn just to make it easier to keep track as\n&gt; the conversation branches.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for pointing out these insights and your work on behavioral vs.\n=\r\n&gt; genetic diversity. It does appear that behavioral diversity and novelty\n&gt;=\r\n are emerging through recent research such as your own as more critical\n&gt; f=\r\nactors in maintaining healthy diversity than genetic diversity, in\n&gt; partic=\r\nular when the diversity is in service of achieving a traditional\n&gt; objectiv=\r\ne (i.e. when one of the multiple objectives is some kind of\n&gt; task-specific=\r\n performance measure).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, genetic diversity may still play a =\r\nuseful role in combination\n&gt; with behavioral diversity or novelty, which I =\r\nwant to illustrate here.\n&gt; Recall that the original motivation in NEAT for =\r\nmaintaining genetic\n&gt; diversity was to ensure that genetic innovations (i.e=\r\n. additions of\n&gt; structure) are not eliminated prematurely. That is, the po=\r\nint is to\n&gt; ensure that individuals with new structure are not eliminated b=\r\nefore\n&gt; they have a chance to show their potential by optimizing their weig=\r\nhts\n&gt; over several more generations. Placing them in protected species give=\r\ns\n&gt; them that opportunity to optimize further.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, recent resu=\r\nlts such as yours suggest that when you have a\n&gt; target objective, protecti=\r\nng behavioral diversity is so effective (most\n&gt; likely because it help avoi=\r\nd deception) that a system with only\n&gt; behavioral diversity will likely com=\r\ne closer to the objective than one\n&gt; with only genetic diversity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nut that leaves open the possibility that genetic diversity can\n&gt; complement=\r\n behavioral diversity or novelty. One interesting question is\n&gt; whether in =\r\nthe &quot;Encouraging Behavioral Diversity in Evolutionary\n&gt; Robotics&quot; paper the=\r\n results would be even better if *both* behavioral\n&gt; diversity/novelty and =\r\ngenetic diversity were combined (as our group has\n&gt; done in recent papers).=\r\n Going back to the motivation in NEAT for genetic\n&gt; diversity, the logic fo=\r\nr why it would still matter when combined with\n&gt; behavioral diversity/novel=\r\nty can be seen:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just as we do not know at first for any structural =\r\ninnovation whether\n&gt; that innovation might lead to higher fitness in an obj=\r\nective-based\n&gt; problem, we also do not know initially whether a particular =\r\nstructural\n&gt; innovation might lead later to more *novelty*. Often structura=\r\nl\n&gt; additions in neuroevolution lead to a complete collapse in behavior,\n&gt; =\r\nwhich obviously hurts fitness, but also hurts novelty because degenerate\n&gt; =\r\nbehaviors are not considered novel (except at the very beginning of the\n&gt; r=\r\nun). Therefore, if you are not protecting genetic diversity when\n&gt; novelty/=\r\nbehavioral diversity are one of the objectives, then you are\n&gt; risking prem=\r\naturely eliminating genotypes before their potential for\n&gt; novelty has been=\r\n explored.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, perhaps more significant in magnitude than even=\r\n that scenario\n&gt; is whether novelty alone (as in novelty search) can drive =\r\na search as\n&gt; effectively without genetic diversity than it can with it. Wh=\r\nen you are\n&gt; searching for a specific objective target, deception is the ov=\r\nerriding\n&gt; pathology, which is why behavioral diversity is such a potent an=\r\ntidote.\n&gt; However, if you are searching only for novelty, then obviously de=\r\nception\n&gt; is no longer the issue (since you are not looking for any one thi=\r\nng),\n&gt; which means that now other pathologies (such as prematurely losing\n&gt;=\r\n structural innovations from the population) would become more important.\n&gt;=\r\n Therefore, the impact of forgoing genetic diversity might be more\n&gt; eviden=\r\nt in that context.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, even if this issue is most evident =\r\nin pure novelty\n&gt; search, it may still appear to some extent in any search =\r\nwhere\n&gt; behavioral diversity is important, since genetic diversity ultimate=\r\nly\n&gt; drives behavioral diversity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This issue probably merits furthe=\r\nr study. I only mean to raise the\n&gt; question, not to argue that the answer =\r\nis conclusive. I&#39;m guessing the\n&gt; real answer is probably nuanced. For exam=\r\nple, it may be that genetic\n&gt; diversity is more important early in a run wh=\r\nen small structural changes\n&gt; tend to have the most dramatic effects on beh=\r\navior. Perhaps in later\n&gt; generations because the effect tends to be less t=\r\nhe need for genotypic\n&gt; protection might reduce. But my guess is that ultim=\r\nately genetic\n&gt; diversity and behavioral diversity both play a role in heal=\r\nthy\n&gt; evolution, and in fact complement each other (because genetic diversi=\r\nty\n&gt; helps foster behavioral diversity). I would also guess the effect woul=\r\nd\n&gt; be more pronounced the more a search relies on novelty as its primary\n&gt;=\r\n driver (with pure novelty search being the most extreme such case). Of\n&gt; c=\r\nourse these are currently just speculations on my part.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
