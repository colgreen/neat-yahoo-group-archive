This thought then leads me into wondering if\nwe could speciate based on position in the behaviour space. There&#39;s\none good reason for not doing that which is that it would probably\nmake sexual reproduction within a species less effective, but then we\nknow we can run NEAT with just asexual reproduction.\n\nIt seems to me that there may be a continnum of NEAT search variants\non the axes:\n\npure objective fitness  &lt;--&gt; pure novelty fitness\nencoding space speciation &lt;--&gt; behavior space speciation\n\nJust a random thought.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
