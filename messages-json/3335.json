It&#39;s primary target is to examine what are the benefits of using geometry for dynamic control problems. Use &quot;F&quot; to switch between fast and normal mode. Use &quot;C&quot; to switch between CPPN network and substrate views. If you close a window, it will not open anymore. You need Visual Studio 2005 to compile, but it is compatible with other versions, I guess. You have to copy the .H files to your compiler&#39;s include directory.  \n\nYou can access this file at the URL:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/Neuro%20Evolving%20Virtual%20Humans.zip \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit:\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/files\n\nRegards,\n\npetar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
