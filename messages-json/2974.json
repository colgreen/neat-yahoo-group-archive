I think we&#39;ll evolve AI before we reverse engineer the brain\n&gt; sufficiently to pass the Turing test. Well, I actually think that all of\n&gt; these different methods will continue to cross fertilize each other such\n&gt; that no individual thrust will be solely responsible.\n\nYeh but history rarely remembers the people behind the breakthroughs,\nonly the people who took the last step. The major barriers are still\nhardware ones (essentially limits in available computational\nresources) and once those problems are solved (by chemists,\nphysicists, mathematicians, etc. working on CPU fabrication and\ndesign), actually putting together an artificial conciousness could\nquite possibly be a fairly straighforward exercise.\n\nAnyway for further reading see the wikipedia &quot;technological\nsingularity &quot;article, featuring a rather nifty &#39;big picture&#39; graph of\ntechnological progress:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
