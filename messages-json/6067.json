Therefore, I think we should move to a system where all p=\r\napers are initially submitted to venues with low acceptance thresholds (and=\r\n therefore typically high, but not pre-determined, acceptance rates), and y=\r\nears later, when they have been public long enough to show their real worth=\r\n in informing other people&#39;s research, they could be elected to be part of =\r\nmore &quot;selective&quot; proceedings. This would likely help researchers refrain fr=\r\nom adding needless quantitative results just to please reviewers.\n\nI would =\r\nlike this kind of system very much. Actually, it not that far from a more c=\r\nlassic system in which conferences have a very high acceptance rate (to dis=\r\ncuss and mature ideas, possibly without quantitive comparisons) and journal=\r\n papers with lower acceptance rate in which we publish more mature ideas (t=\r\nypically with more quantitative experiments and better arguments).\n\nThis is=\r\n also close to what Nicolas describes. &quot;A decent poster session with a lowe=\r\nr selection rate (~50%? unlike PPSN) would possibly enable to take some ris=\r\nks with accepting contributions, and giving anyone the opportunity to prese=\r\nnt new ideas, without removing the fact that if you want to get your work a=\r\nccepted for a conference talk or a journal publication (with high selection=\r\n rate), you have to work hard to convince reviewers and editors (as it is a=\r\nlready the case for many journals). To some extent, this is already done el=\r\nsewhere, for example in the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience =\r\n(thousands of attendants, many many posters, keynote talks).=94\n\nBest regar=\r\nds,\n=97 JBM\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/\n"}}
