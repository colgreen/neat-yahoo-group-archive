Run ba=\r\nsic examples, like learning the XOR function, a often \n&gt; included example o=\r\nf supervised learning. Read the paper that introduce NEAT, not \n&gt; all, but =\r\nat least the section about how it&#39;s done, a one hour effort. If you \n&gt; data=\r\n are vector of fixed size, it&#39;s very straighfoward to move from the XOR \n&gt; =\r\nexample to your problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; But anyway, if the real problem is to actuall=\r\ny build a classifier and not \n&gt; tinkering with NEAT, better first have a go=\r\nod reason to use NEAT and not \n&gt; something more simple (Occam razor princip=\r\nle). A perceptron with backprop, you \n&gt; got plenty of implementations for i=\r\nt in the most esotheric languages, and it&#39;s \n&gt; easy to do your own if you w=\r\nish to. Same goes for SVM, if you don&#39;t use fancy \n&gt; kernels. And both are =\r\nlikely to be faster for many supervised learning tasks. I \n&gt; might be corre=\r\ncted by the others, but I think the original purpose of NEAT was \n&gt; to do *=\r\nUNSUPERVISED* learning.

NEAT will generate many neural network, and you \n&gt; give a=\r\n *fitness* to each neural network. Higher fitness means more interesting \n&gt;=\r\n neural network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, with NEAT, you can produce neural networks that=\r\n can themselves can be used \n&gt; for doing classification. Your fitness for a=\r\n given neural network should be its \n&gt; classification performance. To avoid=\r\n over-learning (a classifier which does not \n&gt; generalize), be careful to n=\r\not use the same sample set to compute classification \n&gt; performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlso, be sure that more classic machine learning methods are not suitable, l=\r\nike \n&gt; SVM or back-prop, they are likely to be faster if they work good eno=\r\nugh on your \n&gt; problem.
