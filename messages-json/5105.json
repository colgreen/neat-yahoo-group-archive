Indeed one of our goals is to raise=\r\n the profile of neuroevolution in mainstream AI venues that are not exclusi=\r\nve to only evolutionary computation (EC).  Of course, we still very much en=\r\njoy and support EC venues.\n\nI think your question on additional dimensions =\r\napplies not only to multiagent learning, but in fact to any type of HyperNE=\r\nAT learning application.  I do believe that additional dimensions can be pu=\r\nt to good use.  There are many possible conceptual arrangements of problem =\r\ngeometry that could take advantage of higher dimensions.  However, the plac=\r\nement of sensors (or other nodes) in different geometries is a heuristic bi=\r\nas to HyperNEAT, and it is possible in some cases that its advantage would =\r\nbe outweighed by its cost (i.e. adding many more dimensions).  Sometimes th=\r\nere will be ways to separate important categories even within only two or t=\r\nhree dimensions by simply separating them within the geometry offered by th=\r\nose few dimensions.\n\nThe many implications of different geometrical configu=\r\nrations for various problems remain largely unexplored, although Jeff Clune=\r\n has taken steps in that direction.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wes=\r\nley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Congratulations David, Joel, Sebastian, =\r\nand Ken! Another top-tier AI \n&gt; publication for neuroevolution. You guys ha=\r\nd better slow down. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to see the results confirm the intuiti=\r\non that I think most \n&gt; people had. The videos are also impressive (though =\r\nthe wmv&#39;s crashed my \n&gt; Firefox, maybe YouTube videos would be better?).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As a follow-up question, I wonder if additional dimensions would be \n&gt; u=\r\nseful for evolving sensors that have to deal with multiple, distinct \n&gt; cat=\r\negories of objects. A simple example would be a first-person shooter, \n&gt; wh=\r\nere you have walls, enemies, teammates, and projectiles all at once. \n&gt; You=\r\n could separate these values via input activation levels, but would \n&gt; it m=\r\nake more sense to separate each class of object into a separate \n&gt; location=\r\n in a new dimesion?\n&gt; \n&gt; Congrats again, and enjoy Toronto!\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Our 2008 GECCO paper by David D&#39;Ambrosio and myself in=\r\ntroduced the \n&gt; &gt; idea that a single HyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of neu=\r\nral networks \n&gt; &gt; (instead of just one) that represent a pattern of policie=\r\ns for an \n&gt; &gt; entire team. Since then a few people have asked about the way=\r\n we laid \n&gt; &gt; out the team on the substrate and whether alternatives might =\r\nbe better.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am happy to announce, with my co-authors David D&#39;Ambro=\r\nsio, Joel \n&gt; &gt; Lehman, and Sebastian Risi, that we have extensively tested =\r\nsuch an \n&gt; &gt; alternative z-axis-based encoding and published the results to=\r\n appear \n&gt; &gt; in AAMAS 2010, available here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu=\r\n/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/pub=\r\nlications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Direct Link: http://eplex.cs=\r\n.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/=\r\ndambrosio_aamas10.pdf&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We believe this z-based substrate layout is =\r\nsuperior to the previous \n&gt; &gt; one, particularly for scaling the size of the=\r\n team, and should open up \n&gt; &gt; the field of multiagent learning further to =\r\nHyperNEAT. The paper also \n&gt; &gt; includes the first published results on scal=\r\ning the size of the team \n&gt; &gt; without further training, which works because=\r\n HyperNEAT can \n&gt; &gt; interpolate new policies for ANNs inserted along the z =\r\naxis of the \n&gt; &gt; substrate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Videos that accompany the paper are her=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/mahnaamas2010.html \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf=\r\n.edu/mahnaamas2010.html&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
