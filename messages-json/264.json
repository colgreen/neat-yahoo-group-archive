I have\n&gt; taken note of some of the recommendations. So I will\n&gt; go ahead and set something up and we can make changes\n&gt; from there. One question I did have though was, how do\n&gt; we want to upload documentation to this site?\n&gt; Do we want anyone/everyone to be able to upload ( so\n&gt; we do it via a web interface) Or do we want to log\n&gt; into unix machine and ftp it?  What do you recommend?\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Rog\n&gt; \n\nHi Rog, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;upload documentation to the\nsite?&quot;  What kind of documentation do you mean?\n\nBut to answer your other question, I think it would be nice to have a\nweb interface for uploads.  If someone uploads something\ninnapropriate, we don&#39;t have to include it.  What do others think\nabout this?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
