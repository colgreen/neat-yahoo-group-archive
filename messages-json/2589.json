A network is created from the\ngenetics, but the genetics cannot be updated from the\nnetwork.  If the genetics change, the network must be\nreinstantiated.\n\nThe genetics are implemented by an abstract Gene\nclass.  Each type of gene implements the abstract\nclass.  The system currently only has two types of\ngenes, NeuronGenes and WeightGenes.  Each gene has a\nlabel which is a simple unsigned integer which is\nautoassigned when the gene is created or cloned.  Each\nsubclass must implement a compare method used to sort\ngenes of each type.\n\nNeuronGenes are sorted by their label, thus they  must\nbe created in a specific order: input, bias, output,\nhidden.  Hidden neuron genes can come anywhere in the\nsequence, but must appear after the last non-hidden\nneuron gene.\n\nWeightGenes are sorted by their output neuron\nconnection label first, followed by their input neuron\nconnection label second.  The compare method for\nweight genes is about thirty lines of code.\n\nWhen the genetics are sorted, using STL with the\ngene&#39;s compare method, everything lines up as expected\nwith innovations.  I only sort once, immediately after\nthe genetics have been created.  Both the network\ncreation code and the genetic mating code depend upon\na well sorted gene sequence.\n\nA genepool is implemented using a hash table. \nWhenever a new gene is created, the hash table is used\nto see if   \ngene already exists.  In the case of a weight gene,\nthe hash function uses the output/input neuron label\npairing.  If the gene is found, a reference count is\nincreased and a pointer to the existing gene is\nreturned rather than creating a new gene.  Once each\nepoch, the genepool is purged of any genes that no\nlonger have any references to help speed up searches.\n\nIt takes only seconds to create large populations with\nhuge networks.  My large test case has a population\nwith 5000 organisms of 100 neurons each.  It takes\nonly ten to twenty seconds real time to create the\npopulation.  The majority of creation time is spent in\nthe speciation code, which may still be buggy.\n\n\n--- Michael Rosario &lt;michaelrosario_2003@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt; Just wondering... In your implementation, if you do\n&gt; not use innovation numbers, how do you line up genes\n&gt; for mating operations?  \n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
