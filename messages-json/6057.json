I agree that there are=\r\n many papers that describe some very complex system, show some cool results=\r\n, and we don&#39;t learn anything. But sometimes there are papers that show som=\r\nething extremely impressive and don&#39;t have any informative quantitative mea=\r\nsures, and we learn a lot. It is the job of the reviewer to judge whether t=\r\nhere is a contribution: but a reviewer should not start with the assumption=\r\n that &quot;if there is no quantitative test, it&#39;s not science and is not publis=\r\nhable.&quot; My guess is that you agree with that, right?\n\nI agree. What I was t=\r\nrying to explain in the previous e-mail was: (1) we need to learn something=\r\n from the paper and (2) quantitative analysis is an easy way to argue somet=\r\nhing in a convincing way.\n\nI agree that the reviewer should not start with =\r\nthe assumption &quot;if there is no quantitative test, it&#39;s not science and is n=\r\not publishable.=94 However, I think that it is much harder to write a convi=\r\nncing paper without any quantitative test than with the help of measures/co=\r\nmparisons/etc. As a result, as a reviewer, I start being suspicious when I =\r\nsee a paper without strong quantitative results. I may accept it, but I kno=\r\nw that the challenge =97 for the author =97 will be more difficult.\n\nAnothe=\r\nr important point is that there is, in my opinion, a strong correlation bet=\r\nween weak papers and papers without strong quantitative results. Correlatio=\r\nn does not imply causation, but we somehow learn to have an intuitive bad f=\r\neeling when we see a paper without quantitative results.\n\n&gt; Here is one str=\r\nong argument for not mandating a quantitative test: we have not created AI =\r\nyet, so there are many things that humans can judge better than computers/q=\r\nuantitative tests. Take computer vision, for example. All of us are blown a=\r\nway by the images that resulted on Picbreeder,\n\n[Picbreeder is not related =\r\nat all with computer vision]\n\n\n&gt; Picbreeder taught us a lot about why CPPNs=\r\n are powerful and interesting, but they did not do so with numbers. My gues=\r\ns is that the Picbreeder papers did jump through some hoops to provide numb=\r\ners to satisfy reviewers that insist on them (I forget at this point, it&#39;s =\r\nbeen a while since I read those papers), but those numbers likely taught us=\r\n very little about the central advance. \n\nAgreed. Sometimes, examples can t=\r\neach us many things. But, again, it=92s hard to make a strong points with e=\r\nxamples. I=92m not saying it=92s impossible and your example is probably a =\r\ngood example. \n\n&gt; The same is true for many domains: if I come up with a ne=\r\nw story-telling algorithm, the judgement of whether it is a huge advance wo=\r\nuld be you listening to the stories and thinking about whether they feel mo=\r\nre natural and impressive than what came before.\n\nThis is typically quantif=\r\nied by taking 30 people and make them grade your story. My subjective opini=\r\non does not count that much.\n\n&gt; Do you agree?\n\nI agree with you. Neverthele=\r\nss, our field is young and I think we have to put pressure to have strong p=\r\napers on which we can build strong foundations for future researches. One w=\r\nay to put this pressure is to have high standards and encourage to measure =\r\neverything that is measurable/comparable, so that the average paper is as g=\r\nood as possible. Keep in mind that papers like =93look, cool simulated robo=\r\nts!&quot; are making our field weaker.\n\nAgain, I=92m advocating that we should j=\r\nudge papers by how much they teach us. I think we agree on this. Quantitati=\r\nve analysis is an easy way to teach something to the reader, other ways are=\r\n possible. But they are harder.\n\nBest regards,\n=97 JBM\n\n\n"}}
