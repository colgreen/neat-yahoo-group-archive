The network displays use of memory by moving in the direction of \nthe prey after it has moved outside of the sensor range. It also follows \na search pattern when the prey has been lost, although this wasn&#39;t \nreally intended because during evolution the network only has a small \nnumber of timesteps to catch the prey before we give up. However during \nthe high difficulty levels the number of allowed timesteps is increased, \nso this must be how the search pattern behaviour came about.\n\nColin\n\nColin Green wrote:\n\n&gt;Following the recent &#39;Refining Search&#39; thread, Derek described a problem \n&gt;where an evolved network scored 100% on the fitness function, but then \n&gt;scores less than 100% on subsequent more exhaustive tests. This is a \n&gt;consequence of using random tests for each evaluation, and therefore the \n&gt;score is partly dependent on which test cases come up.\n&gt;\n&gt;To alleviate the problem I suggested keeping a list of test cases that \n&gt;have previously failed and to test against these on each eval, as well \n&gt;as the normal set of random tests. Now it just so happens that this same \n&gt;problem exists with the prey capture domain currently implemented in \n&gt;SharpNEAT, so I was curious to see if the technique would work.\n&gt;\n&gt;After some experimenting I have settled on a slightly different approach \n&gt;than the one I described, but the concept is the same - keep track of \n&gt;failed tests and evaluate against them. The results are very good, the \n&gt;progress of the search is much slower than the existing code that used \n&gt;only random tests, typically it takes about 12 hrs now to achieve \n&gt;maximum fitness, whereas before it took about 1-2hrs. But the quality of \n&gt;the evolved networks at the end of the process is much higher, in fact \n&gt;the networks are near-perfect, although not quite 100% perfect, most \n&gt;likely due to non-determinism creeping back into the system as the \n&gt;difficulty level is increased (the prey begins to move in a \n&gt;non-deterministic manner).\n&gt;\n&gt;I hope to address this last little problem in an attempt to evolve 100% \n&gt;perfect networks for this task, but as it stands this experiment has \n&gt;demonstrated the effectiveness of the technique. It may not be \n&gt;applicable to all non-deterministic domains, but I think it is a useful \n&gt;technique for the NEAT toolkit.\n&gt;\n&gt;Following a bit more experimentation I hope to put together another \n&gt;write-up on all of this to fill out the details.\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
