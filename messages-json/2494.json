When I&#39;m\nf=\r\ninished, I plan to evolve neural nets to control a CYE robot, taking\ninput =\r\nfrom a roving eye on the (dynamic) video input from the robot&#39;s\nvideo camer=\r\na, and outputting data about how to move/zoom the roving\neye and how to cha=\r\nnge the robots speed and heading.\n\nHowever, I can&#39;t decide how I will go ab=\r\nout evaluating the networks&#39;\nfitnesses. I would think it would be impractic=\r\nal to actually have the\nrobot run using each neural net from every populati=\r\non (and it would\ninvolve lots of extra code to manage automatically guiding=\r\n the robot\nback to its charging station when its batteries run low).\n\nHowev=\r\ner, the robot will eventually use the champion network to\nactually perform =\r\na task, so the networks will need to learn how to\nprocess dynamic video dat=\r\na and respond accordingly. I can&#39;t think of a\nway to simulate this.\n\nI thou=\r\nght maybe I would run the robot manually through a number of\nideal courses,=\r\n recording the video, and compare networks&#39; responses to\nthe necessary resp=\r\nonses for those courses, but I&#39;m not sure that will\nwork, as the responses =\r\nduring simulation would not affect the video\ndata. The final net&#39;s response=\r\ns will actually move the robot and\ntherefore affect the video data.\n\nHas an=\r\nyone else tried anything like this, or does anyone have any\nideas about how=\r\n to evaluate these networks&#39; fitnesses?\n\nThanks,\nThomas Jack\n\n\n\n\n"}}
