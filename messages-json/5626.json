I&#39;ve ironed out a few bugs just now and run the code with\ndebug asserts switched on, so I have a reasonable confidence it&#39;s\nworking as expected, but I&#39;ll need to run some more extensive tests to\nbe sure.\n\nThere have been a number of other lesser submissions recently so check\nthe SVN log for more info there.\n\nSVN URL is:\nhttps://sharpneat.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sharpneat/trunk/SharpNeatV2\n\n  --Colin.\n\n"}}
