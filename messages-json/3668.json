The problem they have is that some (actually a lot)\n&gt; of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the images\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of galaxies are hard to classify, so they explain=\r\ned what to \n&gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opened the task up to Joe Public, =\r\nthe idea being that by \n&gt; grouping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answers they coul=\r\nd determine a good answer for each galaxy. \n&gt; Seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the idea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npaid off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I&#39;ve looked at some of these galaxies and the=\r\nre&#39;s a lof of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; variation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; general noise and mess in these i=\r\nmages, and apart from that \n&gt; some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fairly vague. =\r\nHowever, Joe Public + professional astronomers \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; with some of these images also and now we potentially have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; databa=\r\nse (don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know if it&#39;s all public yet) that quantifies which images=\r\n are \n&gt; hard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clasify (by humans).
