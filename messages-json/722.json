I\n&gt; think the natural motion\n&gt; thing shows this can be done, but what&#39;s interesting\n&gt; is the simplicity of\n&gt; their neural representation.  It suggests that you\n&gt; could get much more sophisticated\n&gt; behaviors if you did the same thing with NEAT and\n&gt; let it run a long time.\n\nSo far this semester I&#39;ve been trying to develop a\nsolid, expandable framework that I can use to study\nthe more important stuff (neural net inputs, evolution\nparameters, fitness functions).  Now I&#39;m putting the\nfinishing touches on the joint proportional derivative\ncontrollers.  Here&#39;s my to-do list:\n\n* data visualization (networks, speciation)\n* XML data storage\n* better human model using actual data for joint\nlimits, body part location/size/center of mass, etc.\n* more fitness functions\n* better neural net inputs\n\n&gt; One thing I thought of was eventually coevolving\n&gt; them to try to knock each other over,\n&gt; like a fighting simulation.  Then you could even\n&gt; play against one the evolved \n&gt; fighters and it might make an interesting game,\n&gt; where punches and kicks are\n&gt; real and the bodies actually have to try to keep\n&gt; balance.\n\nThat would be awesome.  I daydream about cool fitness\nfunctions like this... once the basics have been\naccomplished.  Here&#39;s my wist list of possible fitness\nfunctions to try:\n\n* standing, jumping, walking\n* breaking through walls\n* stacking boxes to build towers\n* throwing things at an object to knock it down\n* pushing others off of a platform (�king of the\nmountain�)\n* recognizing shapes (present human with a shape, take\nit away, then place several shapes around and have\nthem walk toward the correct shape)\n* swimming\n* staying balanced amidst an earthquake\n* staying balanced with unpredictable ground friction\n* staying balanced with unpredictable wind direction\nand magnitude\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nWin a $20,000 Career Makeover at Yahoo!
