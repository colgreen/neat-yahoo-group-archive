I noticed that in different experiments there \nare different parame=\r\nter values, but I don&#39;t know why, though they are \nfound experimentally, th=\r\nere should be something that tells you the \nrange of a parameter in a certa=\r\nin experiment. \nBack to my problem, I used the same parameter setting as DP=\r\nM, but \ncould not get a satisfied answer, and I thought the output I need w=\r\nas \nsimilar to DPM. Could you tell me why? I had not expected that you \nwou=\r\nld reply so fast, morning.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot;=\r\n \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well basically you need to understand h=\r\now two genotypes (NNs) are \n&gt; compared so that it is determined whether the=\r\ny are in the same \n&gt; species or not. \n&gt; The total number of excess and disj=\r\noint genes is counted, as well \nas \n&gt; the average weight difference of matc=\r\nhing genes. These 3 values are \n&gt; then multiplied by their importance facto=\r\nrs and summed up to \nproduce \n&gt; the distance value. If that distance value =\r\nis less than the \n&gt; compatibility threshold, then the genotypes are in the =\r\nsame \nspecies, \n&gt; else they are in two separate species.\n&gt; So what you need=\r\n to adjust is the importance factors and the \n&gt; compatibility threshold. \n&gt;=\r\n There is no general rule on how to adjust the importance factors, \nbut \n&gt; =\r\nnotice that if you set them all to 1.0, this basically means that a \n&gt; weig=\r\nht difference of 1.0 is as important as one excess or one \n&gt; disjoint gene.=\r\n (I assume that the numbers of excess/disjoint genes \n&gt; are absolute, they =\r\nare not divided by genome size). \n&gt; You can also make the compatibility tre=\r\nshold dynamic, that is, \nchoose \n&gt; a target number of species and alter the=\r\n compatibility threshold \neach \n&gt; generation, if there are too many species=\r\n, raise it, or lower it if \n&gt; there are too few. \n\n\n\n"}}
