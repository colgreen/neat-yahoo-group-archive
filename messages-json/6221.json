Measure all three separately, and then place the\n&gt;&gt; genome in a 3D cube where each metric represents an axis in 3D space.\n[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Colin,\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea you write about in the above paragraph is very similar to the MOLE algorithm Jean-&gt; Baptiste Mouret, Hod Lipson, and I introduce in our paper The Evolutionary Origins of\n&gt; Modularity. Check out Figure 3:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://jeffclune.com/publications/2013-CluneEtAl-EvolutionaryOriginsModularity-RoyalSociety.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; Does that seem like what you are talking about?\n\nYes! (sorry for the response delay).\n\nAlso I quite like that 8 pixel retina task. Simple enough to be fast\nto evaluate as well as understand/explain, but difficult enough to be\nchallenging.\n\n\n\n&gt; PS. We also have a summary of some other MOLE work here: http://jeffclune.com/publications/MouretClune-MoleTwoPageAbstract.pdf\n\nThanks for the links. Is there further work in this area? (maybe I\nneed to go back through the last few months posts?)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
