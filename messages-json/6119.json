Please don&#39;t take it as\noverly critical - I&#39;m much more interes=\r\nted in the issue of where an\nunquestioning drive towards quantification wil=\r\nl lead us, so I&#39;m just\nexploring that issue through your suggestions. I res=\r\npect your view and\nunderstand that many share it.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;rhiever489&quot; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Jeff,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, but those statements are a=\r\n bit &quot;cowboy science-y.&quot; Let me show\nyou\n&gt; how those statements can (and li=\r\nkely will) be translated:\n&gt; &quot;A single (non-reproduced?) study has suggested=\r\n that targeted\nevolution\n&gt; does not work very well (with Picbreeder?). Our =\r\nmethod can achieve an\n&gt; error of zero (data not shown). Thus, comparing our=\r\n method with\ntargeted\n&gt; evolution is pointless.&quot;\n&gt; Performing such a quanti=\r\ntative comparison would kill two birds with\none\n&gt; stone: (1) it reproduces =\r\nthe findings that Ken made* in a 3D domain,\nand\n&gt; (2) it would address the =\r\nreaders&#39; concerns related to the goal of the\n&gt; paper, particularly by direc=\r\ntly showing that your method produces more\n&gt; accurate CPPN-based representa=\r\ntions of 3D objects than the &quot;leading&quot;\n&gt; (only) method. For a methods paper=\r\n, that is an important statement to\n&gt; make. Thus, there is value in making =\r\na quantitative comparison here,\nand\n&gt; it&#39;s not an arbitrary checkbox.\n&gt; * I=\r\n&#39;m not suggesting that Ken did/does bad or unreliable work, but\n&gt; reproduci=\r\nng results that you&#39;re building off of is an important part\nof\n&gt; science --=\r\n especially when you&#39;re applying those results in a new\ndomain\n&gt; (2D object=\r\ns vs. 3D objects).\n&gt;\n\nSo you really would prefer that Jeff would fill up se=\r\nveral pages of this\nshort paper instead with a comparison between his new m=\r\nethod and a\nreproduction of my old target-based evolution experiment with B=\r\nrian\nWoolley, even though that&#39;s not the subject of this paper? Jeff&#39;s\nmeth=\r\nod for reproducing these objects is not an optimization method so of\ncourse=\r\n it is essentially perfect, so why bother comparing it to an\noptimization m=\r\nethod? The point of this paper is what happens once you\nevolve beyond such =\r\nreproductions, not the perfection of the\nreproductions themselves.\n\nIf you =\r\nwere a reviewer and succeeded in forcing Jeff to switch this\npaper to inclu=\r\nde such a comparison, do you really think the resulting\nloss of text on the=\r\n real topic of the paper (i.e. what happens after you\nevolve further) would=\r\n not actually reduce its value?\n\nThis suggested change might be an example =\r\nof how demanding\nquantification where it is unneeded can actually damage a =\r\npaper and\ndistort its original intent, but I&#39;m curious how you see it.\n\n&gt; I=\r\nt&#39;s a really bad assumption (that many of us make) that someone will\n&gt; want=\r\n to follow up on our work. Yes, it&#39;s good to point out future\n&gt; research di=\r\nrections from the work, but the mindset that everyone will\n&gt; want to follow=\r\n up on our work can be damaging to the research field.\n&gt; Everyone wants to =\r\nbe the thought leader and establish a &quot;new&quot; research\n&gt; path, and that&#39;s why=\r\n we see so many people establishing new research\n&gt; platforms and whatnot ev=\r\nery year and talking about all the cool\nresearch\n&gt; that it enables. Then by=\r\n the next year, that platform has fallen into\n&gt; obscurity because no one wa=\r\nnted to actually do that future work, and\n&gt; thus no one really learned anyt=\r\nhing from the paper introducing that\n&gt; research platform.\n&gt; That&#39;s a big re=\r\nason why I think qualitative/methods/proof of concept\n&gt; papers (whatever yo=\r\nu want to call them -- they&#39;re the same) are not\nvery\n&gt; useful to publish a=\r\ns full papers, and are better suited as a poster or\n&gt; late-breaking abstrac=\r\nt.\n&gt;\n\nThese sentiments surprised me. Why is it a bad assumption that someon=\r\ne\nwould want to follow up on your work? What is the point of publishing\nsom=\r\nething if you assume that no one would want to follow up on it? What\ncould =\r\nbe more important than what might come next thanks to your\ncontribution? If=\r\n anything I&#39;d like to see longer future work sections\nso I have some idea w=\r\nhy people think their ideas are important.\n\nI&#39;m also not clear on why a pro=\r\nof of concept should be relegated to a\nposter. After all, there&#39;s only one =\r\nproof-of-concept in the known\nuniverse of evolution producing human intelli=\r\ngence and it inspired our\nentire research field.\n\nIf I evolved a single Hyp=\r\nerNEAT neural network with human-level\nintelligence but could not do it aga=\r\nin, would you prefer that the result\nremains reported only in a poster? Wou=\r\nld you question the capabilities\nof HyperNEAT because it &quot;only&quot; evolved hum=\r\nan-level intelligence once?\n\nPersonally I think our field will be forced to=\r\n shift inevitably to more\nproofs of concept because evolution at its most i=\r\nmpressive doesn&#39;t like\ndoing cool stuff more than once. No interesting imag=\r\ne on Picbreeder\nwill ever be discovered again. No creature on Earth will ev=\r\ner evolve\nagain in the history of the planet. Finding something once is goo=\r\nd\nenough for me to want to know about it, and often will be as good as it\ng=\r\nets. The fact that human intelligence evolved once is amazing enough\nand me=\r\nrits thousands of research articles, as it has indeed provoked.\n\nBest,\n\nken=\r\n\n\nNo virus found in this message.\nChecked by AVG - www.avg.com\nVersion: 201=\r\n3.0.3343 / Virus Database: 3184/6378 - Release Date: 06/02/13\n\n\n"}}
