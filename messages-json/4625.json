I u=\r\nnderstand your concern. It&#39;s certainly a valid one.\n\n(I could be totally wr=\r\nong. I wish I paid more attention in my statistical mechanics class.)\n\nFrom=\r\n my understanding of the talk, each pre-training abstract the representatio=\r\nns from the inputs of the previous layer. So even if the original layer of =\r\ninput is individual pixel, it&#39;s very possible that the 2nd or the 3rd layer=\r\n contains geometry representations. Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine it will do w=\r\nell in generating such a wide variety of styles of digits.\n\nIf we want to u=\r\nse this network on tasks of different resolutions, I&#39;m willing to hypothesi=\r\nze that we can just chop off the pixel layer, attach a higher resolution in=\r\nput layer, and retrain only the new connections.\n\nBetter yet, re-train thos=\r\ne connections using hyperNeat.\n\nDoes that sound sensable?\n\n\n"}}
