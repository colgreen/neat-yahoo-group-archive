The primary objective envisioned being \nthe evolution of a =\r\nsupervisor network which controls the trans-\ngenerational parameters normal=\r\nly contained in the &quot;.ne&quot; file, for the \nexpress purpose accelerating the u=\r\nnderlying arbitrary user task \nevolution.\n\nSubsequent to the selection of c=\r\nandidate inputs, the output would be \nthe genome of said supervisor, tested=\r\n against a baseline of experiments \nto evaluate added utility, where the co=\r\noperative contribution would be \nindividual champion genomes from users, ev=\r\nolved against their pet \nexperiments, for the purpose of expanding the gene=\r\nrality of the \nsupervisor network genome. The generality of the effort has =\r\nthe \npotential to benifit the entire community of users, while maintaining =\r\n\nthe absence of any specifics regarding the arbitrary user specific \ntasks.=\r\n\n\nAny thoughts or suggests.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
