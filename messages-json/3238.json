I elaborate a bit below each \npart of=\r\n your question:\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason or Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt;    I am attempting to understand the nature of inpu=\r\nts & outputs as \n&gt; applied to both the Hypercube and substrate networks, wi=\r\nthout being \n&gt; limited to the geometric nature of the visual-based examples=\r\n. The \n&gt; examples provided were helpful, but I am striving for a more \ngene=\r\nral \n&gt; guideline for application to more general problems.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Would it=\r\n be correct to say that:\n&gt; \n&gt; (a) Substrate Network: Inputs & Outputs ident=\r\nified as typical to \n&gt; application of conventional NEAT to a problem of int=\r\nerest;\n&gt; \n\nThis statement is correct although you might do things that you =\r\nwould \navoid doing in conventional NEAT because HyperNEAT can deal with so =\r\n\nmany more inputs and outputs.  So you might for example output a high \nres=\r\nolution representation of your possible decisions, which is \nsomething you =\r\nnormally wouldn&#39;t do in regular NEAT.\n\n&gt; (b) Hypercube Network: (i) Inputs:=\r\n Other descriptors/parameters \n(i.e. \n&gt; geometric coordinates being a subse=\r\nt thereof), associated with a \ngiven \n&gt; substrate network node (i.e. like a=\r\n timestamp associated with a \n&gt; coordinate point comprising a trajectory), =\r\nmutually exclusive of \nthe \n&gt; descriptor/parameter expressly identified in =\r\nthe substrate node, \neach \n&gt; being collected together and collectively iden=\r\ntified as either \na &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;to&quot; terminator of a link between any two =\r\nsubstrate nodes; and \n(ii) \n&gt; Output: Weight of link between the currently =\r\nidentified &quot;from&quot; \nand &quot;to&quot; \n&gt; substrate nodes.\n&gt; \n\nI think this characteri=\r\nzes it well, although there is even more \nflexibility.  You can for example=\r\n use additional outputs on the CPPN \nto represent additional attributes of =\r\nlinks and/or nodes.  \n\nThe timestamp idea is interesting- if I understand c=\r\norrectly it would \ncause the network to change over time in a deterministic=\r\n way.  \nAlthough maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding.  But certainly things like tha=\r\nt \nare possible.  \n\nIt&#39;s difficult to write an accurate general description=\r\n of exactly \nwhat goes in and comes out of the CPPN at this point because I=\r\n have \nno doubt that at this early stage that new ideas are going to broade=\r\nn \nthe possibilities beyond what I am currently aware of.   But what you \ns=\r\naid captures it pretty well for now.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
