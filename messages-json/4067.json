From reading the published papers, I\ncan&#39;t find a pe=\r\nnalty for using HyperNEAT even if NEAT by itself may\nsuffice.  Am I correct=\r\n here?\n\n--Todd\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There are other benefits to HyperNEAT that have nothing to do with\ngeo=\r\nmetry,\n&gt; no? It is an indirect encoding, and thus is more likely to create\n=\r\nmodular\n&gt; phenotypes that exhibit repetitions and symmetry (with and withou=\r\nt\n&gt; variation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Unless I am mistaken, these benefits can cause HyperNE=\r\nAT to\noutperform NEAT\n&gt; even on problems where geometry is not being exploi=\r\nted.
