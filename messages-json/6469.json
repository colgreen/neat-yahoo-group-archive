I=E2=80=99d=\r\n love to hear your summary!\n&gt;\n\nOK I&#39;ll give it a shot.\n\nI&#39;m picturing a  2D=\r\n landscape where x and y are the search variables,\nand z is the fitness. We=\r\n pick a point, calc the gradient w.r.t. x and\ny respectively, and move the =\r\npoint along x proportionally to x&#39;s\ngradient, and along y proportionally to=\r\n y&#39;s gradient. So [I think] the\nGD path matches that of a hockey puck slidi=\r\nng down our surface under\ngravity (sort of... for one, the puck has no mome=\r\nntum).\n\nThe gradient doesn&#39;t tell us how far is a good amount to move at ea=\r\nch\nstep, only how far to move in an axis relative to all other axes,\nhence =\r\nwe introduce a global learning rate (to convert those\nproportions to absolu=\r\nte step deltas). The learning rate has to be\nfound experimentally.\n\nSo far =\r\nthis is just plain GD.\n\nQuestion: Does it necessarily follow that we should=\r\n move faster along\na steep gradient than a shallower one?\n\nSay the x-axis g=\r\nradient is steep, and y describes a long shallow\ndescent. Plain GD is prett=\r\ny much stationary w.r.t y; it moves along x\nto the bottom of a valley. We n=\r\now stop moving in x but don&#39;t move any\nfaster in y (assuming there&#39;s still =\r\na y gradient at our new location).\n\nRMSProp follows *all* *steady* gradient=\r\ns at the same speed, regardless\nof steepness. Why? because the step size is=\r\n no longer proportional to\ngradient, but instead is proportional to:\n\n(1)  =\r\n   gradient / mean_of_recent_gradients\n\n(actually the recent gradients are =\r\nsquared to eliminate the sign,\naveraged, and *then* we take the square root=\r\n, hence Root Mean Squared\n(RMS-Prop).\n\nSo if the gradient is consistent ove=\r\nr recent history then equation (1)\ncomes to about 1. If however a gradient =\r\nfluctuates a lot then (1) is &lt;\n1 (again, the squaring of the historic gradi=\r\nents is important there).\nAnd if a gradient steadily increases, then it is =\r\ngreater than its\nrecent history and equation (1) is &gt; 1. But I think the tw=\r\no key cases\nare - consistent versus fluctuating.\n\nA gradient that changes a=\r\n lot probably means we need to slow down\nmoving along that axis, but a cons=\r\nistent gradient probably means we\nshould speed up (plain RMSProp doesn&#39;t do=\r\n that really, but you can add\nmomentum to it).\n\nHere are some nice animatio=\r\nns I found that might help demonstrate the\ndifference in pathways of GD ver=\r\nsus RMSProp:\n\n    http://imgur.com/a/Hqolp\n\n\nThere are some other related d=\r\nevelopments I could go into, but I think\nthat covers the basics for now.\n\nF=\r\ninal point, there&#39;s some evidence that saddle points are the dominant\ntype =\r\nof surface that occur in GD of weights in a neural net, i.e.\npoints were th=\r\nere is no strong gradient in any direction - and that&#39;s\nprecisely the scena=\r\nrio where RMSProp moves quickly along a slope and\nexits the saddle. If we h=\r\nad simply tried to speed up the exit by\nincreasing our global learning rate=\r\n, then the size of the steps would\nbecome far too large once we exited the =\r\nsaddle.\n\nThat&#39;s all far more verbose than I was hoping for. If I&#39;d had more=\r\n\ntime I would have written a shorter email! :)\n\nAnyway hope some of it made=\r\n sense!\n\nColin\n\n"}}
