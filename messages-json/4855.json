So there is no example where one output neuron is =\r\nactive with an other output neuron. But I still want to get a percentage di=\r\nstribution. \n\nNow I expected to get a output distribution like:\n\n33%, 33%, =\r\n33%\n\nBut most of the time I get:\n\n100%, 0%, 0%\n0%, 100%, 0%\n0%, 0%, 100%\n\nI=\r\n think it is a matter of the fitness function.\n\nI use the following method:=\r\n\n\nThe fitness for one training data is the sum of the correct decisions.\nSo=\r\n when neuron A is correct and neat says A 100%, it gets 1.0 fitness for thi=\r\ns test data. If it says it is B, then it gets 0 fitness. I sum this up and =\r\ndivide it by the example count. So when it says it is 50% A, then it would =\r\nget 0.5 fitness and so on.\n\nBut the network still only favorites one decisi=\r\non.\nI tried to favorites correct decisions log(hit ratio), but this does no=\r\nt change anything.\n\nWhen the input data is exactly the same and I have 6 ti=\r\nmes A, 3 times B and 1 time C as correct output, then I want 60%, 30%, 10% =\r\nand not always 100% for A.\n\nWhat can I change to achieve such a percentage =\r\ndistribution?\nI think it has nothing to do with other neat parameters but t=\r\nhe fitness function. With my fitness function the fitness would be the same=\r\n if it says always 100%, 0%, 0% or if it says 60%, 30%, 10%.\n\nWhat shall I =\r\ndo?\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n\n\n"}}
