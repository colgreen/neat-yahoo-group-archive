There is alot of really good research going on at this \nschool, and since about 2/3rds of the course is research based there are \nalot of good opportunities for advisors.\n\nThe course website is here:\nhttp://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/msc-nc/\n\nAdditionally, it only takes 1 year for a master&#39;s degree over here - which \nis a good thing because it does tend to be rather expensive in the UK. The \ncourse was designed to identify good researchers, with a strong push to \ncontinue on with a PhD. However, there are far fewer funding options for \namericans over here, which is why I&#39;m most likely not going to be able to \ncontinue on here after this year.\n\nThey also don&#39;t require an application fee nor do they look at your GRE \nscores (which was a good thing for me :)\n\nWhile there are probably better schools in the UK, there are only a very \nsmall number of schools that do a masters on natural computation, and I \nthink B&#39;ham is the best of those. B&#39;ham is a really good university, and \nsince its not at the very top of the pack in terms of publicity its waaaay \nmore relaxed and the professors and lecturers usually have alot more time \nto see you, etc (with the possible exception of Xin Yao ... but my \ncoursemate Arjun on \nthis list \ncould tell you more about that :).\n\nWhile the course was a tad rough around the edges, this is only the 3rd \nyear they&#39;ve offered it, and they are still improving it. With a couple of \nminor exceptions, I&#39;ve been extremely happy with the course and would \nrecommend it to anyone looking for the kind of thing you seem to be \nlooking for.\n\nFeel free to email me privately or on the list if you have any more \nspecific questions.\n\n-KB-\n\n\nOn Wed, 2 Jun 2004, Derek James wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just took the GRE last weekend, with an eye toward applying for \n&gt; graduate school.  I don&#39;t have a strong CS background, and I&#39;m not \n&gt; really interested in a PhD in computer science anyway.  What I&#39;d like \n&gt; is an interdisciplinary PhD program, in which I would spend as much \n&gt; time studying evolutionary biology and genetics as I would \n&gt; programming, or psychology, or neuroscience.\n&gt; \n&gt; UCSD looks like they&#39;ve got a great program.  I&#39;m looking at UT \n&gt; Austin, but I think I&#39;d have to pursue a CS degree there.  And I&#39;m \n&gt; looking at a couple of other schools.  I know Tyler has suggested the \n&gt; HCI program he&#39;s in at...is it Iowa State?\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;m curious to hear anyone else&#39;s experiences applying or \n&gt; attending graduate schools, and I&#39;d appreciate any advice anyone \n&gt; could give.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also don&#39;t mind living abroad.  I&#39;ve looked a bit at schools in \n&gt; Japan and the UK, but still don&#39;t know much.  There are a few brits \n&gt; on this list...anyone have any advice for an international student \n&gt; possibly interested in studying there?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
