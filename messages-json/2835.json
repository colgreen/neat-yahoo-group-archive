Thanks for having me, I find NEAT\n=\r\nquite fascinating.\n\nToday, despite the confounding effect of nearly no know=\r\nledge of\ncomputer programming, I opened up the sharpNEAT source code and tr=\r\ny to\nget a basic understanding of what&#39;s going on.  I wrote my own little\ne=\r\nxperiment as a trial, basically copying another experiment&#39;s files\nwith min=\r\nor changes into my own experiment folder and modifying the\napp.config file =\r\nso it would show up on the dropdown experiment list...\nso far so good.\n\nNex=\r\nt up is to try to figure out how to take the neural net that is\nevolved and=\r\n apply it to some out of sample data, and this is where I&#39;m\nbogged down.  H=\r\now can I create a file that opens up a neural net that\nwas previously saved=\r\n, apply some given inputs, and give me the output?\n Is there some sample co=\r\nde already in the source code that might point\nme in the right direction?\n\n=\r\nSimilarly, is there a way to start a NEAT process without going\nthrough the=\r\n GUI?  I&#39;m sure this is possible, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a\nlot more complica=\r\nted than my first question?\n\nThanks,\nMatt\n\n\n\n"}}
