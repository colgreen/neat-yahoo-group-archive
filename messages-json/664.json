When I first read the title, I \nimagined a slightly different approach.  You might call what I imagined the \n&quot;omnipresent eye&quot; [OE] in contrast to the actual roving eye [RE] approach....\n\n\tAn OE approach would consist of iterating a single network over every \npossible position (and orientation and mirroring) on the board, recording a \nsingle output.  Then playing at the position where the output was highest.\n\n\tThis has a weakness of locality (it cannot bring data from further afield \nthan the radius of the eye) but the strength that it will consider every \nlocation on the board in every turn (and, for efficiency,  you can cache \nvalues for positions where no new stones were placed since the last turn).\n\n\tHowever, I don&#39;t believe in the paper you documented any measurements of \nhow much information was carried over from one eye position to the next?\n\n&lt;&lt;Interesting side-note _is_ there any mathematical theory which would give \nus such a measure, e.g. if we populate an eye&#39;s inputs at one board \nposition, we can suppose that all nodes which the evaluation wave has \nreached are 100% filled with data from this position.  If we move the eye \nto another position and run another update, is there some maths we can do \nwith the weights to tell us what proportion of the data in each node came \nfrom this position and how much is left form the last.  Obviously this can \nonly apply where there is recurrence.  My first thought is just to \ncalculate it as if the data was solutions mixing, thus you&#39;d just multiply \nthe current &quot;concentration&quot; of data from each source by the connection \nweightings and renormalise to keep the overall &quot;quantity&quot; of data \nconstant.  This would allow contributions to decay to less than 1 bit but...&gt;&gt;\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
