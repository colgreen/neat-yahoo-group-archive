As soon as the\n&gt; &quot;ready&quot; output is \n&gt; &gt; high, then you are done, and you take all of the\n&gt; other outputs as \n&gt; &gt; your result. High could be defined as&gt; .5. I think\n&gt; this is a \n&gt; &gt; general approach that applies to many problems.\n&gt; Essentially, you are \n&gt; &gt; letting the nework tell you when it is done\n&gt; processing. I have used \n&gt; &gt; this approach in two programs, and it worked\n&gt; perfectly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you describe the progams? This sounds like the\n&gt; group confidence \n&gt; topic that came up earlier. \n\n4Play is one of them; it has been discussed here many\nweeks ago.  All of the C souce code can be downloaded\nfrom the ANNEvolve website, along with plenty of\ndocumentation.  It is all command line stuff, no\ngraphics.  In 4Play there were actually 4 &quot;ready&quot;\nlines; the processing was condidered done if any of\nthem went high.\n\nVizANN.py is a GUI program that demonstrates the\ndetailed operation of a 2-neuron recurrent binary ANN\nthat does XOR.  With this program you get to see the\nready output in action.\n\nThe weight sets for VizANN.py were evolved by a\nprogram which I call xor.c.  This is ready to release;\nI expect to release it very soon.  I think I will\nrelease it today! \n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
