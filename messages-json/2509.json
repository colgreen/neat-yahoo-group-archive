In this case, the additional \n&gt;complexity should be helping increase fitness, so it shouldn&#39;t be \n&gt;considered bloat.\n\nI also allow a new genome to replace an old one if they are of equal \nfitness (my current fitness scheme is quantized, so I get a lot of \nequal fitnesses).  I do this because it means that the population is \nchanging (e.g. searching) even when it is not making progress.\n\nAnybody have any thoughts on that vis-a-vis bloat?\n\n&gt;2) Now if we consider that some additive mutations are neutral then we\n&gt;can assume that these will get cloned and propagated through a\n&gt;population over time.\n&gt;3) Overall, mutation is more likely to find neutral additions than\n&gt;neutral deletions - assuming equal amount of both types.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What are your justifications for #3?\n\nI think he&#39;s thinking of the case where, if you have a genome where \nmost parts are functional, then the chances are that a deletion will \nbe deleterious.  In the same case, however, there is a good chance of \nan addition being neutral, because there is a good chance of an \naddition being functionless.   However, if we imagine that population \npersisting for some time, then it will acquire more and more \nnon-functional structure (for the reasons just outlined) and to my \nmind it ought to eventually arrive at an equilibrium point where the \nchances for adding or deleting structure are roughly \nequal.  Personally I have never seen that, however....\n\nNow!  Here&#39;s an analysis that might explain the situation, and \nsure-enough, I think the explanation comes down to crossover.\n\n--\n\nSuppose that we think about some subset of a population.  Without \ncrossover we can imagine that this subset will come to an equilibrium \npoint where there is enough non-functional structure that deletion \nhas increased to match additions.\n\nTo reach this point, the subset will have acquired some set, A of \nnon-functional genes (a1, a2, a3...).\n\nOK, now suppose that another subset of the population is also at \nequilibrium, it will also have a set of non-functional genes B (b1, b2, b3...).\n\nNow, what are the chances that the sets A and B contain the same \ngenes?  Essentially zero!\n\nSo, as soon as there is a crossover between A and B, if the new \nindividual is keeping a significant number of the unmatched genes, it \nwill immediately have a greater than equilibrium proportion of \nnon-functional genes.\n\n--\n\nObviously in reality there is no neat subdivision of the population \ninto completely disjunct subpopulations, but I think I have \nillustrated an extreme case and that the more general interpretation would be:\n\n1) as long as two breeding individuals each have some gene unmatched \nin the other, then the offspring will be bigger than either parent.\n2) the more different the two parents are, then the more we might \nexpect the offspring to grow by.\n\n--\n\nI&#39;m thinking this brings me back around to my idea of not taking all \nunmatched genes regardless.  Do we think that with a 50% change of \nkeeping each unmatched gene, that will balance things.  e.g. if we \nassume that each individual is contributing roughly the same number \nof them, then simple arithmetic should suggest we have twice as many \nas we need, so halving them...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
