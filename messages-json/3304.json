The node placement schemes can be i=\r\nmplemented in a \nsimilar \n&gt; way as vector graphics is. Ken, I will do some =\r\nstudy on these \n&gt; algorithms. \n&gt; \n&gt; I already have a substrate class, capab=\r\nle of generating a parralel \n&gt; (layered, like most drawings of backprop net=\r\ns), circular and a \nmatrix-\n&gt; like layers of nodes in 3D, given the node co=\r\nunts for each layer. \n&gt; I&#39;ll add spherical, cubic and perhaps even random s=\r\nuch schemes. \n&gt; \n&gt; I like the idea of taking apart the substrate from the C=\r\nPPN-NEAT \n&gt; stuff. They are no similar things at all. It sucks to have your=\r\n \n&gt; experimental application generate the substrate in some algorithmic \n&gt; =\r\nway. \n&gt; There should be a stand-alone app that deals with substrates, and \n=\r\n&gt; another one that runs the evolution and is experiment-specific. \nThis \n&gt; =\r\nis more flexible. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently running experiments with leaky-integ=\r\nrator networks, \n&gt; the CPPNs have 3 outputs and when the biases and time co=\r\nnstants are \n&gt; computed, the (x1, y1, 1.0) are used only (others are set to=\r\n 0.0). \n&gt; This was a suggestion that Ken told me, and I want to thank him f=\r\nor \n&gt; this, because I see this is the right way to evolve node properties \n=\r\n&gt; along with connections with the same connective CPPN :) \n&gt; \n&gt; So the GUI =\r\nI am planning will possibly include CTRNN substrates as \n&gt; well. \n&gt; \n&gt; As s=\r\noon as I have it working, I will send the application & source \nin \n&gt; the f=\r\niles section.
