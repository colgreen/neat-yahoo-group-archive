I never said you should not be asking\nquestion=\r\ns.  What I said was that you should change your tone.  It&#39;s\nthe tone of voi=\r\nce that is the problem.  \n\nLet&#39;s take this offline since it is a distractio=\r\nn for the group. \nPlease send me an email and I will address your concerns =\r\nthere.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; The concept of &quot;NEAT&quot;, that you have shared with the rest of us,=\r\n is a \n&gt; worthy and substantial contribution worthy of praise. And I have \n=\r\n&gt; openly stated as much on more than one occasion. But as I am sure \n&gt; that=\r\n you are aware, a concept once let loose, is free to become more \n&gt; that wh=\r\nat may have been originally envisioned. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am indeed aware of the work=\r\n involved in using NEAT for everyday \n&gt; engineering tasks, and making subst=\r\nantial upgrades to the source code \n&gt; infrastructure to unlock its potentia=\r\nl (i.e. greater than a man-year).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m confident in the statement that =\r\neach proposed update suggested to \n&gt; date has already been accomplished (on=\r\n NEAT, not HyperNEAT). It would \n&gt; be an error to assume otherwise. So I ha=\r\nve more than a concept of \n&gt; whats involved.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem, if you want =\r\nto characterize it as such, is that my \n&gt; efforts are directed towards ever=\r\nyday engineering tasks which are not \n&gt; public in nature, and the burden of=\r\n writing papers is substantially \n&gt; greater than just the writing. The expe=\r\nriments are the everyday jobs \n&gt; that need to get done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your efforts a=\r\nre not unappreciated. But when you put something \n&gt; forward with associated=\r\n claims, its reasonable to assume that you \n&gt; have done your homework and a=\r\nre in a position to answer reasonable \n&gt; questions as they relate to your c=\r\nlaims.\n&gt; \n&gt; Asking questions such as:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) What benchmarks against known=\r\n quantities, have you made \n&gt; comparisons against your claims, to help us u=\r\nnderstand where in the \n&gt; AI landscape we should place your claims,\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)=\r\n What computational cost comparisons have you performed against \n&gt; other kn=\r\nown quantities, to help us understand what the costs of your \n&gt; claims are.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; These are not adversarial questions. They are the normal types of \n&gt; =\r\nquestions that are routinely addressed in the body of a technical \n&gt; paper =\r\nor presentation making various claims.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you fail to answer the quest=\r\nions up front in the technical \n&gt; presentation/paper itself, it is reasonab=\r\nle to expect follow-on \n&gt; questions in an attempt to nail these issues down=\r\n. If you neglect to \n&gt; answer these questions, it is also a reasonable expe=\r\nctation others \n&gt; will wonder why.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my opinion that the concept o=\r\nf NEAT has so much more potential \n&gt; than you have exercised publically to =\r\ndate. \n&gt; \n&gt; For whatever your reasons are, perhaps as simple as alignment w=\r\nith \n&gt; research interests, you have left a lot on the table. And that is \n&gt;=\r\n your right. It would just be more helpful to all if you would be more \n&gt; f=\r\northcoming in regards to the bounds of your agenda, and provide \n&gt; reasonab=\r\nle answers to questions related to your claims and \n&gt; presentations, so tha=\r\nt they may be promptly and properly classified, \n&gt; rather than discovering =\r\nthem after the fact in a protracted manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody said being the big =\r\ndog was easy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; Andy Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The lack of scientific/method=\r\nical approach in demonstrating \n&gt; ability \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to discover patterns, a pr=\r\niori known patterns, before attempting \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrate a &quot;killer-a=\r\npplication&quot;, for which there is no known \n&gt; &gt; &gt; figure of merit to compare =\r\n&quot;ability to discover patterns&quot;, is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing, and expecting an inor=\r\ndinate level of faith on the \n&gt; part of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the reader.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n lack of any comparative computational cost data is equally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disturbi=\r\nng, and begs the question, especially since there appears \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be a=\r\n growing body of user experience that the computational cost \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nteep. But the information should be up-front going in rather \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n withheld and unanswered.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Andy, I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s bo=\r\nthering you.  You express\n&gt; &gt; impatience that every possible question has n=\r\not been answered within\n&gt; &gt; one year of the debut of a completely new metho=\r\ndology.  It verges on\n&gt; &gt; paranoia to suggest that we are &quot;withholding&quot; inf=\r\normation (the \n&gt; source\n&gt; &gt; code is released; anyone can perform any experi=\r\nment that they \n&gt; wish). \n&gt; &gt; I suppose you just don&#39;t realize how much eff=\r\nort goes into running\n&gt; &gt; experiments and writing papers. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Notice =\r\nthat others in this group ask questions that are couched as\n&gt; &gt; friendly di=\r\nscussion.  Yet you take the attitude that someone is \n&gt; hiding\n&gt; &gt; somethin=\r\ng from you and you are therefore &quot;disturbed.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You should change =\r\nyour tone.  Instead of attacking the source for \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; having answered =\r\nevery question that you have and performed every\n&gt; &gt; experiment that you pe=\r\nrsonally believe we should ever perform, why \n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; put it more like, &quot;=\r\nIt would be interesting to see if...&quot;  or &quot;One\n&gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;d like to p=\r\nerform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting question \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; whether...&quot; In other w=\r\nords, what is accomplished by your aggressive,\n&gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I remember hearing once, though I do not remember the source, an=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; interesting quote on scientific research.  To paraphrase: &quot;Good\n&gt; &gt; sc=\r\nientific research answers hard questions.  However, the best\n&gt; &gt; scientific=\r\n research raises entirely new questions that we never \n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; have eve=\r\nn asked before.&quot;  Think of quantum physics.  The uncertainty\n&gt; &gt; principle =\r\nhas led to endless discussion of paradoxes and\n&gt; &gt; impossibilities, with no=\r\n end in sight, but we do not see people\n&gt; &gt; accusing Heisenberg of trying t=\r\no hide the &quot;truth.&quot;  Instead, it is a\n&gt; &gt; credit to his discovery that we a=\r\nre now asking such profound \n&gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So let me suggest to you=\r\n that you change your tone and drop the\n&gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor.  That=\r\n is not an appropriate way to speak \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; colleagues, or to anyone else=\r\n for that matter, and I sincerely hope \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; maintain the exceptional p=\r\nositive atmosphere this group has \n&gt; maintained\n&gt; &gt; throughout 5 years (bel=\r\nieve it or not!) of fruitful and interesting\n&gt; &gt; discussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let m=\r\ne also add that I am not the moderator (who is Derek James, who\n&gt; &gt; has don=\r\ne an excellent job), and therefore this is just my personal\n&gt; &gt; suggestion.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
