The problem: There\nare too many opportunities, and too little time. My work deals with\nmassively parallel computer clusters, especially using TWEANNs like\nHyperNEAT to configure compute fabrics for MPP. I use tools like Azure and\nEucalyptus for configuring these clusters for private clouds, normally for\ncollaborative scientific research. FWIS, I&#39;m also the founder of the New\nMexico Azure Users Group. \n \nWe are at a point of discovery where we are learning about all this &quot;stuff&quot;\nall at once, which is a little uncomfortable because most of the issues you\nraise are complex-coupled, and honestly not very well understood (at least\nby me). It is possible to proceed too fast in identifying the fundamental\nconcepts and make erroneous assumptions - like how one parallelizes\nHyperNEAT experiments (either on traditional clusters, or hybrid,\nheterogeneous clusters that use GPUs as part of the compute fabric).  There\nhave been several times when I thought I understood this process, only to\nfind I had to explain the perplexing counter-examples. (I am currently using\na third cousin derivative of HyperNEAT trying to evolve consistent patterns\nthat point to answers of parallelization on various topologies, as well as\nthe topology configuration itself.)  \n \nHere&#39;s the problem as I see it.  Most developers haven&#39;t learned the art of\nparallel programming to an adequate level, yet.  The concepts of\neffectively, and efficiently unrolling task loops and partitioning the data\nstructures for genetically-inspired algorithms are complicated.  To do this\nright, I&#39;ve found this probably cannot be hard-coded into the software to\naccommodate all experiments I run (thus, my use of TWEANNs to discover\neffective patterns). Since the compute fabric and the experiment are closely\ncoupled, this is currently just beyond my grasp (hopefully a temporary\nsituation).\n \nOthers may have already solved this problem - but I haven&#39;t seen it. And\napparently many folks in supercomputing haven&#39;t either.\n \nThe &quot;Other&quot; Ken\n \nKen Lloyd\nDirector of Systems Science at Watt Systems Technologies Inc.\nAlbuquerque, NM USA\n \n\n\n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Ken\nSent: Sunday, November 22, 2009 3:38 PM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [neat] Re: F# NEAT\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nJeff, makes sense, thanks for the clarification.

There was talk at PDC about the use of\n&gt; agents in F# to accomplish parallelism across different boxes. But there&#39;s\n&gt; no support for that yet and I don&#39;t see any reason that the same concepts\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be applied to C# or the other languages when/if they show up. Of\n&gt; course, it&#39;s probably just all the marketing hype that I&#39;ve been exposed\nto\n&gt; talking, but MS was pushing Azure (their cloud solution) very hard this\n&gt; year. It&#39;s tempting to imagine writing a version of NEAT that could run on\n&gt; Azure. Has the potential for exposing vast computing resources for\n&gt; relatively little coin. Of course, at this point, if you were going to\n&gt; develop something for Azure (or something similar), there are better\n&gt; languages than F# (probably C# for Azure and java for just about anything\n&gt; else - amazon EC2, hadoop, etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Nov 22, 2009 at 5:19 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeff, I&#39;m not familiar enough with F# to judge whether it is well-suited\n&gt; &gt; for NEAT or not.

I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea in my\nhead\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time of doing an implementation of NEAT in F#. For the\n&gt; &gt; uninitiated, F#\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is MS&#39;s functional .NET solution to the manycore system. It is\n&gt; &gt; completely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interoperable with C#/VB and can use the .NET framework. I&#39;m still\n&gt; &gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely ramped up on it but it seems like it might be very well\n&gt; &gt; suited to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT. I was wondering what people think about this. Waste of time?\n&gt; &gt; Maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT would be better suited to hadoop or something like that.
