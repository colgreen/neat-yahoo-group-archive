I don&#39;t have a strong CS background, and I&#39;m not \nreally interested in a PhD in computer science anyway.  What I&#39;d like \nis an interdisciplinary PhD program, in which I would spend as much \ntime studying evolutionary biology and genetics as I would \nprogramming, or psychology, or neuroscience.\n\nUCSD looks like they&#39;ve got a great program.  I&#39;m looking at UT \nAustin, but I think I&#39;d have to pursue a CS degree there.  And I&#39;m \nlooking at a couple of other schools.  I know Tyler has suggested the \nHCI program he&#39;s in at...is it Iowa State?\n\nBut I&#39;m curious to hear anyone else&#39;s experiences applying or \nattending graduate schools, and I&#39;d appreciate any advice anyone \ncould give.\n\nI also don&#39;t mind living abroad.  I&#39;ve looked a bit at schools in \nJapan and the UK, but still don&#39;t know much.  There are a few brits \non this list...anyone have any advice for an international student \npossibly interested in studying there?\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
