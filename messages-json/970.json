I think it makes much more sense to try to\n&gt;only keep around mutations that show an immediate payoff for fitness,\n&gt;even if it is slight.\n\nIsn&#39;t this whole discussion moot?  Between fitness sharing, fixed size \npopulations, and selective reproduction, haven&#39;t we already biased things \ntowards mutations that are beneficial?\n\n\n\n"}}
