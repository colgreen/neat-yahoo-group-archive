The evolved topology and the weights are the \nmost important thing t=\r\no consider. \nI guess this topology can change? Maybe in time (leaky neurons=\r\n) or \nwith recurrent connections?\nThe idea of changing input topology for t=\r\nhe CPPN is like \nHyperHyperNEAT :) CPPNs that further create CPPNs..\n\nPeter=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n   It appears that you keep attempting to recast the substrate \ninputs \n&gt; a=\r\nnd outputs such that the hypercube input topology remains \nconstant. \n&gt; Not=\r\n taking anything away from HyperNEAT&#39;s ability to exploit \n1d/2d/3d \n&gt; geom=\r\netry in which the hypercube input topology remains constant, \nthe \n&gt; more g=\r\neneral question of when the hypercube input topology is not \n&gt; constant, wh=\r\nat do you do? Please address this specific issue. The \n&gt; answer to this que=\r\nstion will help to identify the \n&gt; applicability/limitations of HyperNEAT.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    Andy Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth S=\r\ntanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thomas, this is a great question that hi=\r\nghlights an important \narea \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; further research.  We can speculate=\r\n on the right approach in this \n&gt; case \n&gt; &gt; (and I have my hunches) but we =\r\nwon&#39;t know until we do some \n&gt; experiments \n&gt; &gt; and try ideas out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n To give some of my thoughts, perhaps the most obvious thing is \n&gt; similar =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to what you suggest:  Have two separate input sets, one for \n&gt; the &quot;ty=\r\npe A \n&gt; &gt; info&quot; and one for &quot;type B info.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The way this would lo=\r\nok is e.g. if A was 2D and B was 2D then the \n&gt; CPPN \n&gt; &gt; would have 4 inpu=\r\nts, 2 represent A source nodes and 2 \nrepresenting \n&gt; B \n&gt; &gt; soource nodes.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then, I would still have only one set of outputs.  I am still a \n=\r\n&gt; little \n&gt; &gt; unclear on why you say the outputs are from the second \nsubst=\r\nrate?  \n&gt; In \n&gt; &gt; my understanding, this is still all one substrate, it&#39;s j=\r\nust that \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; collects inputs from two different sources.  But it can=\r\n still \nexist \n&gt; &gt; with only one set of outputs.  So if the outputs are 2D,=\r\n the CPPN \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; have 2 more inputs representing the output area for=\r\n a total of 6 \n&gt; inputs \n&gt; &gt; (and one output representing the weight of a c=\r\nonnection in the \n&gt; &gt; substrate).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If there was a hidden layer you =\r\ncould have it exist in either the \n&gt; same \n&gt; &gt; geometry as A, the same geom=\r\netry as B, or the same geometry as \nthe \n&gt; &gt; outputs.  (For example by intr=\r\noducing a z dimension to any of \n&gt; these)  \n&gt; &gt; Or you could have each kind=\r\n of hidden layer all at once.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, as you note, there are a =\r\nlot of ways to do something \n&gt; like \n&gt; &gt; this.  I think it will be a great =\r\nissue to explore, but it may \n&gt; require \n&gt; &gt; starting with a very simple do=\r\nmain that isolates the issue (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; orthogonal input types) so we can c=\r\noncentrate on that rather than \n&gt; on a \n&gt; &gt; specific domain with its own co=\r\nmplications.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One other issue to note is that even if two sets of i=\r\nnputs are in \n&gt; &gt; effect unrelated, it may not necessarily hurt antyhing to=\r\n put \nthem \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the same geometry.  For example, they could be two se=\r\nparate \nplanes \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the same cube.  On the face of it, it seems like =\r\nthat could cause \n&gt; &gt; problems, but we don&#39;t yet know whether the situation=\r\n is that \n&gt; difficult \n&gt; &gt; to deal with in practice.  There could also be h=\r\nidden \nrelationships \n&gt; &gt; that are not obvious but still exploitable in a s=\r\nurprising way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Thomas Johnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.johnson@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEA=\r\nT folks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s the recommended strategy for handling inputs t=\r\nhat \n&gt; represent \n&gt; &gt; concepts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are not geometrically related?
