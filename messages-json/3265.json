Bec=\r\nause other than that, what \nelse is there that is duplicated?\n\n-What is an =\r\n&quot;input-to-input&quot; or &quot;output-to-input&quot; connection?   In \ngeneral most ANN im=\r\nplementations do not allow connections to go into \ninputs.  So what does th=\r\nis mean?  And how does it relate to a hidden \nnode, which is neither an inp=\r\nut nor an output?\n\n-What is the &quot;dimensionality of a node?&quot;  A node exists =\r\nin a space of \nsome number of dimensions, e.g. 2 or 3 dimensions.  Is that =\r\nwhat you \nmean?  Or do you mean the number of incoming or outgoing connecti=\r\nons, \nor something else?\n\n-What is a &quot;true&quot; substrate hidden node?  I know =\r\nyou say it&#39;s &quot;not a \ncomputational dupe,&quot; but I don&#39;t know what that means =\r\neither.  A \ncomputational duplicate in my understanding would be a node tha=\r\nt has \nthe exact same weights on its incoming connections as some other \nno=\r\nde.  But when would that ever be the case, and why is that not \na &quot;true&quot; no=\r\nde even if it was the case?\n\n-What is a &quot;clear dimensionality?&quot;  Again, I a=\r\nm not sure what you \nmean by dimensionality with respect to nodes?  Other t=\r\nhan being at \nsome coordinate in the substrate, I don&#39;t know what dimension=\r\ns there \nare associated with the node?\n\n-What does this mean: &quot;a) nodes onl=\r\ny have one unique input, and b) an \ninput has no activation function?&quot;  Nod=\r\nes can have any arbitrary \nnumber of inputs, so why do you say &quot;one?&quot;  Do y=\r\nou mean that all \ninputs are summed before being applied to the activation =\r\nfunction?  \nThat of course is how almost all ANNs work, so how does this qu=\r\nestion \napply specifically to HyperNEAT?  \n\nI know I&#39;m just misunderstandin=\r\ng, but I want to make sure I \nunderstand before trying to address the quest=\r\nion.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nt would seem that the issue of substrate hidden nodes is mitigated \n&gt; somew=\r\nhat by the fact that in certain instances they are nothing \nmore \n&gt; than du=\r\nplicated substrate input and/or output nodes, created for \nthe \n&gt; sole purp=\r\nose of handling input-to-input or output-to-input \n&gt; connections, due to th=\r\ne current limitation that a) nodes only have \n&gt; one unique input, and b) an=\r\n input has no activation function. In \nthis \n&gt; case, the dimensionality of =\r\nthe clone node may reasonably carry \nwith \n&gt; it the dimensionality of the o=\r\nriginal.\n&gt; \n&gt; A true substrate hidden (i.e. not a computational dupe), woul=\r\nd not \n&gt; have a clear dimensionality associated with it. So the question is=\r\n, \n&gt; is there a meaningful way to present a true substrate hidden node \nto =\r\n\n&gt; a hypercube network, or simply have the hypercube network ignore \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n true substrate hidden nodes, and evolve the true substrate hidden \n&gt; nodes=\r\n and associated connections to whatever, in the substrate \n&gt; network separa=\r\nte from the hypercube network (i.e. hypercube network \n&gt; only operates on &quot;=\r\nb&quot; & &quot;c&quot; for PSIs and PSOs, and their clones).\n&gt; \n&gt; Other thoughts and/or c=\r\nomments are appreciated!\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    Andy Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Given an arbitrary point =\r\n&quot;P&quot; in design space, comprised of the \n&gt; &gt; following:\n&gt; &gt; (a) problem speci=\r\nfic inputs (PSIs);\n&gt; &gt; (b) auxiliary additional parameters associated w/ PS=\r\nIs;\n&gt; &gt; (c) problem specific outputs (PSOs);\n&gt; &gt; (d) auxiliary additional p=\r\narameters associated w/ PSOs;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An instance of a struct of items ide=\r\nntified in (a) through (d) \n&gt; above, \n&gt; &gt; which taken together comprise a d=\r\nesign point P[i], a vector of \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; comprises the current substrate=\r\n resolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Substrate Inputs: comprised of PSIs, &quot;a&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nubstrate Outputs: comprised of PSOs, &quot;c&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hypercube Inputs: =\r\ncomprised of auxiliary additional parameters \n&gt; &gt; associated w/ PSIs & PSOs=\r\n, &quot;b&quot; & &quot;d&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; Hypercube Output: weight between current pair of nod=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Questions:\n&gt; &gt; (1) When the dimensionality of &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; diffe=\r\nr, how is the \n&gt; &gt; hypercube input topology reconciled?\n&gt; &gt; (2) Are there d=\r\nifferent hypercube networks depending on if the \n&gt; &gt; current node (input or=\r\n output), is a substrate input, hidden or \n&gt; &gt; output node?\n&gt; &gt; (3) How are=\r\n substrate hidden nodes handled when the hypercube is \n&gt; &gt; focused on the a=\r\nssociated connecting substrate weight?
