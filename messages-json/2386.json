But when I set it a bit lower, I end up with 100\nspecies of 1 ch=\r\nromosome after some 100 generations. I can&#39;t seem to\nfind the golden middle=\r\n. On his FAQ\n(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html), Kenneth S=\r\ntanley\nhimself presents a method to automatically set the speciation\nthresh=\r\nold by descreasing or increasing it with, say, 0.3, whenever the\nnumber of =\r\nspecies becomes more or less than a preset target amount of,\nsay, 10.\n\nHowe=\r\nver, when I apply this method (with population size 100 and target\nspecies =\r\ncount 10), then after some 100 generations I end up with 20 to\n25 species a=\r\nnd a speciation threshold of 40 and rising. Of the\nresulting species, one s=\r\npecie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\ncontain 5 chromosomes or less and=\r\n 10 species contain just one chromosome.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such =\r\nproblems before, or have some idea to\nwhat might be causing this? How do yo=\r\nu keep a &#39;normal&#39; amount of more\nor less equally sized species?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
