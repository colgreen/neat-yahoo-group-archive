That&#39;s\n16,384, which is=\r\n a LOT of inputs.  Here is what I had in mind, though:\n\nSuppose I have X nu=\r\nmber of images that are all tagged &#39;rose&#39;.  There\nare thousands of other im=\r\nages that are NOT tagged &#39;rose&#39;.  Evolve (or\neven use backpropagation to tr=\r\nain) a network to determine the\ncharacteristics that define the &#39;rose&#39; tag.=\r\n  Then, when future images\nare received, they are compared to the &#39;rose&#39; ta=\r\ng network to determine\nthe likelihood that the image should have that tag a=\r\npplied to it.  I\nbelieve there has already been done a fair amount of work =\r\nof that\nkind, and it has demonstrated a fair amount of success.\n\nSuppose I =\r\nhave image A and image B.  When asked, the user says that A\nis better than =\r\nB.  Repeat for thousands of combinations of images. \nUse the signatures of =\r\nthose two images as the inputs (yeah, 32,767\ninputs) and try to output a nu=\r\nmber between 0 and 1 to indicate which\nimage is &#39;better&#39;.  Use this network=\r\n as a pre-screen for the quality\nor likability of images.\n\nNow, since it is=\r\n such a simple task, a simple classifier in both\ncases, could it be that th=\r\ne large number of inputs will still be\nmanageable?  Or would that be a real=\r\nly bad idea?  Any tips or\nsuggestions, thoughts, advice, whatever, would be=\r\n appreciated.\n\n-- John\n--------------------------------------------------\nJ=\r\nohn Arrowwood\nJohn (at) Hanlons Razor (dot) com\n\n"}}
