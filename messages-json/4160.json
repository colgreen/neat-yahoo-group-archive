I did not use it for \nevaluations bu=\r\nt for evaluating a CPPN many times in parallel for large\nHyperNEAT networks=\r\n. I was able to get 47x faster than a reference\nC++ CPU implementation. It =\r\nwasn&#39;t too difficult to plug in the\nfinished GPU CPPN evaluation code into =\r\nPython either.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there plans to support HyperNEAT in the Python version? =\r\n I&#39;m much\n&gt; more comfortable with Python than C++.  With the new release of=\r\n\n&gt; HyperSharpNEAT 2.0 (http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html), there is a\n&gt;=\r\n substantial code base to draw from.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I&#39;d be interested to extend=\r\n NEAT Python with Parallel Python\n&gt; (http://www.parallelpython.com/) to all=\r\now evaluations on multiple\n&gt; cores and machines.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve never worked wit=\r\nh GPUs, but nVidia&#39;s CUDA capabilities look\n&gt; promising.  PyStream (http://=\r\ncode.google.com/p/pystream/) isn&#39;t being\n&gt; supported anymore by Tech-X.  Th=\r\neir new GPUlib\n&gt; (http://www.txcorp.com/technologies/GPULib/index.php) supp=\r\norts\n&gt; multiple languages.  Again, this would be for evaluating fitness\n&gt; f=\r\nunctions.
