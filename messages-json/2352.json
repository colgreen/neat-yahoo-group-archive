Th=\r\ne Volkswagen Touareg R5 crossed the finish line ahead \nof four other compet=\r\nitors in the DARPA Grand Challenge race for \ndriverless vehicles, sponsored=\r\n by the Pentagon, on Oct. 8.\n\nWhen the Stanford team first started testing =\r\nStanley, a blue sport-\nutility vehicle, he had a 12 percent blunder rate fo=\r\nr ``false \npositives&#39;&#39; -- incorrectly assuming 12 percent of the objects in=\r\n \nfront of him were obstacles big enough he had to swerve around them.\n\nSo =\r\nthe team instructed Stanley&#39;s software to take notes while a \nhuman driver =\r\nmaneuvered the car over different types of terrain. By \nfollowing this guid=\r\nance, the false positive rate dropped to one in \n50,000 objects.\n\nThis kind=\r\n of debugging, conducted during 1,200 miles of off-road \ntesting in the des=\r\nerts of Southern California and Arizona, put \nStanley first across the fini=\r\nsh line in Primm, Nev., after \ntraversing a 132-mile course with no human i=\r\nntervention.\n\nThe victory was particularly sweet because Stanford beat heav=\r\nily \nfavored Carnegie Mellon University, which entered two vehicles that \nc=\r\name in second and third.\n\nThe race was funded by DARPA, formerly the Defens=\r\ne Advanced Research \nProjects Agency, because the Pentagon wants to make on=\r\ne-third of the \nmilitary&#39;s land vehicles self-driving within a decade.\n\nBut=\r\n the really big market for robotic driving systems is in the \ncivilian worl=\r\nd, for both safety and convenience.\n\nDARPA ran the first Grand Challenge ra=\r\nce in March 2004 with \ndisappointing results; no vehicle got farther than e=\r\night miles. I \ncovered that race and was disenchanted enough to pass on att=\r\nending \nthis year&#39;s repeat. So much for my powers of prediction.\n\nInstead, =\r\nI caught up with the Stanford team leaders last week during \na break at a r=\r\nobotics conference held in a hotel near Fisherman&#39;s \nWharf in San Francisco=\r\n.\n\nI discovered that the Stanford team, which didn&#39;t enter last year&#39;s \nrac=\r\ne, still picked up pointers on what not to do.\n\nFirst, DARPA had said the o=\r\nff-road course would be navigable by a \nstandard off-road vehicle such as a=\r\n pick-up truck or SUV. Some teams \nwasted time and money designing custom v=\r\nehicles.\n\nSecond, the Stanford team believed standard off-the-shelf hardwar=\r\ne \nwould be sufficient for the sensors and computers. Again, some teams \ngo=\r\nt caught up with custom designs.\n\nThird, the Stanford team realized the rac=\r\ne was really all about \nsoftware. Completing the course would require a veh=\r\nicle that could \naccurately understand its position, what was coming on the=\r\n road \nahead and how to respond.\n\n`A simpler solution&#39;\n\n``We focused on art=\r\nificial intelligence from the get-go,&#39;&#39; said \nStanford team leader Sebastia=\r\nn Thrun, director of Stanford&#39;s \nartificial intelligence lab.\n\n``Our system=\r\n is a simpler solution,&#39;&#39; added Michael Montemerlo, a \npost-doctoral fellow=\r\n in Thrun&#39;s lab and head of the team&#39;s software \ndevelopment effort.\n\nHere&#39;=\r\ns how they did it:\n\nStanford started with an off-the-shelf vehicle, the Tou=\r\nareg donated \nby Volkswagen&#39;s Palo Alto research lab. The Palo Alto lab als=\r\no \nprovided engineering support for connecting Stanley&#39;s computers to \nthe =\r\nsteering wheel, gear shift, gas pedal and brakes.\n\nThe only physical modifi=\r\ncations to the vehicle were minor: adding a \nskid plate to protect the unde=\r\nrcarriage, a beefed-up front bumper \nand heavy-duty tires.\n\nStanley constan=\r\ntly updated its position and orientation by taking \nreadings from three glo=\r\nbal positioning system receivers, as well as \nfrom motion sensors, and by m=\r\neasuring the number of times its wheels \nrotated.\n\nDARPA provided a rough o=\r\nutline of the 132-mile route by giving each \nteam a computer file containin=\r\ng 3,000 way points just two hours \nbefore the race started -- an average of=\r\n 23 way points per mile. But \nsimply following this electronic bread crumb =\r\ntrail wasn&#39;t enough to \nwin, because the way points weren&#39;t always centered=\r\n on the road and \ndidn&#39;t show how to get around obstacles.\n\nTo navigate bet=\r\nween way points, Stanley had a vision system \nconsisting of five laser rang=\r\ne finders and one video camera. The \nlasers looked at the ground immediatel=\r\ny in front of the vehicle, \nwhile the camera looked further down the road. =\r\nThe motion sensors \nhelped the vision system by telling when the car was pi=\r\ntching up and \ndown, allowing the vision system to correct for the movement=\r\n.\n\nThe position and visual data was fed into a planning module that \nexamin=\r\ned every possible path and picked the best solution -- \nsomewhat in the sam=\r\ne way chess software evaluates every possible \nmove on the board.\n\nThe plan=\r\nning module also included a ``road finder&#39;&#39; feature that \nlooked at the roa=\r\nd immediately under the vehicle and determined \nwhich section of the forwar=\r\nd horizon looked the same. If Stanley was \nrunning on a brown dirt road wit=\r\nh green bushes on the sides, it \nwould aim for the stretch ahead that was b=\r\nrown rather than green.\n\nFinally, a controller module turned the selected r=\r\noute into specific \ninstructions for steering the vehicle and setting its s=\r\npeed.\n\nStanley&#39;s programmers also had to make lots of small but critical \nd=\r\necisions in setting rules for the road. One example: Stanley was \ntold to d=\r\nrive over rocks no higher than six inches, but to avoid \nrocks any larger.\n=\r\n\nIntel computers\n\nIntel donated six computers with Pentium M chips to tackl=\r\ne all the \nprocessing this required, and all six computers were installed i=\r\nn \nStanley&#39;s trunk. But the team needed only two computers to do the \nactua=\r\nl work, and one more computer to keep a log. The other three \ncomputers jus=\r\nt went along for the ride.\n\nCarnegie Mellon&#39;s two vehicles worked in much t=\r\nhe same way, \naccording to Thrun and Montemerlo, but Stanley&#39;s software was=\r\n \ntweaked to move just a little bit faster.\n\nThe result: Stanley finished i=\r\nn six hours and 53 minutes, for an \naverage speed of 19 miles an hour, with=\r\n Carnegie Mellon&#39;s vehicles \ntrailing 11 and 21 minutes behind. One other v=\r\nehicle completed the \ncourse within the allotted 10 hours set by DARPA: Tea=\r\nm Gray, run by \nstudents from Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nThe $2 mil=\r\nlion prize goes to Stanford, rather than any of the 60 \nindividuals who wor=\r\nked on the team, and Stanford will also own any \npatents that come out of S=\r\ntanley.\n\n``I&#39;m trying to exploit the moment within Stanford to build up \n(r=\r\nobotic) driving as a research focus,&#39;&#39; Thrun said.\n\nThrun, 38, believes rob=\r\notic driving will someday advance to the \npoint where human geography is ch=\r\nanged. No longer will big office \nbuildings or shopping centers need to be =\r\nsurrounded by big parking \nlots. Instead, cars will dutifully park themselv=\r\nes on the edge of \ncities, waiting for a call to come retrieve their owners=\r\n.\n\nLong before then, robotic systems will save thousands of lives by \ntakin=\r\ng the wheel at the last moment to prevent accidents caused by \ndriver error=\r\n.\n\nThrun confidently concluded: ``It&#39;s a no-brainer to me that cars \nwill d=\r\nrive themselves.&#39;&#39;\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n-----------\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
