(Of course, I may be\n&gt; wrong.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Animals in nature are called upon to do that all the\n&gt; time.  For example, when a small mammal migrates to a\n&gt; new territory, he needs to leave his nest, explore for\n&gt; food while remembering his route.  Then, to return\n&gt; home, he recalls the route in reverse.\n&gt;\n&gt; Humans do it when they remember a new telephone number\n&gt; for a short time.  Like when you say to someone:\n&gt; Please dial 380-6637.  The person then dials the\n&gt; number, perhaps never having heard it before.  Clearly\n&gt; he had to memorize it and then recall it, even if it\n&gt; is forgotten a few minutes later.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think this is a worthwhile challenge for recurrent ANNs.\n&gt;\n&gt; =====\n&gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
