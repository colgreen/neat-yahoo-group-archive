I th=\r\nink it is also quite fast and I have some plans that I\nwill\n&gt; &gt; elucidate o=\r\nn in my next message that could significantly speed it\nup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve als=\r\no built a little tool to run the saved result network and\n&gt; &gt; generate a CS=\r\nV file. So you can load the times series as a graph in\n&gt; &gt; excel and visual=\r\nize the results of your networks prediction compared\n&gt; &gt; to the original ti=\r\nme series.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It has plenty of work that needs done on it. But I figur=\r\ned I might\n&gt; &gt; create a Sourceforge page and post it if anyone is intereste=\r\nd?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shane\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
