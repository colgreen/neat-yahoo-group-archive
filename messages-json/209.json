The idea of adaptive topology is very\n&gt; &gt; appealing to me, but the C++ implementation is\n&gt; not. \n&gt; &gt; The other features of NEAT are also of great\n&gt; interest,\n&gt; &gt; including speciation and graphical display of\n&gt; &gt; topology.   It would be a big hurdle for me to\n&gt; learn\n&gt; &gt; enough C++ as well as understand the details of\n&gt; NEAT. \n&gt; &gt; I have always found it difficult to read other\n&gt; &gt; people&#39;s code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Mitchell, one thing you may consider is that in\n&gt; my NEAT C++\n&gt; package, the experimental control code is closer to\n&gt; C than C++.  It is\n&gt; true that it sometimes instantiates an object, but\n&gt; for the most part\n&gt; it&#39;s written as stand-alone functions rather than\n&gt; class methods.\n&gt; So if you just want to write experiments, it can be\n&gt; done with little C++.\n\nThanks for the encouragement; One of these days I will\ngive it a try.\n\nm\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
