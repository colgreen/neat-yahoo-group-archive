It let me play\n&gt;with a bit of development while using your OCR experiment as a\n&gt;framework.  \n&gt;\nAt this point I should point out to the viewers at home that the &#39;OCR&#39; \nexperiment in SharpNEAT isn&#39;t proper OCR. The input patterns are fixed \n(1 for each lower case letter of the alphabet) and so the problem is \nactually a pattern classification problem, which is far simpler then \nproper OCR. In fact it should be possible to solve with a feedforward \nonly network and backpropagation.\n\n&gt;I thought the reduced 7 X 5 input grid and very distinct\n&gt;character set would be a snap for the network.  Now I know better. \n&gt;Thirty-five inputs and twenty-six outputs is too much for a one-to-one\n&gt;connected net so the problem isn&#39;t trivial.\n&gt;\nWhat do you mean by one-to-one? Or is that just the topology of the \nstarting networks? (connection proportion = 1.0).\n\n&gt;  I&#39;m having fun playing\n&gt;with the various search parameters, especially the frequency of &quot;add\n&gt;connections&quot; and &quot;add nodes&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIf you have the latest code I think the OCR experiment has a customised \nNeatParameters object. As I recall the experiment performed better with \na higher &#39;add connection&#39; rate, and with pruning switched on. That way \nthe population cycles between networks with loads of connections and \nnetworks with very few - the complexity zig zags.\n\nAs you say braille characters are more distictive than normal (visual) \ncharacters so I would also expect this to make the problem to be easier \nto solve. I&#39;m just looking at the braille characters here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille\n\n...and I note that they are just 3x2 dots. How did you come to be using \n7x5? Are these in fact images of braille characters?\n\nIf the problem really is too difficult then it can be decomposed into 26 \nsimpler problems, that is evolve a network for each character you want \nto recognise and that that gives a yes/no response. Of course this means \nthat to recognise characters you have to run the input past 26 networks \ninstead of one - and in fact for pattern classification you may as well \njust compare the inputs with the 26 expected input patterns! But the \ntechnique has merit when doing proper OCR where the input images vary.\n\n&gt;The downside of adding an experiment is my SharpNEAT library and some\n&gt;of the Form1 initialization differ from the standard release.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh the experiments should probably be external to the library, and \nthere should really be a mechanism for experiments to &#39;plug-in&#39; to the \nmain application instead of having to manually add them into the Form1 \nclass. I never said it was perfect ;)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
