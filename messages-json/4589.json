At least not in the sense that I believe you are\ndescribing.\n\n&#39;Energy&#39; =\r\nas it were, is not really &#39;transferred&#39; between any given\nneurons in such a=\r\n system. Neurons only interact via neurotransmitters\nbeing released into an=\r\nd absorbed from the synaptic cleft between said\nneurons. Electrical energy =\r\n(which I gather is to what you are\nreferring) is confined to within a parti=\r\ncular neuron itself. In a\nproperly functioning neuron, this energy is neith=\r\ner received nor\ntransmitted. In fact, (and I may be mistaken here, so someb=\r\nody correct\nme if I am) I beleive that the effects of such neurological dis=\r\neases\nas multiple sclerosis are actually precipitated by this electrical\nen=\r\nergy escaping the cell due to a degeneration of the myelin sheath\nthat woul=\r\nd normally cover the axon of the cell, along which the\nelectrical signals w=\r\nithin the cell travel from dendrite to axon\nterminal.\n\nIf it were the case =\r\nthat a conservation of energy principle was\napplied to such a model, and th=\r\ne electrical signals *were* being\ntransmitted cell-to-cell, this would impo=\r\nse a ceiling on the number of\nlayers possible in the network, degree of rec=\r\nursion in feedback\nnetworks, etc. due to what would be inevitable signal de=\r\ngradation to\nthe point of no longer being usable. That is unless there was =\r\nalso the\nprovision for &#39;repeater&#39; cells/nodes in the network (a concept tha=\r\nt I\nhave personally not encountered as of yet).\n\nBasically, the energy that=\r\n is &#39;distributed&#39; across connecting neurons\nactually comes from within the =\r\ncell (insert complex/detailed\ndiscussion about mitochondria, phosphorylatio=\r\nn, etc. here... haha),\nitself being a function of the type, amount, and pos=\r\nsibly other\nyet-to-be-discovered properties of the neurotransmitters (and p=\r\nossibly\nother chemicals as well) that are within the synaptic cleft at the\n=\r\ntime that the firing was initiated.\n\nA better analogy (I believe) would be =\r\nthe one proposed by a large body\nof the literature: a single neuron is a bl=\r\nack-box function. It takes a\ngiven input (absorbing neurotransmitters from =\r\nthe synaptic cleft) and\nproduces an output (releasing neurotransmitters int=\r\no the synaptic\ncleft). Any conservation of energy principle is resetricted =\r\nto being\napplied to the processes occurring within the cell itself, because=\r\n in\nthis (limited) sense the cell is acting as a closed system for that\nele=\r\nctrical energy.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nEric\n\nPS Anyone, feel free to correct me=\r\n if any of this is off-base or just\nplain wrong too. I&#39;m just going by my c=\r\nursory understanding of these\nthings, and so could be mistaken about some o=\r\nf this.\n\nOn Wed, Feb 25, 2009 at 8:39 AM, Raymond Von Wahlde\n&lt;rvonwahlde@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I have a question relating to the analogy of the intercon=\r\nnected nodes\n&gt; of an artificial neural net as neurons. A node receives inpu=\r\nts that\n&gt; are fed into an activation function. The activation function &quot;fir=\r\nes&quot;\n&gt; an output somewhat comparable to a synapse firing. As implemented in\n=\r\n&gt; ANN&#39;s, the same output value (its &quot;energy&quot; as it were) from the node is\n&gt;=\r\n fed through weighted links to other nodes. What would be the effect of\n&gt; i=\r\nmposing a sort of &quot;conservation of energy&quot; principal on the ANN?\n&gt;\n&gt; Isn&#39;t =\r\nit the case that in an actual neural net, when a neuron fires its\n&gt; total e=\r\nnergy is distributed somehow to its connecting neurons. The\n&gt; total energy =\r\nreceived by the connected neurons can not be more than the\n&gt; energy generat=\r\ned by the sending neuron. What if in an ANN, the value\n&gt; coming from a node=\r\n was split evenly between the outgoing links? And\n&gt; for the receiving nodes=\r\n, the sum of the weighted inputs could not\n&gt; exceed the total energy genera=\r\nted by the sending nodes. Would there be\n&gt; any benefit to forcing this rest=\r\nriction on an ANN?\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
