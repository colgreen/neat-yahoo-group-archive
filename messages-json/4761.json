Jeff Clune addresses it to some extent in his quadruped c=\r\nontrollers, which include a sine wave input that seemingly does not fit in =\r\nwith the other body-related geometric inputs:\n\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/=\r\nwebfiles/publications/Clune-HyperNEATSensitivityToGeometry.pdf\n\nJeff essent=\r\nially just stuffs that input into an arbitrary location on the substrate.  =\r\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to stop it from learning, so that is indeed an option, alth=\r\nough it is inelegant.  \n\nHowever, to me, it seems even more inelegant to so=\r\nmehow try to kludge HyperNEAT into NEAT.  I&#39;d rather stick with one or the =\r\nother.  \n\nI would suggest putting such information in a centered locations =\r\nin their own layers, or in other dimensions (as you suggest), and sticking =\r\nwith HyperNEAT overall.  It may work well actually to make things like heal=\r\nth and ammo actual geometric dimensions.  However, you could also let them =\r\nbe single nodes that are alone in their own layers, or in parts of the inpu=\r\nt layer that are separated from the rest of it.  \n\nUltimately I think that =\r\nit should be okay to provide that kind of information to the substrate beca=\r\nuse our brains certainly contain various types of unrelated information, su=\r\nch as the time of day and the angles of our knees.  These are in effect sep=\r\narated in space within the geometry of the brain, although they obviously e=\r\nxist somewhere.\n\nIn any case, clearly what to do with this type of data is =\r\na tricky issue and others may have alternative suggestions and ideas.\n\nken\n=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, tansey@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks fo=\r\nr the clarification.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a follow-up, do you have any suggestions on ho=\r\nw to handle mixed geometric and\n&gt; non-geometric data?\n&gt; \n&gt; For instance, if=\r\n you&#39;re evolving a bot for a FPS, you may have some geometric\n&gt; representat=\r\nion of the world. However, there may also be other relevant\n&gt; information l=\r\nike health or ammo. It seems like there are only three solutions\n&gt; right no=\r\nw:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Use regular NEAT and lose the regularity of the world.\n&gt; 2. Use =\r\nHyperNEAT and force the health and ammo information to be represented as\n&gt; =\r\nextra dimensions even though they can be handled by a single input node.\n&gt; =\r\n3. Evolve a HyperNEAT agent separately then use its input(s) as secondary\n&gt;=\r\n input(s) to a regular NEAT controller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a fourth approach? Or=\r\n is there generally a preference for one of the\n&gt; above three approaches?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; Quoting Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wesley, the =\r\nmain insight motivating r(x) is that it aligns the agent geometry\n&gt; &gt; with =\r\nthe team geometry.  That is, the left side of the agent is on the same\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nside of the agent as the left side of the team, which is how it usually wou=\r\nld\n&gt; &gt; be in the real world.  Nevertheless, you make a good point that the =\r\nsubstrate\n&gt; &gt; could be 3D as an alternative.  There is nothing wrong with d=\r\noing it that way\n&gt; &gt; and it does have its own advantages.  In fact, we have=\r\n experimented with both\n&gt; &gt; approaches to laying out agents for multiagent =\r\nlearning (although only r(x)\n&gt; &gt; is in the GECCO paper), and both are valid=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am working on a project that =\r\nneeds a substrate of more than 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dimensions. Looking at David and Ken=\r\n&#39;s GECCO&#39;08 paper, I would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expected a 3d substrate for the heter=\r\nogeneous agent experiment. Is there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some insight I&#39;m missing behind u=\r\nsing the special r(x) function rather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than making a 3rd dimension?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
