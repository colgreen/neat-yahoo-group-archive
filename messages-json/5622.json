It is true that standard NEAT implementations usually require at s=\r\nome point a single score for each individual, so they have to be aggregated=\r\n eventually.  I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with your interpretatio=\r\nn.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ze_dakster&quot; &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m in the process of coding up a &quot;remake&quot; of the robot=\r\n duel experiment from your paper on evolutionary complexification, and I ha=\r\nd a question regarding having multiple fitness scores per host. \n&gt; \n&gt; So yo=\r\nu have 12 opponents per host genome, played twice (east/west start). I see =\r\nyou&#39;re combining the east/west scores into a single fitness score per oppon=\r\nent, but it sounds like from the paper you&#39;re ending up with 12 fitness sco=\r\nres per host genome per generation (or more likely I&#39;m too tired to interpr=\r\net the paper correctly). \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m my current robot duel implementation I&#39;m=\r\n simply combining all 24 of these evaluations into a single fitness score p=\r\nassed into the end-of-generation &quot;epoch&quot; method in my NEAT implementation (=\r\nbasically a Linux port of Mat Buckland&#39;s windows implementation setup as C+=\r\n+ classes). \n&gt; \n&gt; At least in the implementation I currently have, you can =\r\nonly have one fitness score per genome in the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I correct=\r\n in combining them, or did you do something else under the hood there with =\r\nmultiple fitness scores per genome?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
