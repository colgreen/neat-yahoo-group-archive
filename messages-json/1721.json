Philip and I are planning on \nattending,\n&gt; and we&#39;re hoping to submit a paper for the regular paper deadline \nin\n&gt; mid-January.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re working on fingerprint classification now, automatically\n&gt; categorizing fingerprints into one of four classes: whorl, left \nloop,\n&gt; right loop, or arch (and for the five-class problem, tented arch). \n&gt; Automatic classification of fingerprints is a pretty difficult\n&gt; problem, and is hard to do quickly and accurately.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re in the early stages of experimenting in this domain, but \nwe&#39;ve\n&gt; already evolved a network that can distinguish two distinct left \nloop\n&gt; prints from two of each of the other classes, so we&#39;re pretty\n&gt; optimistic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n\n"}}
