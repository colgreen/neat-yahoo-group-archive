This helps in a few different ways. When \n&gt; crossover occurs we only swap nodes that are co-located on both\nparents. \n&gt; It also allows us to implement a &#39;reference&#39; node (more later). And\nit \n&gt; allow us to mutate the genome by not only mutating data within a\nnode, \n&gt; but by copying, deleting and moving branches of the tree around. By \n&gt; relating nodes in a tree and branchies of the tree I thought I\nwould \n&gt; facilitate more intelligent, meaningful manipualtion of the genome.\n&gt; \n\nHi Colin...what does &quot;co-located&quot; mean if you are looking at two\ndifferent trees?  Isn&#39;t there still a topology-matching problem\nwith trees?  How do you know which branches match up?\n\n&gt; 2) Each node either represents a neuron or a reference. Neurons\nhave a \n&gt; position, which is relative to the parent node. They also have a\nlist of \n&gt; (incoming) connections. Each connection has a length (thus giving a \n&gt; position to connect to, relative to the neuron&#39;s position) and a \n&gt; weight. The networks evolved thus have fixed weights. Also note\nthat \n&gt; connections connect to the nearest neuron, therefore the connection \n&gt; length does not have to be precise, or even anywhere near a neuron.\n \n&gt; Where a neuron is a child of a reference node there is a highly \n&gt; convoluted technique whereby I  evolving a connection point onto\nthe \n&gt; parent tree. In theory this allows re-used parts of the tree to be \n&gt; extended further (variation on reused genes). In hindsight it is a\nvery \n&gt; poor implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Reference nodes. A node on the tree that cause traversal to jump\nto \n&gt; some other specified point. The reference itself is just a list of \n&gt; numbers, each number is basically a list of child indexes\nspecifying a \n&gt; path to the referenced node through the tree starting from the root \n&gt; node. Later I also implemented relative references where a child\nindex \n&gt; of -1 means to traverse back up the tree one node. Reference nodes\nallow \n&gt; for the possibility of re-use and therefore aid in evolving\ncomplexity.\n&gt; \n\nGruau&#39;s Cellular Encoding (CE) also uses a tree genome and can reuse\nnodes in the tree.  Have you looked at CE?  I describe it (and give a\npicture) in our Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny paper:\n\nhttp://steam.csres.utexas.edu/nn/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=121\n\nThe references to Gruau&#39;s original papers on CE are also given in that\npaper.  It might be interesting to see how your ideas are similar to\nGruau&#39;s.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
