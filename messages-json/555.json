But unfortunately at least in past years it looks like his\n&gt; tutorial is mostly from that era, so it&#39;s missing a lot of the recent\n&gt; developments in the field like NEAT.  (Of course this year could be\n&gt; different.)  Still, I recommend checking it out since he&#39;s a well\n&gt; known researcher and his perspective may be useful.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------\n  k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n  msc natural computation : the university of birmingham\n  http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
