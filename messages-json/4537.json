Move the genome to the clu=\r\nster it is closest to (if\nnecessary).\nStep 3) Goto Step 2 until no more re-=\r\nassignments are necessary or the\nnumber of re-assignments falls below some =\r\nlow threshold number.\n\nThere are some graphs in my blog of an experimental =\r\nrun using points\nin 2D space, see http://the-locster.livejournal.com/43595.=\r\nhtml\n\nFollowing this we can probably get a reasonably good initial number\nf=\r\nor the compatibility threshold by measuring the distance between\ngenomes in=\r\n clusters; since clusters will be roughtly spherical in\nshape (hyperspheres=\r\n) we can take the largest distance between any two\ngenomes in a cluster as =\r\nbeing an approximation of each spheres&#39;\ndiameter, and thus the compatibilit=\r\nyy threshold should be about half\nthis figure. It&#39;s just a ball park number=\r\n to use instead of a fixed\narbitrary number which is typically used at the =\r\nmoment.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
