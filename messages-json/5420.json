It seems that a lot of people got to know about HyperNEA=\r\nT&#39;s ability to overcome a lot of challenges and then try to apply it to eve=\r\nrything, without knowing it&#39;s internal workings, mainly the CPPN theory and=\r\n the way CPPNs generate patterns. Trying HyperNEAT on everything is good, t=\r\nhough, it sheds light on what tasks the algorithm works and where it fails.=\r\n It would be good to know if HyperNEAT performs well in time series predict=\r\nion. Perhaps some kind of data preprocessing, which makes geometrical sense=\r\n, should help. I personally have tried time series prediction with HyperNEA=\r\nT and had no better results than regular NEAT, even worse. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter, you coul=\r\nd use any version of HyperNEAT currently available for your task, but the m=\r\nain question is whether the geometry (or regularities) of the time series c=\r\nan somehow be made an advantage to HyperNEAT through the configuration of t=\r\nhe substrate.  It is not immediately clear why HyperNEAT in particular is a=\r\ndvantageous for time series problems, though it is possible it can be lever=\r\naged in some way that is helpful.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As an alternative, you could also =\r\ntry regular NEAT as well.  Also, if you search through the archives of this=\r\n group you will find a number of discussions on time series prediction.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Peter&quot; &lt;blackprinzze@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m currently trying to develop HyperNEAT for Time series f=\r\norecasting (Stock & commodity)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1, Is there a current version of Hy=\r\nperNEAT available that my be suited for this task?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2, If not can y=\r\nou please point me in the right direction, explaining  how this can be achi=\r\neved. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3, Forecast should behave, similar to that of a Moving aver=\r\nage, with forecast plots one period or more into the future. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Than=\r\nks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
