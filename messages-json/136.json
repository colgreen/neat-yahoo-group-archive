The one headache I \ncan forsee is that the java code you submit cannot use any of the java \nframework classes! So basically I think I would be looking at making a \nport of Ken&#39;s neural network code into an minimal implementaion that is \nwritten in raw Java. Which at first sounds easy but then think about the \nlack of the Math functions! I don&#39;t know, maybe there IS a basic library \nof essentials that I didn&#39;t pick up on.\n\nAnyway your quest for an environment brings me back to one of my \noriginal points which is - wouldnlt it be nice to have a central \nrepository of environment code. Prefereably modified to expose a \nstandard interface (or one of a set of interfaces) that we define for \nuse in EANN/GA type projects.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
