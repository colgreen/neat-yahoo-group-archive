Actually I think you answered this question yourself in your\n&gt;&gt;response to John -  crossover. The crossover rate was set to 0.5, so\n&gt;&gt;structures are continuously propagating through the population.\n&gt;&gt;Subtractive mutations are only on individual [offspring] genomes, so\n&gt;&gt;there is a very high probability that the deleted gene will exist in\n&gt;&gt;numerous other genomes in the population and will persist despite\n&gt;&gt;subtractive mutations occuring. In fact the propagation of genes through\n&gt;&gt;crossover is so numerous that the subtractive mutations have hardly any\n&gt;&gt;effect at all - as demonstrated in the graphs.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Doesn&#39;t NEAT crossover also, when one individual has a gene and the other \n&gt;not, always include the gene in the offspring?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNope. Thats what I was doing in SharpNEAT, but that&#39;s not what was \ndescribed in the various NEAT papers.\n\n&gt;That means that a deletion cannot spread to other individuals and be \n&gt;combined with other deletions.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, SharpNEAT had this failing until I altered it.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;As a side note I was just reading a short article in this month&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;Scientific American that briefly discusses the possibility that\n&gt;&gt;crossover, despite being being good at trying out combinations of genes,\n&gt;&gt;actually acts as an error correcting technique - that is, if one of the\n&gt;&gt;parents has a mutated gene that is poor, the other parent is likely to\n&gt;&gt;have a good copy, and therefore some of the offspring will have a\n&gt;&gt;complete set of good genes despite having a parent with a mutation.\n&gt;&gt;Well, it&#39;s sort of relevant :)\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s very probably true but less significant than it sounds.  Calling what \n&gt;cross over does &quot;error correcting&quot; is based on a supposition that the \n&gt;mutation is &quot;wrong&quot; in some way.  \n&gt;\nNot really. It&#39;s based on it&#39;s ability to correct errors when they \noccur. I never said anything about mutation :)  Yeh it&#39;s just a certain \nperspective on inheritance and selection to say that it&#39;s error \ncorrecting - bad offspring (with nagative errors) will not survive. Of \ncourse, a computer scientist hearing the term might expect to find \nsomething akin to a genetic checksum and redundant data so that \nmutations can be corrected during DNA replication. Maybe this happens as \nwell, but if it was perfect evolution wouldn&#39;t work :)\n\n&gt;&gt;I think it makes sense. If a species is good but has not improved for a\n&gt;&gt;number of generations (200 in the experiments) then it is culled.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This is presumably the wrong thing to do?  I mean, given that the fitness \n&gt;function is the only measure of progress that we have, then the fittest \n&gt;species _is_ the best solution we have. however much we would also like it \n&gt;to also have the property of still evolving.  The only thing we can do is \n&gt;to continue taking mutants of it (and other fit species) and hope that \n&gt;eventually an avenue of progress is found.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis seems to be the consensus view - it&#39;s a matter for the operator to \ndecide when to give up and re-start a whole new search, rather than the \nNEAT algorithm containing logic to discard the best genome after some \nfixed number of generations in the hope that one of the other species \nwill be able to evolve faster.\n\n&gt;So, reassure me that your approaches do allow neutral mutations to prosper...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAbsolutely, that is essentially what I discuss in my phased search write \nup when I discuss bloat and speculative structures - they are \nnon-essential, neutral genes and are essential to searching.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
