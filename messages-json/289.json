I am\ncurrently traveling, but when I get more time I&#39;ll give some more\ncomments.  By the way, would you like me to put your source code\ndistribution up on our NN group web pages, where all the other NEAT\nsource version are currently available?  \n\n(For example, like this page:\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/soft-view.php?RECORD_KEY(S\noftware)=SoftID&SoftID(Software)=4\n)\n\nI&#39;ll also fix my own web pages that mention software to point to your\nnew NEAT page.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
