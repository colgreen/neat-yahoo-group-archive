They used fully \nconnected CTRNN=\r\ns. No crossover and fixed genome size. Well, it is \njust like the opposite =\r\nto the NEAT philosophy about the problem. I \nexamined his .ne file, and he =\r\nmade the add_link and add_node \nprobabilities to 0.00. :) \nWell this is NEA=\r\nT in the weight-range sense only :)  \nWhat about topology? That was not men=\r\ntioned anywhere. \nIn fact, Reil and Husbands are the people founded Natural=\r\nMotion? :) \nI know that a CTRNN can generate any dynamic behaviour, but put=\r\nting \nit into HyperNEAT&#39;s hands is changing the whole thing! Now I can \nspe=\r\ncify any time constant range and so on. I don&#39;t care about \nmutation powers=\r\n anymore. This is handled by the activation functions \nand the scale factor=\r\n I specify. \nThe power of this indirection is getting to our view. I see th=\r\nat \nCTRNN networks exhibit patterns as complex as their CPPN is. Well, \nthi=\r\ns is cool! \n\nPeter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanl=\r\ney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter and Steve, the way I would approach this problem i=\r\ns to start \n&gt; with the simplest possible model and get it working before mo=\r\nving \nto \n&gt; more complex or biologically plausible ones.  It&#39;s interesting =\r\nto \n&gt; note that Tyler Streeter evolved his biped with no inputs!  He was \n&gt;=\r\n trying to see if a fully recurrent network on its own with no \ninputs \n&gt; c=\r\nould produce a temporal walking pattern.  Of course that makes the \n&gt; probl=\r\nem quite difficult, and giving some feedback (i.e. inputs) \nmakes \n&gt; the pr=\r\noblem easier.  However, too many inputs could tip the \n&gt; difficulty back in=\r\n the other direction.  In any case, my approach \nto \n&gt; a hard problem is al=\r\nways to first see if I can do the easiest \nversion \n&gt; of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the wa=\r\ny, about Natural Motion, most of their current stuff \n&gt; probably is mainly =\r\nhand-coded.  They started out using CTRNNs but \n&gt; they moved on the scripti=\r\nng and other things as Peter mentioned.  \nSo \n&gt; they are a very difficult t=\r\narget to match with evolution alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, thanks for the encour=\r\naging words on NEAT and HyperNEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is really a =\r\nprototype, Steve.
