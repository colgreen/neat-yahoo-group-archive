For me, all your\narguments are against a quantification that people think to be\nsignificant at a particular time. It puts one particular quantification\nin question, but it is not against quantification in general. Looking\nfor performance is a criteria that makes sense when your problem is well\nposed. It does not mean that it is the only way to proceed, nor that it\nis the most interesting one. It has the advantage of the simplicity, but\nnothing prevents you from proposing new quantifications.\n\nAll the problems you mention are related to the conclusions that are\ndrawn from the results. If CPPN and a goal-oriented objective can&#39;t\ngenerate the pictures you are looking for, all you can deduce is that\nthe couple CPPN-goal oriented objective does not lead to any interesting\nsolution... As you said, it is tempting to infer that CPPN can&#39;t lead to\nthe solution, and a lot of papers are built around such conclusions, but\nas you said and as other results of yours have shown, it is false. The\nfact that quantifications are, sometimes, misleading is nothing else\nthan a symptom that our interpretation of these quantifications are\nwrong. For me, it does not mean that we should stop it, or even stop to\nrequire it. It just means that we need to think about it and update our\nway of analysing our results.\n\nThe point of JB, is that we need such quantifications to get confidence\nin the proposed ideas. Many different ideas can be proposed. Some may be\ngood and a lot won&#39;t be interesting at all. Requiring quantifications\nimplies to push these ideas far enough so that their potential more\nclearly appears. It is possible to demonstrate the potential of an idea\nwith one single (thought ?) experiment and a careful argumentation, but\nit is so difficult that it will remain an exception. Finding a right way\nto quantify the results is also thought provoking and interesting per\nse. Such a new quantification is a strong contribution to the field,\nmaybe as important as the initial idea itself.\n\nBest,\n\nstef\n\n"}}
