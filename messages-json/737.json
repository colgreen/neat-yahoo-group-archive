This is exactly the\n&gt; perspective I was trying to argue we should change.  The question is\n&gt; not whether it could perform as well with 25% less structure, but\n&gt; why would we care if it did?  \n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s important is that on average\n&gt; over all of evolution we are minimizing the space we have to search\n&gt; through.\n\nRight.  Why would we care if our resultant champions have 25%\nunnecessary topology?  Because we wouldn&#39;t be minimizing the space we\nhave to search through very effectively.\n\nIf you have a significant number of members of the population that are\nunnecessarily complex, that&#39;s going to reduce the efficiency of your\nsearch, right?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
