It would be interesting to run the search in pruning mode to trim\n&gt;away the &#39;chaff&#39;, thus revealing the functional parts of the champion\n&gt;network for examination. Is the switching occuring how we would expect\n&gt;or not? Actually it will be easier to examine the network evolved for a\n&gt;3-multiplexer first, which BTW is a problem that was solved in a couple\n&gt;of mins when I tried it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What is your fitness function like?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;As you might expect really. I loop over each of the 2^6=64 test cases,\n&gt;apply the inputs adjusted so that true=0.9 and false=0.1, then interpret\n&gt;the output as false for &lt;0.5 and true for &gt;=0.5. For 11 multiplexer\n&gt;there are of course 2^11=2048 test cases, which makes for an inherently\n&gt;slower eval function even before you consider the extra complexity\n&gt;required. Thus 20-multiplexer probably isn&#39;t a viable domain work on.\n&gt;But I think the point is proved - that NEAT can evolve a multiplexer.\n\nHow about if you tested as follows:\n\nfor each possible address\n         set corresponding input true\n         test\n         set corresponding input false\n         test\nnext\n\ne.g. you are exploiting the fact that for an address of N, only input line \nn actually matters, and you can set the others to random values or start \nwith a small set of random patterns and only check exhaustively when you \nget really fit networks...\n\nOr you could even have a fitness function that rewards a network for its \noutput being _not_ affected by changes to the non-addressed inputs.\n\n&gt; &gt;Go for it.  Or how about evolving an indirect representation for a general\n&gt; &gt;N + 2^N multiplexer?\n&gt; &gt;Should have had a &quot;:-)&quot; on that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Yes, I did wonder how I was supposed to arrange the i/o connections on\n&gt;that one - not for long though :)\n\nI really want to get a grip on some indirect encoding schemes that might do \nthis.  But I didn&#39;t get my thoughts together yet.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
