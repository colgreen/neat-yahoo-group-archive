I noticed a few minor things \nthough:\n\n-I don&#39;t think the default value for connectness of the initial \ngenome should be 0.2.  The default should be 1 and people should be \nable to adjust it down from there.  I think most users would not \nknow what the 0.2 is and not understand what affect it&#39;s having.\n\n-I find I can&#39;t delete a network in the species visualization as it \nsays I can.  The only species that I can get to disappear are dead \nones, and not by clicking on them.\n\n-Something went wrong with file loading in the pole balacing and \nprey capture simulators.  It seems you changed something about your \nfile structure but didn&#39;t make the corresponding change in their \nloaders.\n\nIt&#39;s getting quite impressive.  Congratulations on really nice work!\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At the usual URL http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; Notes from the web site:\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; New network visualization windows in the main SharpNEAT \nexecutable. This \n&gt; includes a best genome window and a window for monitoring the best \n&gt; genomes from a selected range of species, you can also set this \nwindow \n&gt; to monitor the best N species.\n&gt; \n&gt; New network visualization tool (bin/NetworkViewer.exe). Currently \nthis \n&gt; loads and displays SharpNEAT network XML. There are plans turn \nthis into \n&gt; an editor and to support loading/saving of other network and \ngenome file \n&gt; formats\n&gt; \n&gt; Important Notice. There currently exists a problem in the genome \n&gt; crossover code that allows multiple connections to accrue between \ntwo \n&gt; neurons, or between a single neuron in the case of recurrent \n&gt; conenctions. This will have some detrimental effect on searches, \n&gt; although how much of an effect is not known. This problem is being \n&gt; worked on.\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the last point, I was intending to resolve this problem \ntoday \n&gt; but I&#39;m still deciding on the best way to do this. I was going to \ntry \n&gt; and maintain a full history of all additions, which would solve \nthe \n&gt; problem and actually it sounds like a better strategy. \nUnfortunately if \n&gt; I do it this way then the problem re-appears when you distribute a \n&gt; search over multiple PCs - or at least the using the way I was \nthinking \n&gt; of doing distribution anyhow.\n\n\n"}}
