Why is it that if I create a network with 10 input nodes and 1 \n&gt;output nodes, when I use the newwork viewer application is show \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;the network as haveing 11 input nodes?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPhilip got it. There is always one bias input node + however many you \ndefine for your experiment, and it is always the first node.\n\n&gt;2. I&#39;ve created an experiment where most test require a simple \n&gt;network in order to get the right answer.  However, a few of the \n&gt;tests require a more complex solution.  What seems to be happening \n&gt;is that the searching process quickly finds the simple network but \n&gt;which achieves about 94% of the fitness but never finds a network \n&gt;that fits the complete solution.  I think a solution should be \n&gt;possible as the inputs are logically created.\n&gt;\nCan you explain the experiment a bit more, this might help us gauge \nwhether a solution should or could be found.\n\n&gt;  I think the more \n&gt;specialised species are being wiped-out before they get the change \n&gt;to evolve properly.  What changes to my network parameters can I \n&gt;make to increase the change of more complex networks?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe default species drop-off age is 200. What this means is, if the max \nobserved fitness in a species&#39; hasn;t improved for 200 generations then \nthe species is culled. I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re after.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;Chris,\n&gt;\n&gt;How many generations have you run your experiment?  Sometimes it can \n&gt;take a while to build up the necessary structure to jump \n&gt;from &quot;almost perfect&quot; to &quot;perfect.&quot;  That is, it may take hundreds \n&gt;of generations even.  \n&gt;\n&gt;It is also possible that you have your speciation parameters set up \n&gt;in a way that doesn&#39;t let new species develop.  Unfortunately, I \n&gt;don&#39;t know exactly how SharpNEAT allocates these parameters (such as \n&gt;the coefficients of the compatibility equations and the \n&gt;compatibility threshold).\n&gt;\nThey are pretty much as defined by standard NEAT. So that&#39;s a node, \nconnection and weight delta co-efficient. The compatibilty threshold \nstarts out at fixed value and is dynamically adjusted to maintain the \nnumber of species between a upper and lower limits. So generally \nspeaking everything balances out by itself after a few gens. For \nnon-trivial tasks I do now tend to use a population of 1000 and species \nmin/ax thresholds of 40 & 50 respectively. The default settings in \nSharpNEAT are 150 genomes and 6/10 species.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
