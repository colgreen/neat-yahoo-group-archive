That&#39;s really interesting.\n\nI&#39;ve re-written it.  It now is much less of a burden on the server, the \ngraph is vertical instead of horizontal, html-based, and very colorful!\n\nI also used the same colors for the main topology graph, so it&#39;s much more \nbright and cheerful.\n\nCheck it out! :)\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/reports/\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
