Is there any chance you could release =\r\na\nversion that lets the user scale the networks and observe the impact?\n Th=\r\nat would be very interesting.  You mentioned that it does generally\nwork wi=\r\nth some imperfections.\n\nAnother interesting thing about these substrates is=\r\n that they appear\nto be highly recurrent.  Is that right?  The amount of re=\r\ncurrence\nsuggests that the mechanisms for action are likely quite different=\r\n\nthan what we see for example in early generation regaular NEAT,\nbecause th=\r\nese substrate networks must have ways of maintaining\nequilibrium and self-s=\r\ntabilizing cycling activation.\n\nAbout the complexification,  I am sure ther=\r\ne is some limit due to the\nfinite nature of the substrate, although it will=\r\n take a while to get\nthere.  However, of course, if you start with a bigger=\r\n substrate the\nlimit is greater.\n\nBy the way, I wonder if there is a memory=\r\n leak or something like that?\n I notice that after 100 generations or so th=\r\ne simulation of the\nrobots on the screen slowed down a lot.  However, I do =\r\nnot see a\nreason that it should slow down since the substrates are always t=\r\nhe\nsame size.  Why would they simulate slower in one generation than anothe=\r\nr?\n\nFinally, just out of curiosity, why is your version of NEAT protected\nb=\r\nehind an NDA?  Are you trying to do something commercial with it?\n\nken\n\n\n--=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy that you like my demo. This particular experi=\r\nment was set \n&gt; up to answer some questions I had in mind. The first one is=\r\n obvious, \n&gt; is there a geometric regularity in the predator/prey task that=\r\n \n&gt; HyperNEAT can possibly exploit. And there is. I can see some \n&gt; meaning=\r\nful behaviors emerging with HyperNEAT as early as the 4th or \n&gt; 5th generat=\r\nion. My next question was, what is the difference between \n&gt; the indirect e=\r\nncoding and the direct encoding. Let me make it more \n&gt; clear. In your expe=\r\nriments in the robot duel domain, both robot NNs \n&gt; are encoded directly an=\r\nd complexifying. They elaborate on previous \n&gt; strategies by incrementally =\r\nadding more structure, right? \n&gt; What about HyperNEAT, does it preserve the=\r\n same dynamics, where the \n&gt; CPPNs complexify but the substrate is fixed? D=\r\noes it lead to endless \n&gt; alteration of strategies instead of elaboration? =\r\nI can predict that \n&gt; HyperNEAT can discover some complex connectivity patt=\r\nerns between \n&gt; hidden nodes to develop some kind of &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior=\r\n, but is \n&gt; that limited? \n&gt; Well this question is still not answered becau=\r\nse, as you mentioned, \n&gt; the predator/prey task is too easy to learn, thoug=\r\nh there is room for \n&gt; the predator and prey to learn tricks to fool each o=\r\nther. For example \n&gt; the prey can learn to hide behind walls, etc. \n&gt; Yes I=\r\n compared it to direct encoding NEAT and generally I can conclude \n&gt; that H=\r\nyperNEAT develops strategies faster. Especially in the case of \n&gt; many many=\r\n inputs. Scaling works as well, but it is not perfect. \n&gt; Let me tell you a=\r\nbout the source code. Unfortunately the core NEAT \n&gt; library I wrote and us=\r\ne is locked under an NDA but it is equivalent to \n&gt; the rtNEAT modification=\r\n I released with the NEVH project. The \n&gt; visualization routines are basica=\r\nlly the same there, there is nothing \n&gt; new at all. But I can release the s=\r\nource code for the demos \n&gt; themselves. Please ask me about any details, I =\r\nwill be happy to help \n&gt; anyone. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, thanks for this Hyp=\r\nerNEAT coevolution demo.  I see some\n&gt; &gt; interesting behaviors evolving, bu=\r\nt I am curious about your own\n&gt; &gt; conclusions?  What did you learn from thi=\r\ns experiment?  Did you try\n&gt; &gt; comparing it to regular NEAT in the same dom=\r\nain?  I am not sure\n&gt; &gt; whether the difference would be great since I am no=\r\nt sure if this \n&gt; task\n&gt; &gt; is sufficiently complex to exhibit a significant=\r\n difference between\n&gt; &gt; the methods.  That is, there is probably only so go=\r\nod that you can \n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; before new skills stop really mattering in this =\r\ndomain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, do you plan releasing source code for your var=\r\nious\n&gt; &gt; experiments and AI code?  It seems like you have a nice system set=\r\n \n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; and other people might like tinkering with it.  I especially lik=\r\ne \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; real-time CPPN/substrate displays.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hell=\r\no,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the neat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; group.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   File        : /HyperNEAT_PredatorPrey.exe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Uploaded b=\r\ny : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Description : HyperNEAT a=\r\npplied to competetive predator-prey\n&gt; &gt; coevolution task (with walls).  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/neat/files/HyperNEAT_PredatorPrey.exe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To learn mo=\r\nre about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; http://hel=\r\np.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\n&gt; lfiles\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
