The highest output value determines the action: dribble towards goal (a=\r\nt attacker with ball position), pass (at teammate position) or shoot (at go=\r\nal post position).\nThe achieved performance is a little bit better than a s=\r\nimple handcoded solution, but I wonder a few things:\nThe solution is not re=\r\nally aware of the distances of the attacker with ball to its teammates and =\r\nto the goal, which results in attempted shots from the middle line and pass=\r\nes to teammates far away. I tried using path values corresponding to the di=\r\nstances and no paths at all, but the performance is similar. I also tried t=\r\no use a lengthCppn-input (as in the visual discrimination task), but that d=\r\noes not show any performance gain.\nIs there a better way to represent the s=\r\ntate and shoot action?\n\n\nAttacker without ball:\nThe input layer is marked w=\r\nith the position of attacker with ball (+1), attackers without ball (+0.5) =\r\nexcept the attacker requesting an action and defenders (-1). The highest ou=\r\ntput value determines the position to which the agent should move.\nThis doe=\r\ns not work at all. All attackers tend to move to the same positions.\n\nDefen=\r\nders:\nThe input layer is marked with the position of attackers (-1), positi=\r\nons of teammates (+0.5) and the defender requesting an action (+1). The hig=\r\nhest output value determines wether to intercept the ball (at attacker with=\r\n ball position) or to mark an attacker (at attacker without ball position).=\r\n\nThis representation suffers the same problem as attackers without ball: al=\r\nl defenders execute the same action (mark same player, intercept ball).\n\nI =\r\nprobably miss something because this is my first experiment with HyperNEAT.=\r\n I&#39;d appreciate any tips for the representation of the state in the input l=\r\nayer, especially for attackers without ball and defenders.\n\nKind regards,\nT=\r\nhomas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
