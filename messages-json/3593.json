Unfortunately =\r\nit won&#39;t speed up the other\nnon-NEAT portions of the problem. If it did, it=\r\n would simply be a\nsuper computer and then I could charge more and have a m=\r\nuch broader\nmarket :) We are developing it in house to use for accelerating=\r\n our\nown R&D. It could be used, for example as a dedicated NEAT appliance\ni=\r\nn a cluster of computers to process the NEAT aspects of the problem.\nWhile =\r\nthe other computers work on the non-NEAT parts.\n\nWe are in the process of d=\r\neveloping it. However it looks quite\npromising and will definitely help our=\r\n research. So I was interested\nin whether there would be enough commercial =\r\ninterest to bring it to\nmarket.\n\nThank you,\n\nShane \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shane, \n&gt; \n&gt; Naturally I=\r\n&#39;m very interested in what a NEAT accelerator actually \n&gt; does.  My researc=\r\nh group certainly does a lot of work with NEAT so we \n&gt; would actually purc=\r\nhase something like that (assuming funds were \n&gt; available) if the price wa=\r\ns sufficiently competitive to be faster for \n&gt; the dollar compared to somet=\r\nhing more simple like a regular CPU \n&gt; cluster.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I think that is the=\r\n main pricing question:  For $10,000, if you \n&gt; are efficient, you can buy =\r\nmaybe a 20-core cluster, which in effect \n&gt; is a 10x speedup from a regular=\r\n 2-core CPU.  So a 20x speedup sounds \n&gt; economical if it is genuine.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYet I am not clear how such gains would be made specifically with \n&gt; NEAT i=\r\nn mind?  One of the biggest expenses with running experiments \n&gt; with NEAT =\r\ncomes during evaluation in the task domain, which includes \n&gt; a lot of code=\r\n (aside from the ANN activation method) that is not \n&gt; specific to NEAT.  I=\r\nn fact, in many domains, it is task the domain \n&gt; simulation itself that ta=\r\nkes the vast majority of CPU.  For example, \n&gt; a task trained in a robot si=\r\nmulator spends more time simulating the \n&gt; robot than doing anything NEAT-s=\r\npecific.  Of course, in some \n&gt; supervised applications (e.g. financial dat=\r\na) it is possible that \n&gt; network activation takes up more CPU than the dom=\r\nain since the domain \n&gt; is in effect just a bunch of numerical comparisons.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So the questions is what exactly is being accelerated and how, so \n&gt; =\r\nthat a purchaser can be confident that they are going to get the \n&gt; offered=\r\n speedup overall, and not just when NEAT-specific code is \n&gt; being called?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, sounds really interesting and I&#39;d enjoy hearing more about it.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shanemcdonaldryan&quot; \n&gt; &lt;s=\r\nhanemcdonaldryan@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My company is in the process of developin=\r\ng a NEAT accelerator. This \n&gt; &gt; would be a combination of hardware and soft=\r\nware that accelerates \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; process of evolving a population of netwo=\r\nrks for a particular NEAT \n&gt; &gt; application.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We anticipate a 20 fol=\r\nd reduction in training time compared to a \n&gt; &gt; system running on a single =\r\nCPU Dual Core Pentium system. But this \n&gt; &gt; would of course depend greatly =\r\nupon the problem at hand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The product will consist of an API writt=\r\nen in C that will interface \n&gt; &gt; with a hardware system and accelerate the =\r\ncore functionality of the \n&gt; &gt; NEAT algorithm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A feature set and p=\r\nricing model has not been finalized.  Though to \n&gt; &gt; make the product finan=\r\ncially viable a tentative price of $10K USD \n&gt; has \n&gt; &gt; been estimated.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The reason I am posting is to gauge interest.
