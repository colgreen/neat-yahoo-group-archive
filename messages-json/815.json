Possibly the original work to which\n&gt;they refer might have some applications for us. OTOH,\n&gt;whatever their topology was NEAT might be able to\n&gt;evolve it, without knowing what they did. I have no\n&gt;doubt that NEAT can evolve nets with short term\n&gt;memory. What is not clear is how much memory, i.e.\n&gt;given a reasonable amount of time for evolution, how\n&gt;much data can be stored and retrieved. It would also\n&gt;depend on the manner of retrieval.\n&gt;\n&gt;=====\n&gt;Mitchell Timin\n&gt;http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;Yahoo!
