But I guess that the &lt;br&gt;\nbest &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way is to recompute the novelty scores at regular intervals.. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;lehman.154@ &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Peter,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glad to hear that you are interested in the method, and that &lt;br&gt;\nyou&#39;ve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been able to implement it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are correct, the novelty of each individual is calculated &lt;br&gt;\nwith&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respect to the current population and the archive.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, sparseness in the behavioral space around an individual &lt;br&gt;\nis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equated with novelty, which is used for the fitness of the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ideally, novelty would recomputed for each individual in the &lt;br&gt;\ncurrent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generation after each evaluation. In our implementation it is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get stale for a few evaluations (in the same frequency that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuals are respeciated according to rtNEAT). In our &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowing for a bit staleness did not effect the results.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, in the scenario you describe, each of the &lt;br&gt;\nindividuals &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now have a lower novelty, the original individual included. &lt;br&gt;\nThis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflects that the area around these individuals in behavior &lt;br&gt;\nspace is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more dense than it previously was. As more individuals come &lt;br&gt;\ninto a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular area, the novelty of all of them drops, and &lt;br&gt;\nprovides&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pressure for individuals to do something new in order to be &lt;br&gt;\nseen as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novel.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me know if you have any more implementation questions, &lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;ll be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; releasing my source based off the rtNEAT package in the next &lt;br&gt;\nfew &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Joel &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;petar_chervenski@ &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I implemented novelty search and the maze navigation task &lt;br&gt;\n(it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works! :)), but I need to ask you about something. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So when a new individual is spawned from the population, &lt;br&gt;\nits &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computed based on the domain-specific distance measure to &lt;br&gt;\nall &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors in the population and the archive, right. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But what about the population itself, should every &lt;br&gt;\nindividual &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recompute its sparseness on every evaluation, based on the &lt;br&gt;\nnew &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask this because when I observe the sparseness (I assume &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparseness &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals fitness) of the individuals, say one happens to be &lt;br&gt;\nin a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sparse area so it receives a high fitness score. But then a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other individuals come into this area, so it becomes more &lt;br&gt;\ndense. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that first individual still has a high fitness score? Is &lt;br&gt;\nthis &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Peter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n\n\t \n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1848136686-1211629713=:96775--\r\n\n"}}
