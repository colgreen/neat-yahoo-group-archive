Amy and I (and now Paul too) have intended for a long time to extend =\r\nthe theory behind NEAT Drummer to full-blown harmonization.  The basic idea=\r\n is that different parts of a composition can be expressed as *functions* o=\r\nf each other.  Therefore, if you have some parts already written, then you =\r\ncan apply an evolved function (encoded as a CPPN evolved by NEAT) to those =\r\nparts and it will automatically output an accompaniment.  Because the accom=\r\npaniment is a function of the preexisting parts (which we call the &quot;scaffol=\r\nd&quot;), it naturally follows their contours.  In other words, you can get surp=\r\nrisingly good accompaniments in very few generations of interactive evoluti=\r\non.  The overall approach is called Functional Scaffolding for Musical Comp=\r\nosition (FSMC), which can evolve complete original harmonies (i.e. not just=\r\n drums) or even novel melodies to accompany existing harmonies.\n\nYou can li=\r\nsten to some samples at the link above and we will be sharing more in the f=\r\nuture.  We added a couple &quot;bonus tracks&quot; to the page (of accompaniment gene=\r\nrated for Scarborough Fair from only generation 3) that are not from the pa=\r\nper, but we think you&#39;ll find them surprisingly good in any case.  We&#39;re ha=\r\nving a lot of fun applying FSMC to lots of different kinds of music and sur=\r\nprising ourselves with the creative variations it comes up.  We hope to rel=\r\nease the actual application in the coming months for others to play with as=\r\n well.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
