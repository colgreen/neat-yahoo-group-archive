My\n&gt;own belief is that this large number of generations is\n&gt;necessary to trawl a multi-dimensional search space\n&gt;effectively.\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting point of view.  I have been influenced greatly\nby the experiments done by Ken and other neuroevolution techniques\nsuch as SANE, all of which seem to be able to converge on their\nresults, topologically and synaptically complex results, in less than\n500 generations.  I cannot recall looking over any paper (and there&#39;s\nbeen quite a few) where the intended goal took more than 500\ngenerations to reach.\n\nOf course this is probably just my own ignorance and inexperience\nshowing itself - as I&#39;m assuming that all experiments can be grouped\ntogether, regardless of whether it is using co-evolution or taking\ninto account how the scenario is designed, etc...  \n\nMy scenario is very limited in its opening permutations, for each\nskill, and I cannot simply place characters randomly if I hope to\nachieve any sort of meaningful fitness evaluation.  After much thought\nI think the scenario design is sound, so perhaps I am just not giving\nNEAT enough time to evolve the appropriate solution(s).\n\nAfter 719 generations on the hardest memory test possible (scenario\nE), my recurrent NN has achieved a fitness of 5005 out of 5107, so far\nso good.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
