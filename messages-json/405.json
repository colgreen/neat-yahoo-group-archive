If you have a fixed number of\ninputs, \n&gt; &gt;some of which are not relevant, then learning a weight of 0 is\nequivalent to \n&gt; &gt;simplifying them out of the genome, right?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; yes. Although the zero weights would contribute to a network\ncomplexity \n&gt; measurement, thus muddying up any experimentation! That problem can\nbe \n&gt; addressed by factoring network complexity (genome length) into the \n&gt; fitness calculation. Someone tell me if I seem like a dog with a\nbone on \n&gt; this one? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway this made made me think of another question: Disabled genes\nare \n&gt; mention in the original NEAT paper (enable bit). Are any of the\ncurrent \n&gt; implementations utilizing this bit? Is it beneficial to implement \n&gt; dormant genes in NEAT?\n&gt; \n\nA lot of the discussion about how NEAT does not simplify is slightly\nmisleading.  NEAT *does* have a mutation operator that flips enable\nbits to &quot;disabled&quot; with random probability.  It&#39;s just that I never\nactually used this kind of mutation in the experiments I ran.  The\nreason I didn&#39;t use it was so that we don&#39;t have too many opposing\nprocesses happening at the same time, which would make the analysis of\nthe algorithm too convoluted.  But there is nothing about the system\nitself that prevents one from allowing genes to become randomly\ndisabled, and my current implementation has such a mutation available.\n (muate_toggle_enable in the .ne file).  \n\nThat said, I&#39;ve tried using it, and didn&#39;t find any dramatic\nimprovement in performance, although I absolutely believe more\nexperiments with the idea of complexification with pruning are\nmerited, especially over long term evolution.  \n\nI should also note that as Derek said, NEAT does disable genes when it\nadds a node, and there is some probability during mating that a\ndisabled gene may become reenabled.  I only mention this to point out\nyou will see disabled genes occasionally even without another mutation\noperator.\n\nAlso note that the proper way to simplify in NEAT is to disable,\nbecause if you literally cut out a gene, you lose that historical\ninformation, which is still useful for compatibility determination.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
