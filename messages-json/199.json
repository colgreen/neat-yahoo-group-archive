An\nNK landscape is an approximation for the very rugged search spaces that\ntend to come up in evolutionary search. N represents the number of genes\nin a chromosome and K represents the number of linkages. So from this, we\nknow that K &lt; N and the relative difficulty increases with K (as linkage\nincreases so does the number of peaks of the fitness landscape).\n\nThe fitness of a certain chromosome is determined by averaging the fitness\nat each of the loci. The fitness of a locus is determined by a lookup\ntable (usually random) in which all combinations of alleles across K\nlinked loci are enumerated. Here is a quick example for N=3 K=1:\n\nLocus one is linked to locus 2, locus 2 is linked to locus 3, and locus 3\nis linked to locus 1.\n\nA gene can take on either the value 0 or 1.\n\nNK Table:\n\n   locus1 locus2 locus3\n00  this\n01    table\n10      is\n11          random\n\nThus if locus one took on the value 0 and locus two took on the value 0,\nthe fitness of locus 1 would come from the table under (00, locus1). So\nyou can see, with a high linkage and a large number of genes... the\nproblem gets pretty difficult.\n\nI read somewhere that NK landscapes are similar to the spin-glass model,\nbut I&#39;m not sure about that.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
