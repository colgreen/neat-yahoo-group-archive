I ran across NEAT an=\r\nd I&#39;m very interested in using it as \na \n&gt; &gt; function approximator of my va=\r\nlue function. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am doing a single pendulum balancing upright (muc=\r\nh like the \n&gt; &gt; mountain-car problem). I am currently discreteizing the sta=\r\nte-\nspace \n&gt; &gt; into a 60x60x3(position,velocity,action) table.  This is fin=\r\ne for \n2 \n&gt; &gt; states, but the model I will be implementing for my walker (3=\r\n-\nlink \n&gt; &gt; pendulum) has 6 states.  I have hopes of adapting Matlab NEAT f=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; NEAT+Q.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few questions on neural nets that I could=\r\nn&#39;t find a \nclear \n&gt; &gt; answer on by searching through the internet.  \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) State Features:\n&gt; &gt;    In the mountain car example there are two sta=\r\ntes: position and \n&gt; &gt; velocity.  However, the neural net has 20 inputs (10=\r\n for \nposition, \n&gt; &gt; and 10 for velocity).  Am I correct in assuming that e=\r\nach of the \n10 \n&gt; &gt; inputs represents 1/10 of the unit circle for position?=\r\n  I read \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; Neural Networks like inputs in the range of 0 to 1 (w=\r\nhy is \nthis?).  \n&gt; &gt; So if the position is in a certain region, is the inpu=\r\nt for that \n&gt; &gt; feature 1 and 0 for all other state features that represent=\r\n other \n&gt; &gt; positions?  Or can it be a fraction between 0 and 1?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2=\r\n) Net Output:\n&gt; &gt;    The mountain car problem had 3 outputs, 1 for each act=\r\nion.  \nI&#39;m \n&gt; &gt; guessing that the output with the highest value corresponde=\r\nd to a \n&gt; &gt; discrete action.  If NEAT+Q was to approximate a value function=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; however, would the outputs still be the 3 actions?\n&gt; &gt;    In addition=\r\n, By using the sigmoid 1/(1+exp(-4.9x)) the output \nof \n&gt; &gt; each node is fo=\r\nrced to be 0 or 1 correct?  In NEAT+Q the output \n&gt; error \n&gt; &gt; is: r+gamma*=\r\nVa&#39; which would be used in back-propagation.  But if \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; output is =\r\neither a 0 or a 1, how could this be used to model a \n&gt; value \n&gt; &gt; function=\r\n?  Unless the output of the NN is just the sum of inputs \n&gt; into \n&gt; &gt; the o=\r\nutput node.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Matlab NEAT:\n&gt; &gt;    Other than number_input_nodes a=\r\nnd number_output_nodes in the \n&gt; &gt; neat_main.m file, is the entire experime=\r\nnt contained in the \n&gt; &gt; xor_experiment_vec.m file?  I&#39;m assuming this is w=\r\nhere the Q-\n&gt; Learning \n&gt; &gt; and dynamics simulation would take place.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n  Does Matlab NEAT use backpropagation to optimize the weights?  \nI \n&gt; &gt; di=\r\ndn&#39;t see anywhere in the code where the weights were \n&gt; backpropagated \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (perhaps I missed something).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry my message was so long, but I=\r\n&#39;ve read through the most of \nthe \n&gt; &gt; Stanley/Whiteson/Stone papers, the 1=\r\n7-page help file, the \n&gt; &gt; readme&#39;s contained in the c++ and matlab version=\r\ns of NEAT, and a \n&gt; few \n&gt; &gt; unrelated NN websites.  Needless to say I&#39;m ne=\r\nw and sort of \nlost.  \n&gt; &gt; Any assistance is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
