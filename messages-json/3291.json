Please address this specific issue. The \nanswer to this question will=\r\n help to identify the \napplicability/limitations of HyperNEAT.\n\nThanks,\n   =\r\nAndy Carl\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thomas, this is a great question that highlights an important are=\r\na \nfor \n&gt; further research.  We can speculate on the right approach in this=\r\n \ncase \n&gt; (and I have my hunches) but we won&#39;t know until we do some \nexper=\r\niments \n&gt; and try ideas out.\n&gt; \n&gt; To give some of my thoughts, perhaps the =\r\nmost obvious thing is \nsimilar \n&gt; to what you suggest:  Have two separate i=\r\nnput sets, one for \nthe &quot;type A \n&gt; info&quot; and one for &quot;type B info.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe way this would look is e.g. if A was 2D and B was 2D then the \nCPPN \n&gt; =\r\nwould have 4 inputs, 2 represent A source nodes and 2 representing \nB \n&gt; so=\r\nource nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, I would still have only one set of outputs.  I am s=\r\ntill a \nlittle \n&gt; unclear on why you say the outputs are from the second su=\r\nbstrate?  \nIn \n&gt; my understanding, this is still all one substrate, it&#39;s ju=\r\nst that \nit \n&gt; collects inputs from two different sources.  But it can stil=\r\nl exist \n&gt; with only one set of outputs.  So if the outputs are 2D, the CPP=\r\nN \nwould \n&gt; have 2 more inputs representing the output area for a total of =\r\n6 \ninputs \n&gt; (and one output representing the weight of a connection in the=\r\n \n&gt; substrate).\n&gt; \n&gt; If there was a hidden layer you could have it exist in=\r\n either the \nsame \n&gt; geometry as A, the same geometry as B, or the same geo=\r\nmetry as the \n&gt; outputs.  (For example by introducing a z dimension to any =\r\nof \nthese)  \n&gt; Or you could have each kind of hidden layer all at once.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Of course, as you note, there are a lot of ways to do something \nlike \n&gt; =\r\nthis.  I think it will be a great issue to explore, but it may \nrequire \n&gt; =\r\nstarting with a very simple domain that isolates the issue (i.e. \n&gt; orthogo=\r\nnal input types) so we can concentrate on that rather than \non a \n&gt; specifi=\r\nc domain with its own complications.\n&gt; \n&gt; One other issue to note is that e=\r\nven if two sets of inputs are in \n&gt; effect unrelated, it may not necessaril=\r\ny hurt antyhing to put them \nin \n&gt; the same geometry.  For example, they co=\r\nuld be two separate planes \nin \n&gt; the same cube.  On the face of it, it see=\r\nms like that could cause \n&gt; problems, but we don&#39;t yet know whether the sit=\r\nuation is that \ndifficult \n&gt; to deal with in practice.  There could also be=\r\n hidden relationships \n&gt; that are not obvious but still exploitable in a su=\r\nrprising way.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas J=\r\nohnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.johnson@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT folks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wha=\r\nt&#39;s the recommended strategy for handling inputs that \nrepresent \n&gt; concept=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; that are not geometrically related? For instance, consider \nsomething=\r\n \n&gt; like a\n&gt; &gt; poker game where we want to input both players&#39; actions and =\r\nthe \ncards \n&gt; we\n&gt; &gt; see. We might be able to come up with geometric encodi=\r\nngs for \neither \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; these individually, but there&#39;s no obvious spacia=\r\nl relationship \n&gt; between\n&gt; &gt; cards and actions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
