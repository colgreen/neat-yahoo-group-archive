One\n&gt; &gt; suggestion is to try pruning the net=\r\nworks with the addition of subtractive\n&gt; &gt; mutations (remove link & remove =\r\nnode). Or better try phased searching,\n&gt; &gt; complexification followed by sim=\r\nplification stages. This will improve things\n&gt; &gt; for sure. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs r=\r\necently that the number\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear=\r\n function of time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the f=\r\nitness trajectory of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; run. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Som=\r\netimes it gets really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jc=\r\nlune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the r=\r\nuns in this second figure where the CPPN node\n&gt; &gt;&gt; count linearly increases=\r\n are in a changing environment and those runs where\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the CPPN node coun=\r\nt flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One problem is that it ma=\r\nkes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt; &gt;&gt; populations with 200-nod=\r\ne genomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evolution can make too muc=\r\nh progress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; seen fitness continue=\r\n to increase even with such large genomes).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have tried droppin=\r\ng the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that definitely =\r\nchanges the slope of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; increases. The go=\r\nod news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any thoughts=\r\n? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolut=\r\nion Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
