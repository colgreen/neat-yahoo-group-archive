The\ntrick to using them is multithreading. So perhaps your asking if NEAT\ncan be massively multithreaded.

How the fitness evaluation is done is always program\nspecific. A framework that manages lists of threads would be a very\nusable addition to NEAT. I imagine the package interface would require a\nthread that is given a pointer to a network, and must return a fitness\nvalue for that network. For multi-agent evaluations, an ordered list of\nnetworks is presented, and a matching ordered list of finesses is\nreturned. Then the framework manages the threads, collects the results,\nand runs the NEAT epoch. \nThat&#39;s a product I would love to use, and if I had access to a cluster,\nmight find time to throw together.
