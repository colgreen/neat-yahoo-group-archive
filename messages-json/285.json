I made it run faster, I\nincluded a WhatsNew.txt file and a results.txt file,\nand shorter perfect player chromosomes.  The smallest\none has only 34 neurons.  Also, a program to examine\nand report about a chromosome is included.  With it I\ndiscovered that well over half of the weights and\nbiases for the 4Play perfect chromosomes, are\nunecessary! There are several unecesary neurons also! \nHowever, my current methods don&#39;t result in ANNs like\nthose.  I&#39;ll bet NEAT could evolve a perfect player\nwith only 20 neurons!  (That&#39;s assuming binary neurons\nwhich have only 1-bit of memory capacity.) \nTheoretically, neurons with continuous output have\nmuch higher memory capacity; but its not clear if that\nwould be applicable to this problem.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
