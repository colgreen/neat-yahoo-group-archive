(After you try other optimization methods suggested here.) If th=\r\ne training set is fairly static you can use local storage on each cluster n=\r\node, which will make the evaluation scale pretty near linearly with the num=\r\nber of nodes. \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chhofchhof&quot; &lt;Christian.Hofman=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello together!\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to start a new project with v=\r\nery much training data. \n&gt; \n&gt; Doing some tests, currently I need for one ge=\r\nneration about 347 days.\n&gt; That&#39;s a bit too long :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you know trick=\r\ns to handle that amount of data?\n&gt; Or should I just select per random one m=\r\nillion datasets and only use these?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Christian\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
