The problem is that there \nare so\n&gt; &gt;  many possible spurious correla=\r\ntions between good pictures and \nother\n&gt; &gt;  irrelevent factors that the cla=\r\nssifier will not get the deeper\n&gt; &gt;  concept of what makes a good picture.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Yet I agree with John in the sense that there is extremely rich \na=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt;  unusual data in the Picbreeder database that may be useful for\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n something beyond Picbreeder itself.  I just think the right way \nto\n&gt; &gt;  l=\r\neverage it is tricky.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  The idea of complexity is also quite muddy. =\r\n Unfortunately, the \nword\n&gt; &gt;  means a lot of different things.  In fact, p=\r\nerhaps the best \nformal\n&gt; &gt;  definition (&quot;minimal description length&quot;) is b=\r\noth proven\n&gt; &gt;  uncomputable in general and also does not correlate to what=\r\n is \nmeant\n&gt; &gt;  by the normal intuitive use of the word complexity with res=\r\npect \nto\n&gt; &gt;  evolution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  As evolutionary complexity goes up in the=\r\n sense we usually mean \nit,\n&gt; &gt;  it is not just that the phenotype takes mo=\r\nre bits to describe.\n&gt; &gt;  There is also a sense of organization, i.e. regul=\r\narity, that \nbegins\n&gt; &gt;  to take hold.  That is in direct opposition with t=\r\nhe idea of \nminimal\n&gt; &gt;  description length.  In fact, what we really want =\r\nis some kind of\n&gt; &gt;  partnership between complexity and organization.  Unfo=\r\nrtunately \nthat\n&gt; &gt;  introduces yet another mysterious word: organization; =\r\nit also\n&gt; &gt;  introduced a partnership between two seemingly opposing forces=\r\n.  \nYet\n&gt; &gt;  I think this muddiness and internal conflict is important \nbec=\r\nause it\n&gt; &gt;  shows that this problem is extremely slippery.  It makes me \nw=\r\nonder\n&gt; &gt;  what is meant by &quot;doing well&quot; for humans asked to select for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  complexity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  In any case, I do like the theme behind John&#39;s idea,=\r\n but I think\n&gt; &gt;  something more sophisitcated needs to be done to capture =\r\nthe \ndeeper\n&gt; &gt;  reasons that certain pictures are selected.\n&gt; \n&gt; In classi=\r\ncal art there are &#39;rules&#39; for good works.  The rule of\n&gt; thirds, for exampl=\r\ne.  Why do those rules exist?  I would posit that\n&gt; those rules exist becau=\r\nse of a mathematical relationship that exists\n&gt; in how the signals travel a=\r\nround in our brain.  I suspect that a\n&gt; network COULD be developed that wou=\r\nld be able to identify the pure\n&gt; aesthetic merit of a particular image, be=\r\ncause I think that at that\n&gt; level, aesthetics is a purely mathematical fun=\r\nction.\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I think that it would be very unlikely to be able to=\r\n say,\n&gt; &quot;hey, that looks like a bunny rabbit that has been \nborgified...coo=\r\nl!&quot;\n&gt; Since our choice of what to breed for is based partly on aesthetics\n&gt;=\r\n and partly on the emotional tie to the objects that something \nreminds\n&gt; u=\r\ns of, there is little chance that a controller network could \ntotally\n&gt; rep=\r\nlace the human.\n&gt; \n&gt; But what if?  What if a controller could be evolved wh=\r\nich learned to\n&gt; recognize good image composition rules?  How might such a =\r\nthing \nextend\n&gt; the usefulness of PicBreeder in general?  What might it tea=\r\nch us?\n&gt; What might it say about the limits of computer controls?  What mig=\r\nht\n&gt; it say about US?  Is there any merit at all to undertaking such an\n&gt; e=\r\nxperiment?  In my opinion, there is.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\nJohn, you argue persuasi=\r\nvely for your idea, and I can see the \nappeal.  I would not dismiss the ide=\r\na that there is the possibility \nthat a classifier could evolve that detect=\r\ns something surprising \nabout aesthetic value and thereby filters the searc=\r\nh for interesting \nimages.  It is an intoxicating idea and I would love to =\r\nhear about \nand see the results of any such attempt.\n\nYet let me give you a=\r\nn idea about the origin of my skepticism.  I&#39;m \nbasically jaded by the unde=\r\nrwhelming results of past such efforts.  \nFor example, a friend of mine tri=\r\ned to evolve a neural network to \ndetect good music in a similar approach t=\r\no yours.  I have heard of \nother attempts like that one (usually they seem =\r\nto be with music).  I \nrealize these stories are only anecdotal, yet I draw=\r\n a lesson from \nthem which shows the danger in such an approach:\n\nEvolution=\r\n likes to cheat and get by easy.  If you want it to learn \nsomething deep a=\r\nnd general, it tries to learn some cheap trick to do \nalmost as well withou=\r\nt having to deal with the deep stuff.  In other \nwords, like lightning, it =\r\ntakes the path of least resistance.  The \nproblem with training to detect a=\r\nrtistic quality is that there may be \npredominant correlations among pictur=\r\nes or songs that we deem good \nthat are really not the reason they are good=\r\n.\n\nFor exampele, &quot;good&quot; songs may tend to have a lot of C notes, not \nbecau=\r\nse C makes a good song, but rather because it happens to appear \na lot in a=\r\n particular genre, perhaps because it is the base note of \nsome scale.  Thu=\r\ns, an evolved classifier will simply predict that \nanything with a lot of C=\r\n&#39;s is good, missing the deeper reasons \nentirely.  Or, in Picbreeder, you m=\r\nay notice if you look closely that \nmany (though not all) of the published =\r\nimages have some sort of small \ncircular formation near their center.  For =\r\nexample this object may be \na nose, an eye (in a profile), a cockpit window=\r\n, an iris, a keyhole, \na sun, a moon, a fingernail, etc.  Therefore, a clas=\r\nsifier would do \nwell to learn to predict that any picture with a small cir=\r\ncle in the \nmiddle is good, again missing the point.\n\nI think the reason su=\r\nch projects have failed in the past is because \nof just such spurious corre=\r\nlations.  The question is how to push \nevolution to learn the deeper meanin=\r\ng of &quot;good,&quot; which is so \nprofoundly slippery.\n\nNevertheless, I would not s=\r\nay it is a lost cause.  Yet it is \ncertainly a grand challenge and will not=\r\n succumb easily.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
