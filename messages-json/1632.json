In nature, not all parts of a chromosome exhibit\n&gt; &gt; equal\n&gt; &gt; mutation rates.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not only that, in a larger sense, different phenotypic modules exhibit\n&gt;different mutation rates based on their connectivity. For example, take\n&gt;some regulatory pathway &#39;A&#39; that is very short but highly conserved\n&gt;across several different modules. A mutation on &#39;A&#39; will then affect\n&gt;all of those modules. Whereas a mutation in as less-conserved process,\n&gt;say &#39;B,&#39; would have a smaller phenotypic effect.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thus not only the mechanism of crossover and DNA transcription, but\n&gt;also development itself affects what we think of as phenotypic\n&gt;mutation.\n\nHi Joe,\n         I&#39;m afraid I cannot follow you here.
