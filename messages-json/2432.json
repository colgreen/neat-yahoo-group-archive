We choose a function based on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;problem at hand, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a different\n&gt;&gt;&gt;function. But often we come up with different ways of evaluating netwoks\n&gt;&gt;&gt;for a given problem and we often have discussions about what is the best\n&gt;&gt;&gt;function. What if we were to code up a few of theses different functions\n&gt;&gt;&gt;and allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This then could be\n&gt;&gt;&gt;something akin to an extinction event occuring in nature and changing\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the fitness landscape.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;.... or if your function has a bunch of measures that are weighted to\n&gt;&gt;give a final fitness score you could just change the weighting\n&gt;&gt;occasionally.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;  Even co-evolution might be expressible this way, e.g. if each \n&gt;individual plays against every other member of the population, then \n&gt;that set of results is a fitness vector as well.))\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood point. In fact there are loads of different ways of obtaining a \nfitness score in co-ev.\n\n&gt;You can use this to identify individuals with important new features, \n&gt;even if their overall score is low.  e.g. given two individuals, we \n&gt;have the simple comparison of scores:\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;         \n&gt;\n&gt;p.s. I don&#39;t really know anything about it, but doesn&#39;t one of the \n&gt;classifier approaches work a little like this?  Maybe pareto?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSome stuff I looked at used a line of champs, the newest entry being the \npareto front. A while ago I suggested an extension to the idea by \nmaintainign a tree of champs in different categories, each leaf node of \nwhich represents a pareto front, which is maybe were you&#39;re going with \nthis. Umm, I think the tree gets a bit unwieldy though since any genome \nthat doesn&#39;t have any positive attributes would get assigned as a new \npareto front coming off of the root node. Maybe you just limit it to \nbeing a binary (or some arbitrary degree) tree.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
