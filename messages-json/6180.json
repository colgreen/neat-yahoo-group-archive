Here is the description. \n\nPle=\r\nase forward this email to anyone who might be interested. \n\nA fully funded =\r\ncomputer science Ph.D. position is available in any of the following areas,=\r\n especially in combinations of them: evolving artificial intelligence, neur=\r\nal networks, robotics, and deep learning. Postdoctoral positions are also a=\r\nvailable, but under different funding arrangements (please email jeffclune@=\r\nuwyo.edu for details). Positions ideally start this coming Spring (January =\r\n2014), but alternate start dates, including next fall, are possible. \n\nI (J=\r\neff Clune) direct the Evolving Artificial Intelligence Lab at the Universit=\r\ny of Wyoming. The lab focus is on evolving artificial intelligence by produ=\r\ncing artificially intelligent robots, including physical robots and agents =\r\nin simulated worlds. The lab will also study other bio-inspired AI techniqu=\r\nes, such as deep learning. Part of these efforts will involve investigating=\r\n how evolution produced the complex, intelligent, diverse life on this plan=\r\net by trying to computationally recreate it. A major focus will be on evolv=\r\ning large-scale, structurally organized neural networks (i.e. networks with=\r\n millions of connections that are modular, regular, and hierarchical).  I a=\r\nm also interested in combining neuroevolution with learning algorithms (Heb=\r\nbian, neuromodulation, etc.). \n\nPlease see my website (http://JeffClune.com=\r\n) for example publications, press articles about the work, videos, etc. Her=\r\ne are some keywords that describe related fields: evolutionary algorithms (=\r\nalso known as genetic algorithms or evolutionary computation), neural netwo=\r\nrks (including evolving neural networks, having them learn, deep learning, =\r\nand computational neuroscience), robotics, artificial intelligence, and res=\r\nearch into the evolution of intelligence, complexity, evolvability, and div=\r\nersity.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the lab or would like more inform=\r\nation about the positions, please follow the instructions at http://jeffclu=\r\nne.com/positionsAvailable.html\n\nHere is a video that summarizes my research=\r\n: http://goo.gl/wA6Fe  \nOther videos about my research are here: http://jef=\r\nfclune.com/videos.html\n\nThe University of Wyoming is located in Laramie, a =\r\ncollege town in the heart of the Rocky Mountain West. Nestled between two m=\r\nountain ranges, Laramie has more than 300 days of sunshine a year and is ho=\r\nme to year-round outdoor activities including hiking, camping, rock climbin=\r\ng, downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, fishing and mountain biking. Lara=\r\nmie is also near many of Colorado&#39;s major cities and university communities=\r\n (e.g. Fort Collins, Boulder, and Denver).  \n\nThe University of Wyoming is =\r\nan Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer. All qualified applicants =\r\nreceive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religio=\r\nn, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability,=\r\n marital, veteran or any other legally protected status.\n\nBest regards,\nJef=\r\nf Clune\n\nAssistant Professor\nComputer Science\nUniversity of Wyoming\njeffclu=\r\nne@...\njeffclune.com\n\n\n"}}
