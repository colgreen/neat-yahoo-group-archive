Ken then suggested that it could be per species, which I \nagreed was a good idea - but when I came to implement I realised that \nthis was more complex. This is because if I prune a genome there is a \ngood chance it will no longer be compatible with it&#39;s current species, \nit will get placed intoa new species that is not in prune mode, \ntherefore the original species loose numbers but not actually fall in \ncomplexity! To prevent this I would have to keep offspring tied to their \nparent species - which is doable I suppose, but it things can start to \nto get complicated. So I applied th Keep It Simple principle and opted \nfor a population-wide pruning mode.\n\n&gt;\tI ask because I think the latter should be more portable across problem \n&gt;domains.  e.g. if individuals/species can enter and leave pruning \n&gt;individually, then they can subsequently either survive or perish in the \n&gt;population, so, as an extreme case, if you had a problem that pruning \n&gt;_never_ helped then all pruned species would die but have no effect on the \n&gt;outcome, because non-pruned species would always exist to continue the \n&gt;search.  Actually, for that to be completely true, if you use a species, \n&gt;you probably want to take a copy of it and start pruning that; whereas \n&gt;starting/ending pruning an individual would make it a new species?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOne of the major benefits of pruning though is that it keeps the \ncomplexity of the population as a whole in check, which keeps the NEAT \nsearch running at an optimal speed. So if you allowed some species to \ncomplexify without limit you would loose this benefit. Anway, more \ndetails on all of this will be in my write up!\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
