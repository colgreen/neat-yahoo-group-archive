In your case, FT-NEAT can change these near-zero links and\n&gt; give them back a significant value (if it&#39;s useful).\n\nI see what you are saying. You are right that topology is being evolved to\nsome extent because one can think of links with a weight of zero as being\nabsent. You are also right that in the HybrID implementation we tested in\nthe paper, FT-NEAT can change these values from 0 to another value\n(functionally adding the link back in).\n\n&gt; Did you try to remove these near-zero weights before running FT-NEAT?\n&gt; It could improve the search of FT-NEAT by reducing the size of the\n&gt; search space (but some variations would become impossible).\n\nWe did not try that. It is an interesting suggestion.  But if the mutation\nrate for FT-NEAT is low enough, presumably links will only be added back in\nif they are helpful. But the optimal mutation rate for FT-NEAT might be high\nenough that some unhelpful links are being added, at which point your\nsuggested method could improve performance. I guess we&#39;d  have to try it out\nto know for sure.\n\nThanks for the suggestion.\n\nCheers,\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
