In\nother words, while they do not explicitly enact two=\r\n different time\nscales (as you thought to do), is not the effect the same i=\r\nmplicitly?  \n\nI&#39;m not certain about this issue because I don&#39;t remember pre=\r\ncisely\nhow people set their relative mutation rates for different types of\n=\r\nchanges in various systems, but I would guess that most have weights\nchangi=\r\nng more often than topologies.  At least that is how NEAT was\noriginally se=\r\nt up, and it seemed to straightforward thing to do.\n\nOr do you feel that pe=\r\nrhaps having different mutation rates is not\nreally the same as having expl=\r\nicitly differing time scales that\nseparate periods of weight an topology se=\r\narch?  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I think that some people did see themselves as taking the next=\r\n step\n&gt; &gt;  when neuroevoltuion algorithms started proliferating in the 90s.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  I think a lot of those early algorithms were motivated by people who\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  saw themselves as cutting backprop completely out of the loop. You\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  know, if you look back at some of the papers on neuroevolution at\n&gt; &gt;  th=\r\nat time, some would evolve topology and combine it with backprop,\n&gt; &gt;  and =\r\nsome would simply evolve everything (weights and topology, which\n&gt; &gt;  are s=\r\nometimes called TWEANNs for topology and weight evolving\n&gt; &gt;  artificial ne=\r\nural networks). Probably some of those people evolving\n&gt; &gt;  TWEANNs saw the=\r\nmselves as taking the next step you describe. (Xin\n&gt; &gt;  Yao&#39;s 1999 review c=\r\novers a lot of those methods from that time)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  The difference is tha=\r\nt no one did it with a population of one, but\n&gt; &gt;  that probably just did n=\r\not occur to them because as soon as you go\n&gt; &gt;  to a non-gradient type of p=\r\nroblem (like evolving topologies)\n&gt; &gt;  populations seem natural at first th=\r\nought. Of course what you&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;  shown is that you can make it work at lea=\r\nst in some cases without a\n&gt; &gt;  population.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, the big differen=\r\nce is that we&#39;re doing it at different\n&gt; timescales. This is really the who=\r\nle reason it works.\n&gt; \n&gt; The simplest extension is to mutate both topology =\r\nand weights at the\n&gt; same timescale, either in the very same mutation or in=\r\n different\n&gt; mutation types (say, half of the time it mutates topology and =\r\nhalf of\n&gt; the it mutates weights). The algorithm we call &quot;simultaneous clim=\r\nber&quot;\n&gt; in the paper does just that: it applies both topology and weight\n&gt; m=\r\nutation at the same time. It doesn&#39;t work at all - in fact it&#39;s much\n&gt; wors=\r\ne than a simple hillclimber that only searches weight space. The\n&gt; reason i=\r\ns that topology mutations are destructive, and needs to be\n&gt; offset with lo=\r\ncal weight search to explore the potential of the\n&gt; topology, otherwise no =\r\ntopology mutations would survive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tino and me have been trying to work=\r\n our way through the references in\n&gt; Yao&#39;s paper, but many of the early TWE=\r\nANN papers are very hard to get\n&gt; hold of (Journal of Parallel Computing fr=\r\nom 1990 etc.). What we&#39;ve\n&gt; found are examples of either evolving topologie=\r\ns and using backprop to\n&gt; set the weights, or evolving topologies and weigh=\r\nts at the same time\n&gt; (i.e. topology and weights are treated the same way, =\r\nand topology\n&gt; changes are not followed by any kind of weight search before=\r\n the new\n&gt; topology is evaluated). So what puzzles me is why people have no=\r\nt\n&gt; simply tried replacing backprop with evolution, while keeping the idea\n=\r\n&gt; that topology changes are evaluated only after a period of weight\n&gt; searc=\r\nh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Either this has been done in one of these papers we haven&#39;t found o=\r\nr\n&gt; gotten hold of yet, or the idea wasn&#39;t so obvious after all...\n&gt; \n&gt; Jul=\r\nian\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; IDSIA\n&gt; Galler=\r\nia 2\n&gt; 6928 Manno-Lugano\n&gt; Switzerland\n&gt; julian@...\n&gt; http://julian.togeliu=\r\ns.com\n&gt; http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; +46-705-192088\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
