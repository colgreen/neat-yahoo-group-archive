I had omitted it from my \nphenotype XML \n&gt; since it&#39;s not really relevent. \n\nYes.  The XSL writes the connection weight out along the path of the \nconnection, which has to have an id, so to associate the weight text, \nthere needs to a unique identifier associated with the connection.  \n\n&gt; I think the same applies to the \n&gt; recurrent flag.\n\nThe XSL draws recurrent connections in red and forward ones in black, \nwhich is useful for visualization.  Any XSL style sheet is not going \nto be smart enough to determine whether a connection is recurrent or \nnot (which, as has been pointed out, can be very complicated logic).\n\nIt is probably best to determine whether or not a given connection is \nrecurrent or not, then explicitly store that information in the XML.  \nThis will be necessary for anyone either drawing (if you want to \nrender that information visually) the network or trying to reproduce \nits functionality.  \n\nIn our framework, when a connection is designated &quot;recurrent&quot;, all it \nreally means, from an implementation standpoint, is that the output \nfrom the previous timestep is stored and re-input.  And because it is \nnot clear whether or not some neurons should be designated recurrent, \nit is best to explicitly include that information with the XML.  If, \nfor example, you sent me the XML of a network without indicating \nwhich connections were recurrent, I&#39;d have to have an algorithm that \ndetermined that information, and my algorithm for automatically \ndetermining recurrency differed from yours, the networks would not \nfunction the same.\n\nDerek\n\n\n\n"}}
