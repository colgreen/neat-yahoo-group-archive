I have a few questions that might \nhelp me g=\r\net started.\n\n1.  I&#39;ve looked around for documentation for NEAT, I see a lot=\r\n of \npapers on &quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-list.php&quot; but they all seem \nve=\r\nry experiment specific.  Is there a paper anywhere describing NEAT \nin gene=\r\nral, and the theory behind how it works?\n\n2.  I looked at the experiments t=\r\nhat come bundled with SharpNeat, and \nI see I have to define a function tha=\r\nt returns fitness in Network \nEvaluator Function to do my own experiment.  =\r\nHow do I set a fitness \nthreshold to the program, so that SharpNeatGui will=\r\n know to stop when \nit has found a network of sufficient performance? \n\n3. =\r\n Can I setup SharpNeat to only evolve the topology of a network, \nand deter=\r\nmine the weights with traditional back prop ANN training?\n\nThank You - \nMik=\r\ne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
