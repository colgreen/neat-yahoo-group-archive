In this particular case the ANN can learn\nthat a cart has momentum, such that if velocity sharply drops to zero\nthen we can probably assume the input is wrong and estimate the true\nvelocity from past inputs (using recurrent connections) . However the\nproblem is easier if we have another input telling us the connection\nis broken - we don&#39;t have to evolve structure to do work that out and\nthe ANN can flip immediately to it&#39;s velocity estimate sub-net.\n\nSo my instinct on this one (in the genral case) is that if we overload\nan input then NEAT will typically have to evolve some structure to try\nand distinguish between the distinct overload cases - which generally\nwill be more difficult than if you just tell the ANN directly that the\ninput is currently dead.\n\nAn additional 100 inputs sounds bad, but it&#39;s not as bad as trying to\nevolve 100 substructures trying to do something potentially complex.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
