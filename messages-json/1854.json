I think\npotentially two or more modules would be very powerful\nand efficient.  As I see it, each module is an ANN,\nand they connect via some of their inputs and outputs.\n As you say, both the ANNs and their interfaces should\nbe evolved.  What we need is a good problem.\n\nI&#39;m still waiting for someone to tackle my\n&quot;Sailchallenge&quot; problem, which can be handled by a\nsingle ANN.  So people are not generally looking for\nhard problems that would really benefit from modules.\n\nm\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"}}
