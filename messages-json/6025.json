I also think that self-organizing pri=\r\nnciples are an important factor in the development of neural networks. I th=\r\nink, these mechanisms are one reason, why the evolution of neural networks =\r\nis so robust. However, with the link to the polychronization article I want=\r\ned to highlight that heterogeneous conduction delays might point to a new w=\r\nay of processing information / implementing certain functions and that patt=\r\nern generating encodings might be a very good way of making use of heteroge=\r\nneous conduction delays.\n\nHere are some thoughts to some of your statements=\r\n:\n\n&gt; What seems\n&gt; more important is the interplay of these properties of di=\r\nfferent types of\n&gt; neurons and synapses that allows the network to self-org=\r\nanise in such a way\n&gt; that it performs the required functions. The self-org=\r\nanisation creates the\n&gt; detailed form and function of the brain (eg topolog=\r\ny and connection\n&gt; strengths). \n\nI agree with you. It also means that the v=\r\nery same network region can show different behavior depending on the input =\r\nit receives (e.g. visual cortices can be involved in auditory task when no =\r\nretinal input drives the system). For computational studies this means, we =\r\nshould seek for networks that are able to adapt to different types of input=\r\n.\n\n\n&gt; It seems more like natural genomes encode the neuron and\n&gt; synapse ty=\r\npes, and which regions of the brain they go in, and the\n&gt; properties of the=\r\nse neuron and synapse types. \n\nThat&#39;s why I developed the &quot;Brain in a box&quot; =\r\nmodel, a naive approach, in which a CPPN just encodes the position and orie=\r\nntation of dendritic and axonal projection cones. Intersections of cones le=\r\nad to connections between neurons. But there are better ways to implement t=\r\nhis.\n\n&gt;I suspect there are still\n&gt; some regions where the genome encodes, o=\r\nne way or another, a fairly precise\n&gt; topology (though even in this case th=\r\ne genome could make use of how the\n&gt; neurons and synapses self-organise).\n\n=\r\nyou mean, like in c. elegans, which has exactly 302 neurons.!? I am wonderi=\r\nng, whether it is correct to say that in simpler organisms natural encoding=\r\ns tend to encode the precise topology whereas with increasing complexity th=\r\ne encoding leaves more organizational tasks to self-organizing mechanisms.\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; As part of my current work I&#39;m planning on reproducing many of these\n=\r\n&gt; properties, including synaptic transmission delays, in a neural network\n&gt;=\r\n model to see how they affect the evolvability and capabilities of evolved\n=\r\n&gt; networks performing online learning. I&#39;m planning on using HyperNEAT or a=\r\n\n&gt; variant like ES-HyperNEAT, and am in the middle of implementing these ki=\r\nnds\n&gt; of properties in a neural network model and creating a flexible Hyper=\r\nNEAT\n&gt; set-up to allow specifying the parameters for models of these proper=\r\nties.\n&gt; The motivation being that a lot of these properties have been impli=\r\ncated in\n&gt; learning processes in the brain. See http://ojcoleman.com/node/1=\r\n and\n&gt; http://ojcoleman.com/node/3 for details and links to the software. ;=\r\n)\n\nThanks for the links (btw: I commented in your third posting ;)). But I =\r\ndid not find any link to the software you use? Do you work in Matlab, Pytho=\r\nn or something else?\n\nWith a colleague, we work on a model that implements =\r\nstructural plasticity, heterogeneous conduction delays and STDP in spiking =\r\nneurons (we use the Izhikevich neuron and everything is implemented in Matl=\r\nab). Synapses are build depending on the activation level of the neuron and=\r\n its projection kernel. I think, the projection kernel could be something t=\r\nhat can be encoded by a CPPN. Having this kind of super-gun, we are now fac=\r\ning the question: how to setup an appropriate fitness-function, which runs =\r\na bit into the discussions we had here the last weeks. :-)\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
