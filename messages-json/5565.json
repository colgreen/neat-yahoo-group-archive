Genetic crossover of CPPN genomes regenerated the node\nactivation functions on each node on the child genomes instead of\ntaking the activation function from the parent genomes.\n    * Fix to genome loading. Now uses genome factory from each\nexperiment, previously IO was hard coded to use NeatGenomeFactory,\nwhich was incorrect for experiments using sub-classes such as\nCppnGenomeFactory.\n    * Support for radial basis functions in NEAT genomes and networks\n(RBF-NEAT).\n    * New RBF-NEAT experiments; RBF-BinarySixMultiplexer,\nRBF-BinaryElevenMultiplexer and RBF-FunctionRegression for sin(x^2).\n    * XOR and binary multiplexer experiments modified to use fitness\nscore based on squared error; this change improves search efficiency.\n    * Stop condition threshold fitnesses changed in some experiments\nto reflect acceptable scores rather than perfect scores.\n    * Function regression experiments changed to have peaks and\ntroughs at y = 0.9 and 0.1 respectively. This avoids requiring of\noutput values at the extremes of the output range of network\nactivation functions\n\n"}}
