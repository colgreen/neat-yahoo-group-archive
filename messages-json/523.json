A lot of the time \n&gt; it&#39;s better to combine expertise than to go with only one method. \n&gt; Actually, here is a paper on this subject from our research group:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID\n&gt; (Pubs)=16\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that this paper does not use NEAT as its neuroevolution \nmethod \n&gt; (it came out around the time NEAT was first coming out), but it \n&gt; still addresses the general idea of combining expertise and \n&gt; expressing confidence. Of course, it would not work exactly the \nway \n&gt; this paper says if you were to combine evolutionary and non-\n&gt; evolutionary approaches at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been thinking about using &#39;conflicting&#39; networks/controllers\n&gt; &gt; operating the same set of inputs and outputs. \n&gt; &gt; My thoughts revolve around a weighted summing device that \nrecieves \n&gt; both\n&gt; &gt; the ouput and an associated confidence from each network, and \nthe \n&gt; output\n&gt; &gt; of the system is a function of the confidence levels ( sudden \nrise \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; confidence having more meaning than a steady state confidence ) \n&gt; and the\n&gt; &gt; outputs of the functions.\n&gt; &gt; This approach might allow for a coupling of seemingly \nincompatable\n&gt; &gt; networks or controllers, such as a LSTM to recognize features in \na\n&gt; &gt; landscape, an evolved neural network for obsticle avoidence, and \na\n&gt; &gt; conventional controller for &#39;after-market&#39; behaviour add-ons, \nwith \n&gt; out\n&gt; &gt; re-evolving or re-teaching the previous networks.\n&gt; &gt; The idea sounds like fun, except that I have no idea how to go \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; teaching anything how to describe how confident it is in its own \n&gt; output.\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
