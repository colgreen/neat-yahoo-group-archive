My\nsystem was able to pick games where the away team wins over 60% of the\ntime, which is a nice improvement over 25%. However;\n\nThe downside is that when the strategy was able to pick a winner, it was\nusually very poor odds (1.5 times the money or less on average) and in\nthe\nend, the system couldn&#39;t be profitable. If you&#39;re able to predict the\nresult (home, draw, away) 67% of the time, the payback must be 1.5 to\nbreak even. And the more predictable games are, the lower the odds are on\nthe winner - that&#39;s what odds are. At best, a strategy would be able to\nfind errors in the odds makers strategies which is fairly hard.\n\nFurther, if you invest 100% of your capital on each predictable game, one\nloss will wipe out all your funds. So I played 20% of the (simulated)\ncapital per game. While this limits the downside, it severely limits the\nupside.\n\nSadly, it wasn&#39;t as good picking winners out of bounds as it was in\nbounds, which kinda killed the usefulness even if it had been able to\npredict profitably.\n\nHas anyone else done any work in this vein?\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
