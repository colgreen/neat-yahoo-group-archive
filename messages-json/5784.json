In other wor=\r\nds, there might be other perfectly legitimate ways of deciding which connec=\r\ntions to express from an infinite-resolution pattern that are different fro=\r\nm the method in the paper (i.e. those would be different &quot;languages&quot; for th=\r\ne CPPN to express what it wants).  \n\nHowever, the &quot;language&quot; suggested in t=\r\nhe paper is nice in the sense that it allows the CPPN to express one type o=\r\nf connection without being forced to express another at the same time - tha=\r\nt&#39;s what the band pruning achieves.  Otherwise you&#39;d get points chosen on b=\r\noth sides of a sharp border, forcing connections often to be chosen in pair=\r\ns (which seems an undesirable tendency).\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;wilsontg80&quot; &lt;wilsontg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am puzzled by the result of band=\r\n pruning in Figure 3: Example point selection in two dimensions, from Evolv=\r\ning the Placement and Density of Neurons in the HyperNEAT Substrate.  It se=\r\nems like the information inherent in the image should include points along =\r\nthe black-white edge of the outer black region, but band pruning removes th=\r\nem all.  The figure explains &quot;In effect, the CPPN speaks a language through=\r\n its pattern that denotes exactly which weights within the hypercube should=\r\n be expressed.&quot;  I am curious why &quot;language&quot; is used here.  \n&gt; \n&gt; My goal i=\r\ns to add iterated ES-HyperNEAT to the C++ version at https://github.com/Mis=\r\nterTea/HyperNEAT.  I am presently a hobbyist (my profession is embedded sof=\r\ntware engineering) but considering to someday pursue a PhD involving HyperN=\r\nEAT, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Tony Wilson\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
