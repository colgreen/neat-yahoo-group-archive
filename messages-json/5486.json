So despite a stepping stone along the path appearing to \nbe the easy option, I would suggest a better way of putting it, would be \nto say, that it has a higher probability of occurring (but higher by how \nmuch?). Nature might well opt for the weird low probability. Perhaps a \nbit like quantum tunnelling (or the infinite improbability drive).\n\n-- \nRob Marsden\nGistix (Northern) Limited\n\n"}}
