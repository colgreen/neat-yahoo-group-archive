The flaw is in the way that HyperNEAT decides whether =\r\nor not to express a connection based on a threshold that is compared to the=\r\n output of the CPPN that determines connection weights.  It turns out that =\r\nconflating &quot;whether to express&quot; with &quot;what is the weight&quot; was making it har=\r\nd for HyperNEAT to express certain kinds of patterns, in particular those t=\r\nhat exhibit modular groupings in the network geometry.  This paper separate=\r\ns these concepts into separate CPPN outputs and thereby exhibits a dramatic=\r\n improvement in the ability to consistently evolve separations in domain th=\r\nat benefits from such separations, which may turn out useful in a variety o=\r\nf domains.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
