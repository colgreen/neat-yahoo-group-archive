So are\n&gt;cave-dwelling lizards who evolve away pigmentation or\n&gt;eyes.  These simpler morphologies require less energy\n&gt;and upkeep, and produce fitter organisms for that\n&gt;particular environment.\n\nJust an observation:  These are evolutionary simplifications in a CHANGING \nenvironment.  When using NEAT on a fixed domain, simplification shouldn&#39;t be \nnecessary, right?  At least not if there is a large enough population to \nmake an effective search.  It is only when the problem changes that a \nsimplification may prove beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, with a sufficiently complex genome, features may develop \nthat increase fitness, but render another feature irrelevant.  It may even \nrender it inhibitory.  The overall fitness still went up, but it could go up \neven further if it could shed the unnecessary components.  Thus a balance of \nincreasing AND decreasing complexity could prove beneficial, even in an \nunchanging environment.\n\nBut that really depends on the environment and the task.  Control over a \nfixed-topology robot probably won&#39;t benefit from it.  But if the robot could \ngrow a new sensor, rendering an old sensor meaningless, then shedding the \npower drain of the old sensor would increase fitness.\n\nBut for most forms of simplification, simply reducing weights is \nfunctionally equivalent, is it not?  If you have a fixed number of inputs, \nsome of which are not relevant, then learning a weight of 0 is equivalent to \nsimplifying them out of the genome, right?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nStore more e-mails with MSN Hotmail Extra Storage ï¿½ 4 plans to choose from! \nhttp://click.atdmt.com/AVE/go/onm00200362ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"}}
