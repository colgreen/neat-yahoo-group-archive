The\n&gt; format also allows comments in C-style, so \n&gt; genes can be commented out:\n&gt; \n&gt; /* gene 1 10 16 0 0 36 0 1 */\n\nAll the same is true for XML, e.g.:\n\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;OUT&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src-id=&quot;0&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.3731676929130425&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;5&quot; src-id=&quot;1&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.208831769841949&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;6&quot; src-id=&quot;2&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-0.853548931074944&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhat you call a node, our XML calls a neuron.  What\nyou call a gene, our XML calls a connection. \nHistorical markings are clearly defined by the id\nattributes (though we assign neurons ids as well). \nAnd as Colin points out, XML can be commented out as\nwell.\n\nAs far as readability, XML is more reader-friendly, as\nlong as its schema is designed well.  For example:\n\ngene 1 1 14 -0.242932 0 1 -0.242932 1\n\nUnless I am familiar with the code, I&#39;m not sure what\neach of these values maps to.  I&#39;m not sure why the\nweight value is listed twice, etc.  This code is more\ncompact, but I think it is less human-readable.\n\nBut even so, again as Colin pointed out, it&#39;s fairly\ntrivial to write an XSL style sheet that converts\nsomething that looks like:\n\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;OUT&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src-id=&quot;0&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.3731676929130425&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;5&quot; src-id=&quot;1&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.208831769841949&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;6&quot; src-id=&quot;2&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-0.853548931074944&quot;/&gt;\n\n...into something that looks like:\n\nnode 1 0 1 1\nnode 2 0 1 1\nnode 3 0 1 1\nnode 4 0 1 1\ngene 1 1 14 -0.242932 0 1 -0.242932 1\ngene 1 2 14 -0.665275 0 2 -0.665275 1\ngene 1 3 14 -0.690939 0 3 -0.690939 1\n\nAn XSL style sheet iterates across XML tags and their\nassociated attributes, and spits out whatever you tell\nit to.\n\n&gt; Anyway, XML has some great properties and uses, so\n&gt; I am not arguing against XML.  But what I think\n&gt; would be especially cool would be if there was\n&gt; a conversion function both ways between NEAT-XML \n&gt; and NEAT-traditional genome styles.  \n\nYeah...but Colin&#39;s also right that XML -&gt;\nNEAT-traditional is easy, but NEAT-traditional -&gt; XML\nwould require some code to translate it into workable\nXML...though that really shouldn&#39;t be too awfully\ndifficult.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
