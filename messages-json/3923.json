Another words, topologically =\r\nchange only\nhappens in lower fitness organisms anyway.\nThere are many other=\r\n ways to configurate this too. For example, you\ncan add another action for =\r\nthe organism with the highest fitness, so\nit can sometimes disable genes or=\r\n go into pruning process (phase search).\nConceptually, these all work in th=\r\ne same way as your suggested\nalgorithms in that dramatic mutation should be=\r\n applied sparingly and\naccordingly.\n\nFeel free to correct me.\n\n\n"}}
