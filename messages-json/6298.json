I=92ll f=\r\nirst respond to Vassilis then Joel=92s original comments. Please see below.=\r\n \n \n&gt; Self-adaptive mutation rates are a terrible idea:\n&gt; Jeff, thanks for =\r\npointing this out. That is an interesting paper! To be honest I haven&#39;t rea=\r\nd it before; so, you are saying that self-adaptive mutation rates can be mo=\r\nre effective on smoother fitness landscapes, correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; Novelty Search:\n=\r\n&gt; Joel, could novelty search be seen as a way of creating a smoother fitnes=\r\ns landscape? If yes, then based on what you said, is this the reason why se=\r\nlf-adaptive mutation rates work better when coupled with novelty search?\n&gt; =\r\n\n\nI agree with you. Self-adaptive mutation rates work fine on smooth landsc=\r\napes. Of course, landscapes on any interesting, non-trivial problem are rug=\r\nged, so that means that generally self-adaptive mutation rates are a very b=\r\nad idea. Novelty search, however, makes the conversation more complex. I ag=\r\nree with you that NS smoothes out landscapes, making self-adaptive mutation=\r\n rates far less pathological. That said, I=92m not yet sure that self-adapt=\r\nive mutation rates are actually a good idea with Novelty Search (see below)=\r\n. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the idea of self-adaptive mutation rates formed the basi=\r\ns for more advanced evolution strategies such as CMA-ES. I am not trying to=\r\n defend CMA-ES here, which I agree with Jeff that it works differently than=\r\n the basic approach of encoding the mutation rates in the genotype. However=\r\n, I am wondering whether a combination of novelty search with CMA-ES would =\r\nbe a good approach in speeding up the search for novel behaviours.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of =\r\ncourse, I can see some disadvantages of CMA-ES, an example being that the g=\r\nenotype is a vector of real numbers with a fixed size... What do you think?=\r\n\n&gt; \n\nI don=92t think what makes CMA-ES effective has anything to do with se=\r\nlf-adaptive mutation rates. I think that it=92s advantage is in learning co=\r\nrrelations. But, as far as I know, it=92s still forced to mutate genomes ac=\r\ncording to those correlations. I must admit I don=92t know the CMA_ES liter=\r\nature at all, but my guess is that if you tried CMA-ES with and without a m=\r\nutation rate on the genome, you=92d get the same result I report in my pape=\r\nr: as long as the landscape is rugged (i.e. the problem is non-trivial), ev=\r\nolution will floor mutation rates and the result will underperform the best=\r\n, fixed mutation rate. Anyone know the literature enough to know if I=92m r=\r\night? Or anyone care to give it a try?\n\nRegarding Joel=92s claim that wheth=\r\ner self-adaptation is a good idea depends on whether fitness is based on an=\r\n objective or NS:\n\nI love Joel and Ken=92s paper looking into whether self-=\r\nadaptative mutation rates (SAMR) are a better idea with NS. As I said above=\r\n, it makes sense that SAMR would be less bad with NS, because NS smooths ou=\r\nt landscapes and eliminates peaks, but is it actually a *good* idea instead=\r\n of just being less bad? On that question I am still agnostic pending furth=\r\ner research. \n\nOne reason is because of &quot;novelty plateaus=94, a concept my =\r\nstudents and I introduce in our last, not-yet-announced GECCO paper. Novelt=\r\ny plateaus exist when, during novelty search, mutating the current populati=\r\non does not immediately produce new behaviors. For example, once the low-ha=\r\nnging fruit is consumed, it might take 5 specific mutations to produce a ne=\r\nw behavior (assume that all intermediate mutations have no effect on behavi=\r\nor). In that case, NS cannot reward those stepping stones to the new behavi=\r\nor, and thus there is no incentive to have a high mutation rate. Since most=\r\n mutations break things (producing the very un-novel behavior of doing litt=\r\nle or nothing), I hypothesize that having a high mutation rate will be sele=\r\ncted against when on such a novelty plateau. In other words, think of the l=\r\nong, flat lines of fitness you (Joel) mentioned: We hypothesize that those =\r\nlong-flat lines also exist in terms of generating new behaviors and, if we&#39;=\r\nre right, I think there would be a pressure to lower mutation rates during =\r\nsuch periods, even though keeping the mutation rate high is exactly what yo=\r\nu need to cross the plateau. Of course, a lot of this is speculation, and I=\r\n think a paper on this subject would be very interesting and worthwhile for=\r\n the community.\n\nNow let me argue against myself, since I=92m thinking thro=\r\nugh these issues by writing about them in this thread! While I can imagine =\r\nthat novelty plateaus exist, for the specific purposes of this conversation=\r\n on mutation rates, I can=92t figure out if they would actually cause selec=\r\ntion for lower mutation rates, because even if you are not generating not-y=\r\net-seen-before behaviors, you can be generating non-new behaviors in differ=\r\nent regions of density in the archive=85meaning that you may truly always b=\r\ne on the side of a hill and not on a neutral plateau. What do y=92all think=\r\n?\n\nAn additional reason I=92m not yet ready to commit to the claim that SAM=\r\nR is a good idea with NS is because your paper didn=92t show that SAMR did =\r\noptimize mutation rates for long-term adaptation. You did not sweep over th=\r\ne range of fixed mutation rates and show that SAMR found those optimal rate=\r\ns, or outperformed them. Instead, you showed that it performed better than =\r\nthe parameters you had for the initial experiment. \n\nAn final reason I=92m =\r\nagnostic (so far) on the issue of whether SAMR helps with NS is because the=\r\n evidence in your paper, while very interesting, was also not overly strong=\r\n or consistent. I hope you won=92t be offended and think I=92m critical of =\r\nyou and Ken or the work. You may be right that SAMR+NS works, and it would =\r\nbe fascinating if you are, but I would just like to see larger effect sizes=\r\n, lower p-values, and more consistency across domains before taking the cla=\r\nim =93SAMR works with NS=94 to the bank. Please see below for some of my sp=\r\necific reasons for this claim. \n\n1. I don=92t see self-adaptive mutation ra=\r\ntes helping a lot in your results: in some cases SAMR improved evolvability=\r\n significantly, but not in all, and in the cases where the difference is si=\r\ngnificant, the effect size is very small and the variance and associated p-=\r\nvalue are high. The same is true for performance, where self-adaptation onl=\r\ny helped in one domain, not all, and the difference was a jump from ~5% to =\r\n~10% (a doubling, which is rather impressive, but with a p-value of only &lt; =\r\n0.05). I hope I didn=92t get any of these details wrong. I apologize if I d=\r\nid.  \n\nPersonally I=92d prefer more tests before I really commit to this co=\r\nnclusion and start drawing inferences from it. To repeat, I hope you don=92=\r\nt mind that I point out that I=92d prefer more experiments and on more prob=\r\nlems before fully committing to the view that self-adaptation helps with no=\r\nvelty search. As I said, I do think the result is probably right, as self-a=\r\ndaptation works well on smooth fitness landscapes, and NS does eliminate pe=\r\naks and smooth landscapes. Moreover, I think it was an extremely clever and=\r\n interesting question to ask and issue to raise: I=92m a big fan of the pap=\r\ner, but I=92d still love to see follow-up studies on it because the result =\r\nis fascinating, but so far the evidence is not as strong as it could be. \n\n=\r\n2. You show that Eibd* (=93evolvability as defined as producing immediate b=\r\nehavioral diversity=94) is better for NS with self-adaptation, but\n\ta. The =\r\nreal proof is if these organisms actually evolve better in a new environmen=\r\nt. It would be great to see those data. You have provided some evidence for=\r\n improved long-term evolvability since performance was higher, but again th=\r\nat was only in one of the domains, and the difference was not huge. \n\tb. Di=\r\nd you look at what happened to the mutation rates? They may have still gone=\r\n down, which could produce more Eibd, but at the cost of Elt* (Evolvability=\r\n over the Long Term). \n\n3. You report that &quot;Initial experiments revealed th=\r\nat evolving a single mutation power and rate for each entire genome is too =\r\ncoarse.=94 That suggests that the effect may not be that robust, and may be=\r\n hard to take advantage of in practice. I also noted that in the treatment =\r\nthat ultimately worked, you took an intermediate route of different mutatio=\r\nn rates for different connections, but not one set of mutation rates per-co=\r\nnnection. Out of curiosity, did you also try that and find it didn=92t work=\r\n? \n\nOverall, I do think that how bad self-adaptive mutation rates are depen=\r\nds on the ruggedness of landscapes, and NS makes them less bad because it s=\r\nmooths landscapes. However, I consider the question of whether SAMR are ben=\r\neficial with NS to be a fascinating, open question that you have provided s=\r\nome evidence for, but that we=92d all benefit from seeing a lot more resear=\r\nch into. \n\nBest,\nJeff\n\n*I=92m making these up as I go along!\r\n--Apple-Mail=_A9FA3CE4-8256-4607-B898-5D822CB794A4\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=windows-1252\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html charset=\r\n=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-=\r\nmode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-fa=\r\nmily: Times-Roman;&quot;&gt;Hello Joel and Vassilis,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-famil=\r\ny: Times-Roman;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Times-Roman;&quot;&gt;I=92ll =\r\nrespond in this thread since it is focused on the issue of self-adatptive m=\r\nutation rates and novelty search.

Self=\r\n-adaptive mutation rates work fine on smooth landscapes. Of course, landsca=\r\npes on any interesting, non-trivial problem are rugged, so that means that =\r\ngenerally self-adaptive mutation rates are a very bad idea.

Since most mutations break thin=\r\ngs (producing the very un-novel behavior of doing little or nothing), I hyp=\r\nothesize that having a high mutation rate will be selected against when on =\r\nsuch a novelty plateau. In other words, think of the long, flat lines of fi=\r\ntness you (Joel) mentioned: We hypothesize that those long-flat lines also =\r\nexist in terms of generating new behaviors and, if we&#39;re right, I think the=\r\nre would be a pressure to lower mutation rates during such periods, even th=\r\nough keeping the mutation rate high is exactly what you need to cross the p=\r\nlateau. Of course, a lot of this is speculation, and I think a paper on thi=\r\ns subject would be very interesting and worthwhile for the community.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now let me argue against myself, since I=92m thinking t=\r\nhrough these issues by writing about them in this thread! While I can imagi=\r\nne that novelty plateaus exist, for the specific purposes of this conversat=\r\nion on mutation rates, I can=92t figure out if they would actually cause se=\r\nlection for lower mutation rates, because even if you are not generating no=\r\nt-yet-seen-before behaviors, you can be generating non-new behaviors in dif=\r\nferent regions of density in the archive=85meaning that you may truly alway=\r\ns be on the side of a hill and not on a neutral plateau. What do y=92all th=\r\nink?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An additional reason I=92m not yet ready to c=\r\nommit to the claim that SAMR is a good idea with NS is because your paper d=\r\nidn=92t show that SAMR did optimize mutation rates for long-term adaptation=\r\n. You did not sweep over the range of fixed mutation rates and show that SA=\r\nMR found those optimal rates, or outperformed them. Instead, you showed tha=\r\nt it performed better than the parameters you had for the initial experimen=\r\nt.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An final reason I=92m agnostic (so far) o=\r\nn the issue of whether SAMR helps with NS is because the evidence in your p=\r\naper, while very interesting, was also not overly strong or consistent. I h=\r\nope you won=92t be offended and think I=92m critical of you and Ken or the =\r\nwork. You may be right that SAMR+NS works, and it would be fascinating if y=\r\nou are, but I would just like to see larger effect sizes, lower p-values, a=\r\nnd more consistency across domains before taking the claim =93SAMR works wi=\r\nth NS=94 to the bank. Please see below for some of my specific reasons for =\r\nthis claim.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. I don=92t see self-adaptive m=\r\nutation rates helping a lot in your results: in some cases SAMR improved ev=\r\nolvability significantly, but not in all, and in the cases where the differ=\r\nence is significant, the effect size is very small and the variance and ass=\r\nociated p-value are high. The same is true for performance, where self-adap=\r\ntation only helped in one domain, not all, and the difference was a jump fr=\r\nom ~5% to ~10% (a doubling, which is rather impressive, but with a p-value =\r\nof only &lt; 0.05). I hope I didn=92t get any of these details wrong. I apo=\r\nlogize if I did. &nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personally I=92d prefer more tes=\r\nts before I really commit to this conclusion and start drawing inferences f=\r\nrom it. To repeat, I hope you don=92t mind that I point out that I=92d pref=\r\ner more experiments and on more problems before fully committing to the vie=\r\nw that self-adaptation helps with novelty search. As I said, I do think the=\r\n result is probably right, as self-adaptation works well on smooth fitness =\r\nlandscapes, and NS does eliminate peaks and smooth landscapes. Moreover, I =\r\nthink it was an extremely clever and interesting question to ask and issue =\r\nto raise: I=92m a big fan of the paper, but I=92d still love to see follow-=\r\nup studies on it because the result is fascinating, but so far the evidence=\r\n is not as strong as it could be.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. You show that=\r\n Eibd* (=93evolvability as defined as producing immediate behavioral divers=\r\nity=94) is better for NS with self-adaptation, but&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D=\r\n&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; style=3D&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;a. The real proof is i=\r\nf these organisms actually evolve better in a new environment. It would be =\r\ngreat to see those data. You have provided some evidence for improved long-=\r\nterm evolvability since performance was higher, but again that was only in =\r\none of the domains, and the difference was not huge.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span =\r\nclass=3D&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; style=3D&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;b. Did you loo=\r\nk at what happened to the mutation rates? They may have still gone down, wh=\r\nich could produce more Eibd, but at the cost of Elt* (Evolvability over the=\r\n Long Term).&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. You report that &quot;Initial exp=\r\neriments revealed that evolving a single mutation power and rate for each e=\r\nntire genome is too coarse.=94 That suggests that the effect may not be tha=\r\nt robust, and may be hard to take advantage of in practice. I also noted th=\r\nat in the treatment that ultimately worked, you took an intermediate route =\r\nof different mutation rates for different connections, but not one set of m=\r\nutation rates per-connection. Out of curiosity, did you also try that and f=\r\nind it didn=92t work?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Overall, I=\r\n do think that how bad self-adaptive mutation rates are depends on the rugg=\r\nedness of landscapes, and NS makes them less bad because it smooths landsca=\r\npes. However, I consider the question of whether SAMR are beneficial with N=\r\nS to be a fascinating, open question that you have provided some evidence f=\r\nor, but that we=92d all benefit from seeing a lot more research into.&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Best,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jeff&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*I=\r\n=92m making these up as I go along!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/cs=\r\ns&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!--\n  #ygrp-mkp {\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;=\r\n\n  margin:
