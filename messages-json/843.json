I\n&gt; &gt; (think) I have a good feel regarding new\n&gt; connections\n&gt; &gt; and keeping track of innovations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A new node is added by breaking connection a-&gt;b\n&gt; call\n&gt; &gt; it c.  At some future point a-&gt;b is again chosen\n&gt; to be\n&gt; &gt; broken (in a different genome(?)) will it again be\n&gt; &gt; given c as the node id that is put between a and b\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; will it be some new node d?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m missing something obvious but\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;mutate add node&quot; situation hasn&#39;t clicked yet as\n&gt; far\n&gt; &gt; as if/how it needs to be tracked/checked for &quot;same\n&gt; &gt; innovation&quot; situations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When a new node is added, a record is kept with the\n&gt; following \n&gt; information: \n&gt; \n&gt; -The in-node\n&gt; -The out-node\n&gt; -The old connection innovation number\n&gt; -The innovation numbers assigned to the 2 new\n&gt; connections\n&gt; -The id assigned to the new node\n&gt; \n&gt; Whenever a new node is added, all such records that\n&gt; are kept are \n&gt; check for a match on the first 3 items.  If it\n&gt; matches it means it&#39;s \n&gt; splitting the same link.  In that case, it is\n&gt; assigned the same id \n&gt; as the prior node that split the same link.  Also\n&gt; the two new links \n&gt; (around the new node) get the same innovations\n&gt; numbers as in the \n&gt; previous matching split.\n&gt; \n&gt; A list of such records is kept either for the\n&gt; current generation, or \n&gt; forever.  You can look at my NEAT code to see how I\n&gt; keep the \n&gt; records.  They are &quot;class Innovation,&quot; which is the\n&gt; structure that\n&gt; holds information on innovations that have come\n&gt; before.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
