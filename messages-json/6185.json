This means, two species ca=\r\nnnot share the same area (or don&#39;t you use the concept of species)!?\n\nDo yo=\r\nu aim to model something in analogy to nature? Then, I don&#39;t get the link. =\r\nIn natural systems (which is based on co-evolution and open-ended) the loca=\r\ntion on earth determines what is the predator and what is the prey, and whi=\r\nch environmental properties must be incorporated in the evolutionary develo=\r\npment. In the simulation that you aim to setup (if I understand you correct=\r\nly), it seems that you would like to use the geo-location to create more di=\r\nversity for your objective search!?\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m starting t=\r\no think about direction for the next SharpNEAT\n&gt; iteration. There&#39;s been a =\r\nlot of talk recently about novelty search\n&gt; versus objective search, and ma=\r\nybe mixtures of the two. I myself\n&gt; talked about how in the natural world o=\r\nrganisms are separated in both\n&gt; behavioural space (i.e. novel behaviour is=\r\n less likely to compete for\n&gt; the same resources as existing behaviours) bu=\r\nt also geographical\n&gt; space, and I think that geographical space is a key f=\r\nactor that is\n&gt; missing from NEAT based search currently, and possibly EC a=\r\ns a whole,\n&gt; with the caveat there may be other research groups with work i=\r\nn that\n&gt; area that I&#39;m unaware of.\n&gt; \n&gt; My current plan is to focus on this=\r\n geographical space idea for this\n&gt; iteration because it is the simplest to=\r\n implement. Dealing with\n&gt; behavioural space is potentially more complicate=\r\nd because how to\n&gt; compare behaviour varies across problem domains and how =\r\nyou identify\n&gt; the key factors to compare is probably a non-trivial problem=\r\n. I want\n&gt; to try and tackle this at some point, but I&#39;m also keen to explo=\r\nre the\n&gt; geo-space idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; What does this all mean in practical terms?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; SharpNEAT is a kit of parts that allows you to swap in replacement\n&gt; pa=\r\nrts such as an alternative genetic representation and/or associated\n&gt; genet=\r\nic operators (recombination, mutation, etc) with minimal impact\n&gt; on other =\r\nparts in the kit (in principle anyway). I&#39;m proposing to\n&gt; provide an alter=\r\nnative evolution algorithm class that replaces NEAT&#39;s\n&gt; genome based specia=\r\ntion (which clusters genomes into K clusters in\n&gt; genetic space), with a ge=\r\nographical space alternative (I&#39;ll call it\n&gt; geo-space for short).\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n idea is that we have some cartesian/euclidean space (probably a\n&gt; square 2=\r\nD space initially to keep the code simple, but 3D or &#39;globe&#39;\n&gt; space (2-sph=\r\nere) are reasonable alternatives). The seed genomes are\n&gt; each assigned a r=\r\nandom coord in the geo-space and this will be fixed\n&gt; for the life of that =\r\ngenome. So we are basically adding a physical\n&gt; attribute to the genome suc=\r\nh that our population members are probably\n&gt; better referred to as organism=\r\ns (or agents or population members).\n&gt; I&#39;ll use &#39;agent&#39; because it&#39;s easier=\r\n to type :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Agent fitness is now adjusted by population density at the=\r\n agent&#39;s\n&gt; geo-location, this allows really bad agents to survive so long a=\r\ns they\n&gt; are in a sparse region of geo-space, thus allowing for some divers=\r\nity\n&gt; of the genome pool.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reproduction - I haven&#39;t put much thought in=\r\nto this but the two\n&gt; options I see are to create offspring agents near to =\r\ntheir parent(s)\n&gt; versus randomly scattered. Probably some &#39;dispersion&#39; var=\r\niable will\n&gt; define the amount of scattering with 0 being atop of the paren=\r\nt (or\n&gt; between the two?) and 1 being totally random. (Question: Is e.g. se=\r\ned\n&gt; scattering in nature gaussian?). Clearly if agent&#39;s are spawned near\n&gt;=\r\n their parent&#39;s we would expect to see clusters of agent&#39;s with similar\n&gt; b=\r\nehaviour, and that clustering will increase population density and\n&gt; theref=\r\nore lower the fitness of agent&#39;s in that cluster. So there is a\n&gt; form of f=\r\nitness sharing going on, but as I say, I haven&#39;t really\n&gt; thought through t=\r\nhe implications and dynamics of that. But it would be\n&gt; interesting to set =\r\nup, play with and observe what happens.\n&gt; \n&gt; Factoring in behavioural space=\r\n considerations should be possible at a\n&gt; later date, e.g. fitness at a geo=\r\n-location is not adjusted down if an\n&gt; agent has novel behaviour compared t=\r\no other agent&#39;s at that\n&gt; geo-location.\n&gt; \n&gt; As per usual - any thoughts an=\r\nd feedback are welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
