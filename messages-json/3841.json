I have been having some\n&gt; &gt;  pro=\r\nblems trying to compile rtNEAT. However, today I stumbled across a\n&gt; &gt;  sol=\r\nution. I run ubuntu 7.10 at home and it has gcc 4.1.3, This\n&gt; &gt;  version of=\r\n gcc does not compile the rtNEAT code. It gives the\n&gt; &gt;  following errors b=\r\nelow. However, on my lunch break I tried using an\n&gt; &gt;  older version of gcc=\r\n 3.4 and this worked fine. When I got home\n&gt; &gt;  tonight, I installed gcc 3.=\r\n4 on my home machine. I tried compiling\n&gt; &gt;  the rtNEAT but got some differ=\r\nent errors. I then tried the rtNEAT\n&gt; &gt;  that came with the dance evolution=\r\n and that seemed to compile\n&gt; &gt;  correctly. Do you know of any rtNEAT code =\r\nthat will compile with gcc\n&gt; &gt;  4.1.X ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Best Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Ty\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
