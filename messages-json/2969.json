It was also stripped of al=\r\nl the \nextra libraries like gtkmm and guile to make it easier to compile on=\r\n \nits own, or with your own libraries.\n\nTherefore, I recommend using rtNEAT=\r\n in NEAT mode instead of the \noriginal NEAT.\n\nIn addition, there are a lot =\r\nof options for NEAT implementations for \nvarious platforms and languages, i=\r\nncluding C# and Jave.  Many are \nlinked from the software section of my hom=\r\nepage:\n\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#software\n\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Chris Spencer&quot; &lt;chrisspen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Which of the NEAT imp=\r\nlementations does everyone use?
