SharpNEAT has been a great resource and I am sure \n&gt; version 2 will be=\r\n appreciated. I was wondering how you feel about \n&gt; the HyperNEAT component=\r\n of SharpNEAT 2.0. Do you consider a full \n&gt; release of HyperNEAT? That is,=\r\n is it an alternative to the two \n&gt; current releases that we have out?\n\n\nHi=\r\n Ken, thanks. Yes as of this release I&#39;m happy to declare it a full\nimpleme=\r\nntation of HyperNEAT; That part of the code in particular has\nbeen through =\r\na few changes over the last few weeks and months - e.g.\ninitially the subst=\r\nrate was limited to 2D whereas now the\ndimensionality is not actually limit=\r\ned. Implementing the &#39;boxes&#39;\nvisualization task highlighted that issue and =\r\na few other defects and\ndesign niggles that have been ironed out.\n\nThe main=\r\n question I foresee is the speciation by k-means which I want\nto do a bit o=\r\nf investigation on - some kind of visualization of the\nspecies/clusters to =\r\nconfirm it works as expected and maybe identify\nsome improvements. However =\r\nthe NEAT code (which the HyperNEAT code is\nof course built on) is performin=\r\ng at least as well as in SharpNEAT 1.x\nso I don&#39;t foresee any problems ther=\r\ne.\n\nAnd of course if anyone here would like to see a particular HyperNEAT\nt=\r\nask implemented to help prove/test the codebase then I&#39;d be happy to\nhave a=\r\n look (depending on how much work is involved :)\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
