The\n&gt; evolved network can\n&gt; have dynamic behaviour, but it is generally\n&gt; incapable of interesting\n&gt; time dependant behaviour. \n&gt; I believe that history dependance in the transfer\n&gt; function of each\n&gt; neuron, in addition to recurrent connections, should\n&gt; shed some insight\n&gt; into powerfull short term memory. \n&gt; There do exist neuron structures that have strong\n&gt; long term memory, I\n&gt; don&#39;t remember now what they were called, but\n&gt; perhapes in the future we\n&gt; will understand long term and short term memory\n&gt; structures well enought\n&gt; to integrate them into the current evolutionary\n&gt; framework, and we can\n&gt; then write fitness functions that promote learning\n&gt; as the desired\n&gt; behaviour.\n&gt; I hope this is what you were thinking about, cause I\n&gt; get excited talking\n&gt; about it...\n\nYes, that&#39;s exaclty my line of thought.  I have been\npushing this notion for about six months now.  You\nmight like to look at my 4Play project, on my website.\n It uses neuroevolution (but not NEAT) to evolve an\nANN that makes active use of short term memory.  Also,\nif you look in the archive at yahoo groups for this\ngroup you can find several posts by me about the\ngeneral subject of short term memory.\n\nI hope you make a NEAT ANN that can remember stuff and\nrepeat it back.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
