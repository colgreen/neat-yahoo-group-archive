Of course, such comparisons =\r\n\nbecome increasingly expensive as the generations increase, and at \nsome po=\r\nint, it becomes cheaper simply to evaluate everyone rather \nthan try to fig=\r\nure out who is a repeat.  Depending on available \nresources, you can progra=\r\nm it to look for duplicates as long as it&#39;s \ncomputationally advantageous. =\r\n It may turn out not very useful for \nmost of the run.\n\nThere is a potentia=\r\nl for more sophisticated appraches, e.g. maybe \nsome kind of hashing scheme=\r\n, but they would need to promise \nsufficiently impressive results to justif=\r\ny their effort.  I am not \nsure how much effort is justified by a 10% impro=\r\nvement.
