Consequently the question comes up, if that&#39;s j=\r\nust for simplicity and a network should actually learn everything or if it&#39;=\r\ns really better to set up some rules about what makes sense and what does a=\r\nbsolutely not.\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;dan=\r\niel_kuppitz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a general question =\r\nregarding the learning process.\n&gt; \n&gt; After playing around with NERO the las=\r\nt days, I&#39;ve learned a lot about how networks learn, but I still found no a=\r\nnswer to this elementary question: In which sequence should I train a netwo=\r\nrk that has to solve more than one task. NERO isn&#39;t build with HyperNEAT, b=\r\nut I think my questions target HyperNEAT as well as NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider 9 s=\r\ntages:\n&gt; \n&gt; Network is ...\n&gt; \n&gt;   1: quite good in task #1\n&gt;   2: really go=\r\nod in task #1\n&gt;   3: perfect in task #1\n&gt;   4: quite good in task #2\n&gt;   5:=\r\n really good in task #2\n&gt;   6: perfect in task #2\n&gt;   7: quite good in task=\r\n #1 and #2\n&gt;   8: really good in task #1 and #2\n&gt;   9: perfect in task #1 a=\r\nnd #2\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously I&#39;ll begin with stage 1, but what&#39;s next? Should I con=\r\ntinue to train my network in this task (continue with stage 2) or should I =\r\nswitch to the next task (stage 4/7) and come back to stage 2 later.\n&gt; The n=\r\next question is: How should I calculate the fitness when the network is tra=\r\nined in task #2.  Should solutions for task #2 be rewarded higher than thos=\r\ne for task #1 (stage 4) or should solutions for task #1 still get the same =\r\nreward as in stage 1 (stage 7)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe there&#39;s no general answer to my =\r\nquestions, but what&#39;s the best practice? What makes sense, what does not?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
