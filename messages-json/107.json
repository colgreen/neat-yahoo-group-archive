This problem requires short\nterm memory, and use of what is stored there, so an\nMLP can&#39;t do the job.  It must be some kind of\nrecurrent ANN.  The problem is to play the game of\nconcentration.  That&#39;s the card game where all the\ncards are spread face down and each player gets to\nturn over two cards.  If they are a pair he keeps them\nand gets another turn.  Otherwise they go face down\nagain.  When humans play it its mainly a test of\nmemory, although if your memory is perfect there is\nsome strategy involved.  (see Sci. Am. Oct. 1991)\n\nThis is a game that&#39;s natural for a conventional\ncomputer program, quite different from what ANNs\nusually do.  But since a recurrent ANN, or an MLP with\na memory, is supposed to be a universal Turing\nmachine, its theoretically capable of playing it.  I\nwant to know if that&#39;s true in practice as well.\n\nI&#39;ve written some C code that handles the game\nmechanics, assuming there are players that choose\nwhich card to turn over.  Right now I have dummy\nplayers that pick at random.  I&#39;ll be glad to make the\ncode available if someone else want to use it.  I\nwould very much like to see someone apply NEAT to this\ngame.   (I won&#39;t be using NEAT, primarily because I\nonly know C, not C++)\n\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
