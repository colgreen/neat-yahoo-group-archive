The MCNS algorithm addresse=\r\ns the concern with the original novelty search algorithm that it is &quot;too op=\r\nen-ended&quot; and therefore may get lost meandering off to nowhere in some sear=\r\nch spaces.  MCNS adds a constraint that keeps the search in a sane area of =\r\nthe search space while still driving search through novelty alone.  The pap=\r\ner also discusses the philosophical motivation for MCNS as an alternative a=\r\nbstraction of natural evolution to the pervasive fitness-pressure-centered =\r\nparadigm in EC.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
