I completely\nagree this is an area where neuroevolution and NEAT are well-suited. \nI hope to get involved in this eventually.  I also agree with Mitchell\nthat it&#39;s going to be about obstacle avoidance in pursuit of a goal,\nbut that&#39;s something we&#39;ve already seen work well with NEAT in some of\nour current research.  We&#39;ve been training robots in real-time to go\naround obstacles with good success.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt this is an enormously expensive\nundertaking.  Rather than the learning aspect being the hard part, I\nthink the hard part will be simulating the sensor and motor\nconfiguration of the actual robot.  Once that simulation is set up,\nNEAT will learn in a fairly straightforward manner.  But setting it up\nmeans really purchasing some major industrial rover equipment, which\nis thousands of dollars or maybe tens or even hundreds of thousands! \nThen we&#39;d have to drive it around in the real world and take readings\nand get a sense of what it sees, and then go back to the simulator.  \n\nWe&#39;d also have to build interfaces between the actual sensors of the\nrobot and the sensors of the NN, since one convention may not be\nsuitable to the other.  Same with motor outputs and actual motors.  \nWe&#39;d try to make the simulation-&gt;real-world matchup work both ways:\nmake the simulator look like the real world but *also* make the\nreal-world look like the simulator from the standpoint of the NN, to\nthe extent its possible. In other words, a major real-world sensor\npreprocessing problem, requiring expertise outside of NN&#39;s or NEAT.  \n\nI think it&#39;s all doable though, and I hope someday I can get NEAT\ninvolved in this challenge or something like it.  It would require\nmajor funding, though.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
