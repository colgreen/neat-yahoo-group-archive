There\n&gt; &gt; are many =\r\nconsiderations, and although I may not hit all of them, I\n&gt; &gt; think in gene=\r\nral it can be refuted:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Generally, I think HyperNEAT (i.e. NEAT wit=\r\nh CPPNs) already\n&gt; &gt; approximately follow the scenario that you outline:  I=\r\nt discovers key\n&gt; &gt; motifs (whether they be skin or something else) early i=\r\nn evolution and\n&gt; &gt; then as the overall body plan is deformed, the original=\r\n motifs are\n&gt; &gt; often preserved (which again includes skin).  The main idea=\r\n is that\n&gt; &gt; skin is like a kind of surrounding motif for the overall shape=\r\n, and if\n&gt; &gt; the pverall shape is warped through some kind of mutation in t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; internal CPPN, then however the shape is surrounded will naturally\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; warp in the same way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, you can see this happen consiste=\r\nntly in Picbreeder.  It is\n&gt; &gt; possible to consider the simple black outlin=\r\ne of many of the color\n&gt; &gt; figures as a &quot;skin.&quot;  You can notice that it is =\r\nspecial by noting that\n&gt; &gt; often the outer band is black but everything str=\r\nucture inside is\n&gt; &gt; color.  Then, if the shape of the overall image warps,=\r\n so does the\n&gt; &gt; outer membrane.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, you might say that such =\r\na &quot;skin&quot; is not complex enough to be\n&gt; &gt; convincing.  Perhaps skin should h=\r\nave multiple parts, i.e. its own\n&gt; &gt; special structure.  In fact, if you lo=\r\nok closely, you can find many\n&gt; &gt; such examples.  For example, there are of=\r\nten double-layer outer\n&gt; &gt; membranes that form, such as in this image:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D317\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There i=\r\ns a clear outer structure that surrounds the complex curvature\n&gt; &gt; of the o=\r\nbject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or, perhaps more interestingly, you can get several layers =\r\nof color\n&gt; &gt; bands, but only on the outer membrane, such as in this image t=\r\nhat ends\n&gt; &gt; in a light blue that becomes green, then becomes yellow, befor=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; sinking into the inner-body color of orange:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreed=\r\ner.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4227\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To show that the outer mem=\r\nbrane warps easily and naturally regardless\n&gt; &gt; of shape changes (even comp=\r\nlex ones), I further evolved that image to\n&gt; &gt; get a new shape, and you can=\r\n see that the outer membrane has the same\n&gt; &gt; motif nevertheless, nicely wa=\r\nrped to accommodate the new overall\nshape:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/s=\r\nearch/showgenome.php?sid=3D5635\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is also important to note that =\r\nouter membranes in nature are not\n&gt; &gt; uniform covers and often transition i=\r\nnto something else on the\n&gt; &gt; surface.  For example, consider lips and eyes=\r\n.  Or perhaps even more\n&gt; &gt; importantly, consider fingernails, where the ou=\r\nter cover actually\n&gt; &gt; falls *under* something else (i.e. the nail), violat=\r\ning the covering\n&gt; &gt; rule.  I point these exceptions out because in Picbree=\r\nder you also\n&gt; &gt; often see almost consistent outer motifs that are broken i=\r\nn a couple\n&gt; &gt; places.  While these locations often are arbitrary, the poin=\r\nt is that\n&gt; &gt; such a capability could be exploited if it actually mattered.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moving from 2-D to 3-D should not matter in the case of skin, jus=\r\nt as\n&gt; &gt; moving CPPNs from 2-D to 4-D continues to allow all the same\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\negularities.  So when you see examples in 2-D, they are also possible\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nn 3-D for the same reasons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of these outer skin motifs can ar=\r\nise early when the shape is\n&gt; &gt; simple and are then easily preserved.  Howe=\r\nver, they are not always\n&gt; &gt; preserved.  For example, the multicolor skin a=\r\nbove evolved into a\n&gt; &gt; different multicolor skin in one lineage:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4228\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This phenom=\r\nenon is expected from the analogy with nature, just as\n&gt; &gt; scales can evolv=\r\ne into fur, or fur into uncovered skin, all still\n&gt; &gt; serving the role of o=\r\nuter membrane.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s important to note that skin or an oute=\r\nr membrane is not\n&gt; &gt; really any different from any other CPPN-generated mo=\r\ntif, in that it\n&gt; &gt; can be preserved, warped, or changed in its internal st=\r\nructure.  So I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think there is really anything special going on in=\r\n the argument\n&gt; &gt; compared to the discovery of symmetry or other convention=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ken has challenged us all many tim=\r\nes to think about whether there\nis any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; need for a process of developme=\r\nnt. The identity of cells in\n&gt; &gt; developmental\n&gt; &gt;&gt; processes is determined=\r\n by local contextual information whereas Ken\n&gt; &gt;&gt; advocates skipping that b=\r\ny letting cells determine their identity\n&gt; &gt; via giving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them their obj=\r\nective coordinates. The question is whether we lose\n&gt; &gt; anything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; impor=\r\ntant to the evolution of complexity by skipping this step.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I thi=\r\nnk it is a fascinating question and, unable to come up with\na good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rea=\r\nson why development matters myself, but wanting to give the\n&gt; &gt; argument a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rigorous evaluation, I have been asking many people in our field\nwheth=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they can describe something unique that a developmental process\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n provides. No\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one has come up with  a reason that compels me, so I hav=\r\ne become a\n&gt; &gt; strong\n&gt; &gt;&gt; advocate of the lack of a need for an unfolding =\r\nprocess.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, in the course of watching a keynote on develop=\r\nment in\nnatural\n&gt; &gt;&gt; systems at this year&#39;s gecco, an argument in favor of =\r\ndevelopment\n&gt; &gt; occurred\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to me that may have merit. I am interested to=\r\n hear what y&#39;all think\n&gt; &gt; of it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The argument is this: it might=\r\n be easier to evolve certain\nlarge-scale\n&gt; &gt;&gt; properties when the organism =\r\nis simple and small and then scale/grow\n&gt; &gt; them\n&gt; &gt;&gt; up, rather than incor=\r\nporating them into an already complex\nphenotype. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; think an example il=\r\nlustrates the point best. Imagine evolution\n&gt; &gt; figuring out\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how to pu=\r\nt a coat of skin on an organism. It is not that hard to\n&gt; &gt; figure out\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n what the shape of that skin should be when the embryo has only a few\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nells.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Once that simple and small coat of skin has formed, it can follo=\r\nw\n&gt; &gt; the simple\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rule of keeping the layer of skin the same thickness,=\r\n and adding\ncells\n&gt; &gt;&gt; within that layer to grow to cover any arbitrary sha=\r\npe that the\n&gt; &gt; phenotype\n&gt; &gt;&gt; becomes. This simple rule could produce a sk=\r\nin shell for a bat or a\n&gt; &gt; jaguar.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now consider how hard it would be =\r\nfor 3D hyperneat to create a skin\n&gt; &gt; shell\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for a bat or a jaguar. The=\r\n mathematical function to create such\n&gt; &gt; outlines is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; very complex (al=\r\nthough it is less so if it is a composition of other,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; already created =\r\nfunctions that produced the rest of the body).\nStill, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; seems that th=\r\nis task might be harder for hyperneat than following\n&gt; &gt; the simple\n&gt; &gt;&gt; de=\r\nvelopmental rules outlined above.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; What do you think? I would hap=\r\npily be convinced that this argument is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without merit, so please let m=\r\ne know if you see any problems with it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff =\r\nClune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
