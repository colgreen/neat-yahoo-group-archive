Did\n&gt; &gt; you also consider\n&gt; &gt; inputting the start sequence with indices (e.g. M\n&gt; &gt; inputs for data and N\n&gt; &gt; inputs for &quot;address&quot; -- probably just setting one\n&gt; &gt; address-line high, not\n&gt; &gt; full binary numbers) and then ask for the data back\n&gt; &gt; by repeating the\n&gt; &gt; address sequence.\n&gt;\n&gt;No.  That would be a different problem, also worth\n&gt;doing.  I&#39;m modeling phone dialing; you hear a phone\n&gt;number, 7 sounds in sequence, then after only a very\n&gt;short delay you repeat it back in the same sequence,\n&gt;either by speaking it or dialing it.\n\nI&#39;m not so sure about it being a different problem.  E.g. for short \nsequences at least, I can answer questions like &quot;what digit was third&quot; or \n&quot;what came after the seven&quot; as easily as I can repeat the sequence \nback.  And I would not assume that this is three separate mechanisms acting \non the same data.\n\ne.g. to go back to a point discussed a while back, breaking a problem into \nsmall pieces can make it harder.  So, for example, a net which can answer \n&quot;what came after the seven&quot; might make a necessary stepping-stone on the \nway to one which can recall the whole sequence.\n\nNow an &quot;indexed&quot; approach is different, but I was thinking it was an easier \nexperiment to set up than &quot;what came after&quot;.  And it&#39;s pretty clear that if \nyou could evolve indexed access, then it could be connected to a \n&quot;sequencer&quot; to form a solution to the original problem.\n\nI&#39;m not suggesting these are better experiments.  I&#39;m just wondering \nout-loud about whether modularity could be evolved or enforced and whether \nit corresponds to anything in the way nature does it.\n\ne.g. to get back to the lemur, it had to recall the sequence of some \nimages.  I don&#39;t know about lemurs, but a humans memory in such a case \ncomes in two parts:\n\n1) recognize and remember what was in the pictures\n2) remember the sequence\n\nAnd (1) is _much_ easier if they are pictures of things you already \nknow.  Thus our systems have to work, somehow, by forming temporary \nassociations between positions in the sequence (possibly using a central \nconcept of &quot;sequence&quot;) and pre-existing concepts elsewhere in our brains...\n\nI&#39;m very interested in any ideas or experiments for how brains are able to \napply different concepts together like this.  It&#39;s just the same as the \ndiscussion we had about whether 4play could exploit symmetry or not and \nwhether a human brain can learn board-symmetry from checkers and apply it \nto chess.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This is very similar to what is done by my 4Play\n&gt; &gt; &gt;program, except 4Play did more complex logic than\n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;repeating memorize values.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d say this was asking for a more complex net,\n&gt; &gt; however...\n&gt;\n&gt;Which do you think is more complex?\n\nThe phone numbers are more complex.  Assuming I remember 4play correctly, \nit only had to recall the positions of 4 symbols amongst 4 \nplaces.  Treating that naively, it&#39;s only 8 bits of data.  A seven-digit \nphone number is 28 bits of data, even without questions of remembering the \n&quot;cursor&quot; position...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
