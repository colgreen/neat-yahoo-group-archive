This \nshould not be necessary because J#  provides a library of the standard \njava classes, so you should be able to keep using the existing \njava.util.Vector. Just referece vjslib.dll to get access to all of the \nstandard java classes.\n\nThere may be a problem with the java library version. The J# library is \nbased on JDK 1.1.4 but does not contain all of the 1.1.4 java classes. I \nam guessing that JNEAT is based on a later JDK (1.4.x?) so there may be \nsome backward compatibility problems there.\n\nColin.\n\nLuca_PI wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;first of all sorry for my english :)\n&gt;I have imported JNEAT into J#.NET deleting all the graphic interface \n&gt;(dir GUI) using it as a DLL and creating the interface in VB.NET.\n&gt;I have changed only the Vector in ArrayList.\n&gt;After that i try to reproduce the XOR experiment with the original \n&gt;parameter. \n&gt;The result is that the fitness don&#39;t go over 6.25 evry time I start \n&gt;the simulation!\n&gt;NEAT evolve very fast up to 6.23 (in about 4-5 generation) and after \n&gt;go step by step near 6.25 until catching up 6.25 in about 13 \n&gt;generation. after all it doesn&#39;t make nothing.\n&gt;I try to increment the epoch value up to 100 with the same result...\n&gt;There&#39;s a reason to that???\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the answers\n&gt;Luca\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
