Do you still see these behaviors?  \n\nThe supplied executabl=\r\ne w/ associated dll&#39;s appears to work fine. \nPerhaps the default undefined =\r\nvalue for species ID in the dll \nimplementation allowed the equality test i=\r\nn getSpecies (i.e. &quot;if\n(species[a]-&gt;getID()=3D=3Did)&quot;), to be satisfied.\n\n\n=\r\n&gt; Maybe you can provide more details\n&gt; into what is happening that&#39;s causin=\r\ng the finishEvaluations not to \nrun.\n&gt; It&#39;s possible that finishEvaluations=\r\n is causing an exception which \nit is\n&gt; printing out, and then continuing o=\r\nn, resulting in what appears to \nbe no\n&gt; call to finishEvaluations.\n\nNo, I =\r\nhave run with multiple break points in debug. Execution is not \nflowing to =\r\nfinishEvaluations prior to the exception in getSpecies. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve compil=\r\ned and run my program with MSVC 2003 before, and it \nseemed to\n&gt; work, but =\r\nthat was a few months ago.  I will try to compile and run \nthe\n&gt; findcluste=\r\nrexperiment with MSVC2005 here at home and let you know \nif I find\n&gt; anythi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe you can run it in the visual studio debugger and find out wh=\r\ny \nit&#39;s not\n&gt; executing finishevaluations?\n\nHave done this. I believe the l=\r\nogic in ExperimentRun::start requires \nthat the call to finishEvaluations s=\r\nhould be inside the &quot;for (size_t \ngenerations=3D(population-getGenerationCo=\r\nunt()-\n1);generations&lt;maxGenerations;generations++)&quot; braces. I have tested =\r\n\nthis change and it appears to work correctly.

First, I had made reference to\n&gt; &gt; onGenerat=\r\nion equal to 0 in produceNextGeneration and confused it \nwith\n&gt; &gt; generatio=\r\nns equal to 1 in ExperimentRun::start, which is what you\n&gt; &gt; were refering =\r\nto with the &quot;generations&gt;0&quot; test. Bad news, I \nbelieve\n&gt; &gt; that for your in=\r\ntended purpose(?), the call to finishEvaluations\n&gt; &gt; should be inside the &quot;=\r\nfor (size_t generations=3D(population-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;getGenerationCount()-\n1);genera=\r\ntions&lt;maxGenerations;generations++)&quot;\n&gt; &gt; braces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am getting a cal=\r\nl to produceNextGeneration with generations\n&gt; &gt; equal to 1, with no prior c=\r\nall to finishEvaluations, with\n&gt; &gt; species.size equal to 0 and the species =\r\nID undefined, resulting in\n&gt; &gt; the exception associated with a call to getS=\r\npecies. I note that \nthere\n&gt; &gt; is some editing in this area. Maybe a differ=\r\nence in compilers \n(MSVC\n&gt; &gt; 2003)?
