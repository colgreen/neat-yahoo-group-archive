It=\r\n&#39;s important to note that the information in a substrate is more than the i=\r\nnformation in a graph (e.g. node coordinates matter), so I am not sure that=\r\n usual graph descriptions would be sufficient.  Also, ideally, such a langu=\r\nage would be able to express things in a compact way, like saying where a r=\r\now or sheet of neurons is located and to what other neurons it connects as =\r\na group.\n\nIn any case, as I mentioned, we are working on an XML format, but=\r\n right now it can only express certain types of networks and not others.  I=\r\nt may take a week or two because of travel, but I will discuss my students =\r\nif they feel like the format should be released, or if perhaps it is still =\r\ntoo unfinished to be worthwhile (which may be the case).  \n\nI do believe th=\r\nat it is ultimately a good idea to try to adopt some kind of XML standard f=\r\nor describing substrates.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;evertwh2004&quot;=\r\n &lt;evert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m starting some HyperNEAT experiment=\r\ns trying various substrate designs.
