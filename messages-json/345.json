Evolution is not inherently\n&gt; directional; it is simply change.\n&gt; \n&gt; And change could easily be demonstrated in NEAT\n&gt; without a fitness function.  Given a population of\n&gt; 100\n&gt; individuals, 20% could simply be randomly selected\n&gt; to\n&gt; produce offspring via the NEAT mating method, which\n&gt; would then be subject to NEAT&#39;s mutation operators,\n&gt; refilling the population to its original size.  20%\n&gt; could then be randomly selected to survive into the\n&gt; next generation...and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even with no fitness function, the population will\n&gt; evolve.  That is, the gene frequencies of the final\n&gt; generation will be different from the original\n&gt; population (just how different will depend on\n&gt; parameter settings, such as mutation rates).\n&gt; \n&gt; And that&#39;s all evolution is.  No intent.  No\n&gt; direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, for our purposes, we want the change to\n&gt; go\n&gt; in a particular direction, to optimize a particular\n&gt; behavior or set of behaviors, and we try to tailor a\n&gt; fitness function that we think best captures the\n&gt; features of those behaviors.  We&#39;re interested in\n&gt; directional change.\n&gt; \n&gt; But strictly speaking, biological evolution is not.\n\nLet me be the first to disagree with you.  I expect\nmany others will also disagree.  Of course words are\ngiven definitions by people, so there is never\ncomplete agreement.  Nevertheless, evolution as a\nscientific theory includes the idea of selection.  The\nselection is based on the total environment, and\ncauses a directional movement of gene frequencies. \nThe direction may or may not be predictable.  Granted,\nthere are cases where there is only random selection,\nand hence genetic drift is the only source of gene\nfrequency change, but in most case, both biological\nand simulated, the selection that occurs will push the\ngene pool in specific directions.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
