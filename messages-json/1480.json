The line in the circle indicates the eye&#39;s\n&gt; orientation, and it&#39;s actually upside down and fully zoomed out at\n&gt; step 1.  The right window is what the eye is seeing as it moves\n&gt; around.  \n\nIt&#39;s also worth noting that the visual field is a square circumscribed\naround the circle in the left window.  The top of the square is\nperpendicular to the line segment inside the circle.\n\n"}}
