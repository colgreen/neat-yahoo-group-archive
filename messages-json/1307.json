The original seed topology (no hidden nodes) \nwas still alive and kicking, and battling it out for first place in the \npopulation, which means that things weren&#39;t exactly progressing...\n\nSo I decided to speed things up.  I chopped down the number of networks in \nthe population so that packets get returned sooner.  Found a bug in my \noffspring allocation code in the process...oops...but that&#39;s fixed now.\n\nSo now I&#39;m trying to get through the generations faster in an attempt to \nmake some progress.  Problem is, I think I may have done myself a \ndisservice.  By having the evaluation code start at the reduction side and \nwork its way up to enlargement, it seems the pressure is to create a network \nthat merely averages its pixel inputs.  And I&#39;m not convinced that it will \nbe able to (easily) break away from that pressure, even as topology is \nadded.  It might, but I&#39;m thinking that I would be better off if I just went \nahead and calculated all activations rather than trying to short-circuit the \ncalculations for less fit networks.  What do you guys think?\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
