The final pieces of \nthe core code were put in place today and although I really should unit \ntest some of the latest code I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to fire it \nup using a prey capture domain I had coded for a previous EANN project.\n\nResults?  so far so good - the prey capture domain is based on the one \ndescribed in the 1996 paper &quot;Incremental Evolution of Complex General \nBehavior&quot; (Faustino Gomez, Risto Miikkulainen). Basically the task \ndifficulty can be increased by giving the prey a varying number of head \nstarts (0 to 4) and then gradually increasing it&#39;s speed from 0.0 to 1.0 \nmoves per domain time-slice.\n\nThe goal task is to solve 4, 1.0   (4 initial moves and a speed of 1.0). \nPreviously the most difficult task I was able to solve was 4, 0.3.  \nThings kind of ground to a halt after that. Using the new NEAT \nimplementation is so far giving better results - so far it has &#39;solved&#39; \n4, 0.8.  The best network currently passes 75/100 tests on 4, 1.0.  Not \na bad start.\n\nI&#39;ve just added in code to amalgamate matching innovations per \ngeneration (as Ken mentions in the competitive coevolution paper). Ken, \nI wonder - do you amalgamate matching structures in your initial \npopulations too? it would make sense to, currently I don&#39;t.\n\nOne remaining significant thing I&#39;m not doing is elitist selection - my \nevolution algorithm is currently a pure roulette wheel selection. So \nthis will likely improve things when I change it.\n\nSo there you go. I will spend some time unit testing / tweaking and \nhopefully I will have the 4, 1.0 test solved this week and I can move \nonto some visualisation and/or XML stuff maybe.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
