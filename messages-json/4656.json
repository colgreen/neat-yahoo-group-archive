The results were not that encouragi=\r\nng when compared with a standard NEAT experiment (maybe I need to sort out =\r\nthe geometry, though given the recent paper by Jeff, any geometry should wo=\r\nrk better than standard NEAT).  I implemented David B. D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s Food Fi=\r\nnder experiment and that worked just fine.\n\nI know you used this experiment=\r\n in your alife 09 paper and I have one question regarding the fitness funct=\r\nion of this experiment.  First, the algorithms are slightly different - cou=\r\nld be typos or could be just different.  However, in both, they seem to rew=\r\nard (increasing fitness) bots that take longer with the (Ttot * 1000r) or (=\r\nTtot / 1000r) terms of yours and David&#39;s experiments. This seems at odds wi=\r\nth the goal.  I have implemented (1000r / Ttot) which after all food is fou=\r\nnd rewards quicker bots.\n\nMaybe I have missed something or misunderstood.\n\n=\r\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt, what kind of experiment is implemented in your hyperneat?=\r\n  Is it one of the same experiments from our versions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; ke=\r\nn\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My Neat4j v2 (as yet unreleased) implements hyperne=\r\nat.
