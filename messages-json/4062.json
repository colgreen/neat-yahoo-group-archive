It is an indirect encoding, and thus is more likely to create modular\nphenotypes that exhibit repetitions and symmetry (with and without\nvariation).\n\nUnless I am mistaken, these benefits can cause HyperNEAT to outperform NEAT\neven on problems where geometry is not being exploited.

Unless you\n&gt; believe there is some geometric regularities in those time series\n&gt; there is no point to use HyperNEAT. Try regular NEAT first.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My goal is to evolve a stock trader.  The inputs are various\n&gt; technical\n&gt;&gt; indicators, but I like the output to indicate five states--Buy/Sell\n&gt;&gt; (going long), Short/Cover (going short), and do nothing.  Ideally,\n&gt;&gt; each signal would be a 1 or 0 (all zeros indicates to do nothing\n&gt; (i.e.\n&gt;&gt; keep current position - long, short, or out).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. Is this best framed as a classification problem (now is a good\n&gt; time\n&gt;&gt; to buy, sell, short, cover), or would some type of 0-1 analog output\n&gt;&gt; be best (meaning buy when buy is &gt; sell by 0.2 or something)?  How\n&gt; do\n&gt;&gt; you force a binary output in the software anyway?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 2. Should I try to predict the percentage change (up or down) over\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; next n time periods, and then only buy or sell when there is say a\n&gt; 3%\n&gt;&gt; change from now?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 3. when recurrence evolves in NEAT, does it look back only 1 time\n&gt;&gt; period, or can it evolve longer lookbacks?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --Thanks, Todd\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
