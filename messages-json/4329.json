CMAES adapts the Gaussian distribution shape and\n&gt; s=\r\nize with a fully *deterministic* strategy, and thus, are not they are not\n&gt;=\r\n parts of the genotype. This is different from Self-Adaptive Evolution\n&gt; St=\r\nrategies (SAES), where Gaussian distribution shape and size is a part of\n&gt; =\r\nthe genotype. There are both theoretical analysis and experimental results\n=\r\n&gt; that show that the CMAES strategy is much faster to find the optimal\n&gt; Ga=\r\nussian distribution shape and size compared to a SAES strategy.

I don&#39;t recall the specific discussion. =\r\nIn any case,\n&gt;\n&gt; there was a time when I thought evolution could be good at=\r\n things like\n&gt;\n&gt; that, but my mind has been changing in recent years, so I =\r\nappreciate\n&gt;\n&gt; what your paper is saying.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think what caused me to bec=\r\nome a skeptic about these kinds of\n&gt;\n&gt; meta-evolutionary approaches is spea=\r\nking to people who advocate the\n&gt;\n&gt; idea that evolution should &quot;evolve its =\r\nown encoding.&quot; That idea is\n&gt;\n&gt; connected to evolvability, which suggests t=\r\nhat evolution can figure\n&gt;\n&gt; out its own best parametrizations to become mo=\r\nst effective at evolving\n&gt;\n&gt; in a particular type of domain. Working on enc=\r\nodings started to make\n&gt;\n&gt; me think that the search space of encodings is s=\r\nimply too vast to\n&gt;\n&gt; expect evolution itself to optimize the encoding. It =\r\nis basically a\n&gt;\n&gt; vast meta-search, far vaster than the problem domain its=\r\nelf (which is\n&gt;\n&gt; already vast to begin with in ambitious cases), and the a=\r\nctual problem\n&gt;\n&gt; domain would seem to locally obfuscate the landscape of\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; meta-parameters (just as your results show).\n&gt;\n&gt; Overall, I started to f=\r\neel like human intuition is a better bet for\n&gt;\n&gt; solving these meta-questio=\r\nns, or at least for addressing them\n&gt;\n&gt; effectively. Also, as we started to=\r\n think about novelty search, I\n&gt;\n&gt; started to realize that evolution often =\r\ninnovates *despite* selection\n&gt;\n&gt; rather than because of it, which is even =\r\nmore complicating at the\n&gt;\n&gt; meta-level. That is, at a meta-level like enco=\r\ndings, if something\n&gt;\n&gt; good came about, it might actually be because selec=\r\ntion pressure was\n&gt;\n&gt; low for a time. In other words, if selection pressure=\r\n has been high,\n&gt;\n&gt; the steps towards whatever optimal meta-parameter was f=\r\nound would\n&gt;\n&gt; never have been taken because the stepping stones are meta-s=\r\nuboptimal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just talking about this issue with all these &quot;metas&quot; reminds=\r\n me why\n&gt;\n&gt; it seems like wishful thinking to rely on evolution to determin=\r\ne\n&gt;\n&gt; everything. Luck and happenstance have to be accepted as factors.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n In another sense, evolving meta-parameters optimally sounds\n&gt;\n&gt; dangerousl=\r\ny close to a free lunch. If there is an algorithm that can\n&gt;\n&gt; evolve the r=\r\night meta-parameters reliably, which in turn causes it to\n&gt;\n&gt; always find t=\r\nhe right solution, when would that algorithm fail?\n&gt;\n&gt; The conclusion in my=\r\n view is to trust our instincts. We (humans)\n&gt;\n&gt; still have a role to play =\r\nin setting the parameters of our algorithms\n&gt;\n&gt; , and in designing our enco=\r\ndings, by thinking about the problems they\n&gt;\n&gt; are intended to solve. We ar=\r\ne probably not going to get away with\n&gt;\n&gt; offloading all the responsibility=\r\n on evolution itself, at least not if\n&gt;\n&gt; you want to see it succeed in rea=\r\nsonable time.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, Jeff (here I go contradicting myself), there =\r\nare\n&gt;\n&gt; reportedly evolutionary algorithms that seem to show that they bene=\r\nfit\n&gt;\n&gt; from mutating mutation parameters. Evolution Strategies come to min=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; ES has done this kind of thing for years. CMA-ES now uses\n&gt;\n&gt; statis=\r\ntical techniques to predict optimal mutation distributions.\n&gt;\n&gt; What do you=\r\nr results suggest about such approaches? Are they just\n&gt;\n&gt; working on &quot;toy =\r\nproblems&quot; or is there some explanation for why they\n&gt;\n&gt; claim to derive ben=\r\nefit from evolving the parameters?\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. com=\r\n, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A while bac=\r\nk we had a discussion about whether natural selection is\n&gt;\n&gt; good at\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; c=\r\nhoosing its own parameters. Many people assume that it would be\n&gt;\n&gt; benefic=\r\nial\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to evolve the parameters of a run (e.g. mutation rate, crossover r=\r\nate,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; etc.). After having done some research in the area I have conclud=\r\ned\n&gt;\n&gt; that it\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; does not work well.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I expressed this vie=\r\nw previously, some of you were very\n&gt;\n&gt; skeptical. At\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that point, I pr=\r\nomised to share a manuscript that investigates the issue\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; once it was p=\r\nublished.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That manuscript finally came out yesterday in the journ=\r\nal PLoS\n&gt;\n&gt; Computational\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Biology.

I=\r\nn particular, I would like\n&gt;\n&gt; to hear\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; from those of you that were ske=\r\nptical of my claim.

Note: I recognize\n&gt;\n&gt; that\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; this paper only=\r\n covers mutation rates. However, the mutation rate is\n&gt;\n&gt; one of\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the m=\r\nost important parameters. Furthermore, I think similar issues will\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ari=\r\nse with other parameters that result in the perturbation of\n&gt;\n&gt; genomes (e.=\r\ng.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; crossover type and rate).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS.
