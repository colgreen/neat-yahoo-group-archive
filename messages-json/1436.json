The max fitness \nfor\n&gt; this domain is 260, I believe.  For the first few hundred \ngenerations,\n&gt; the population improves to about 80, but for the next several\n&gt; *thousand* generations, the max and average fitness for the \npopulation\n&gt; gets worse and worse, ending up essentially as good as the initial\n&gt; random population (~10).\n&gt; \n&gt; This isn&#39;t about simpler or more complex individuals performing \nbetter\n&gt; or worse.  This is about the entire population getting *worse*\n&gt; throughout the run.  It certainly seems to me that this is not the \nway\n&gt; NEAT is supposed to work.\n&gt; \n\nThat definitely is a bit odd.  Colin, what was the number of \ngenerations of stagnation before a species was cut?  It looks like \nspecies were dying off pretty quickly there is that&#39;s really the \nunderlying explanation for the downward trend.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
