There is currently no Java version of HyperNEAT, so others migh=\r\nt be interested as well.  Do you have any experiments working in it?\n\n(I un=\r\nderstand if it&#39;s not ready for that but I wanted to at least raise the poss=\r\nibility.)\n\nThanks,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually implemented HyperNeat in Java about a year ago. (I had=\r\n some trouble understanding what to do with ANJI and JNEAT too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It wa=\r\ns designed to be able to modify the number of hidden layers. It was my firs=\r\nt Java project and it was unnecessarily complicated. However, a large chunk=\r\n of the code was ported from the original C++ HyperNeat. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s reus=\r\nable with a bit tuning (e.g. not mutating number of layers and their connec=\r\ntion patterns.)\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want it, I will email you the code.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
