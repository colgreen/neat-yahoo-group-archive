It would also be nice to have a\ntop-level directory with documentation related to NEAT\n(research papers, etc.) and perhaps a doc with an\noverview of each implementation (i.e., an elaboration\nof the section of Ken&#39;s NEAT User&#39;s page that talks\nabout deciding which implementation to use.\n\nAnybody else have ideas about how best to organize the\nNEAT repository?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
