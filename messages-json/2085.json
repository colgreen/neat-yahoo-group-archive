Since the\n&gt;solution does not involve the network having to compute the velocities\n&gt;itself.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat is the explanation given by Graua in &quot;A comparison between cellular \nencoding and direct encoding for genetic neural neytworks&quot;:\n\nhttp://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/13526/http:zSzzSzearth.cs.ttu.eduzSz~pyeattzSzpaperszSzgp96.pdf/gruau96comparison.pdf\n\nCheck the last paragraph on page 1.\n\nI suspect though that fast movement in such a simulation may allow the \nsimulation to cheat the laws of physics somewhat because of the large \namount of movement between timesteps, and this /may/ make a solution \neasier. This is just speculation but certainly the accuracy of the \nsimulation is less if the cart and poles are moving at higher speeds.\n\n&gt;But if it were a real-world system we wouldn&#39;t care what the network\n&gt;did or didn&#39;t have to compute, right?  If anything, if it could solve\n&gt;the problem more effectively without extra computation, that&#39;s a good\n&gt;thing.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, I&#39;d go along with that.\n\n&gt;One of the real-world constraints we *do* care about is the amount of\n&gt;energy the system uses.  In Risto Miikkulainen&#39;s Evolving Neural\n&gt;Networks workshop at GECCO this year he showed one of the resulting 2d\n&gt;pole balancing solutions that solve the problem, but would have\n&gt;consumed enormous amounts of energy if it were actually implemented in\n&gt;a real-world controller.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;So wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to penalize the amount of movement of\n&gt;the cart?  Wouldn&#39;t this be not only a simpler penalty to implement,\n&gt;but be functionally very close to what you want to achieve?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is effectively what the anti-wiigle function is doing, albeit in an \ninprecise way. It just totals the absolute value of the cart and pole 1 \nvelocities and positions, which are all centered around 0 and tries to \nminimise them. You could try just minimizing the cart velocity, or some \nother combination of cart and pole variables. An alternative would be to \nlimit the maximum force that the network can apply, but that /may/ leave \nyour networks stranded in local optima. On the other hand the current \nanti-wiggle approach often tends to find high energy wiggling solutions \nand then must try and find its way across the search space to an \nno-wiggling solution - which could be just as difficult.\n\nPerhaps some experimentation is required to settle this matter!\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
