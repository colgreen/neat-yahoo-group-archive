Is there a particular step in\n&gt; the process that the roving eye can fill?  For example, is the\n&gt; experiment you are doing now a task usually done by human eye?\n&gt; It seems even if the entire process of fingerprint identification\n&gt; can&#39;t be done with the roving eye, it may still be able to fill some\n&gt; crucial link in the chain.\n\nIt might be useful to distinguish between the three subdomains that\nall fall under fingerprint recognition:\n\n1) Fingerprint Classification -- The process of determining which\nclass a fingerprint belongs to.  The Henry Classification System\ndivides prints into 3 broad classes (whorl, loop, and arch).  Those\ncan be subdivided into more specific classes (left/right loop,\narch/tented arch).  Left/right loop are sometimes called radial/ulnar\nloop.  And sometimes those classifications are even more granular\n(e.g., a whorl can be two swirled loops or concentric circles).  This\ntype of classification is used primarily to divide a fingerprint\ndatabase into bins, to reduce the time spent doing 1-to-many searches\nby reducing the amount of the database to search.\n\n2) Fingerprint Identification (1-to-many) -- The process of checking a\nsingle unknown print against a database of prints for a match. \nUsually for law enforcement purposes, either trying to match a latent\nprint from a crime scene to a matching print in a database.\n\n3) Fingerprint Verification (1-to1) -- The process of verifying a\nsingle print against a template, usually used for security purposes. \nIf your laptop is fingerprint locked, when someone puts their finger\non the pad, the software checks the scanned print against the stored\ntemplate and either grants or denies access based on the match\nconfidence.\n\nSo for commercial systems, obviously verification is fully automated,\nthough my impression is that in fingerprint identification systems\nthere is still some human intervention.  I honestly am not that\nfamiliar with the industry to know to what extent various systems are\nautomated, and how much they still rely on human expertise and\ntraining.  The recently deployed US VISIT program\n(http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/interapp/content_multi_image/content_multi_image_0006.xml),\nour new immigration system, apparently is set up to store the two\nindex fingerprints (and a digital face photo) of every non-immigrant\nentering the country.  I honestly don&#39;t know what the ratio of human\nintervention vs. automation is involved in how they store and search\ntheir database.\n\nSo obviously we need to do a bit more research on the\ncommercial/governmental side of things.  I don&#39;t know to what extent\nthe academic and commercial communities interact and share ideas, but\nso far I&#39;ve been primarily reading the academic literature.  I don&#39;t\nknow if there are any people on this list that are interested in\nbiometric applications (if there are, speak up). :)\n\nThis just seemed like an interesting, real-world problem where there\nis a good amount of previous research to compare results to.  Whether\nor not there is a direct commercial application for fingerprint\nclassification, I really don&#39;t know.  There definitely would be for\nidentification and verification, though competition is extremely\ntough...there are already a number of very good algorithms being sold.\n If a roving eye/neural net approach can improve upon speed and\ncompactness (I don&#39;t think it could improve much on accuracy, which is\nalready very high), then it might be able to compete with commercial\nproducts.\n\nBut we haven&#39;t even begun to look at applying this approach to either\nidentification and verification, which may be more difficult than\nclassification.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
