So w=\r\ne\nintentionally evolved against a fixed heuristic benchmark with three\nalgo=\r\nrithms that are all variants of NEAT.  That way, the contribution\nof learni=\r\nng from geometry is isolated effectively, and you can see the\nadvantage Hyp=\r\nerNEAT has over the other methods.  \n\nBecause the training is always run ag=\r\nainst a single fixed heuristic\nplayer, there is no way that evolution can p=\r\nroduce anything much\nbetter than the heuristic (because no more challenging=\r\n players are\never encountered during training), so whether or not the resul=\r\ntant\nplayer defeats humans is not that interesting (it would only indicate\n=\r\nthat something slightly better than the heuristic is also better than\nsome =\r\nhuman players, for whatever that is worth).\n\nYet as Jason mentioned we have=\r\n also run separately some coevolutionary\nruns, and those the ones where it =\r\ndoes become interesting what level\nof human player can be defeated.  Nevert=\r\nheless, Jeff and Derek, I\nagree with your criticisms of this kind of sensat=\r\nional claim (e.g.\n&quot;beats masters level player!&quot;) so we need to be careful t=\r\no put any\nsuch claim in context if we come to the point where we get result=\r\ns\nlike that.\n\nAnd Derek, thanks for the Go link, very interesting!\n\nken\n\n--=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Ap=\r\nr 17, 2008 at 1:26 PM, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Finally, whi=\r\nle it is cool that your program beats you guys at\ncheckers, it\n&gt; &gt;  might n=\r\not solely be because of the HyperNEAT-driven AI.

This was one of my big problems with Blondie24\n&gt; (althou=\r\ngh to the author&#39;s credit, he did address the issue, along with\n&gt; many othe=\r\nr objections). The question is the amount of work being done\n&gt; by the ANN v=\r\ns. the brute-force approach of tree search. The Blondie24\n&gt; network did bet=\r\nter than a crude board estimation such as simply\n&gt; counting the number of o=\r\npponent and friendly pieces on the board, but\n&gt; not a whole lot better.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; On a related note, I just saw today that the Go program MoGo beat a\n&gt; 5th=\r\n Dan Go professional in 9x9 play:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/2278450.h=\r\ntml\n&gt; \n&gt; MoGo uses Monte Carlo methods, which from what I understand is a\n&gt;=\r\n variant of brute-force search, which I don&#39;t think sheds much light on\n&gt; h=\r\now humans solve such problems and won&#39;t scale or generalize very\n&gt; well.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
