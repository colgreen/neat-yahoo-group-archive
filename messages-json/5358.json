Is it from a different graph or the same grap=\r\nh?  The reason I ask is that it probably matters whether the nodes will be =\r\nthe same nodes (i.e. because they are from the same graph) or nodes from an=\r\n entirely different graph.\n\nIn general, it does sound like you could create=\r\n an array of 9000 inputs and highlight the ones that you are asking about. =\r\n The main question for HyperNEAT is whether those 9000 inputs can be situat=\r\ned in a meaningful geometry?  For example, is it naturally 300x300?  Or may=\r\nbe something else?  If there is a geometry to them, and if there are regula=\r\nrities in their connectivity, then in principle HyperNEAT might be a good c=\r\nhoice for learning that pattern.\n\nAlso, note that with 9000 inputs, there w=\r\nill generally be a computational cost to activating the network.\n\nken\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p_mridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am=\r\n working on a bioinformatics problem, but it&#39;s easier to talk about it in g=\r\nraph theory terms....\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a graph with a large number of nodes (~90=\r\n00), and about 3000 edges between the nodes...
