Can we directly sense joint\n&gt; &gt; angles?  I&#39;m guessing not.  I think we probably\n&gt; &gt; deduce\n&gt; &gt; that from our more direct &quot;force&quot; senses (i.e.\n&gt; sense\n&gt; &gt; of touch).  ...Not that that matters for this\n&gt; &gt; project.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is well established that humans have a\n&gt; &quot;kinesthetic\n&gt; sense&quot; which let&#39;s them &quot;feel&quot; the position of their\n&gt; various body parts.  You can experience it.  Just\n&gt; close your eyes and move your arms into different\n&gt; positions, or better yet, relax them and have\n&gt; someone\n&gt; else put them in different positions.  Can you feel\n&gt; where your arms are?  (You should be able to.)\n\nI&#39;m still not totally convinced that the kinesthetic\nsense is something we sense &quot;directly.&quot;  It&#39;s really\nhard to separate what&#39;s being sensed directly as\nsignals from our nerves and what our minds compose\nfrom these more primitive input signals.  Having a\ncontinuous memory of where our limbs are positioned\nprobably helps.\n\nWhen I or someone else puts my arms in different\npositions, I really can&#39;t tell how I know where my\narms are  (if that makes sense).  Is that information\njust being constructed in my mind from a bunch of\nsignals coming from my nerves?  I guess we probably\nhave hierarchies of neural modules that automatically\nabstract all kinds of functions, so it&#39;s hard to tell\nwhat&#39;s really going on.\n\nI guess I&#39;m thinking aloud too much, and I&#39;m certainly\nnot an expert on this.  What does anyone else think?\n\nTyler\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
