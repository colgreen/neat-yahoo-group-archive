I&#39;m David D&#39;Ambrosio, one of Dr. Stanley&#39;s\nstu=\r\ndents and I will be presenting a paper on CPPNs and HyperNEAT at\nthis year&#39;=\r\ns GECCO.  The paper is avialble here\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?opti=\r\non=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#dambrosio.gecco07\n\nI&#39;ve be=\r\nen pretty busy lately (grad school would be great it it weren&#39;t\nfor all the=\r\n classes) so I haven&#39;t had a chance to read through all the\nresponses yet, =\r\nbut overall they seem both supportive and informative.\n Anyways, I just wan=\r\nted to let everyone know that I will also be\nreleasing my source code in th=\r\ne near future.  The core HyperNEAT is in\nC# and built on top of Colin Green=\r\n&#39;s excellent SharpNEAT package.  \n\nI also noticed that Stephen Waits mentio=\r\nned a bit about visualizing\nthe hypercubes produced by the CPPNs.  I have a=\r\nctually come up with an\nintuitive and meaningful way of doing this and I pl=\r\nan on releasing\nthis as well.  This is also in C# but it should be able to =\r\ninteract\nwith any genome files from SharpNEAT, ANJI, or any other type of\ng=\r\nenome file that needs support.\n\nAs the others have said, if you have any qu=\r\nestion I&#39;d be happy to try\nand answer them.\n\nDavid\n\n\n"}}
