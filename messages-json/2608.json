It addresses the big \n&gt; assumption that symmetry is beneficial to a lot of cognitive \n&gt; processing.  By making symmetry explicity, I think it allows you to \n&gt; get to the heart of the matter.  It also does a really good job of \n&gt; fitting NEAT into the context of your cognitive science program.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a little unsure if I&#39;m covering all the possibilities properly \n&gt; in my mind. I think a few activation examples might help make it \n&gt; concrete.  For example, what if I made a network with just one \n&gt; symmetric input and the none asymmetric output?  Is that different \n&gt; from a network with an asymmetric input and an asymmetric output?  \n&gt; How do you read a symmetric output?  Is it interpreted as two \n&gt; outputs?\n&gt; \n&gt; Something that would be a great debugging tool is a visualization \n&gt; that shows the translation from the specially-encoded network to its \n&gt; normal graph (i.e. two side-by-side pictures).  In the second \n&gt; picture, &quot;symmetric&quot; pieces would now be (I assume) pairs of \n&gt; structures, one on each side.  Then maybe you could see the \n&gt; contralateral crossing visually, among other things.  But it would \n&gt; also make sure that the system means what you think it means.\n&gt; \n&gt; I once had a different idea about symmetry in NEAT, which was to \n&gt; take a NEAT network that is &quot;one-sided&quot; and reflect the entire \n&gt; network (with the reflection having all new historical markings), \n&gt; and then concatenate the two networks (the original and its \n&gt; reflection) into one genome.  By &quot;one-sided&quot; I mean those irritating \n&gt; bots that tend to only do thing by turning way way or another (or \n&gt; things like that).   What I was wondering is whether once NEAT \n&gt; discovers a one-sided strategy, it can be fairly easily duplicated \n&gt; on the other side with little difficulty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course I can see problems there.  It could create an \n&gt; unintentional opponent process that causes the network to fight with \n&gt; itself in some cases and end up doing nothing.  The failure cases \n&gt; can be subtle and hard to visualize, but I think that&#39;s true in your \n&gt; approach as well, which is why I bring this up.  What I&#39;m wondering \n&gt; is whether what you&#39;re doing better avoids the potentially sloppy ad-\n&gt; hocness of my idea.  I&#39;m also wondering what you see as the pluses \n&gt; and minuses in general, since you&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot \n&gt; recently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have more thoughts but hearing more about \n&gt; activating your networks would give me a better intuitive \n&gt; understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Just thought I&#39;d post an update on what Philip and I have been \n&gt; working on\n&gt;&gt; lately, to get some feedback, but also to help me articulate the\n&gt;&gt; implementation and some of the ideas behind it (since I&#39;m in grad \n&gt; school now\n&gt;&gt; and will have to explain this to a lot of people soon anyway).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have to do a first year project as part of the PhD program I&#39;m \n&gt; in right\n&gt;&gt; now, Cognitive Science at the University of Louisiana at \n&gt; Lafayette.  I\n&gt;&gt; decided to focus on a particular aspect of indirect encoding in \n&gt; the context\n&gt;&gt; of NEAT, specifically bilateral symmetry.  Most animals exhibit a \n&gt; high\n&gt;&gt; degree of bilateral symmetry in their overall body plan, as well \n&gt; as their\n&gt;&gt; neural systems.  It seemed like a logical starting point for a \n&gt; foray into\n&gt;&gt; indirect encoding.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m interested in several theoretical questions:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To what extent is bilateral symmetry in an agent&#39;s neural system \n&gt; necessary?\n&gt;&gt; And for what kinds of cognitive tasks?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To what extent is contralateral connectivity (connections which \n&gt; cross the\n&gt;&gt; midline of the neural system, i.e., are interhemispheric) \n&gt; important, as\n&gt;&gt; opposed to ipsilateral connectivity (connections which do not \n&gt; cross the\n&gt;&gt; midline, i.e., are intrahemispheric)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To try to start answering some of these questions, we extended \n&gt; NEAT in the\n&gt;&gt; following ways:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Before, the experimenter would declare the number of input and \n&gt; output units.\n&gt;&gt; Now there are four parameters:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; inputs.asymmetrical\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; outputs.asymetrical\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; inputs.symmetrical\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; outputs.symmetrical\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll use XOR as a running example.  To simply run XOR as before, \n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; experimenter would declare 3 asymmetrical inputs (for the two data \n&gt; inputs\n&gt;&gt; and the bias), and one asymmetrical output.  Per the NEAT \n&gt; paradigm, they\n&gt;&gt; would initially be fully-connected with feedforward connections, \n&gt; all with\n&gt;&gt; different random initial weights.  Everything else would work as \n&gt; before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To run XOR under a symmetrical condition, the experimenter would \n&gt; declare 1\n&gt;&gt; asymmetrical input (bias), 1 symmetrical input (for the 2 data \n&gt; inputs), and\n&gt;&gt; 1 asymetrical output. Let&#39;s call the asymmetrical input, neuron 0, \n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; symmetrical neuron 1, and the output neuron 2.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When constructing the initial network, all asymmetrical neurons \n&gt; will default\n&gt;&gt; to the &quot;left&quot; of the network.  So the network now has a spatial \n&gt; structure,\n&gt;&gt; whereas before it was arbitrary.  So neuron 0 is on on the left, \n&gt; along with\n&gt;&gt; output neuron 2.  When reading the chromosome and building the \n&gt; network,\n&gt;&gt; neuron 1 is split into 2 copies: 1left and 1right, with identical\n&gt;&gt; attributes.  The initial network is still fully-connected feed-\n&gt; forward, but\n&gt;&gt; there are only 2 connection genes in the intial chromosome: \n&gt; asymmetrical\n&gt;&gt; connection 4 (which connects 0 and 2), and symmetrical connection \n&gt; 5 (which\n&gt;&gt; connects 1 and 2).  When constructed, connection 4 makes a single \n&gt; connection\n&gt;&gt; with a random initial weight.  Connection 5 makes 2 connections, \n&gt; 5left and\n&gt;&gt; 5right, connecting 1left to 2 and 1right to 2, and both \n&gt; connections have the\n&gt;&gt; same random initial weight.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hope that makes sense.  There are lots of ways to encode bilateral \n&gt; symmetry.\n&gt;&gt; We chose to make symmetry an attribute of individual genes.  It \n&gt; may not be\n&gt;&gt; the most biologically-inspired encoding, but we felt that it fit \n&gt; best within\n&gt;&gt; the context of NEAT and allowed for good control over the amount \n&gt; and type of\n&gt;&gt; symmetry in the evolving population.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So all neuron genes now have a symmetry attribute, and all \n&gt; connections have\n&gt;&gt; 2 new attributes, symmetry and lateralization (indicating whether \n&gt; they cross\n&gt;&gt; the midline or not).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, about mutations:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Perturb connection weight remains unchanged, although if it \n&gt; affects a\n&gt;&gt; symmetrical connection, it will affect both copies created in the \n&gt; resulting\n&gt;&gt; network.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Add neuron basically works the same as well.  If a neuron is \n&gt; mutated on top\n&gt;&gt; of an existing asymmetrical connection, it creates the new neuron \n&gt; and the\n&gt;&gt; new incoming and outgoing connections per NEAT, and all 3 new \n&gt; features are\n&gt;&gt; asymmetric.  If the mutation occurs on top of a symmetric \n&gt; connection, the\n&gt;&gt; new resulting neurons and connections will have the same symmetry \n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; lateralization attributes of the connection gene they replaced.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Add connection mutations are fairly complicated.  There are 2 new \n&gt; mutation\n&gt;&gt; rates, which control the amount of symmetry and lateralization in \n&gt; the newly\n&gt;&gt; mutated connections.  First, the add connection mutation rate \n&gt; determines how\n&gt;&gt; many new connections should be added.  Of those, the symmetry rate\n&gt;&gt; determines the ratio that are symmetric.  Of each of those two \n&gt; ratios, the\n&gt;&gt; lateralization rate determines the ratio of new \n&gt; contralateral/ipsilateral\n&gt;&gt; connections.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; New connections between 2 asymmetrical neurons are asymmetrical.  \n&gt; New\n&gt;&gt; connections between an asymmetrical neuron and a symmetrical \n&gt; neuron can\n&gt;&gt; either be asymmetrical or symmetrical.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For a mutation between 2 symmetrical neurons, there are four \n&gt; actual neurons\n&gt;&gt; in the resulting network, and we allow 6 possible types of \n&gt; connectivity to\n&gt;&gt; mutate:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; symmetrical/ipsilateral    ||\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; symmetric/contralateral    X\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; asymmetric/ipsilateral left   |-\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; asymmetric/ipsilateral right   -|\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; asymmetric/contralateral left  /\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; asymmetric/contralateral right  &#92;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So by adjusting the symmetry rate, we can control the amount of \n&gt; symmetry\n&gt;&gt; that evolves among new connections, and by adjusting the \n&gt; lateralization\n&gt;&gt; rate, we can control the amount of connectivity that crosses the \n&gt; midline of\n&gt;&gt; the network.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure there are weaknesses to this encoding scheme (as I&#39;m sure \n&gt; some of\n&gt;&gt; you will point out...please do).  It&#39;s now nearly completely \n&gt; implemented in\n&gt;&gt; ANJI (though there&#39;s still a lot of testing to be done, and we&#39;re \n&gt; not going\n&gt;&gt; to release it yet).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m applying it to an active vision symmetry detection task \n&gt; (discriminating\n&gt;&gt; between sets of symmetrical and asymmetrical letters).  I&#39;ve got \n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; preliminary results, but I&#39;m not particularly confident that \n&gt; everything&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; working the way it&#39;s supposed to.  This testbed is nice, since it \n&gt; involves\n&gt;&gt; both control aspects and pattern processing, so I&#39;m interested to \n&gt; see if\n&gt;&gt; there are qualitative differences in the way symmetrically-encoded \n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; asymmetrically-encoded populations solve the problem (or fail to \n&gt; solve the\n&gt;&gt; problem).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, I hope to present this research at GECCO this summer, but \n&gt; I thought\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;d expose the group to it as well and see what thoughts people \n&gt; might have.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
