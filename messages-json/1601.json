I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve\n&gt;ever read through a newsgroup or mailing list that has such a high\n&gt;signal-to-noise ratio: I&#39;ve learned a tremendous amount just looking\n&gt;over peoples&#39; shoulders. Extracted from Yahoo!, tidied, formatted\n&gt;(8pt, 2 columns) in Word, I still had over 300 pages to work through,\n&gt;hence the delay between joining and introduction - I&#39;ve not been idle!\n&gt;There&#39;s probably a book in there somewhere if someone had the energy\n&gt;to write it...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWow, that&#39;s dedication! I hope you don&#39;t mind if we all start asking you \nquestions on stuff we can&#39;t recall :)\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve played around with various domains over time (XOR, OCR and some\n&gt;simple games) but my most recent area of &quot;research&quot; has taken me back\n&gt;to an old love betting on football matches (that&#39;s soccer to our\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m certainly interested in this, although I would imagine that the \noutcome of sporting events is even more unpredictable than financial \nmarkets. Having said that I see no reason to use the confidence output \ntechnique to pick up on any patterns that do occur, even if they only \noccur rarely. Hopefully the code underlying the fitness functions for \nthese types of experiments will be transferable to different domains \nrelatively easilty, so I see no reason to try investigate a whole range \nof domains.\n\n&gt;non-UK colleagues). My interest has largely been rekindled by the rise\n&gt;and rise of the betting exchanges, where the margin to be overcome is\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHave you looked at spread betting at all? It gets (or has had) bad \npress, but there&#39;s no reason you should loose a lot of money if you&#39;re \ncareful and know what you&#39;re doing. Just so long as you&#39;re not prone to \ncompulsive gambling :)\n\n&gt;I&#39;m currently engaged (in between tasks associated with settling in to\n&gt;a new house) in amusing myself with the consideration of various ways\n&gt;of approaching my problem domain and familiarising myself with\n&gt;existing NEAT implementations, Ken&#39;s &quot;canonical&quot; C++ and Colin&#39;s C# in\n&gt;particular. I expect to &quot;roll my own&quot; code because as a professional\n&gt;developer that&#39;s where much of the fun lies, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m in\n&gt;any hurry.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOK well fire away if you have any questions on the C#.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
