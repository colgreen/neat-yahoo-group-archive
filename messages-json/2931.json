They are very sensitive to things like the range \nof time constan=\r\nts, range of weights, etc.  If any of those are \nwrong, it can easily tip i=\r\nt away from oscillation-type behaviprs \ninto more likely hitting stable sta=\r\ntes.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t \nremember the exact right values for this stuf=\r\nf to get it to work \nwell with a regular sigmoid, but it appears that for s=\r\nome reason \ntanh is less sensitive to specific parameters.  Is it because t=\r\nanh \nis signed and the exponential sigmoid is unsigned?  I&#39;m not sure.  \nBu=\r\nt if you want it to work with the exponential, you can probably \nget it wor=\r\nking by playing around:  make a small network by hand and \ntweak its values=\r\n by hand while watching animations of what it does \nuntil you get oscillati=\r\nons.  You might find that for example changes \nof 0.01 are more effective t=\r\nhan changes of 0.1.  Things like that \ntake trial and error to figure out.\n=\r\n\nI am sure also that Tyler Streeter would be happy to answer your \nquestion=\r\ns if you sent him email.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_cherv=\r\nenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am using a CTRN=\r\nN version of rtNEAT, which is an upgraded version \nof \n&gt; Tyler Streeter&#39;s l=\r\neakyNEAT code, combined with the rtNEAT release. \n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that =\r\nthere is no pattern generation at all. I am \nnot \n&gt; sure what is the proble=\r\nm. The neurons use the standard sigmoid \n&gt; activation function, that output=\r\ns in the range of (0 .. 1). The \n&gt; networks are fully interconnected with 1=\r\n0 neurons. They always \n&gt; stabilize at one state and the neurons don&#39;t chan=\r\nge activation as \ntime \n&gt; progresses further. Interesting, when I switch th=\r\ne activation \nfucntion \n&gt; to tanh(), they do generate patterns, like walkin=\r\ng gaits and so \non, but \n&gt; why this does not happen when the function is 1/=\r\n1+exp(-x)?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
