After re-reading over the NEAT\nmaterial I have and checking K.S.&#39;s source code again, nothing seems\nto match up.\n\nSpecifically the publications state that the lowest performing species\nover N generations in age will not be reproduced.  However the code\nuses the any species that has not improved in N generations.\n\nAdditionally, there is written: &quot;In rare cases when the fitness of the\nentire population does not improve for more than 20 generations, only\nthe top two species are allowed to reproduce, refocusing the search\ninto the most promising spaces&quot;.  That is from &quot;Evolving NN through\nAugmenting Topologies&quot;.  In code K.S. simply checks to see if the\nwhole population hasn&#39;t improved in N+5 generations and then takes\nonly allows to reproduce the top 2 species.\n\nSo many different things are being said and being done here, I&#39;m not\nsure who to listen to.  At the moment I am not allowing the 2 worst\nspecies to reproduce if they haven&#39;t improved in N generations.  As\nwell, if the whole population has not improved in N+5 generations then\nI only allow the top 2 species to reproduce.\n\nUnfortunately this is still leading to serious stagnation towards\nlocal minima.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m getting to the\npoint of hitting my head on the brick wall here.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
