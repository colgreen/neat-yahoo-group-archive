My logic being\n&gt; &gt; that I thought matching like innovations is beneficial but costly in\n&gt; &gt; terms of CPU time. So I figured this gives a good balance. However I\n&gt; &gt; just traced a bug whereby evolved networks where seen - by Ken - to have\n&gt; &gt; multiple recurrent connections on a single node. I realise now that this\n&gt; &gt; is a result of crossover between two genomes that contained the same\n&gt; &gt; connection, but with a different innovation ID. To fix this I should\n&gt; &gt; check for duplicate connections within genomes created by crossover,\n&gt; &gt; which erodes some of the performance gain obtained from using technique\n&gt; &gt; (2).\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good point.  How did you handle that case in your\n&gt; implementation, Ken?  If 2 chromosomes crossover where each has a\n&gt; connection between nodes 1 and 2, btu where the connections have\n&gt; different innovation IDs, do you sum the genotype weights to create\n&gt; the phenotype connection weight?  Or average them?  Or discard one?\n\nI would imagine you&#39;d follow the general NEAT methodology of having\nthe topology from the dominant individual take precedence.  So if you\nhad a connection between the same two nodes in two individuals that\nwere crossing over, you&#39;d discard the connection from the less fit\nindividual and use the connection and associated weight from the\nfitter individual.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
