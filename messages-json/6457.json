The goal of this workshop is to provide an updated perspective of this field, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and to consider different areas of applicability for such techniques including design for engineering and modelling for biology. Moreover, this workshop will encourage collaboration between researchers already present at GECCO, or in other similar venues such as the Artificial Life conferences, which are not always present at the same conference.\n\n## When/where? ##\n\nJuly 11-15, 2015, at GECCO 2015, the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Madrid, Spain.\n\n## Important dates ##\n\nSubmission deadline: April 17th, 2015 (see Paper Submission Section) \nAuthors notification: April 25th, 2015 \nCamera-ready submission: May 4th, 2015\n\n## Paper Submission ##\n\nWe accept papers of two types:\n- Presentation of on-going work\n- Summary of already published research (e.g. journal or conference papers -- please include citation to the original work)\n\nEach accepted paper will be presented orally at the workshop. Authors should follow the same format as is used for the GECCO conference papers, and submissions should be maximum 2 pages. Please refer to http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2015/papers.html for details. Paper should be submitted exclusively in PDF format to evocobots@....\n\n## Workshop agenda ##\n\nThree keynote talks (40 min each, invitation-based) -- to be announced\nPresentations of on-going or published work (20 min each, submission-based - see above)\n\n"}}
