What I&#39;m suggesting is\ntaking an objective fn where typically we evaluate each genome in\nisolation from all others, but now we adjust the fitness of each\ngenome based on this other information - the genome&#39;s position in some\n2D space and the density of other genomes in around that position.\n\n\n&gt; You wrote, population density should adjust the fitness. This means, two\n&gt; species cannot share the same area (or don&#39;t you use the concept of &gt;&gt;species)!?\n\nFor this research direction forget about species and go back to just a\npopulation of genomes with no other structure to the population - and\nnow assign each genome a 2D coord.\n\n\n&gt; Do you aim to model something in analogy to nature? Then, I don&#39;t get the link. In\n&gt; natural systems (which is based on co-evolution and open-ended) the location on\n&gt; earth determines what is the predator &gt; and what is the prey,\n\nThat&#39;s largely (or entirely) due to environmental variation. If I&#39;m\nswimming in the sea there are sharks, if I&#39;m on an American mountain\nthen lookout for mountain lions, and if I&#39;m in temperate region forest\nthen beware of bears. We can certainly develop the idea to have\nvariation in the geo-space, but for now I&#39;m proposing that the space\nbe homogeneous.\n\nFit genomes will spawn offspring nearby, which will result in a\ncluster of similar genomes, but one that is self limiting in size\nbecause genomes in that cluster will have their fitness adjusted down\nas the cluster density increases - so there&#39;s maybe a natural balance\nthere. The good genomes will probably start to colonise the whole\ngeo-space over time, which potentially puts us back where we started -\na population dominated by a single &#39;best&#39; strategy and no variation.\nOn the other hand it may lead to some interesting dynamics and mixing\nof genomes, e.g. two strong colonies of genomes (deriving their\nfitness from two distinct strategies) would probably mix (interbreed)\nat the boundary between the colonies.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
