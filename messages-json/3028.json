We are \ncalling this method HyperNEAT, which stands for Hypercub=\r\ne-based \nNEAT.  With HyperNEAT, we have been able to produce working neural=\r\n \nnetworks with millions of connections.\n\nBecause we have just recently had=\r\n two publications on this method \naccepted at GECCO-2007, we can finally di=\r\nsclose our work and share \nit with others.  The publications are available =\r\non \nthe &quot;Publications&quot; page at http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu \n\nThey are also avai=\r\nlable through my homepage \nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications (u=\r\nnder Publications, \nConference and Symposium Papers), or directly at the fo=\r\nllowing \naddress, which I am sure yahoo is going to mangle:\n\nhttp://eplex.c=\r\ns.ucf.edu/index.php?\noption=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28\n\n=\r\nThe two papers, which present separate experiments are:\n\n&quot;Generating Large-=\r\nScale Neural Networks Through Discovering \nGeometric Regularities&quot; by Jason=\r\n J. Gauci and Kenneth O. Stanley\n\nand \n\n&quot;A Novel Generative Encoding for Ex=\r\nploiting Neural Network Sensor \nand Output Geometry&quot; by David B. D&#39;Ambrosio=\r\n and Kenneth O. Stanley\n\nDavid D&#39;Ambriosio and Jason Gauci are both Ph.D. s=\r\ntudents in the \nEPlex lab who did an enormous amount of work to make this p=\r\nossible.\n\nHyperNEAT is based on a surprisingly simple principle: Connectivi=\r\nty \npatterns are actually no different from spatial patterns in a higher-\nd=\r\nimensional space.  In other words, a 2-dimensional connectivity \npattern is=\r\n the same thing as a 4-dimensional spatial pattern.  (The \ntechnical term i=\r\ns that they are &quot;isomorphic.&quot;)  Therefore, if we \nsimply produce spatial pa=\r\ntterns within a 4D hypercube instead of a \n2D plane, they can be mapped dir=\r\nectly to connectivity patterns with \nall the nice properties that we have s=\r\neen from CPPNs.  Thus, they \nrequire no special &quot;image recognition&quot; type tr=\r\nicks.  The mapping is \nperfectly isomorphic.  We are calling these 4D CPPNs=\r\n &quot;connective \nCPPNs&quot; since they are interpreted as connectivity patterns.\n\n=\r\nThis insight yields a handful of unprecedented capabilities.  For \nexample,=\r\n with connective CPPNs, you can recreate the same solution \nnetwork at a di=\r\nfferent resolution without further evolution!  You \ncan also place inputs a=\r\nnd outputs in meaningful geometric \nconfigurations that HyperNEAT can explo=\r\nit for symmetries and \nregularities.  \n\nIn any case, I am excited about thi=\r\ns new advance and these papers \nare a first step in exploring the new appro=\r\nach.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
