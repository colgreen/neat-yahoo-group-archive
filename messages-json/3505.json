It is definitely \na \nvery co=\r\nol to experiment with it.  Of course with advanced images that \nwere evolve=\r\nd intentionally, if it captured them right, it would be a \nquite powerful c=\r\napability.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hi Ken, all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice job on the picbreeder site BTW. Y&#39;kno=\r\nw I was just wondering \nwhat\n&gt; results you would get if you tried to evolve=\r\n towards a given image, \nsay by\n&gt; trying to mimimize the error with respect=\r\n to the target image&#39;s \npixels. Once\n&gt; you have a good representation you m=\r\night get some wierd distortions \nby\n&gt; adjusting the inputs to the network. =\r\nI imagine this would look \nrealy \ncool if\n&gt; you could see an image adjustin=\r\ng in real time as you tweaked the \ninputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
