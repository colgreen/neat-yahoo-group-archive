There&#39;s been a lot of talk recently about novelty search\nversus objective search, and maybe mixtures of the two. I myself\ntalked about how in the natural world organisms are separated in both\nbehavioural space (i.e. novel behaviour is less likely to compete for\nthe same resources as existing behaviours) but also geographical\nspace, and I think that geographical space is a key factor that is\nmissing from NEAT based search currently, and possibly EC as a whole,\nwith the caveat there may be other research groups with work in that\narea that I&#39;m unaware of.\n\nMy current plan is to focus on this geographical space idea for this\niteration because it is the simplest to implement. Dealing with\nbehavioural space is potentially more complicated because how to\ncompare behaviour varies across problem domains and how you identify\nthe key factors to compare is probably a non-trivial problem. I want\nto try and tackle this at some point, but I&#39;m also keen to explore the\ngeo-space idea.\n\nWhat does this all mean in practical terms?\n\nSharpNEAT is a kit of parts that allows you to swap in replacement\nparts such as an alternative genetic representation and/or associated\ngenetic operators (recombination, mutation, etc) with minimal impact\non other parts in the kit (in principle anyway). I&#39;m proposing to\nprovide an alternative evolution algorithm class that replaces NEAT&#39;s\ngenome based speciation (which clusters genomes into K clusters in\ngenetic space), with a geographical space alternative (I&#39;ll call it\ngeo-space for short).\n\nThe idea is that we have some cartesian/euclidean space (probably a\nsquare 2D space initially to keep the code simple, but 3D or &#39;globe&#39;\nspace (2-sphere) are reasonable alternatives). The seed genomes are\neach assigned a random coord in the geo-space and this will be fixed\nfor the life of that genome. So we are basically adding a physical\nattribute to the genome such that our population members are probably\nbetter referred to as organisms (or agents or population members).\nI&#39;ll use &#39;agent&#39; because it&#39;s easier to type :)\n\nAgent fitness is now adjusted by population density at the agent&#39;s\ngeo-location, this allows really bad agents to survive so long as they\nare in a sparse region of geo-space, thus allowing for some diversity\nof the genome pool.\n\nReproduction - I haven&#39;t put much thought into this but the two\noptions I see are to create offspring agents near to their parent(s)\nversus randomly scattered. Probably some &#39;dispersion&#39; variable will\ndefine the amount of scattering with 0 being atop of the parent (or\nbetween the two?) and 1 being totally random. (Question: Is e.g. seed\nscattering in nature gaussian?). Clearly if agent&#39;s are spawned near\ntheir parent&#39;s we would expect to see clusters of agent&#39;s with similar\nbehaviour, and that clustering will increase population density and\ntherefore lower the fitness of agent&#39;s in that cluster. So there is a\nform of fitness sharing going on, but as I say, I haven&#39;t really\nthought through the implications and dynamics of that. But it would be\ninteresting to set up, play with and observe what happens.\n\nFactoring in behavioural space considerations should be possible at a\nlater date, e.g. fitness at a geo-location is not adjusted down if an\nagent has novel behaviour compared to other agent&#39;s at that\ngeo-location.\n\nAs per usual - any thoughts and feedback are welcome.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
