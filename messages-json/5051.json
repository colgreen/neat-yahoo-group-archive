EC is a learning\n&gt;&gt; technique by which a population of individual agents adapt\n&gt;&gt; according to the selection pressures exerted by an\n&gt;&gt; environment; MASS seeks to understand how to coordinate the\n&gt;&gt; actions of a population of (possibly\n&gt;&gt; selfish) autonomous agents that share an environment so that\n&gt;&gt; some outcome is achieved. Both EC and MASS have top-down and\n&gt;&gt; bottom-up features. For example, some aspects of multi-agent\n&gt;&gt; system engineering (e.g., mechanism design) are concerned\n&gt;&gt; with how top-down structure can constrain or influence\n&gt;&gt; individual decisions. Similarly, most work in EC is concerned\n&gt;&gt; with how to engineer selective pressures to drive the\n&gt;&gt; evolution of individual behavior towards some desired goal.\n&gt;&gt; Multi-agent simulation (also called agent-based modeling)\n&gt;&gt; addresses the bottom-up issue of how collective behavior\n&gt;&gt; emerges from individual action.\n&gt;&gt; Likewise, the study of evolutionary dynamics within EC (for example in\n&gt;&gt; coevolution) often considers how population-level phenomena\n&gt;&gt; emerge from individual-level interactions. Thus, at a high\n&gt;&gt; level, we may view EC and MASS as examining and utilizing\n&gt;&gt; analogous processes. It is therefore natural to consider how\n&gt;&gt; knowledge gained within EC may be relevant to MASS, and vice\n&gt;&gt; versa; indeed, applications and techniques from one field\n&gt;&gt; have often made use of technologies and algorithms from the\n&gt;&gt; other field.\n&gt;&gt; Studying EC and MASS in combination is warranted and has the\n&gt;&gt; potential to contribute to both fields.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The goal of this workshop is to facilitate the examination\n&gt;&gt; and development of techniques at the intersection of\n&gt;&gt; evolutionary computation and multi-agent systems and simulation.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The ECoMASS workshop welcomes original submissions in the\n&gt;&gt; theory and practice on all aspects of Evolutionary\n&gt;&gt; Computation and Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation, which\n&gt;&gt; include (but are not limited to) the following topics and themes:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; -Multi-agent systems and agent-based models utilizing\n&gt;&gt; evolutionary computation -Optimization of multi-agent systems\n&gt;&gt; and agent-based models using evolutionary computation\n&gt;&gt; -Evolutionary computation models which rely not on explicit\n&gt;&gt; fitness functions but rather implicit fitness functions\n&gt;&gt; defined by the relationship to other individuals / agents\n&gt;&gt; -Applications utilizing MASS and EC in combination\n&gt;&gt; -Biological agent-based models (usually called individual-based\n&gt;&gt; models) involving evolution\n&gt;&gt; -Evolution of cooperation and altruism\n&gt;&gt; -Genotypic representation of the complex phenotypic\n&gt;&gt; strategies of MASS -Evolutionary learning within MASS\n&gt;&gt; (including Baldwinian learning and phenotypic plasticity)\n&gt;&gt; -Emergence and feedbacks -Open-ended strategy spaces and\n&gt;&gt; evolution -Adaptive individuals within evolving populations\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; *Paper Submission\n&gt;&gt; See http://www.cscs.umich.edu/ecomass/ for details.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; *Important Dates\n&gt;&gt; Paper submission deadline: 25 March, 2010 Notification of\n&gt;&gt; acceptance: 1 April, 2010 Final Papers Due: 13 April, 2010\n&gt;&gt; Registration Deadline: 19 April, 2010\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; *Workshop Chairs:\n&gt;&gt; Bill Rand, University of Maryland\n&gt;&gt; Rick Riolo, University of Michigan\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt;&gt; Modelling mailing list\n&gt;&gt; Modelling@...\n&gt;&gt; http://www.swarm.org/mailman/listinfo/modelling\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
