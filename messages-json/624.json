Firstly we draw neurons with &quot;pure&quot; 1-st level (all connections to the input one). Then (a bit further from inputs) only those neurons that have connections to the 0 and 1 layer only and so on.\n\nAnd what was your method?\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Philip Tucker&quot; &lt;tucker0171@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; We did an implementation similar to this.  We&#39;ve also doen it with shortest\n&gt; distance to output layer.  For the purpose of determining a best guess at\n&gt; which links should be recurrent it has served us well.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the purpose of determinnig a graphical layout, it&#39;s not quite as good.\n&gt; Since we&#39;re using shortest distance, nodes tend to get &quot;pulled&quot; toward the\n&gt; input or output layer.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
