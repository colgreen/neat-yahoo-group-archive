There&#39;s no particular \nreason for doing it that way or not doing it that way; it&#39;s \nbasically just historical precedent.  But since the point is to be \nable to compare methods with a benchmark, it doesn&#39;t really matter \nhow you&#39;re running the experiment as long as it&#39;s consistent.\n\nThat said, people have thought about the brittleness of starting \nfrom a single point, and in fact that&#39;s one of the reason&#39;s for \nGruau&#39;s special fitness function.  Also you will notice in reports \non DPBNV starting with Gruau, they usually report a generalization \nperformance measure, which is taken by starting the champion network \nat literally hundreds of different start states and seeing if it can \nbalance for over 1000 time steps from each state.  Usually \ncontrollers that do well on Gruau&#39;s fitness function can handle at \naround 1/3 to 1/2 of all the spectrum of 625 different possible \nstarting states, which is not bad considering it wasn&#39;t trained on \nthem directly.  In fact, it shows the controllers are often not so \nbrittle after all.\n\nNow, a separate line of research concerns how to make the task \nincreasingly difficult.  And requiring more generalization is one \nway to go.  But it&#39;s not really that attractive since it mean a lot \nmore computation dedicated to testing from all those start states.  \nInstead, most researchers who have looked for harder DBP tasks have \nchanged the relative lengths of the poles.  Changing them to become \ncloser in length makes the task harder and harder.  In fact, it \nbecomes extremely hard very quickly to the point where only \nincremental evolution can handle it.  (If you want to go down this \nroute, Faustino Gomez from our group published on a principled way \nof changing pole lengths...I&#39;d look for that paper, rather than just \ntry arbitrary pole lengths since most ratios will be next to \nimpossible)\n\nAnyway, I hope that gives some perspective on your questions.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Okay, so we&#39;ve implemented Double Pole Balancing and DPB with no\n&gt; velocities input into the network.  And ANJI is solving them fine,\n&gt; with both Ken&#39;s mutation operators and with ours.  We haven&#39;t quite\n&gt; implemented the No Wiggling penalty, but are about to do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; One question we had was this: Were all experiments with double pole\n&gt; balancing started from the same, deterministic state?  That is, \nwith\n&gt; one pole at 0 degrees (upright), and the other leaning at exactly 1\n&gt; degree?\n&gt; \n&gt; Since we hadn&#39;t implemented the domain before, we hadn&#39;t really\n&gt; thought about it much, but wouldn&#39;t it be fairly easy to scale up \nthe\n&gt; difficulty of this domain by randomizing the initial starting\n&gt; conditions?  That is, have the poles start at random initial\n&gt; positions?\n&gt; \n&gt; If we&#39;re evolving a controller, this thing would be extremely \nbrittle\n&gt; if it only learned to balance poles from a single starting \nposition,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; By extension, the initial cart position could also be randomized.  \nThe\n&gt; controllers could be given a small amount of noise.  There could \nalso\n&gt; be &quot;wind&quot; or some other sort of noise added to the system to scale \nup\n&gt; difficulty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is anyone aware of this being done with any of the previous pole\n&gt; balancing work?  If not, why?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n"}}
