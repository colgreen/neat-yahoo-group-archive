Then I take one individual, \n&gt;mutate it to pieces and use it to see the side population.  I then \n&gt;run the side population until it stalls (the main population appears \n&gt;frozen at its last value during this phase).  I then merge the two \n&gt;populations (by one of several experimental techniques) overwrite the \n&gt;main population with the result, scrap the side-population and return \n&gt;to the initial phase (exolving main).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nErr yeh I&#39;m still with you. I notice the side species fitness does \nindeed exceed the main species on some occasions and on other occasions \nthe merging of the two causes an increase. In other words it seems to be \nworking. So are you going to try with multiple side species next?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;I am also inclined to say that the system as I have it has a net \n&gt;drive towards smaller individuals (look at the line of the purple and \n&gt;blue curves from 2.5 MCycles upwards) and that the individuals (i) \n&gt;grow in size when it is discovering additions that make then fitter, \n&gt;but, (ii) then slowly squeezes their existing fitness into a smaller \n&gt;genomes when they are not finding any obvious additions.\n&gt;\n&gt;There&#39;s a solid mathematical reason why the net drive is downwards, \n&gt;which I am aching to explain to you all.  Does anybody want to know?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOh go on then. I&#39;ll be watching CSI but I am listening, honest ;)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
