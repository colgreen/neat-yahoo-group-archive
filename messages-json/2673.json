When the validation scores=\r\n start\n&gt;going down, you stop evolution.\n\nI am using SharpNEAT and am new to=\r\n all this so I would appreciate a\nlittle more detail.\n\nI have implemented t=\r\nwo interface, IExperiment and INetworkEvaluator.\nNeither interface appears =\r\nto have any concept of a generation or of a\nchampion. It looks to me like I=\r\n might want/need to subclass\nSingleFilePopulationEvaluator so that I can ov=\r\nerride\nEvaluatePopulation. I can then call the superclass&#39; EvaluatePopulati=\r\non\nand after it completes do my validation testing on the\nEvolutionAlgorith=\r\nm&#39;s BestGenome. I was then thinking\nthat once I wished to stop evolution, I=\r\n could set the\nEvolutionAlgorithm SearchCompleted boolean. Finally, I can m=\r\nodify\nSharpNeatGui&#39;s SearchThread to check the ea&#39;s SearchCompleted flag so=\r\n\nthat the thread will stop.\n\nAm I on the right track here? How have others =\r\nhandled cross-validation\nand prevention of over-fitting?\n\nThanks,\n\nPeter\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
