Thanks a lot.\n\nThe MSc programme in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems does sound\nbrilliant, from both the website and from the quick email\ncorrespondance I&#39;ve had with Julian.  That being said, I am on my way\nto visit it next week to get a thorough impression of the place and\nits people before I make any decisions.  I&#39;ll let everyone know what I\nthink of it when I get back to Toronto.\n\nProgramme site:\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/publications/pgrad2005/computing.html#5034\n\nJulian&#39;s site:\nhttp://julian.togelius.com/\n\nI realized that I never asked Julian specifically if they focus on\nTWEANN approaches to NE, but judging by the work that he, personally,\nhas done, it would appear so.  Regardless, I&#39;ll soon find out.\n\nIan, you mentioned that there should be lots of places to go for\nguidance on the matter; to be honest, I haven&#39;t found any better than\nthe discussions that have been going on right here.  Many Universities\noffer advice on how to apply for THEIR programmes, but that&#39;s all. \nThe advice being offered here is pure gold to me.  phd-survey.org has\nsome general advice but it&#39;s REALLY general.\n\nExamining the Universities in British Columbia (EA headquarters), I\nsee a lot of AI possibilities but nothing that mentions anything close\nto NE.  Shame.\n\nI&#39;m glad to see your confidence in UCF, Ken.  If it works out the way\nyou want it to, then I&#39;d be very excited by the notion of doing a PhD\nthere eventually.  Of course, I don&#39;t know how competitive it is\napplying to UCF.\n\nThanks again,\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
