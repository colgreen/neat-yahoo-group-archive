It seems like you&#39;ve been making some progress \ntowards figuring out what works and I hope to be on top of it \neventually.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;From: Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;But this is getting into the realms of the obsessive :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve got good reason to be obsessive.  Let me give you an example:\n&gt; \n&gt; Before I can evaluate my networks, I&#39;ve got to calculate the \nexpected \n&gt; results.  I do that once and only once, and then refer back to \nthose \n&gt; calculations for each network.  That saves me from doing it 999 \ntimes more \n&gt; than I need to, which is good.\n&gt; \n&gt; My inputs are converted from pixel values to a &#39;relative \nintensity&#39; in the \n&gt; range of +/- 1.  So, naturally, I want the expected output to be \nin that \n&gt; same range.  So, after I shrink the 144x144 to 9x9, I convert the \n9x9 into \n&gt; the +/-1 range, and use those same parameters to shrink the \noriginal inputs. \n&gt;   Then, I have to calculate the expected results, which requires \ntaking the \n&gt; average of every possible square area within the 144x144 region.  \nThere are \n&gt; 1,005,720 such regions.  Calculating those expected results was \ntaking \n&gt; around 10 minutes...  I could have just settled for that.  But I \ndidn&#39;t...\n&gt; \n&gt; I decided to keep things as integers until the last possible \nstep.  Leave \n&gt; the pixels as 16 bit unsigned integers.  To take the average, add \nthem up \n&gt; and store the result in a 32 bit long.  Convert to a double when \ndividing by \n&gt; the number of pixels that make up the area.  Then convert that \naverage to \n&gt; the +/-1 range.  WOW!  It did the same amount of work in about 10 \nseconds!  \n&gt; Talk about orders of magnitude!\n&gt; \n&gt; The next thing to attack is the time it takes to generate the \nevaluation \n&gt; code.  Generating code that evaluates 500 networks on a single \nsample takes \n&gt; on average of about one minute for my laptop.  It takes less than \n5 minutes \n&gt; to compile and execute that code.  So a savings there is \nsignificant, and \n&gt; there is definitely inefficiencies in the process.  So next on my \nagenda is \n&gt; to speed up that process.  I&#39;m contemplating writing code which \noutputs code \n&gt; that is specific to a topology, and then calling that generated \ncode with a \n&gt; specific network in order to output the optimized activation \nfunction.  \n&gt; That&#39;ll be a debugging nightmare! But cool, in a morbid way...\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;m glad I&#39;m obsessive, I have saved myself boatloads of time \nin this \n&gt; experiment!\n\n\n"}}
