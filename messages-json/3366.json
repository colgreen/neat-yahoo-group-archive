Feedback can be achieved as adding more inputs that represent the\n&gt; ACTUAL joint angles at the moment.\n\nDon&#39;t forget joint rotation too.  Particularly at the hips, shoulders, \nand ankles.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re simulation is doing this at these \njoints right now, but I think it&#39;s pretty important.\n\nAs an example of the rotational motions I&#39;m talking about:\n\n* hips:  stand, feet together.  squat until knees are bent 90 degrees. \nmove knees apart and together\n* ankles:  sit, legs extended above ground, feet together.  move toes \napart and together with heels touching.\n* shoulders:  lock elbow at 90 degrees.  place elbow on table.  move \nhand up and down while keeping elbow in one place.  like arm wrestling.\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
