My point was only that CPPNs can abstract away\n&gt;the temporal unfolding and local interaction that are usually\n&gt;associated with development.\n\nOne point worth clarifying.  The &quot;temporal unfolding&quot; that is \ndevelopment and the &quot;temporal unfolding&quot; that is learning are \ncompletely different processes.  _Except_ in humans where the biology \ndoes only a partial job of wiring the brain in the womb, and then \nspends over a decade finishing the job via experiential/experimental \ninteraction with the environment.  This is a strategy for being \ngeneralists.  We don&#39;t have enough instinct to fully form ourselves.\n\nThere is also a known phenomenon for the transfer of learned \nbehaviour into genetic programming: the Baldwin effect.  Worth \nreading up on if you haven&#39;t already encountered it.\n\n         Ian \n\n\n"}}
