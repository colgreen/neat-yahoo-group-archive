This most likely had a \ndetrimental effect on searching and in fact my update of yesterday&#39;s \ngraph indicates that this might have been the case:\n\nhttp://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/enablebitgraph2.png\n\nThe two experimetents (with and without the enable bit) are now much \nmore in-line with each other, whereas enablebitgraph.png showed slightly \nbetter results without the enable bit. I had put this difference down to \nnot avergaing over enough runs, which could still be the case, but the \nnew graph does show four very well matched lines.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\nColin Green wrote:\n\n&gt;Maybe some of you will find this of interest...\n&gt;\n&gt;As a precursor to my phased searching work I thought about simplfying \n&gt;the NEAT genome ever so slightly by eliminating the &#39;enable&#39; flag on a \n&gt;connection gene. I just ran a experiment using my new OCR code and, \n&gt;although it&#39;s not the most thorough scientific analysis it does seem to \n&gt;hint that the enable bit isn&#39;t all that beneficial.\n&gt;\n&gt;I ran the same search 10 times, 5 with the enable bit, 5 without. Each \n&gt;run was 1000 generations. I have produced a graph that shows the average \n&gt;of the runs here:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/enablebitgraph.png\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
