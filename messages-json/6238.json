I did a little bit \nmore work towards allowing the CPPNs to decide their joints and degrees \nof freedom in my ALife paper from 2012: \nhttp://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jeauerba/publications/auerbach_bongard_alife_2012.pdf \n\nI think there is a lot of value in finding appropriate ways to do that, \nbut I returned to this simpler system here in order to focus on the \nmorphological complexity.\n\nI do plan on continuing this work, but am also involved in a new project \nhere at EPFL at the moment, so have had to put this stuff on the back \nburner for the time being.  I do, at some point, hope to find a way to \nintegrate it with the other things I am working on here.  Without giving \naway too much of future plans I will say that am excited to have access \nto some really high quality additive manufacturing facilities and hope \nto be bringing these or other similarly complex morphologies into the \nreal world.\n\nBest regards,\nJosh\n\nOn 01/07/2014 04:43 AM, kstanley@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Josh, yes congratulations, I agree with Jeff that it&#39;s nice to see \n&gt; this work in PLoS Comp. Bio.  As you know I really like the unique way \n&gt; you use CPPNs to represent these bodies.  Their nuanced shapes are \n&gt; different from the conventional &quot;connected blobs&quot; type of virtual \n&gt; creature and to me feel more natural, so I feel like there&#39;s potential \n&gt; for more progress in this direction, though I understand simulating \n&gt; these creatures is pretty expensive.  Do you have any plans to develop \n&gt; more creatures of this type, maybe giving their CPPNs somehow the \n&gt; ability to decide their own joints and degrees of freedom?  The arrow \n&gt; of complexity is also a really interesting topic and it&#39;s nice to see \n&gt; it elevated in this kind of journal.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n-- \nDr. Joshua E.
