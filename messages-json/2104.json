Our fitness is measured by the Bankroll of each player\nafter 600 hands in Texas Hold&#39;em (Limit).\n\nThe players begin with 10.000$. We don&#39;t want to punish players that\nhaven&#39;t lost money, but those that have should be assigned some sort\nof error. Our own idea is to make it 10.000$ - Bankroll. Is that an OK\nerror measure?\n\n2) What effect does the &quot;champion&quot; setting (set to true) have on an\norganism during epoch ?\n\n3)Some times the NEAT engine writes &quot;performing delta coding&quot;. Is this\na bad thing?\n\n\nOur initial test results currently shows that the best individual have\npicked up that it is important for them to play aggressively when they\nhave one hole card that is a part of the current best hand. This is\nnot at all a good player but it doesn&#39;t take the players more than\nabout 10 generations to pick up on this feature. Our hope is that\nafter a couple of hundred generations we will have a players that is a\nlittle bit stronger.\n\nThe players are playing against a fixed opponent that always call.\nThis way they should be forced only to play the good hands.\n\nOut goal is to continue training but switch the opponent once the\nplayers show signs that they can play convincingly better than this\nopponent.\n\n\nBest regards\n\nLars\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On 7/14/05, lars_v_hansen &lt;lvh@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My name is Lars and I am a student at Department of Computer Science,\n&gt; &gt; University of Aarhus, Denmark. I am writing my Master Thesis with my\n&gt; &gt; good friend Mathias who is also a student here ;-). As you probably\n&gt; &gt; already noticed this thesis is about poker (Texas Hold&#39;em) and GAs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Lars...welcome to the group. :)  Yes, we are very interested in\n&gt; applying neuroevolution to Poker in general and Texas Hold &#39;Em in\n&gt; particular.  It&#39;s nice to hear you&#39;re working on this problem, and\n&gt; that you&#39;re already familiar with the work of the Alberta group.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We just recently discovered NEAT (sadly :-() \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When is your thesis due? ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Before I comment on the rest of your mail, I have a few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) You don&#39;t say how well your evolved networks perform...how are you\n&gt; evaluating the performance of your resulting networks?  Are you\n&gt; playing them on the Poki server?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Is the domain limit/pot limit/no limit?  Maybe you mentioned this\n&gt; and I missed it, but it&#39;s a pretty big deal.  I think it would be much\n&gt; more difficult to gauge fitness as the amount to be able to bet in a\n&gt; single turn increases.  Limit is probably the least noisy of the three\n&gt; variations.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Do your networks use recurrent connections?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) So do your networks always play 10 opponents?  If players are\n&gt; eliminated at a table (they run out of money), do the networks play\n&gt; 9-way hands?  Do the winners eventually play heads up?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and yesterday we finished\n&gt; &gt; a new player based on jNEAT. The player ANN takes the following\n&gt; &gt; inputs:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1 pot / bet\n&gt; \n&gt; This seems fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1 position\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this relative or absolute?  If this input is just an integer value\n&gt; between 0 and 9 that may not be as useful as knowing it&#39;s distance to\n&gt; the button each hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9 player actions this round\n&gt; \n&gt; So all the actions are taken and then input to the network on its\nturn?  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9 player passive / aggressive index\n&gt; &gt; 9 player tight / loose index\n&gt; \n&gt; How are you getting these values?  Are you using other networks for\n&gt; opponent modeling, as Billings et al are doing?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2 suit count (4 or 5 siuted cards)\n&gt; &gt; 2 connector count (4 or 5 connected cards)\n&gt; &gt; 4 card associations (pair, two pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind)\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, the problem I see with this representation right off the bat is\n&gt; that there is no information about the order/strength of the cards,\n&gt; unless I&#39;m not understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would the network receive the same input for a pair of jacks as for a\n&gt; pair of 2&#39;s?  If so, the representation is seriously flawed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, connectivity is important, but again rank is also important. \n&gt; A/2/3/4 is much worse than 8/9/10/J not only because it&#39;s lower but\n&gt; because the latter is open-ended (a straight can be made with a 7 or\n&gt; Q, while for the first one a straight can only be made with a 5).\n&gt; \n&gt; Philip and I have talked over the representation of Hold Em a bit.  I\n&gt; don&#39;t have any easy answers, but I do think you need at least one\n&gt; input for the strength of your best combination.  So an input for\n&gt; pairs might tell the network it has a pair, and another input would\n&gt; scale between 0 and 1 to indicate the strength (and you might want to\n&gt; skew this toward higher pairs).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2 hole cards in use ( are we using 1 or 2 hole cards in our hand?)\n&gt; &gt; 3 game stage (FLOP/TURN/RIVER)\n&gt; \n&gt; These seem all right, though possibly superflous.  Others may have\nthoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The outputs from the ANN are straight forward:\n&gt; &gt; 3 neurons:\n&gt; &gt; FOLD | CALL | BET/RAISE\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep...sounds good. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The 50 players play against each other and a pot-odds-player\n&gt; &gt; (PO-player) - five of each at each table. They play 600 hands but not\n&gt; &gt; at one table only - we mix them between the tables five times such\n&gt; &gt; that they get to meet different individuals from the entire\n&gt; &gt; population.\n&gt; \n&gt; How often do you switch them?  It often takes a while for someone to\n&gt; get a read on another player, and in this case they are playing full\n&gt; tables.  If the individual networks are having to assess the\n&gt; tightness/looseness aggressiveness/passiveness of the players at their\n&gt; table, this is a big burden on the network, and if they are switching\n&gt; opponents every 10 hands or so, it is even more difficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason we have the PO-players at each table is for the players to\n&gt; &gt; be forced to learn faster and play tighter from the very beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, this makes sense.  And personally I would not remove this player\n&gt; from your evolutionary runs.  It makes sense to have a hand-coded\n&gt; standard in among the other players as a baseline.  It&#39;s performance\n&gt; across generations should give you a decent idea of how your algorithm\n&gt; is progressing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; A major concern is the fitness: We have talked about it for hours and\n&gt; &gt; days but we always come back to the cash of the player. If we cannot\n&gt; &gt; apply expert knowledge - we cannot think of anything else than the\n&gt; &gt; amount earned after x hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, that is the standard of fitness for real Poker players, isn&#39;t\nit? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I would think this would make the most sense as the primary fitness\n&gt; value.  Another alternative would be to simply play an elimination\n&gt; tournament and then assign fitness based on the place each network\n&gt; finished.  It depends on whether you want to evolve networks geared\n&gt; more toward tournament play or come-and-go style Poker.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Is it possible to achieve results with a 45-&gt;N-&gt;3 ANN in NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t see why not.  Have you achieved any results?  I think you\n&gt; could reduce your input space for opponent actions, especially since\n&gt; in cases where the network is playing heads up, 24 of your inputs\n&gt; aren&#39;t even going to be used each hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Any general comments regarding the population size for the above\n&gt; &gt; ANN?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would think the general consensus would be that large populations\n&gt; are better for difficult problems, and in the case of NEAT tolerate\n&gt; higher mutation rates and more diversity.  But it kind of depends on\n&gt; your computational resources, doesn&#39;t it?  How long does a run with\n&gt; 600 individuals take?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, you mention Fogel and his evolved Checkers player.  Those runs\n&gt; only had a population of 30.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Any parameters we should put in a particular favourable setting?\n&gt; \n&gt; Parameters like mutation rates and speciation variables seem pretty\n&gt; idiosyncratic to me.  Again, if it&#39;s a large population, it&#39;s more\n&gt; tolerant to higher mutation rates and greater speciation, but I do\n&gt; think there&#39;s a certain amount of hand tuning of these parameters that\n&gt; you just can&#39;t get around.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear someone working on this.  We&#39;re definitely\n&gt; interested in hearing more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n"}}
