For example, do you start each trial from a random\n&gt;&gt;position (either the prey or the predator)?  Or is something\n&gt;&gt;randomized about the prey? \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nA quick update on the prey capture work. I&#39;ve been fine tuning the prey \ncapture test cases and I do now have some nice results, particularly \nevolved agent&#39;s that are able to remember where the prey was last seen \nbefore it moved out of sensor range - and then move in that direction. I \nstill need to extend the new tests further - to evolve agents that can \nchase moving prey - following that and some code tidying up I&#39;ll put the \nnew code on the web site and post another message.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
