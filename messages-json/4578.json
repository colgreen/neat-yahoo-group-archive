I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\nperform on this domain.  The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\nevolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\nyear&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n\n     http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n\nWith regard to the discussion about generating oscillations, I used\nneither sine wave as input nor leaky integrators.  Instead, neural\nnetwork controllers with standard sigmoid neurons were modularized to\nbehave as coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems).  As\nexplained in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\npost, such oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\nperiodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits.  They are easy to\nevolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\nand trot for quadrupeds.\n\nWith only minor adjustments to your setup, you can convert your\nsubstrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillators.  In fact,\nyou would get a configuration similar to my modular controllers by\nrestricting the network inputs to just the joint angles and producing\nangular velocities instead of angles as outputs.  HyperNEAT would then\nhave to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand.  I think that\nwould be an interesting experiment to run, and if successful would\neliminate the need to specify the sine input.  BTW, did you find that\nthe other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary to\nevolve good gaits in your experiments?\n\nVinod\n\n"}}
