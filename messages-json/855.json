In every\n&gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; &gt; except the very simplest, NEAT takes up a tiny\n&gt; &gt; fraction of\n&gt; &gt; computation time.  It&#39;s the evaluations that are\n&gt; &gt; expensive.\n&gt;\n&gt;Each evaluation requires the operation (or\n&gt;computation) of the neural net itself, i.e., giving it\n&gt;some inputs, and progagating the signals through the\n&gt;network.  When you studied the time required for\n&gt;evaluation did you separate it into time for\n&gt;problem-specific code vs. neural net computation code?\n&gt;  For a complex network with many connections that\n&gt;might be substantial.\n\nHow would that distinction be helpful?
