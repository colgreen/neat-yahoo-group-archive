So we wouldn&#39;t even\n&gt; have to worry about weights only the &quot;activation functions&quot; ie: operators. We are likely to\n&gt; produce more structure, but that is what NEAT is good at.\n&gt;\n&gt; This makes the search space MUCH smaller,\n\nIf I&#39;m following you right I think you just end up having to evolve\nlarger networks to represent equivalent functionality (to a normal\nANN). So you end up searching a /different/ fitness landscape* of the\nsame complexity, not a landscape with less complexity.\n\n* More correctly a different version/transformation of the same landscape.\n\n\n&gt; People in this group have more experience with NN&#39;s so I am just looking for a feasibility\n&gt; assessment before I start programing it and possibly wasting my time.\n\nOf course potentially I&#39;ve completely missed the point :)\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
