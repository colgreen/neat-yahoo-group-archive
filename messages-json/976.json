So no, there is currently no bias *against* neutral\n&gt;mutations.  That&#39;s what I believe Colin and Ken are arguing for, the\n&gt;allowance for a lot of structure that&#39;s neither directly helping or\n&gt;hurting fitness in the present, but that may be coopted later in the\n&gt;run to increase fitness.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you want to see this in action, just run NEAT on a very simple\n&gt;problem and crank up the mutation rates.  It will still solve the\n&gt;problem, but you will have networks that are much larger than they\n&gt;really need to be.\n\nAh...I see.  Well, isn&#39;t the solution to that to change the fitness \nfunction?\n\nGive each network both a &#39;fitness&#39; and a &#39;complexity&#39; ranking.  When \ndeciding on the ranking of specimens, sort first on fitness, descending, and \nthen on complexity, ascending.  Thus, if two networks have the same fitness, \nthe smaller one wins.\n\nIf the fitness function was very granular, like to 10 decimal places, it&#39;s \nunlikely that the complexity factor would ever come into play.  But if you \nround the fitness (or scale it), then two networks that are &#39;close&#39; to one \nanother would then be folded into &#39;the same&#39; and the smaller one wins.  And \nyou could make that &#39;scaling&#39; be dynamic...like 10% of the range between \naverage and best within a species.  If the average fitness is 10, the best \nis 12, then the range between average and best is 2.  10% of that is 0.2.  \nSo, any two that are within 0.2 of each other would (kinda) get the same \nfitness score.  And that percentage could be a tunable parameter so we can \nfind the best range for where an &#39;advantage&#39; is a CLEAR advantage and is \nmore important than complexity.\n\nThis does mean that if a mutation adds complexity without adding a clear \nadvantage, that one is selected against.  However, that&#39;s not entirely fair. \n  So...instead of only keeping ONE &#39;elite&#39; member, have a minimum of 2 but \ncalculated at 10% (or so) of the offspring for the species.  That allows \nthose good but not clearly so networks to survive long enough to try and get \nbetter before being pruned back out.\n\nWhat do you think?  Think that would do the trick?\n\n\n\n"}}
