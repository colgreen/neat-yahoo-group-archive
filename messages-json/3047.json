There&#39;s a \nfew basic techniques:\n\n1) think of a cube, think of it as red.  Think of another cube, think \nof it as green.  Put them at the same location.  These two cubes can, \nif you like form the end-stops of a 4D space, where the 4th \ncoordinate is colour interpolated smoothly from red to green.  All we \nneed to do is have a rule that things which are different colours are \nseparated...\n\n2) or, the net of a hypercube can be visualised as a small cube \ninside a large cube and with each corner of the inner cube connected \nto the matching corner of the outer cube.  Now tell yourself that the \nsmaller cube isn&#39;t smaller, it&#39;s further away...  Each trapezoid \n(e.g. wormed by one face from each cube and the 4 joining lines) is \nreally also a cube (but angled away from you)...\n\nAnd so on.  I&#39;m sure web-resources exist if you search for them.\n\nMust go now, I&#39;m due in the 17th century three feet ago.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n"}}
