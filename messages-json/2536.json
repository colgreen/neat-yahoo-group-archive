What I am referring to are simply the \nmessages and =\r\nnothing else (for example this post is a message).  I \nused the word &quot;archi=\r\nves&quot; because the messages go back from the \npresent day all the way to a co=\r\nuple years ago when the group \nstarted.

Before that, you had to join the group in order to view the \nmessages.\n=\r\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that we go back to the original system, \nwhere you=\r\n have to join to see the messages, because being able to \nsee them without =\r\njoining essentially discourages joining and hence \nposting.\n\nken\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.&quot; \n&lt;jim_oflaherty_jr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Help me out.

Thus, nobody \nhas \n&gt; &gt; sai=\r\nd anything to spark discussion.  I&#39;ve seen in the past where \n&gt; &gt; something=\r\n happens (or doesn&#39;t happen) and that causes stagnation \nand \n&gt; &gt; quiet.  T=\r\nhen later, the noise level starts to rise again, but \nonly \n&gt; &gt; when somebo=\r\ndy actually starts talking about something that \nenough \n&gt; &gt; people are int=\r\nerested in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, I&#39;m guessing that people don&#39;t join inactive=\r\n lists, \nso the \n&gt; &gt; fact that the list wasn&#39;t very active may be the real =\r\nreason why \nthe \n&gt; &gt; new people were so greatly reduced.  Here&#39;s an easy wa=\r\ny to find \nout.  \n&gt; &gt; Leave the archives public for now.  But find a way to=\r\n spark \ndiscussion \n&gt; &gt; that gets all the long-time members engaged.  Get t=\r\nhe volume of \n&gt; &gt; messages back up THAT way, and keep it there for a while,=\r\n and \nsee if \n&gt; &gt; new user rate goes up.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- John\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 2/22/06=\r\n, *Kenneth Stanley* &lt;kstanley@... \n&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:kstanley@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;     Hi Everyone,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     I&#39;ve spoken to Derek James (who runs this gr=\r\noup) about this \nissue,\n&gt; &gt;     and he suggested I bring it up for discussi=\r\non.  So please \nfeel free\n&gt; &gt;     to share your thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     I hav=\r\ne come to the conclusion that opening the archives to \npublic\n&gt; &gt;     viewi=\r\nng was probably not the best idea in retrospect.  There \nis one\n&gt; &gt;     goo=\r\nd motivation for doing so, which is that it makes them\n&gt; &gt;     potentially =\r\nsearchable from outside engines.  However, on \nbalance I\n&gt; &gt;     believe it=\r\n is now apparent after we have run this experiment \nfor a\n&gt; &gt;     couple mo=\r\nnths that this benefit is outweighed by the \ndownsides:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     In part=\r\nicular I think opening the archives has significantly\n&gt; &gt;     deterred non-=\r\nmembers from joining the group.  The surface-\nlevel\n&gt; &gt;     effect of this =\r\ndeterrence is simply that the group grows less\n&gt; &gt;     quickly.  However, t=\r\nhere is a more concerning secondary \neffect,\n&gt; &gt;     which is that when you=\r\n do not join, you are less likely to \npost even\n&gt; &gt;     if you have somethi=\r\nng worth contributing, because it would \nrequire\n&gt; &gt;     joining to do so. =\r\n Therefore, the net effect is stagnant \ngrowth and\n&gt; &gt;     a general squelc=\r\nhing of broader discussion and fresh new \ninput from\n&gt; &gt;     outside.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;     I also believe there is a more subtle tertiary effect on \nexisting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;     members, which is that now that you don&#39;t need to log into \nyahoo to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     view the latest messages, you are more likely not to post \nsomethi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt;     that you think of offhand, because that would require \nlogging i=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;     In the past, since you had to log in in order to view the \narchi=\r\nves,\n&gt; &gt;     you were already logged in once ideas popped into your head, \n=\r\nbut now\n&gt; &gt;     you are likely not logged in, and therefore it isn&#39;t worth =\r\n\ngoing to\n&gt; &gt;     the trouble just to make a casual point.  I know that I h=\r\nave \nfound\n&gt; &gt;     even myself falling into that kind of pattern and not \np=\r\nosting since\n&gt; &gt;     I wasn&#39;t logged in.  Again, the net effect is muting \n=\r\ndiscussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     The statistics appear to back up this theory.  Of c=\r\nourse, \nstatistics\n&gt; &gt;     prove correlation and not causality, but the arg=\r\nument for \ncausality\n&gt; &gt;     is strenghened by the precise alignment betwee=\r\nn the time \nthat we\n&gt; &gt;     opened the archives and the time that membershi=\r\np growth and \nposting\n&gt; &gt;     suddenly plummeted.  Here are the numbers:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     New Members by Month\n&gt; &gt;     --------------------\n&gt; &gt;     Oct: 11=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     Nov: 14\n&gt; &gt;     Dec: 5\n&gt; &gt;     Jan: 4\n&gt; &gt;     Feb: 3 (so far)\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;     New Posts by Month\n&gt; &gt;     ------------------\n&gt; &gt;     Oct: 76\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n   Nov: 77\n&gt; &gt;     Dec: 25\n&gt; &gt;     Jan: 38\n&gt; &gt;     Feb: 22 (so far)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n     Both statistics show a sudden and dramatic drop right at \nDecember,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;     right about when we opened the archives.  That seems to \nsupport the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;     idea that doing so had a negative effect on overall \nparticipation.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;     Of course there are other possible explanations such as the \nnatur=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt;     ebb and flow of discourse or just a general downward trend \nas p=\r\neople\n&gt; &gt;     change interests, but the coincidental correlation in timing =\r\n\nmakes\n&gt; &gt;     it likely that even if those are true, they probably are not=\r\n \nthe\n&gt; &gt;     only contributing factors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     My view is that this g=\r\nroup is first and foremost a \ndiscussion group,\n&gt; &gt;     and only secondaril=\r\ny a reference site.  It&#39;s nice to be able \nto\n&gt; &gt;     search for old discus=\r\nison, but what we&#39;re really here for is \nto\n&gt; &gt;     interact with each othe=\r\nr in the present.  Therefore, it \ndoesn&#39;t make\n&gt; &gt;     sense to sacrifice t=\r\nhe interactive quality for a slightly \nmore\n&gt; &gt;     convenient reference, a=\r\nt least in my opinion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     So I am recommending we close the archiv=\r\nes to the public \nagain and\n&gt; &gt;     return to our old system.  However, sin=\r\nce we have been \ngenuinely a\n&gt; &gt;     thriving community for several years n=\r\now (just look at most \nyahoo\n&gt; &gt;     groups and we are almost unmatched in =\r\nconsistent quality \ncontent and\n&gt; &gt;     friendly discussion), it is only ri=\r\nght to let everyone have \ntheir\n&gt; &gt;     two cents before such a decision is=\r\n made, so we can decide \ntogether\n&gt; &gt;     rather than make a unilateral dec=\r\nision.  Derek will \nultimately\n&gt; &gt;     decide what to do based on your inpu=\r\nt.  If no one has input, \nit will\n&gt; &gt;     just be a decision between myself=\r\n and Derek, which is fine, \nbut this\n&gt; &gt;     is your opportunity to partici=\r\npate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Yahoo!
