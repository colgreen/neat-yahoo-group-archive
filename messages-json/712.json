I am on a windows\n&gt; &gt;system, and would like some help in getting all the correct packages\n&gt; &gt;and version etc. in order to compile and run the NEAT experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a working version of the NEAT source which will compile under\nCygwin\n&gt; using an ordinary make, if you&#39;d like me to send it to you. I think\nyou just\n&gt; need to get hold of the latest SWIG. (The usual Cygwin setup program\nwill\n&gt; handle this for you.) I have, however, removed all of the graphics code,\n&gt; simply because I didn&#39;t really need it and it just simplified the\nporting\n&gt; process. If you do need NEAT&#39;s graphics output, you&#39;ll have to sort\nthat out\n&gt; yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Darren\n\n\n"}}
