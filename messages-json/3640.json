Th=\r\ne result is usually a higher fitness vector than the \noriginal organism out=\r\nput vector fitness.\n\nOne interpretation is to view the implementation as a =\r\ntransform of \nthe solution space (i.e. finding the best starting point whic=\r\nh leads \nto the best fitness). Pairing the local optimal fitness to the \nor=\r\nganism rather than the fitness associated with the organism output \nvector.=\r\n\n\nAnother possibility is to re-write the organism genome such that the \nloc=\r\nal optimal vector is it&#39;s new output, and assigning the local \noptimal fitn=\r\ness to the new substituted organism. But the problems of \nspecies membershi=\r\np and gene markers are lost.\n\nThus the possibility of embedding the local o=\r\nptimal genome as the \nrecessive gene of the original organism, would allow =\r\nthe species \nmembership and gene markers to remain. At least until the curr=\r\nent \npopulation has been evaluated.\n\nHave you heard of any work involving r=\r\ne-writing the organism genome \nduring the evaluation phase?\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Not that I know of...maybe Ken knows of NEAT implementations of \nrecess=\r\nive genes.\n&gt; \n&gt; At one point with ANJI, we discussed going down this route.=\r\n Since\n&gt; genes in NEAT are traditionally monoploid (having only one set of\n=\r\n&gt; genes), but we thought about doing a diploid representation (two \nsets\n&gt; =\r\nof genes, one from each parent). You could then use \ndominant/recessive\n&gt; m=\r\narkers for genes to determine which ones are expressed. You could\n&gt; also ex=\r\nperiment with blending, for example in connection weights,\n&gt; where there is=\r\n neither a recessive nor dominant expression, but some\n&gt; blended function o=\r\nf the two (e.g. an average of the two). And if you\n&gt; wanted to get really w=\r\neird, you could implement polyploidy, where \neach\n&gt; individual has any numb=\r\ner of sets of genes (e.g. each individual \ncould\n&gt; have 10 parents).\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;d be interested to see some data from a direct comparison of an\n&gt; implemen=\r\ntation with and without recessive genes, so if you&#39;re going \nto\n&gt; do it, le=\r\nt us know.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 14, 2007 10:11 AM, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Has there been any work to date on impl=\r\nementing recessive genes \nin a\n&gt; &gt;  NEAT genome?
