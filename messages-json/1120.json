It would \ndefinitely be interesting.  The same goes for trying NEAT with any \nmassively parallel system.  Ultimately it just means more \ngenerations in less time, but it might make a difference in orders \nof magnitude, which could substantially change the natureo of what \nevolves.\n\nI&#39;m not sure to what your second question about solving &quot;what sort \nof problems have been proposed&quot; is referring?

Then, as long as we are \nclear\n&gt; &gt; about which space we are talking about, there will be no \nambiguity\n&gt; &gt; about the meaning of a dimension.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In general, all of my arguments about the need to evolve variable\n&gt; &gt; length genomes are about *genotypic* space.  Of course, with \nNEAT in\n&gt; &gt; its current form, this is a trivial statement, since the \ndimensions of\n&gt; &gt; genotype and phenotype are the same.  However, in a future NEAT\n&gt; &gt; wherein the genotype goes through an indirect mapping to \nphenotype,\n&gt; &gt; the dimensions of the genotype may be much fewer than the \nphenotype.\n&gt; &gt; Neverthelsss, all the arguments still apply: we still wish to \nminimize\n&gt; &gt; the number of dimensions in the genome.  It&#39;s just that now they \nare\n&gt; &gt; going to be mapped to somethin different in the phenotype.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What this analysis suggests, and what I ultimately believe is\n&gt; &gt; happening in this field, is that there are two parallel yet\n&gt; &gt; complementary directions of research that should ultimately \nconverge:\n&gt; &gt; 1) The idea of complexification through starting minimally and\n&gt; &gt; protection of innovation inside NEAT is a generic methodology for\n&gt; &gt; evolving in any genotypic space, and 2) an (extremely) clever \nindirect\n&gt; &gt; mapping would allow very compact representations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1 with 2 means efficient search plus efficient representation.  \nThus\n&gt; &gt; they go together very neatly.  You may think for a moment that 2\n&gt; &gt; precludes 1, since perhaps if the mapping is sufficiently \npowerful the\n&gt; &gt; number of dimensions necessary in the genome will be so low that \n1\n&gt; &gt; will become irrelevant.  However, that is not likely to be the \ncase.\n&gt; &gt; Even in indirect mappings we are likely to need many hundreds or\n&gt; &gt; thousands of genes, even though those genes may be reused.  Note \nhuman\n&gt; &gt; DNA, with 30,000 genes.  These 30,000 genes are reused in such \namazing\n&gt; &gt; proportions that they somehow map to 100 trillion connections in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; human brain.  Yet even with this brilliant reduction, 30,000 is \nstill\n&gt; &gt; a lot of dimensions, and still is unlikely to be optimized \nthrough\n&gt; &gt; direct search in the genotype space of 30,000 dimensions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, I believe the field should head towards NEAT-style\n&gt; &gt; evolution of indiretly encoded genomes.  I don&#39;t know if you saw \nwhen\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned our paper, &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny,&quot; \nbut it\n&gt; &gt; is a large review of this area that you may be interested in:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:alife03\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree that modularity is a big deal in evolution, and it should\n&gt; &gt; definitely be at the forefront of future researh.  However, \nsometimes\n&gt; &gt; the way we think about modularity may be misleading since we are\n&gt; &gt; tempted to think as engineers whereas evolution is not like an\n&gt; &gt; engineer.  We have a short paper on this topic as well:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04ws\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I&#39;ve been on holiday so I&#39;m a bit out of daye, this is from\n&gt; &gt; Kenneth&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; long discussion of about a week ago)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great analysis!  Just one small additional thought:  what do we\n&gt; &gt; mean by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;dimensions&quot; in the search space?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Example, suppose we&#39;re doing some vision processing and by \nwhatever\n&gt; &gt; means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we arrive at a good solution.  Then we analyze the solution \nand we\n&gt; &gt; discover\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, although it contains 1000 neurones, they are actually 10\n&gt; &gt; copies(*) of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same 90-neurone structure (say an edge-detector) and a \ncontrol\n&gt; &gt; network\n&gt; &gt; &gt; linking them together(**).  That&#39;s not really anything like as\n&gt; &gt; large a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution-space as it looked before the analysis, for two \nreasons:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (* or 10 &quot;iso-neural&quot; networks, e.g. not copies but \nfunctionally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent....)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (** current systems are unlikely to produce this, see below)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The 10 copies of the edge detector are 10 copies of the \nsame set\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dimensions, and thus a sub-space with 10-fold less dimensions \nthan\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally appeared\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The edge-detector and the control network are (arguably) \nnot in\n&gt; &gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search-space -- they are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.  e.g. the modularity of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; problem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only requires them to respect the same &quot;interface&quot; \nconnections, if\n&gt; &gt; does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; required the edge-detector internal works to be finely tuned to\n&gt; &gt; match the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control network.  Or, to put it another way, any functional \nedge\n&gt; &gt; detector\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would work with any functional control network.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stronger examples of modularity producing orthogonality can \neasily\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dreamed up.  Consider the case of N sub-nets, each evolved to\n&gt; &gt; recognize a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different input class, and a control net which just checks for\n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sub-net is reporting the highest confidence.  There is no\n&gt; &gt; dependency(***)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; between the sub-nets.  (Their internal dependencies are (i) \nreport\n&gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confidence on a connection to the control net, (ii) the input \ndata\n&gt; &gt; format.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (*** dependency is the opposite of orthogonality)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, one cannot expect a homogeneous evolution procedure to\n&gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen to produce orthogonal modules.  You need a modular \nevolution\n&gt; &gt; system:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (slowest) mutate modularity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (medium) try topologies within each module\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (fastest) play with the weights in each module\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - as people have begun to tinker with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ian Badcoe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
