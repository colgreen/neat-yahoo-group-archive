However, if you only put\n&gt; in the head height input, you could end up with some\n&gt; ambulatory sequences that look very odd, but work\n&gt; okay; inverted knee walking, one hand one foot in\n&gt; odd jerky sequences, dog walking using all fours,\n&gt; crab walking using all fours, undulating body lying\n&gt; flat with stationary head, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; My guess is that some aspect of &quot;balance&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;symmetry&quot; and &quot;moderately constrained ranges of\n&gt; motion&quot; (which will be quite challenging to define\n&gt; abstractly) will be desirable if the goal is to\n&gt; eventually have the resultant &quot;figures&quot; have some\n&gt; level of consistency and biological similarity, even\n&gt; to that of a dog, or horse, much less a human\n&gt; \n&gt; If I am understanding your point, you are saying\n&gt; that achieving these ends might be more\n&gt; &quot;efficiently&quot; achieved without having to expand the\n&gt; input set dramatically to introduce all the addition\n&gt; information about muscle contraction and resistance\n&gt; combined with bone elasticity, bone connectivity,\n&gt; etc.\n\nAs you point out, there are many possible ways to\nwalk.  Which one you get will depend on the fitness\nfunction.  If you want to get one which is very close\nto what humans most commonly do, I think you need to\nminimize energy usage by the muscles.  I&#39;m guessing\nthat our most common walking style evolve to minimize\nthis important quantity.  We also have other styles of\nwalking.  For example, if your fitness function is to\nminimize the sound made by the feet striking the\nground, while maintaining some minimum forward speed,\nyou should be able to evolve tip-toeing!\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
