It is indeed good for the community to demonstrate top-notch real-=\r\nworld results.  It&#39;s also interesting that it learns a better real-world ga=\r\nit when trained in simulation as opposed to in the real robot, which could =\r\nbe viewed as counterintuitive.  \n\nCongrats on the publication!\n\nken\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am ver=\r\ny pleased to announce a new paper that shows HyperNEAT evolving a\n&gt; nice ga=\r\nit for a real (physical) robot. On the robot platform we tested on,\n&gt; Hyper=\r\nNEAT outperformed nine other machine learning algorithms from three\n&gt; previ=\r\nous papers to produce the fasted gait yet recorded for this robot. I\n&gt; thin=\r\nk this result is great for our community because it shows that\n&gt; HyperNEAT =\r\ncan perform great--and outperform traditional machine learning\n&gt; algorithms=\r\n--on difficult, real-world engineering problems, instead of just\n&gt; in simul=\r\nation and on diagnostic/toy problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The cite for the paper is:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Lee S, Yosinski J, Glette K, Lipson H, Clune J. 2013.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evolving gait=\r\ns for physical robots with the HyperNEAT generative encoding:\n&gt; the benefit=\r\ns of simulation.
