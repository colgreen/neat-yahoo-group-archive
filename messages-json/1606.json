Do you think it would work \n&gt; out well?\n\nI spent a lot of time thinking about that back when, but I couldn&#39;t come \nup with a representation that seemed powerful enough without the \ncomplexities of infinite recursion and functions with fixed numbers of \narguments. But I think that NEAT contains a lot of cool ideas that would \nbe nice to work into GP.\n\nThere are more problems than evolving neural networks that NEAT could \ntackle, though. I&#39;d like to see evolution of electrical circuits using \nNEAT - I have a feeling that it would beat GP hands down.\n\nThe reason I think that is that the circuit encoding that Koza et al use \nfor their GP runs is similar to Gruaus(?) NN/GP encoding scheme - which \nNEAT beats by an amazing margin. \n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n\n"}}
