That would\n&gt; seem to prevent the problem.\n\nOr allow Level(A) &lt;= Level(B) but perform an explicit test for\nrecurrence in the Level(A) == Level(B) cases.\n\nI was wondering what to do during mating two genomes. I figure we can just do:\n\n1) Take the fittest parent as being the baseline. Let&#39;s say fittest\nparent = A, other parent = B.\n2) For every connection in B that isn&#39;t in A *and* that we wish to\ntransfer to A - we simply consider each of these connections as being\nan add connection mutation on A; and so the same rules apply.\n\nProblem 1. Normally I think NEAT implementations tend bring all\nconnections across from B to A (this was discussed agin recently I\nthink). As soon as you have a scheme that can&#39;t guarantee that *all*\nmismatching connections are transfered from B to A then (I think) we\nhave the possibility of creating a new network with isolated\nstructure. Well, there are some ways around this:\n\n1) Only add connections where the two endpoint node IDs are already\npresent in A. Here though you can still get &#39;dead end&#39;  connectivity.\n2) Perform a clean-up of any dead-end structure after mating.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
