Please keep us posted on what you end\nup doing.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gerbopel&quot; &lt;redcrocodile@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; As a little refresher: This year I wrote a BSc (Hons) dissertation\n&gt; using a modified implementation of WinNEAT to evolve predatory agents\n&gt; for a one-on-one advanced Prey Capture scenario:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/message/1905\n&gt; http://www.redcrocodile.net/source/dissertation.php\n&gt; \n&gt; I had never done any work with neuroevolution or NEAT before and\n&gt; several members of this group were extremely helpful and forthcoming\n&gt; with advice on several occasions when I felt lost and confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; I finally received my results, and I did very well, so I just wanted\n&gt; to thank everyone for their input and for helping me as they did. \n&gt; So... Thanks a lot :)\n&gt; \n&gt; On another note, on the advice of Julian I visited the University of\n&gt; Sussex (in Brighton) and applied to their MSc Evolutionary and\n&gt; Adaptive Systems programme.  I was very impressed with the staff,\n&gt; facilities and the programme itself.  It seems like the logical next\n&gt; step for someone who&#39;s interested in pursuing all the topics that Ken\n&gt; intends to focus on at UCF.  I was accepted several weeks ago and if\n&gt; no fantabulous job opportunities present themselves in the next two\n&gt; months then I&#39;ll probably end up heading off to Brighton in October. \n&gt; This, of course, will all be in preparation for applying to UCF to do\n&gt; a PhD under Ken and his newly formed crew of intellectual giants ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, just wanted to say thanks and let everyone know that their\n&gt; advice has helped me significantly in identifying the directions that\n&gt; I want my academic/professional career to go in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
