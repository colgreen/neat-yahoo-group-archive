Will aim to make package up a new\nSharpNEAT release 7zip soon.\n\nRegarding the walker, any advice on improving the fitness function?\nThis one has stop conditions for when one or both of the feet are too\nhigh, the torso height goes below a threshold or any of the the joint\nangles go beyond 90 degrees. Ideally I&#39;d like to avoid these and make\nit more open ended (and punish for applied torque to get efficient\nwalkers) but the reality was that that didn&#39;t seem to work very well.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
