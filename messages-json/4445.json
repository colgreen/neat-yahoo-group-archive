Is that how the updated code\nwill work\n&gt; too?\n&gt;\n\nYes the update=\r\nd code will work by randomly choosing a gene from one or\nthe other parent w=\r\nhen there are matching genes (i.e. genes with the\nsame historical marking).=\r\n  It will use the proportional probability\nmethod.  \n\nNote that the proport=\r\nional method is slightly different than past\nversions of NEAT.  For example=\r\n, my code would choose one gene\ncompletely randomly regardless of fitness. =\r\n However, for disjoint\ngenes, my code would only include them from the more=\r\n fit parent. \nJason&#39;s has a chance of including it from the less fit one.\n =\r\n\nThese differences however are subtle and should not matter much.  The\nmain=\r\n point is that yes it is multipoint (i.e. uniform) crossover.\n\n(More answer=\r\ns below)\n\n&gt; If so, it strikes me that might really slice up building blocks=\r\n. To take\n&gt; P-NEAT, which is easier to think about, if one neural module ex=\r\nisted\nin a\n&gt; region of the substrate, and a different neural module existed=\r\n in\nthe same\n&gt; region in a parent, instead of possibly grabbing the whole m=\r\nodule\nfrom one\n&gt; parent and sticking it in a new genetic background, crosso=\r\nver would\ntake a\n&gt; few links from the modules of each of the parents and se=\r\ne if they work\n&gt; together. \n&gt; \n&gt; To use a nice metaphor Ken has used before=\r\n, in crossover you want to\nswap a\n&gt; hand for a hand instead of take a hand =\r\nand put it where an ear\nbelongs. This\n&gt; system is at least swapping parts o=\r\nf hands for parts of hands, but it\n&gt; (almost) never allows an *entire* hand=\r\n to be placed on a new body.\nInstead,\n&gt; it sees if taking x% of phenotypic =\r\nslices from one hand works in\ncombination\n&gt; with 100-x% of phenotypic slice=\r\ns from the other hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that makes sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is very simi=\r\nlar to the question in GAs of using uniform (swapping\n&gt; slices of hands) vs=\r\n. one- or two-point crossover (potentially swapping\n&gt; entire hands). \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nA few questions\n&gt; 1) does canonical NEAT use the uniform version of crossov=\r\ner or something\n&gt; like two-point crossover?\n&gt; 2) does the version of HyperN=\r\nEAT you are about to release use uniform or\n&gt; two-point?\n&gt; 3) if the answer=\r\n to 1 is &#39;uniform&#39;, has anyone ever looked at trying\n&gt; something like two-p=\r\noint?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n(1) Yes it does use uniform.  I also included a more tradit=\r\nional\nsinglepoint crossover operator in my version of NEAT, but I never use=\r\n\nit and as far as I know, no one else uses singlepoint crossover with\nNEAT =\r\neither.\n\n2) HyperNEAT C++ will also use uniform.\n\n3) As I mentioned, I did =\r\nimplement singlepoint crossover (is that what\nyou mean by two-point?).  And=\r\n I have tested it.  The reason I stopped\nusing it and turned its probabilit=\r\ny of happening to zero in the\ndistribution is because it does not work as w=\r\nell as uniform types of\ncrossover in NEAT.  However, of course anyone can t=\r\nurn it on again if\nthey wanted to, though I would not recommend it.\n\nThere =\r\nare a couple reasons that singlepoint crossover in NEAT makes\nless sense. F=\r\nirst, my feeling is the building blocks hypothesis\ndoesn&#39;t make as much sen=\r\nse with NEAT, so I don&#39;t think those analogies\nreally work when reasoning a=\r\nbout its crossover operator.  Because\ncrossover almost always happens betwe=\r\nen individuals in the same\nspecies, they do not have totally separate modul=\r\nes representing\ndifferent things.  That is, you are not looking at things l=\r\nike one\norganism with wings and one with arms.  Such exotic difference are\n=\r\nlikely to exist only beyond species boundaries, where NEAT rarely mates.\n\nI=\r\nnstead, mating in NEAT, like in nature, is between individuals with\ngeneral=\r\nly similar genes that represent generally similar &quot;body plans.&quot;\n So when I =\r\ntalk about alignment issues, I am speaking on a\ngene-by-gene basis, not a m=\r\nodule-by-module basis, because generally\ninsofar as there are modules, they=\r\n are shared by those who are mating.\n\nThen what is crossover doing in NEAT?=\r\n  I think it may be more like the\nway they talk about crossover in ES liter=\r\nature, where it can be a kind\nof error-correction mechanism.  If someone ge=\r\nts a bad version of some\ngene, mating can in effect flush it out over time =\r\nby replacing it with\nthe good version from the other parent, which will eve=\r\nntually\nproliferate over the population.  That is why I think crossover onl=\r\ny\nhas a modest effect on performance in NEAT in general.  It&#39;s not a big\nin=\r\nnovator.\n\nIn fact, I am somehat skeptical of the building blocks hypothesis=\r\n with\nrespect to mating in GAs in general, but that is a broader topic. \nWh=\r\nen it comes to NEAT, in any case, it doesn&#39;t really work that way.\n\nSecond,=\r\n genes NEAT genomes are actually ordered from oldest to newest\ngene, which =\r\nmakes singlepoint crossover have a strange meaning:  It\nmeans, in effect, t=\r\nake all the older genes from one parent and all the\nnewer genes from the ot=\r\nher and concatenate them.  Intuitively I don&#39;t\nsee a really useful reason t=\r\no do that.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
