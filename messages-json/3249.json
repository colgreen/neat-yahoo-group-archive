But I just don&#39;t like to dwell on or conclude\n&gt; with nebulous generalities (which is where my newly phrased\n&gt; statement is heading).  For if we ended on the note that &quot;All in\n&gt; all, theoretically, no advantage can be shown to exist over all\n&gt; possible problems even when the user provides prior knwoledge\n&gt; because the user is no more reliable than any given algorithm,&quot; we\n&gt; would have achieved theoretical accuracy yet said essentially\n&gt; nothing.  This is one reason I sometimes dislike discussions on\n&gt; theory since they veer the conversation away from interesting points\n&gt; (i.e. the importance of geometrical relations to neural organization\n&gt; and computation) onto pleasantly precise yet inconsequential\n&gt; generalities.\n\nSo I think your newest statement of HyperNEAT&#39;s advantages is fine,  \nand basically I&#39;m with you until about here. Basically I don&#39;t see  \nthis discussion as having fallen into some kind of black hole of  \nvacuousness,rather, I think now that we&#39;ve gotten a lot of the cruft  \nout of the way, we can actually start building a real theory of why  \nadding geometry as a parameter might actually be beneficial. We&#39;ve  \ngotten to the key point, and now all we have to do is start to  \nexplore the class of problems for which using geometry is useful.  \nFinding this restricted class would allow us to make wonderful  \nstatements like, &quot;HyperNEAT with these geometry settings is better  \nthan NEAT on these domains.&quot; Which no longer falls under NFL because  \nof the restricted problem set. This might prove fruitful, because, as  \nyou pointed out earlier in the discussion, one such restricted class  \nof domains may just happen to include all the real-world problems  \nthat we could ever care about.\n\nOf course doing this is going to be difficult, and would probably  \nrequire someone with more math than I have. But the point is it can  \nbe done, so we can still do empirical research based on the premise  \nthat this statement is correct.\n\nAnyway, here is how I view the verdict so far:\n\n- We agree completely and we&#39;ve argued semantics.\n- Ken: &quot;Theory often distracts us from interesting problems.&quot;\n- Joe: &quot;Theory is cool, but hard.&quot;\n\n-- \nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n\n"}}
