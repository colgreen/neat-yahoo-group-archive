SharpNeat 2 (SN2) is n=\r\nearing release and allows metrics to be plugged and thus compared, there&#39;s =\r\na bit more to it than that and I&#39;m currently writing some documentation to =\r\nexplain how this will work along with some issues to keep in mind, pros and=\r\n cons, etc.\n\nAnyway in writing up this stuff I ended up documenting how the=\r\n original metric works, as described in the original NEAT paper in 2002. No=\r\nw I&#39;ve got a suspicion that this came up long ago but in that paper the dis=\r\ntance is given as:\n\n   d =3D c1*E/N + c2*D/N + c3*W\n\n(E,D are the # of exce=\r\nss and disjoint genes. W is the total weight diff).\n\nN is the number of gen=\r\nes in the longest genome. So the contribution of excess/disjoint genes to d=\r\n is normalized. In Ken&#39;s original code this equation is commented out and r=\r\neplaced with the equivalent of:\n\n   d =3D c1*E + c2*D + c3*W\n\nThis makes mo=\r\nre sense to me, it puts far more emphasis on the difference in topology tha=\r\nn the first version and is sort of related to edit distance and manhattan d=\r\nistance. \n\nFor the record SN1 also uses the latter equation and the other i=\r\nmplementation I checked just now was ANJI2 which uses the former. Not sure =\r\nwhat the implications of this are but I suspect it would have a significant=\r\n effect on speciation with secondary effects from there. Others may wish to=\r\n review the metric in their implementations.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
