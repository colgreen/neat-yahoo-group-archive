It is done\nenough to solve the xor problem, but the mating\nfunctions are still buggy.  The code was written from\nthe papers rather than copying existing source.  It is\nvery fast and efficient, compared to the other code I\nhave seen, but it is also fairly buggy and incomplete.\n \n\nI also made one major deviation, programatically, from\nneat... there are no innovation numbers... at least\nnot directly.  Innovation is still implemented, but\ndone so in a much more efficient manner.  However,\nthis change causes problems in the speciation section.\n Speciation works, but is a bit unstable... sometimes\nthe number of species will sky rocket... this may be a\nbug, or a design flaw (on my part), I&#39;m not yet sure.\n\nIf you have questions specific to coding Mac OS-X with\nx-code in C++ or Objective-C, I can probably help you\nout.\n\n--- Adam Wright &lt;zeno@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m extremely new here. Although I&#39;m actually a bit\n&gt; shocked it took  \n&gt; me as long to find NEAT as it did, as it&#39;s the kind\n&gt; of thing I&#39;ve  \n&gt; been quite interested in for years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather, it took until I came to write a proposal for\n&gt; an honours year  \n&gt; project, when a potential supervisor pointed me\n&gt; towards NEAT after I  \n&gt; spent a few minutes ranting at them about the kind\n&gt; of things I was  \n&gt; interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, now I&#39;m hopefully going to be able to spend\n&gt; my year doing  \n&gt; NEAT related things.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment, I&#39;ve yet to get the original NEAT\n&gt; package to  \n&gt; compile...
