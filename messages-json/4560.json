Tyler\n&gt; Streeter has do=\r\nne such experiments, in fact my own experiments were\n&gt; inspired by his work=\r\n.\n&gt; It is interesting that NEAT performs well even in cases of only one\n&gt; l=\r\neg. Remember that NEAT Hopper demo?\n&gt; So I guess the failure of my experime=\r\nnts is not because it is\n&gt; incredibly hard to evolve good biped walking gai=\r\nt. It is hard indeed,\n&gt; but not that hard :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;2. The sine wave I provid=\r\ned made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt; &gt;gaits.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, inputting just=\r\n a sine wave to the substrate is something clever\n&gt; and I never thought of =\r\nthat. I actually prefer leaky integrators\n&gt; because a CTRNN substrate made =\r\nup by leaky integrators doesn&#39;t need\n&gt; any inputs to make oscillations. It =\r\ndoesn&#39;t need inputs and timing at\n&gt; all. The time constant range in the lea=\r\nky integrator substrate becomes\n&gt; the thing that is as important as the per=\r\niod of the sine wave in your\n&gt; system.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;3. Leaky integrators hurt perfo=\r\nrmance for some reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably. The main reason behind why leaky inte=\r\ngrator-based substrates\n&gt; may perform worse is because not all networks are=\r\n guaranteed to\n&gt; oscillate. Some just stabilize forever. Getting oscillatio=\r\nn with leaky\n&gt; integrator networks is like a small short-term challenge of =\r\nits own.\n&gt; :) Inputting a sine wave explicitly makes the whole thing differ=\r\nent.\n&gt; But there is an interesting observation of leaky integrator substrat=\r\nes\n&gt; evolving with HyperNEAT. The neural activity itself appears\n&gt; distribu=\r\nted in a complexifying geometric pattern. The time constants\n&gt; and biases o=\r\nf the neurons are generated by a 2D/3D spatial CPPN.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;4. I used a PID-b=\r\nased setup, where the target angle was the output of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;neural net (a=\r\nnd not the force to be applied).\n&gt;\n&gt; I used the same :) The outputs are all=\r\n the target joint angle rescaled\n&gt; to min/max angle of the particular joint=\r\n. But I tried applying forces\n&gt; and even direct angular velocities. It is i=\r\nnteresting, it has\n&gt; different dynamics but the PID-based setup is closest =\r\nto reality\n&gt; anyway :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very interesting=\r\n paper! :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It reminds me=\r\n about the experiments I made with HyperNEAT for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controlling biped ro=\r\nbots. Did you try using leaky-integrator based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neurons for the substr=\r\nate?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I found them very useful for generating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oscillation patter=\r\nns. Substrates of leaky integrators with tanh()\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activation functions =\r\nproduce oscillations much easier than others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hm.. I should really tr=\r\ny with robots with 3 legs or more. Getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biped walking with HyperNE=\r\nAT is perhaps too ambitious right now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have thought a lot about y=\r\nour biped experiment. I&#39;d be really\n&gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; in hearing your opinio=\r\nn, and that of anyone else on this list, as to\n&gt; why\n&gt; &gt; your results were =\r\nso different from mine. I found that it did not\n&gt; take that\n&gt; &gt; much tuning=\r\n to get HyperNEAT to evolve really good quadruped gaits.\n&gt; But, as\n&gt; &gt; you =\r\nnote, it was much harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can=\r\n suggest a few hypotheses as to what explains the difference.\n&gt; These are\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; not mutually exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one of\n&gt; t=\r\nhem\n&gt; &gt; explains most of the difference, but instead that they add up to th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; difference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadrupe=\r\nd gaits\n&gt; &gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve perio=\r\ndic\n&gt; gaits.\n&gt; &gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are other d=\r\nifferences of course, such as the inputs and the\n&gt; number of\n&gt; &gt; hidden nod=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Biped g=\r\naits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would be easy =\r\nto test by simply trying a biped with my setup.\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I have s=\r\nome other obligations that will prevent me\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; testing this anytime =\r\nsoon, but if you (or anyone else) would like to\n&gt; give it\n&gt; &gt; a try, that w=\r\nould be cool. I can send you the code I used. One would\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; need to =\r\nchange the quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could\n&gt; try to\n&gt; &gt; mimi=\r\nc my setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do have access to a huge =\r\ncomputing cluster. So, if someone makes\n&gt; the code\n&gt; &gt; modifications to my =\r\nsetup (which I know compiles on our cluster) and\n&gt; sends\n&gt; &gt; them to me, I =\r\ncan do a batch of runs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really =\r\neasy to evolve periodic\n&gt; gaits\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would be an easy test. You cou=\r\nld just plug a sine as an input\n&gt; into your\n&gt; &gt; biped. Note: I found that t=\r\nhe period of the sine wave made a huge\n&gt; &gt; difference. If I made it too fas=\r\nt or too slow, evolution basically\n&gt; ignored\n&gt; &gt; the signal. Within the ran=\r\nge of periods that worked, I found that I\n&gt; got\n&gt; &gt; different types of gait=\r\ns with different period speeds. With slower\n&gt; periods,\n&gt; &gt; I observed cool =\r\ntortoise-like gaits with left-right symmetry. With\n&gt; medium\n&gt; &gt; periods, I =\r\ngot the gaits in the paper. With faster periods, I saw\n&gt; slightly\n&gt; &gt; more =\r\nfrantic versions of the gaits in the paper.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As a side note, I tried=\r\n to evolve the period for a short while and\n&gt; it was a\n&gt; &gt; miserable failur=\r\ne. I&#39;d like to try that again, and would be\n&gt; interested to\n&gt; &gt; hear people=\r\n&#39;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe that\n&gt; attempt\n&gt; &gt; in =\r\nanother email. If someone out there is curious, let me know and\n&gt; I&#39;ll send=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt per=\r\nformance for some reason.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I did not try leaky integrators. Did you =\r\never try your setup without\n&gt; them?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I did not try them because the =\r\ndefault sigmoid neurons worked so\n&gt; well out of\n&gt; &gt; the box that I did not =\r\nexperiment with alternatives. Both Ken\n&gt; (during\n&gt; &gt; preliminary conversati=\r\nons about the paper) and one of the papers&#39;\n&gt; reviewers\n&gt; &gt; asked about lea=\r\nky integrators, so there is clearly some interest out\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; in seeing=\r\n how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt; &gt; we used in the pape=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better? Why?=\r\n I\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; never worked with them, nor do I know that much about them, s=\r\no I\n&gt; don&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that the=\r\ny could have\n&gt; made\n&gt; &gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It would be =\r\ncool to test them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be\n&gt; able to get\n&gt; &gt; to t=\r\nhis in the near future so if someone out there wants to swap\n&gt; them in and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; give it a go, that would be interesting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) I used a PID-based =\r\nsetup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; neural net (and n=\r\not the force to be applied).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I could not figure out whether your se=\r\ntup did this as well. What\n&gt; were the\n&gt; &gt; outputs in your system?\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you think any/all of these hypotheses explain the differenc=\r\ne in\n&gt; results?\n&gt; &gt; What other likely hypothesis am I missing (I am sure th=\r\nere are\n&gt; lots).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks again for checking out the paper,\n&gt; &gt; Jeff\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS.

Tra=\r\nditional evolutionary algorithms can produce\n&gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; controllers, bu=\r\nt require manual decomposition or other problem\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; simplification becau=\r\nse conventionally-used direct encodings have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taking ad=\r\nvantage of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; active\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solut=\r\nions, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the\n&gt;=\r\n problem&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; promising\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks=\r\n, can evolve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without manually decomposing the =\r\nproblem. Analyses suggest that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; successful because=\r\n it employs a generative encoding that can more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easily\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reuse p=\r\nhenotypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuroevolutionary\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which\n&gt; may\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; aid its\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct =\r\nencoding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve im=\r\npressive quadruped gaits\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vastly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Com=\r\nparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are more h=\r\nolistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n coordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results\n&gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems=\r\n\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complex,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jclune=\r\n@\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0015175cba3ec13fbe0462fe8aaf\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nJust a random thought I had about evolving biped gaits: Have you considered=\r\n first evolving a quadruped gait, then switching the fitness function to on=\r\ne that&#39;s similar to the quadruped fitness function but has additional r=\r\newards for spending more time on two legs?

The sine wave I provided made it really =\r\neasy to evolve periodic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;gaits.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nYes, inputting just =\r\na sine wave to the substrate is something clever &lt;br&gt;\nand I never thought o=\r\nf that. I actually prefer leaky integrators &lt;br&gt;\nbecause a CTRNN substrate =\r\nmade up by leaky integrators doesn&#39;t need &lt;br&gt;\nany inputs to make oscil=\r\nlations. It doesn&#39;t need inputs and timing at &lt;br&gt;\nall. The time consta=\r\nnt range in the leaky integrator substrate becomes &lt;br&gt;\nthe thing that is a=\r\ns important as the period of the sine wave in your &lt;br&gt;\nsystem. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;3. Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nProbably=\r\n. The main reason behind why leaky integrator-based substrates &lt;br&gt;\nmay per=\r\nform worse is because not all networks are guaranteed to &lt;br&gt;\noscillate. So=\r\nme just stabilize forever. Getting oscillation with leaky &lt;br&gt;\nintegrator n=\r\networks is like a small short-term challenge of its own. &lt;br&gt;\n:) Inputting =\r\na sine wave explicitly makes the whole thing different. &lt;br&gt;\nBut there is a=\r\nn interesting observation of leaky integrator substrates &lt;br&gt;\nevolving with=\r\n HyperNEAT. The neural activity itself appears &lt;br&gt;\ndistributed in a comple=\r\nxifying geometric pattern. The time constants &lt;br&gt;\nand biases of the neuron=\r\ns are generated by a 2D/3D spatial CPPN. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;Ih2E3d&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;4. I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output of &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;neural net (and not the force to be applied).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\nI used the same :) The outputs are all the target joint angle rescaled &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nto min/max angle of the particular joint. But I tried applying forces &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nand even direct angular velocities. It is interesting, it has &lt;br&gt;\ndiffere=\r\nnt dynamics but the PID-based setup is closest to reality &lt;br&gt;\nanyway :) &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;Wj3C7c&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeter&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/=\r\na&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very intere=\r\nsting paper! :)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It reminds me about the experiments I made with HyperN=\r\nEAT for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; controlling biped robots. Did you try using leaky-int=\r\negrator based&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; neurons for the substrate?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I foun=\r\nd them very useful for generating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; oscillation patterns. Subst=\r\nrates of leaky integrators with tanh()&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; activation functions p=\r\nroduce oscillations much easier than others.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hm.. I should re=\r\nally try with robots with 3 legs or more. Getting&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; biped walki=\r\nng with HyperNEAT is perhaps too ambitious right now.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I =\r\nhave thought a lot about your biped experiment. I&#39;d be really &lt;br&gt;\ninte=\r\nrested&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in hearing your opinion, and that of anyone else on this li=\r\nst, as to &lt;br&gt;\nwhy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; your results were so different from mine. I fou=\r\nnd that it did not &lt;br&gt;\ntake that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; much tuning to get HyperNEAT to =\r\nevolve really good quadruped gaits. &lt;br&gt;\nBut, as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you note, it was =\r\nmuch harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I can s=\r\nuggest a few hypotheses as to what explains the difference. &lt;br&gt;\nThese are&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; not mutually exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one =\r\nof &lt;br&gt;\nthem&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; explains most of the difference, but instead that the=\r\ny add up to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; difference. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are=\r\n harder to evolve than quadruped gaits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided=\r\n made it really easy to evolve periodic &lt;br&gt;\ngaits.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3) Leaky integ=\r\nrators hurt performance for some reason&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setu=\r\np, where the target angle was the output &lt;br&gt;\nof the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; neural net (a=\r\nnd not the force to be applied)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There are other differen=\r\nces of course, such as the inputs and the &lt;br&gt;\nnumber of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hidden no=\r\ndes. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This would be easy to test by simply trying a biped wit=\r\nh my setup.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately, I have some other obligations that will=\r\n prevent me &lt;br&gt;\nfrom&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; testing this anytime soon, but if you (or an=\r\nyone else) would like to &lt;br&gt;\ngive it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a try, that would be cool. I=\r\n can send you the code I used. One would &lt;br&gt;\njust&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; need to change =\r\nthe quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could &lt;br&gt;\ntry to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mim=\r\nic my setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I do =\r\nhave access to a huge computing cluster. So, if someone makes &lt;br&gt;\nthe code=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; modifications to my setup (which I know compiles on our cluster) =\r\nand &lt;br&gt;\nsends&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; them to me, I can do a batch of runs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\ngaits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This would be an easy test. You could just plug=\r\n a sine as an input &lt;br&gt;\ninto your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; biped. Note: I found that the p=\r\neriod of the sine wave made a huge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; difference. If I made it too fa=\r\nst or too slow, evolution basically &lt;br&gt;\nignored&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the signal. Withi=\r\nn the range of periods that worked, I found that I &lt;br&gt;\ngot&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; differ=\r\nent types of gaits with different period speeds. With slower &lt;br&gt;\nperiods,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; I observed cool tortoise-like gaits with left-right symmetry. With=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nmedium&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; periods, I got the gaits in the paper. With faster pe=\r\nriods, I saw &lt;br&gt;\nslightly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more frantic versions of the gaits in t=\r\nhe paper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period f=\r\nor a short while and &lt;br&gt;\nit was a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; miserable failure. I&#39;d like=\r\n to try that again, and would be &lt;br&gt;\ninterested to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hear people&#3=\r\n9;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe that &lt;br&gt;\nattempt=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in another email. If someone out there is curious, let me know an=\r\nd &lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;ll send&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it out sooner rather than later.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; I did not try leaky integrators. Did you ever try your setup without =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nthem?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I did not try them because the default sigmoi=\r\nd neurons worked so &lt;br&gt;\nwell out of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the box that I did not experi=\r\nment with alternatives. Both Ken &lt;br&gt;\n(during&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; preliminary conversa=\r\ntions about the paper) and one of the papers&#39; &lt;br&gt;\nreviewers&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a=\r\nsked about leaky integrators, so there is clearly some interest out &lt;br&gt;\nth=\r\nere&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in seeing how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; we used in the paper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Do most of you feel leaky =\r\nintegrators would perform better? Why? I &lt;br&gt;\nhave&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; never worked wi=\r\nth them, nor do I know that much about them, so I &lt;br&gt;\ndon&#39;t have&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that they could have &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nmade&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It wou=\r\nld be cool to test them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be &lt;br&gt;\nable to=\r\n get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to this in the near future so if someone out there wants to s=\r\nwap &lt;br&gt;\nthem in and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; give it a go, that would be interesting.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the =\r\noutput &lt;br&gt;\nof the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied).&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I could not figure out whether your setup did this as wel=\r\nl. What &lt;br&gt;\nwere the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; outputs in your system?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ---------&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Do you think any/all of these hypotheses explain the diff=\r\nerence in &lt;br&gt;\nresults?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What other likely hypothesis am I missing =\r\n(I am sure there are &lt;br&gt;\nlots).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again for checki=\r\nng out the paper,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jeff&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PS.

To appear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; navigating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rough terrain, but the design of thei=\r\nr control software is both&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; challenging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and =\r\nlaborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce &lt;br&gt;\nthese&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; simplification because conventionally-used direct encodi=\r\nngs have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; trouble&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taking advantage of a prob=\r\nlem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; active&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; solutions, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requires the user to possess a de=\r\nep understanding of the &lt;br&gt;\nproblem&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; structure. Thi=\r\ns paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; promising&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; quadruped gaits&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without manually decomposin=\r\ng the problem. Analyses suggest that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; easily&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also o=\r\nne of the first&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; neuroevolutionary&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; algorithm=\r\ns that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which &lt;br&gt;\nmay&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; aid its&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-N=\r\nEAT, a direct encoding&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; control, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find th=\r\nat HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits &lt;br&gt;\nand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; vastly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses re=\r\nveal that HyperNEAT&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; individuals&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are more ho=\r\nlistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; better=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the r=\r\nesults &lt;br&gt;\nsuggest&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is a pow=\r\nerful algorithm for evolving control systems &lt;br&gt;\nfor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; complex=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clu=\r\nne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan Sta=\r\nte University&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n    \n    &lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color: white; clear:=\r\n both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0015175cba3ec13fbe0462fe8aaf--\r\n\n"}}
