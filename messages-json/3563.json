This seems\n&gt; logical s=\r\nince NEAT does not any node removing operator. I&#39;m trying \nto\n&gt; reduce the =\r\nadd_node and add_connection probabilities but I think I\n&gt; should stop the e=\r\nvolution sometimes.\n&gt; =3D&gt; When should I end the evolution ? Considering th=\r\nat I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; compare NEAT to some other neuro-evolution methods, I&#39;d =\r\nlike to use\n&gt; the same number of generations to be as fair as possible.\n&gt; \n=\r\n\nIn problems like pole balancing, usually the experiment is ended \nonce it =\r\nsolves the problem, which usually means balancing a pole for \nsome minimum =\r\nnumber of time steps and/or passing a generalization \ntest.  In other words=\r\n, there is a success criterion, and once it&#39;s \npassed, the run ends.  \n\nHow=\r\never, NEAT has an interesting way of improving by minute \nincrements almost=\r\n indefinitely if you simply leave it running.  \nSometimes, for example, you=\r\n may find that after 500 generations of \nstagnation there is a sudden 0.01 =\r\nimprovement in fitness.  This \nphenomenon is due in part of complexificatio=\r\nn, which means that the \nsearch is never real &quot;over&quot; because every new conn=\r\nections means that \na new space opens up that has not yet been explored.  S=\r\no new \nopporunities keep popping into existence.  Slight nonlinearities \nin=\r\ntroduced by sigmoids can also tweak a solution every-so-slightly \ntowards i=\r\nmprovement.  Sometimes, all these tiny improvements \nacccumulate to make a =\r\nvery large network.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes a particular species may =\r\nbecome bloated \nwith excess structure (though the real question is whether =\r\n*all* \nspecies are similarly bloated).  In such a case, Colin Green and \not=\r\nhers have shown reason to believe that pruning is warranted.\n\nken\n\n\n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m starting to evaluate NEAT fo=\r\nr simple robotics problems and \nI \n&gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your advices to be sure t=\r\no use the correct starting networks \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters. I work on two si=\r\nmple problems: single pole \nbalancing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (non-markovian) and simple 3-DO=\r\nF robotic arm control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -&gt; how could I improve these re=\r\nsults ? Does someone has some \n&gt; &gt; benchmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; results on this classica=\r\nl problem ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you tried using p2nv.ne (the non-Markovian=\r\n parameters) \ninstead \n&gt; &gt; of pole2_markov?  Perhaps they would do better. =\r\n Perhaps a \nsmaller \n&gt; &gt; mut_weight_power (weight mutation power) would hel=\r\np too, since \nyou \n&gt; &gt; are concerned very small oscillations that may be ha=\r\nrd to damp \n&gt; &gt; without our very fine-grained weight adjustments.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=3D&gt; I&#39;ve tried this and I was not able to improve the results in any\n&gt; sub=\r\nstancial way. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret=\r\n / Mandor\n&gt; http://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
