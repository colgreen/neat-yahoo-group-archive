Do I have to use a very high constant? Since the lowest er=\r\nror \nis supposed to be zero, so if I divided by the error, the result is \nc=\r\nlose to infinite, then how can I decide the terminate conditon?\nLet me elab=\r\norate on my case. The input pattern is a two-column array \nwhile the output=\r\n pattern three-column, the data vary in a wide range \nand randomly, either =\r\npositive or negetive. My question is that in what \nmethod can I achieve min=\r\nimum error fitting?\nThanks for help, I am a new guy.\n\n\n"}}
