If I&#39;m reading it\nright, you&#39;re proposing a &quot;dominance tournament&quot; as\nopposed to a &quot;master tournament&quot; (in which champions\nof later generations play against champions of past\ngenerations, in order to demonstrate improvement).  If\nI&#39;m reading it right, the &quot;dominance tournament&quot; is\nmore of a &quot;king of the hill&quot; approach, more like a\nsingle-elimination version of the master tournament,\nrequiring fewer evaluations.  Am I reading it right?\n\nIt&#39;s an interesting idea.  In TTT, Gomoku, and Go, I&#39;d\nplanned to test the champions of every 50th generation\nor so against an external opponent, like Angeline and\nPollack did in this &#39;93 paper:\n\nhttp://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cache/papers/cs/1362/http:zSzzSzwww.cis.ohio-state.eduzSzlairzSzTechReportszSzijcai93.pdf/angeline93learning.pdf\n\nFor TTT they created a random player, a best player\n(that plays a perfect game), and a near player (a best\nplayer that occasionally makes random moves).\n\nThey tested their resulting populations against these\nthree external players, to get a grid like this:\n\n                 RAND    NEAR    BEST    POP\nWins vs. RAND    1125     802     310    781\nDraws vs. RAND      0     104     535    471\nWins vs. NEAR       0     144       0     61\nDraws vs. NEAR      0     123     360    588\nDraws vs. BEST      0       0       0    481\n\nPOP was their evolving population.  Such a grid gives\nthem a decent measure of the progress of their\nalgorithm.  In the above example, this population won\nabout as many games against a purely random opponent\nas the NEAR player did, which means they are somewhere\nbetween random players and perfect players.\n\nWith Checkers, Fogel used human players as his test\nfield, putting his evolved champion on an on-line\ngaming ladder and charting its progress against human\nplayers.\n\nIt seems to me that when charting the progress of a\ncoevolving population, it is probably best to try to\nmeasure their progress against a standard outside of\ntheir own evolutionary environment, and that testing\nthem against a broad range of strategies is most\ndesirable.  \n\nIn more complex domains, good external opponents are\nmore difficult to find, especially automated ones.\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure using Angeline and Pollacks approach\nto TTT and Gomoku will provide a good measure of\nprogress, but I&#39;m not quite sure how we&#39;ll handle\nmeasuring improvement with Go.  Many researchers test\nagainst GnuGo or other publicly available Go AIs, and\nthat seems like a reasonable approach.  It might be a\ngood idea to measure improvement in a blended way,\nwith a dominance tournament and testing against\nexternal opponents.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
