I had completely forgotten about the initial &quot;boxes&quot; experi=\r\nment!  I&#39;ll look up the paper you&#39;re referring to as well.\n\nI&#39;m getting spu=\r\nn up on Hierarchical Temporal Memory at the moment.  It&#39;s been around for a=\r\n couple of years, but it&#39;s relatively new to me.  I&#39;ll have a look at DBNs =\r\nas well for future use.  I heard of them, but I&#39;m not familiar with them, e=\r\nither.  I&#39;m starting to wonder if one or both of HTMs or DBNs could benefit=\r\n from CPPNs.  As long as they can be mapped to a substrate and there&#39;s some=\r\n spatio-temporal patterns in the data, I would certainly think so.\n\n\n-- Chr=\r\nis\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years back Derek James and Philip Tucker wrote a paper using=\r\n NEAT\n&gt; to do some very simple object recognition (discriminating between t=\r\nwo\n&gt; very basic shapes using a roaming eye approach if memory serves).
