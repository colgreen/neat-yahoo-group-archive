I \nalso \n&gt; am n=\r\not really sure what the requirements really are for a fitness \n&gt; function, =\r\nI couldn&#39;t locate any guidelines in the literature so I \n&gt; have just been u=\r\nsing the sum of rewards over one 20 second trial.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also wondering=\r\n where in the training does the value function \n&gt; converge over hundreds if=\r\n not thousands of episodes? I didn&#39;t see \nan \n&gt; episode loop in Shimon Whit=\r\neson&#39;s NEAT+Q algorithm so I am unclear \n&gt; on how the value-function Q woul=\r\nd approach the optimum value-\n&gt; function over a single run fitness evaluati=\r\non.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just e-mailed Shimon to the same effect, but as I am under =\r\n\na \n&gt; time restraint I figured I would ask the group as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; My code =\r\nthus far can be found at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://filebox.vt.edu/users/mirenner/NEATplu=\r\nsQ/\n&gt; \n&gt; the only files I have modified are:\n&gt; neat_main_modified7.m used t=\r\no run the program\n&gt; mike_experiment7.m contains pendulum experiment\n&gt; \n&gt; th=\r\ne linked folder also contains an added m-file I made to \nvisualize \n&gt; the b=\r\nest network in each generation, which I will upload to the \n&gt; files section=\r\n once my thesis is complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; your feedback is appreciated\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
