The deadline is coming up soon!\n\nGenerative and Developmental Systems Track, GECCO 2010, Call for Papers and\nParticipation\n\n              GENERATIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS TRACK\n    2010 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE (GECCO-2010)\n\n                   http://www.sigevo.org/GECCO-2010\n\n\nDear Generative and Developmental Systems (GDS) Researcher,\n\nWe invite you to submit a paper to the GDS track at GECCO 2010, which we\nbelieve is the premier conference for GDS-related work worldwide.\n\nOur program committee of GDS experts means that your paper will be\nreviewed by many leaders in the field. Moreover, the attendance at the\nGDS track has been high ever since it started in 2007. The size and\nprestige of the GECCO conference will allow many researchers to learn\nabout your work, both at the conference and via the proceedings (GECCO\nhas the highest impact rating of all conferences in the field of\nEvolutionary Computation and Artificial Life*).\n\nThis track focuses on work which has gone by many names, such as\nartificial development, artificial embryogeny, computational embryology,\ngenerative systems, indirect encodings, developmental encodings, genetic\nregulatory networks (GRNs), Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems), genotype to\nphenotype mappings, etc. We invite papers on these topics or related\nsubjects.  \n\nWe also want to alert you to the historical importance of this track.\nMany of you share our excitement about this field and its connection to\nthe powerful capabilities of biological encoding and development. For\nmany years, there was no consistent annual venue to which researchers in\nthis area could submit papers to be reviewed by a committee of GDS\nresearchers.\n\nMost opportunities to present work in this area have been through one-\ntime workshops or symposia that do not carry the same weight as a GECCO\nconference publication.\n\nTo address this gap, a committee of GDS researchers encouraged GECCO to\nestablish an official conference track in 2007. With the establishment of\nthe track, we now have an opportunity to build a strong and consistent\ncommunity that can improve and flourish over time.\n\nHowever, the track can only survive with your submissions.   It is\nimportant to note that GECCO permanently cancels tracks that fail to\nattract sufficient submissions.  Therefore, our community can preserve\nthis new resource only by contributing papers.  We know that you have\nmany options for submitting your GDS-related ideas, and we hope that you\nwill consider the long-term investment that GDS represents for the\ncommunity.  Our program committee is selected from among the top GDS\nresearchers in the world, and we hope that our track will continue to\nflourish with your enthusiasm.\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n* Submission deadline: January 13, 2010\n* Notification of paper acceptance: March 10, 2010\n* Camera-ready submission: April 5, 2010\n* GECCO-2010 Conference: July 7-11, 2010\n\n\nThe conference will be held July 7-11, 2010 in the very nice city of\nPortland, Oregon, USA.\n\n\nFor more information, please see the GECCO homepage at\nhttp://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2010\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nJeff Clune and Julian Miller\n\n2010 GECCO GDS Track Chairs\n\n* http://www.cs-conference-ranking.org/conferencerankings/topicsii.html\n\n\n\n\nGECCO is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery Special\nInterest Group on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (SIGEVO).
