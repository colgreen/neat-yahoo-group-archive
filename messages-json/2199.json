My guess is that\n&gt; the population would never reach such an extreme dichotomy between\n&gt; species because specie 3 never would have gotten that large unless its\n&gt; fitness were dominating the others - which in this case it is not. \n&gt; Also, the species 1 and 2 likely would not be that small with such\n&gt; good fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/19/05, Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whilst calculating the number of offspring for a valid (i.e. non\n&gt; &gt; extinct and size &gt; 0) specie, the count returns 0.  This is\n&gt; &gt; particularly prevalent in large species where the adjusted fitness\n&gt; &gt; becomes quite small comapared with the rest of the other, and usually\n&gt; &gt; much less populous, species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This becomes even more marked if I boost young species fitness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as I understand, the offspring is calculated as follows.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (av adjusted specie fitness) / (total of all species av adjusted\n&gt; &gt; fitnesses) * Population size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, imagine we have 3 species. Specie_1 has 3 members av raw\n&gt; &gt; fitness 0.85, Specie_2 has 2 members av raw fitness 0.82 and Specie_3\n&gt; &gt; has 145 members with av raw fitness 0f 0.9.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specie_1(adj) = 0.85/3 = 0.28333\n&gt; &gt; Specie_2(adj) = 0.82/2 = 0.41\n&gt; &gt; Specie_3(adj) = 0.9/145 = 0.006\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specie_1 then generates 61 offspring\n&gt; &gt; Specie_2 then generates 87 offspring\n&gt; &gt; Specie_3 then generates 2 offspring\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not quite 0, but you get the idea.  So even though the largest specie\n&gt; &gt; with has best average fitness, its population gets decimated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I understand, that large species need to get penalised, but this seems\n&gt; &gt; extreme and you are potentially losing a lot of good gemomes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ideas/correction/thoughts appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ta\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Matt\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
