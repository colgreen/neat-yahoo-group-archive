Rather they\nare fi=\r\nxed pattern classification problems.  I decided to make a\nversion of your e=\r\nxperiment because it was straightforward to\nunderstand and modify.  The Exp=\r\neriment View window, showing the\ncharacters as they are correctly or incorr=\r\nectly classified, is\ninteresting to watch.  One can cheer the networks on a=\r\ns they learn to\ndistinguish between three or two dots in a column.  The fit=\r\nness\nfunction is also a no brainer =96 the character is either right or\nwro=\r\nng.  You are also correct that Braille characters are essentially\n3x2 dots.=\r\n  I put some white space around and between the dots to make\nthe characters=\r\n &quot;prettier&quot;.\n\nThe Nero world is way out of my league and even the complicat=\r\nions of\nTic-Tac-Toe have been surprising to read about.  This little patter=\r\nn\nclassification system seemed just right for initially learning about\nNEAT=\r\n.  I am having a great time adjusting the various search\nparameters and slo=\r\nwly digging into the network code to see how they\nwork.\n\nThanks again for t=\r\nhe work you put into SharpNEAT.\n\nCarl\n\n\n\n\n"}}
