I picked up on it\n&gt;last year from a post on the Genetic Programming yahoo group, it&#39;s\n&gt;basically 6 inputs, made up of two binary address inputs which select\n&gt;which of four binary data inputs should be returned as a response.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, after taking a fresh look at the code today I spotted an error\n&gt;and also made a small change to the fitness function. SharpNEAT has just\n&gt;found a perfect network in two independent runs, taking about 10-15 mins\n&gt;each. I wonder how this compares to GP&#39;s ability to find a solution? I\n&gt;would guess probably not too well actually, since I would guess that GP\n&gt;is better suited to boolean logic type problems. I may investigate this.\n\nWhat is your fitness function like?\n\n&gt;I think this domain was also related to the image processing that John\n&gt;Arrowood was working on. I think that the switching ability was a\n&gt;sub-task of what John was trying to achieve.\n\nI thought that the way John posed the problem required complexity \n_equivalent_ to several hefty multiplexers within the network, and I was \ntherefore using it as an example of how hard the problem was, and how \nmodularity might relate.  Possibly evolution could have found approaches \nthat did not require this complexity, but I thought the problem was really \nthat hard.  If it had proven possible to evolve a solution, then of course \nthere is no guarantee it would have actually used multiplexers.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m going to try the more difficult 11-multiplexer now, that&#39;s 3 address\n&gt;lines and 8 data lines.\n\nGo for it.  Or how about evolving an indirect representation for a general \nN + 2^N multiplexer?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
