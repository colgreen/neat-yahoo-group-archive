I will keep it in mind.  You know,\n&gt; ultimately what we are up against is just the fact that no sample\n&gt; can be guaranteed to perfectly represent its generating distribution.\n&gt; It&#39;s likely there will always be extraordinary situations that were\n&gt; not encountered in whatever training set was experienced during\n&gt; evolution.  At the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do better,\n&gt; it just means reaching exactly 100% of all possible test cases is\n&gt; unlikely for complicated problems or domains.\n\nThat&#39;s a good point.\n\nWe have a couple of particular problems presented by the fingerprint\nclassification domain that bear on this.  One are fingerprints that\nare not completely one class.  That is, they are somewhat an arch and\nsomewhat a left loop.\n\nThe other is rejects.  Some images are of such poor quality, and\ncontain so much noise, that it is inherently difficult to get enough\ninformation to make a classification.\n\nSo it&#39;s virtually impossible to evolve networks that have seen cases\nthat not only cover all the variation in a particular class, but those\nfuzzy cases that are blends of classes, plus the full range of\ndegraded fingerprint images that contain all sorts of different noise.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
