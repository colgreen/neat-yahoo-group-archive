Nevertheless, Jeff and Derek, I\n&gt;  agree with your criticisms of this kind of sensational claim (e.g.\n&gt;  &quot;beats masters level player!&quot;) so we need to be careful to put any\n&gt;  such claim in context if we come to the point where we get results\n&gt;  like that.\n&gt;\n&gt;  And Derek, thanks for the Go link, very interesting!\n\nNo problem. Even though I&#39;m not focused on AI for games, I still like\nto try to keep up with what&#39;s going on in the field. If people are\nmaking comparisons to Deep Blue and Kasparov, I think they are\nanalogous. I don&#39;t think Deep Blue was any sort of meaningful step\ntoward general-purpose AI, and I don&#39;t think algorithms like MoGo are\neither. But who knows? I&#39;m willing to be convinced otherwise. :)\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
