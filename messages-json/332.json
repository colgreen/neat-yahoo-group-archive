Sounds fair enough.\n&gt; \n\nRight, if an input is picked to be connected, it is fully-connected\nto the outputs.\n\n&gt; &gt; Also the bias is always connected\n&gt; &gt; to the outputs.  So on average each network has the bias and one\nother\n&gt; &gt; input connected.  Any network with only the bias connected is\nforced\n&gt; &gt; to have one other connection connected.  So the initial\npopulation is\n&gt; &gt; minimal but diverse.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s another thing Shimon suggested:  Instead of training one\nbig\n&gt; &gt; OCR network, train a separate network for each letter.  And do the\n&gt; &gt; training separately, i.e. an &quot;is it a &#39;b&#39;?&quot; network and a\nseparate &quot;is\n&gt; &gt; it an &#39;a&#39;?&quot; network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Intereting - it would cut down the size of the networks\nsignificantly - \n&gt; even fully connected networks would be feasable - even though I like\nthe \n&gt; ideas of starting minimally.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, this wouldn&#39;t work with my current demo, because it only\ninputs \n&gt; one image of each letter. I&#39;d have to add alternative letters,\neither \n&gt; damaged &quot;a&quot;:s or &quot;a&quot;:s from other fonts.\n&gt; \n\nWell, you could lete ach network see all your letters, and just rate\nthem on their ability to fire only for the appropriate one.\n\n&gt; Interestingly enough, it would be trivial to merge 26 such networks\ninto \n&gt; a single network that solves all letters at once - why you would\nwant to \n&gt; do that is unclear...\n&gt; \n\nIt might be interesting to merge it into one network and then keep\ntraining with lots of noisy examples.  Maybe NEAT would find\nconnections among the different subnetworks that are helpful.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
