The problem is if you only train for one \nexample at a time, the system doesn&#39;t need to remember what it \npreviously learned in order to get the next example right.\n(By the way, I&#39;m not sure the curve is necessarily logarithmic, but \nthe general point you&#39;re making sounds right)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; so in general, it&#39;s better to measure fitness in such a way that \nthe\n&gt; fitness graph for the entire run is a single logarithmic curve, not\n&gt; repeated curves, with the hope that the curves will get smaller \nand go\n&gt; away.\n&gt; Is this a very consistant paradigm, or are there interesting \nexceptions?\n&gt; chad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-----Original Message-----&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: Kenneth Stanley\n&gt; &gt;Sent: 8/1/2004 4:31:57 PM\n&gt; &gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [neat] Re: 3D cross product domain\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you are training on only a single example and every time you \nswitch\n&gt; &gt;examples it goes back to square one it sounds like the problem is\n&gt; &gt;overspecialization. In classification tasks, you need to train on \na\n&gt; &gt;broad representative range of examples that every individual \nsees. \n&gt; &gt;Then each individual receives a score reflecting their overall\n&gt; &gt;performance on the training set. That way, you are training for\n&gt; &gt;generalization.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hey group, \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
