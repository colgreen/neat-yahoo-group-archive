I think *time* might be another dimension of physical \n&gt;neurons.  In other words, there are likely nuances in a physical \n&gt;neuron&#39;s firing and the *timing of the receptivity* of a \n&gt;related/connected neuron that had some level of influence on the \n&gt;evolution of the neurons and organ.\n&gt;\nI read that neurons have been observed to briefly set up connection \npathways across large regions of the brain only for that pathway to \nnever be observed again. When I read this I thought of  how a connection \nis made when you make a phone call (or make a TCP connection on the \ninternet), the infrastructure is a physical one but there is no single \nwire going from one end of the connection to the other, the connection \nis a virtual or logical one. But the fact remains that the brain exists \nin 3 spatial dimensions and that any extra functionality that helps \novercome this limitation, such as virtual connections, is still limited \nby this fact. So staying with the phone system analogy, if neuron&#39;s are \nacting as switches on a virtual connection then they cannot be \nsimultaneously re-used for another connection. Ok so packet switching is \nanother way to get more use out of a communications network, but there \nare still limitations to how many virtual connections can be maintained. \nSo are biological NN&#39;s acting like a packet switching network or a \nconnection based one? Are spikes perhaps part of a &#39;control&#39; channel \nthat is &#39;in-band&#39; with the &#39;data&#39; channel - like in the old days when \nyou could trick payphones by emitting various tones into the handset.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
