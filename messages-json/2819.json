Has anybody else been\ndown that path using NEAT, t=\r\naking e.g. the weights evolved using NEAT\n& feeding them into some standard=\r\n BP software?\n2) Has NEAT been used in any &#39;real world&#39;/industrial applicat=\r\nions yet?\n\nand a &#39;how long is a piece of string question&#39;...\n\n3)  As yet  h=\r\nave no feel for how long the evolution might take. I&#39;ve\nran a few of the do=\r\nwnloaded sample executables they seem to take quite\na while to run. My neur=\r\nal net has 8 inputs, one output and if we guess\nat a final neural net of 2 =\r\nhidden layers with 8 nodes per layer. If we\nused say a 2GHz PC doing nothin=\r\ng else - could we guess at 7 hours\n(i.e. an overnight run) to evolve or is =\r\nit more likely to be several\ndays? Would appreciate any best guesses or exp=\r\nerience on this.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
