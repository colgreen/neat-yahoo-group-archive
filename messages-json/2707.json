That looks an awful lot =\r\nlike ANJI output, so I&#39;m\n&gt; going to assume that&#39;s the implementation you&#39;re=\r\n using.  I&#39;m one of the\n&gt; developers of ANJI.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you have here is tw=\r\no different runs that solved XOR.  One took 77\n&gt; generations, the other too=\r\nk 49 generations (if memory serves, it&#39;s\nactually\n&gt; 78 and 50, since genera=\r\ntion number is 0-based).  I&#39;ll give a\nline-by-line\n&gt; summary of the first o=\r\nne.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  Generation 77: start\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Beginning of generation 77.  Ev=\r\nerything between here and &quot;Generation\n77: end\n&gt; [start-stop] [duration]&quot; is=\r\n logged for every generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  connection-&gt;neuron id map size =3D=\r\n=3D 55\n&gt; &gt; INFO  neurons-&gt;connection id map size =3D=3D 394\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; These m=\r\naps are data structures that track the innovation IDs of\nneuron and\n&gt; conne=\r\nction genes.  Basically, this means the population contains 55\n&gt; connection=\r\n genes and 394 neuron genes.  Note that the same gene can\nexist in\n&gt; multip=\r\nle chromosomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  species count: 32\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; # species in the popul=\r\nation this generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  max: id=3D9786 score=3D1.0 size=3D25\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n INFO  # chromosomes with max fitness: 1\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  champ: id=3D9786 score=\r\n=3D1.0 size=3D25\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Sometimes you will have multiple chromosomes in o=\r\nne generation with max\n&gt; fitness.  In that case, you&#39;d have multiple &quot;max&quot; =\r\nlines.  In this case\n&gt; there&#39;s only one, so the first and third lines are r=\r\nedundant.  The\nchamp&#39;s\n&gt; ID is 9786.  Its score is 1.0.  It contains 25 gen=\r\nes.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  Generation 77: end [23:31:42 - 23:31:43] [1\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; End of g=\r\neneration 77.  Since this is the final generation, the rest\nof the\n&gt; log li=\r\nnes are a summary of the entire run.  The first set of brackets\n&gt; indicate =\r\nstart and end time.  The second set of brackets indicate\nduration\n&gt; in mill=\r\niseconds.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  generation of first solution =3D=3D 34\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ANJI pr=\r\novides two fitness paramaters, threshold and target.  Threshold\n&gt; indicates=\r\n the lowest fitness that can be considered a candidate\nsolution.\n&gt; But you =\r\nmight want the run to continue to find a better solution. \nTarget\n&gt; indicat=\r\nes a fitness that is sufficient for the run to stop.  I don&#39;t\nrecall\n&gt; the =\r\nvalues for the example, but let&#39;s say threshold=3D0.8 and target=3D1.0.\n&gt; T=\r\nhis line indicates the first chromosome to exceed 0.8 occurred in\n&gt; generat=\r\nion 34.  But it took until generation 77 to get a fitness of 1.0.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO=\r\n  champ # connections =3D=3D 15\n&gt; &gt; INFO  champ # hidden nodes =3D=3D 6\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; # connections and hidden nodes in overall champion for the entire run.=\r\n\n&gt; Adding the 3 inputs and 1 output neuron to these yields 15+6+3+1=3D25,\nw=\r\nhich\n&gt; is the number of genes mentioned above.\n&gt; \n&gt; INFO  Run: end [23:29:5=\r\n9 - 23:31:44] [104531]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; End of the run.  Start/end time and duration=\r\n are the same as the\n&gt; &quot;Generation: end&quot; log line.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that helps.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
