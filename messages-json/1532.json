Anybody have any feedback?\n\nFirst, I can settle for a fixed-enlargement scale.  I didn&#39;t want to,\nbut I really want a better enlargement method, even if it isn&#39;t able\nto do arbitrary scale.  Now, having fixed-position outputs, the\nproblem is reduced to a classification problem.  &quot;Should this pixel be\nabove or below the center?&quot;  Easily solved, except for the BILLIONS of\ntraining samples...\n\nSecond, to get an idea of how many hidden nodes I will need, I can\nevolve for the normal input nodes, but with only one output node. \nHowever many hidden nodes it takes for one, that&#39;s how many I start\nwith for trying to evolve the final solution.\n\nThird, this is not a controller, it is a classification problem.  So,\nI can (perhaps) take some shortcuts where connectivity is concerned. \nInstead of splitting one connection and then adding more connections\nlater, I can add a node that is pre-connected to all inputs and all\noutputs, but with nearly 0 weights.  Then, it only has to optimize the\nweights.  Except then I have to decide if a new node adds to the first\nhidden layer or a second (or a third).  Hmm...\n\nAny other ideas?\n\n"}}
