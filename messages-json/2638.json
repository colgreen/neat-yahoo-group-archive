They aren&#39;t academic \npublications, but they are easy to read, include t=\r\next and figures, \nand reveal to the reader the key issues.  It would be gre=\r\nat to have  \na reference like that for SLEAT.\n\nAlso, I haven&#39;t spent much t=\r\nime in the TTT world;  can people remind \nme how good 94.8% is?  How is PPS=\r\n measured again?  Is that the same \nmeasure as in past research such as Der=\r\nek and Philip&#39;s ANJI results?\n\nken \n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Bad=\r\ncoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; \tOK so I finally have to results t=\r\no ponder.  Let me tell you \nwhat I \n&gt; think in no particular order...\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n...and ask everyone for anything they can think of to add.\n&gt; \n&gt; These exper=\r\niments were to create TicTacToe players, using the \n&gt; &quot;cheating&quot; method of =\r\nevaluating with the &quot;Perfect Player Score&quot; \n&gt; (TTT-PPS) that I outlined bef=\r\nore.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tWhat I&#39;ve been doing is fishing for reasonable parameters.  \nSo =\r\nI set \n&gt; up a basic configuration, and (to avoid a combinatorial explosion =\r\n\nof \n&gt; tests) just varied one parameter at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI was also=\r\n using:\n&gt; \n&gt; SLEAT - where multiple chromosomes communicate to one another =\r\nvia \n&gt; rewritten versions of the input data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Variance - where all weig=\r\nhts and FIDs (FIDs are a detail of SLEAT) \n&gt; have an accompanying &quot;variance=\r\n&quot; and every time they are reproduced \n&gt; they are varied within a normal dis=\r\ntribution centered on their \n&gt; current value and with a width based on the =\r\nvariance (this is like \n&gt; Evolutionary Computation (EC)).\n&gt; \n&gt; Control of g=\r\nenome size via only 50% chance of inclusion of \nunpaired \n&gt; genes in cross =\r\nbreeding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Multiple node modes (sigmoid, and, or, xor, ...)\n&gt; \n&gt; The si=\r\nmplest form of my &quot;advanced speciation&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And I ran three different rand=\r\nom number seeds for each one.  And \nran \n&gt; each run up to 10,000,000 cycles=\r\n (call that 100,000-ish \ngenerations).\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; The parameters I varied=\r\n were:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) population size\n&gt; 2) how much to mutate to create a new spec=\r\nies\n&gt; 3) mutation rate\n&gt; 4) how long to keep trying with a stalled species\n=\r\n&gt; 5) whether to mostly crossover/mutate or mostly clone/mutate\n&gt; 6) whether=\r\n to keep champions when merging species (preserving \nmerge)\n&gt; 7) whether to=\r\n punish illegal moves (PPS parameter)\n&gt; 8) whether to reward partial succes=\r\ns (PPS parameter)\n&gt; \n&gt; And the results of this are in the file I uploaded. =\r\n For each \nthere \n&gt; are two graphs (i) the whole thing, (ii) zoomed on the =\r\n0.9 to 0.95 \n&gt; region of fitness.  The latter is because it is clear that m=\r\ny \nbiggest \n&gt; problem is the way the search slows at high scores.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Conclusions and puzzlements:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) population of 50 is best (this is =\r\nper species, I use up to 2 \n&gt; species at a time at the moment).  You can se=\r\ne how small \npopulation \n&gt; sizes work, but are unreliable and a size of 100=\r\n works but is \nslower...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) there is no overall conclusion from the de=\r\ngree of mutation for \na \n&gt; new species, as &quot;20 mutations&quot; is highest at the=\r\n end, we could \ncall \n&gt; that a winner, but as one of my other conclusions i=\r\ns going to be a \n&gt; more general &quot;mutate more&quot;, I think I reserve judgement =\r\non this.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) low mutation just failed, I&#39;m not 100% sure why, but I&#39;m \n=\r\nthinking \n&gt; that individual added genes were so rare they never met one \nan=\r\nother...\n&gt; \n&gt; High mutation is better, so my conclusion is to try higher \nm=\r\nutation \n&gt; rates still and try to find an optimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) no overall concl=\r\nusion about how long to wait on a stalled \nspecies \n&gt; before spawning a new=\r\n one, less patient might be better but \noverall I \n&gt; would say this wasn&#39;t =\r\nconclusive yet.  Trying higher mutation \nrates \n&gt; might change the scale of=\r\n these anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Too much breeding verses just clone/mutate is slight=\r\nly worse, \nbut \n&gt; only slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) Not keeping champions during speci=\r\nes merges is slightly \nbetter.  I \n&gt; have no idea why, except that maybe th=\r\ne species merge doesn&#39;t tend \nto \n&gt; lose anything even without this (thus i=\r\nt doesn&#39;t help) and keeping \n&gt; champions occasionally gets in the way of a =\r\nless fit hybrid that \nhas \n&gt; the _potential_ to be more fit.  I&#39;m going to =\r\nkeep champions until \nI \n&gt; have firmed up the other params, and then try th=\r\nis again in more \ndetail.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7/8) These change the scoring system and can=\r\nnot be simply compared \n&gt; with the other absolute score values.  I will rec=\r\nalculate their \nfinal \n&gt; results in the same system as the others as a guid=\r\ne.  Generally, \n&gt; however, neither of these curves looks especially better =\r\nor \n&gt; worse.  Punishing illegal moves shifts the whole curve down, \n&gt; rewar=\r\nding partial success pushes the whole curve up, but generally \nmy \n&gt; guess =\r\nis this is just due to the change in the score system and \nthe \n&gt; results a=\r\nre about the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; One embarrassment I have from this is I und=\r\nerestimated how much I \n&gt; needed to change the random numbers to get a genu=\r\ninly different \n&gt; run.  e.g. for my data set #2 I just advanced the random =\r\nnumber \n&gt; sequence by a couple of hundred thousand, thinking that although =\r\n\nthe \n&gt; sequences would overlap, every number would be used in a different =\r\n\n&gt; context and hence very different.  In fact, some of my curves in \n&gt; thes=\r\ne two sets start as time-shifted versions of one another, and \n&gt; manage to =\r\nhold on to that similarity for up to half the run!\n&gt; \n&gt; So the lesson there=\r\n is &quot;always use completely different random \nnumber seeds&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nis represents about 18 CPU-weeks of work...\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; Special thanks to =\r\nColin for providing 1/3 of the CPU.  My next \nstep \n&gt; is a smaller series o=\r\nf higer mutation studies, then look at \n&gt; speciation params again, then loo=\r\nk at keeping champions in some \n&gt; detail...  The current best player I have=\r\n seen has a PPS of \n94.8%.  I \n&gt; need to upgrade some software before I can=\r\n take it on man to man...\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; In 15 minutes everybody will be in th=\r\ne future.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
