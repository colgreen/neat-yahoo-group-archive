The results I\n&gt; reported were against a totally random opponent.  \n\nAh...well, for some reason I thought throughout the\nentire discussion of Concentration that the players\nwould be playing solitaire.  That&#39;s probably where I\nwould have started with this domain.\n\nIt&#39;s easier to code, for one.  And then you don&#39;t have\nto worry about relative fitnesses and multiple\npopulations, at least until you want to add them in. \nIf the player is just playing solitaire, your fitness\nfunction is trivial...it&#39;s just how many turns it\ntakes for the player to clear the board. \n\n&gt; They appear to be evolving against each other, but I\n&gt; have no way of know how good they are!  The\n&gt; first-movers are winning about 60% of the games and\n&gt; the 2nd movers about 40%.  They might all be playing\n&gt; near-perfect games or all just about like random\n&gt; players.\n\nWell, Ken posted a link to give you some ideas.  There\nare lots of different ways to test them, but a pretty\neasy one would just have them play solitaire (like\nplaying an opponent who always passes).  If there&#39;s no\nstatistical difference between the number of turns it\ntakes your nets and random players to clear the board,\nthen your algorithm isn&#39;t working.\n\nHonestly, 60% wins for a first-mover sounds pretty\nclose to random, and part of the problem is the small\ndomain.  The probability of finding a match with only\nsix cards is reasonably high, and after a match is\nmade, the odds of matching go up even more.\n\nIt would be easier to mark progress in a game with\nmore cards, because your random players are really\ngoing to suck as the number of cards gets big.\n\n&gt; That is an unforeseen problem with co-evolution; you\n&gt; can&#39;t easily tell how they are doing if the evolve\n&gt; together.  I need to add some objective measure\n&gt; because I like to know what&#39;s happening.  I won&#39;t\n&gt; use\n&gt; that for evolution, just for observation.\n\nLike I said, solitaire should do the trick.  Or\nalternately, if each of your evolved players is played\nmultiple times against a random opponent, playing at\nleast two games, with each player taking turns going\nfirst, then your nets should win more games if they&#39;re\ndoing anything.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
