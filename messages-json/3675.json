It&#39;s essentially\nthe same as the official SharpNEAT (Sourceforge version), but it has support for\ndistributed execution. As far as I&#39;m aware, Peter hasn&#39;t gotten around to\nincorporating distributed execution into SharpNEAT and I&#39;m fairly certain there\nis no central repository for all 3 versions you mentioned.\n\nWesley\n\n\nQuoting krn_2k &lt;krn_2k@...&gt;:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt;    Did you eventually modify SharpNeat to support validation data\n&gt; sets? Or does anybody know if there any Neat implementations/code\n&gt; snippets etc out there (SharpNeat or otherwise) that support\n&gt; cross-validation?\n&gt;\n&gt; As I am fairly new to NEAT, I begun by searching around for SharpNeat\n&gt; and noticed that there are at least three different implementations:\n&gt; SourceForge, codeplex and a version supporting HyperNeat/.NET 2.0.  Is\n&gt; there by chance a central CVS/Subversion repository coordinating these\n&gt; together where the SharpNeat project is maintained and/or the patches\n&gt; for update versions available?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Keith.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petervermont&quot; &lt;pandrews@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the recent thread &quot;New To NEAT - A few Newbie Questions&quot; Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What you do is evaluate each\n&gt; &gt; &gt;generation on the training set and test the champion of each\n&gt; &gt; &gt;generation on the validation set. When the validation scores start\n&gt; &gt; &gt;going down, you stop evolution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am using SharpNEAT and am new to all this so I would appreciate a\n&gt; &gt; little more detail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have implemented two interface, IExperiment and INetworkEvaluator.\n&gt; &gt; Neither interface appears to have any concept of a generation or of a\n&gt; &gt; champion. It looks to me like I might want/need to subclass\n&gt; &gt; SingleFilePopulationEvaluator so that I can override\n&gt; &gt; EvaluatePopulation. I can then call the superclass&#39; EvaluatePopulation\n&gt; &gt; and after it completes do my validation testing on the\n&gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm&#39;s BestGenome. I was then thinking\n&gt; &gt; that once I wished to stop evolution, I could set the\n&gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm SearchCompleted boolean. Finally, I can modify\n&gt; &gt; SharpNeatGui&#39;s SearchThread to check the ea&#39;s SearchCompleted flag so\n&gt; &gt; that the thread will stop.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Am I on the right track here? How have others handled cross-validation\n&gt; &gt; and prevention of over-fitting?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
