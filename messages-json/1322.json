It returns a number guaranteed \nto be unique within the run.  It does this by just incrementing a counter \nand returning the result.  I call that same function every time I need an \nID.  Topology ID&#39;s, network ID&#39;s, Node ID&#39;s, you name it, it all gets its id \nfrom the same place.\n\nAnd whenever a new one (topology, node) is created, I always look through a \nhash record to see if it is a duplicate of one created earlier.  If it is, I \nre-use the old ID, which makes things a lot easier.  You may or may not want \nto do that, but I suggest that it will simplify the search, if not the code. \n  And if you are coding in a language that makes the hash lookup easy, then \nit&#39;s even easy in the code.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
