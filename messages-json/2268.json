It let me play\nwith a bit of development while using your OCR experiment as a\nframework.  I thought the reduced 7 X 5 input grid and very distinct\ncharacter set would be a snap for the network.  Now I know better. \nThirty-five inputs and twenty-six outputs is too much for a one-to-one\nconnected net so the problem isn&#39;t trivial.  I&#39;m having fun playing\nwith the various search parameters, especially the frequency of &quot;add\nconnections&quot; and &quot;add nodes&quot;.\n\nThe downside of adding an experiment is my SharpNEAT library and some\nof the Form1 initialization differ from the standard release.\n\nLots to play with and I haven&#39;t even looked at the network code.\n\nCarl\n\n\n\n"}}
