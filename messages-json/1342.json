Neural nets of the knid we use are good at adding(and therfore \nsubtracting) because each neuron adds it&#39;s inputs, but what about \nmultiplication?\n\nI tried a simple multiplication experiment and discovered that although \nnetworks can be found, that they are not trivial. Typically they will \nhave at least 4 hidden nodes to get the basic functionality and more \nnodes are required for extra accuracy. Now consider that for a network \nto calculate a cross product it must independently discover six \nmultiplication sub-networks, connected up so that their result is \ncombined appropriately. Hopefully this gives some idea of why the cross \nproduct domain is a non-trivial one.\n\nA quick google came up with this paper which investigates neurons that \nmultiply their inputs instead of adding them:\n\nhttp://gs37.sp.cs.cmu.edu/papers/files/mult-NN-complexity2.pdf\n\nI havent read it yet but I tried out the concept and sure enough I can \nfind a network that performs multiplication just by connecting the two \ninput (operand) neurons directly to the output, all the NEAT search \nneeds to do is find the appropriate two weights. Some accuracy is lost \nbecause the answer passes through the sigmoid function, but it&#39;s about \nas accurate as the networks found using adding neurons.\n\nI then tried the cross product domain again, this time with the \nmultiplying neurons and a manually created seed genome with all the \nconnections required to perform cross product. The result was failure, \npresumably because although the multiplication part is now being \nperformed by the network, the additive (or subtraction) part of the \nformula is now more difficult to achieve with multiplying neurons. doh! \nSo perhaps it would be an idea to mix adding and multiplying neurons? So \nnow I&#39;m wondering what other domains might benefit from the inclusion of \nmultiplying neurons into our various NEAT implementations? For starters \nJohn&#39;s image enlargment might benefit, as might Derek and Philips roving \neye (with a zoom factor).\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
