On the other hand, if the dung beetle can go\naround molding pieces =\r\nof dung, in principle a wheeled creature could\npave its own roads (i.e. fla=\r\ntten some grassy areas) so it could more\neasily drive on them later.  Also,=\r\n in some habitats, the ground is\nrelatively flat and probably could support=\r\n wheels anyway.  My guess is\nthat wheels would indeed be useful in some env=\r\nironments and &quot;should\nhave&quot; evolved they were indeed possible to encode.  T=\r\nhat does not mean\nthey are better than legs in any way, but just as flying =\r\ncan get you\nto some places more effectively than walking or climbing, and p=\r\nlenty\nof creatures get along fine without flight, I&#39;d guess wheel-based\nani=\r\nmals would get along fine too without walking.\n\nMy guess on why wheels neve=\r\nr evolved is that a wheel has to be\nseparated from its axle so that it can =\r\nspin unfettered.  It seems like\na hard problem to get blood/arteries/nutrie=\r\nnts or any other resources\nto such a separated piece.  Yet with all the wea=\r\nr and tear (especially\non the outer membrane), there would have to be a way=\r\n.  Perhaps it&#39;s\njust too hard to encode such a decoupled transport system w=\r\nith DNA.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken- \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a minor quibble on a side comment of yours, but I=\r\n think it\nis fun to\n&gt; think about. I used to be amazed as well that evoluti=\r\non never\ndiscovered the\n&gt; wheel. But then I realized that wheels are only g=\r\nood with pavement.\nSince\n&gt; environments did not have pavement, it is no sur=\r\nprise that evolution\ndid not\n&gt; discover the wheel. Only a complex process o=\r\nf niche construction,\nlike we\n&gt; have done with our road system, allows the =\r\nchicken/egg problem to be\n&gt; overcome such that it is worth it to both lay r=\r\noads and use wheels.\n&gt; \n&gt; In natural uneven landscapes, legged creatures ar=\r\ne much better than\nwheeled\n&gt; creatures. Which is why we can&#39;t drive through=\r\n forests.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I don&#39;t see this as a failure of evolution. In fact, we c=\r\nan make good\n&gt; wheeled creatures but are just barely starting to be able to=\r\n make good\n&gt; legged creatures (e.g. Big dog). The legged creatures are bett=\r\ner and\nharder\n&gt; to make than the wheel.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; That p=\r\noint aside, evolution did discover the wheel in some cases.\nSuch as\n&gt; dung =\r\nbeetles:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DI1RHmSm36aE\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people=\r\n also have claimed that evolution has created the wheel\nat the\n&gt; nano-scale=\r\n.

However, usually w=\r\nhen people attempt benchmarks they do not\n&gt; &gt; compare their results explici=\r\ntly with others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the same time, as you know, I have changed my =\r\nphilosophy somewhat\n&gt; &gt; since 2003 because I have realized that benchmark c=\r\nomparisons can\n&gt; &gt; lead to misunderstanding unless they are controlled very=\r\n carefully.\n&gt; &gt; One of the problems is the &quot;target-based evolution problem,=\r\n&quot; which\n&gt; &gt; is one of the inspirations for novelty search.  In short, evolv=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; to an arbitrary target can lead to misleading intuitions about what=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is possible with a particular encoding because of deception.  Often\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a &quot;failed&quot; encoding very well could represent the target if only it\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nad been led to it through an alternative path through the search\n&gt; &gt; space.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, another problem with benchmarks is that they may obfuscate\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; more fundamental advantages of particular approaches because they do\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; not focus on general capabilities.  (Although, of course, if you do\n&gt; &gt; e=\r\nnough of them, perhaps general capabilities start to be clearer.)\n&gt; &gt; But t=\r\nhat is why I advocated more focus on looking for biological-\n&gt; &gt; like regul=\r\narities in the patterns output by particular encodings,\n&gt; &gt; rather than loo=\r\nking for a single particular pattern, or even a\n&gt; &gt; single set of patterns.=\r\n  Like I&#39;ve said before, evolution never\n&gt; &gt; produced a wheel but that hard=\r\nly means DNA is a bad encoding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course benchmarks can play a ro=\r\nle and I do think more comparisons\n&gt; &gt; could be done, but we also have to b=\r\ne cautious about their\n&gt; &gt; misapplication.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Derek,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not really aware of much, if any benchmark=\r\ning work that has\n&gt; &gt; been\n&gt; &gt;&gt; done in the field other than some of the pa=\r\npers mentioned in the\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; post.

I went back and\n&gt; &gt; reread\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Ken&#39;s paper &quot;A Taxonomy f=\r\nor Artificial Embryogeny&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=\r\n=3D121), which is a\n&gt; &gt; very nice\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; paper. I was specifically wondering=\r\n about the suggestions at the\n&gt; &gt; end\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of the paper, regarding benchma=\r\nrks for AE systems, such as:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Evolution of:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --Pure=\r\n symmetry (e.g. bilateral symmetry)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --Specific shapes (e.g. rings, st=\r\nars, and trees)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --Specific connectivity patterns (e.g. for neural net=\r\nworks)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --Simple controllers (e.g. for double pole balancing)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; Ken goes on to say:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Such benchmark comparisons will even=\r\ntually make it possible to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; predict the performance\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of AE system=\r\ns based on their location in the taxonomy. For\n&gt; &gt; example, one\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bench=\r\nmark might be to evolve a five-pointed star. This benchmark\n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; b=\r\ne attempted\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with a system in which all the dimensions of development =\r\nare\n&gt; &gt; fixed\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; except the cell\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fate dimension. That dimension ca=\r\nn vary from using only\n&gt; &gt; prepatterning\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to using every\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; conceiv=\r\nable form of fate determination, from stochastic\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; self-organization to=\r\n signaling,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; migration, and proliferation. The results can be measured=\r\n using\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; several criteria: How\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fast does the objective shape evol=\r\nve? How often and how many\n&gt; &gt; genes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are reused by\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the solution =\r\ngenome? Is symmetry used, or is each point in the\n&gt; &gt; star\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; specified =\r\nby a separate\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; section of genetic code=97that is, is there emergent mo=\r\ndularity?\n&gt; &gt; For\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; every possible\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; setting on the varying dimensi=\r\non (e.g., cell fate\n&gt; &gt; determination), data\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; will be available\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nfor comparison.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; This sounds like a great idea. I&#39;m wondering,=\r\n though...what kind\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; response has this generated? Have there be=\r\nen any follow up\n&gt; &gt; papers on\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; AE systems that have tried to apply su=\r\nch benchmarks in a\n&gt; &gt; systematic\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; way?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Have these types =\r\nof benchmarks been systematically applied to\n&gt; &gt; the 2D\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; representatio=\r\nns evolved using HyperNEAT?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I also noticed rereading Sims 1994=\r\n paper that he displays hand-\n&gt; &gt; coded\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; examples of recognizable morp=\r\nhologies such as a primate hand, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; humanoid form, and a tree structur=\r\ne.
