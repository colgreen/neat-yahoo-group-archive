There isn&#39;t generally one setup that =\r\nis best for all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that in some versions of NEAT there is =\r\nsomething called a &quot;species dropoff age,&quot; which will cause a species to be =\r\npenalized if it has not improved in some number of generations (the dropoff=\r\n age).
