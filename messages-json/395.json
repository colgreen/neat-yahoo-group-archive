You&#39;re comparing:\n\n--The complexity of generational champions (averaged\nfrom 13 separate runs)\n--The max and min complexity each generation (averaged\nfrom 5 random runs)\n\nWhy not compare:\n\n--The complexity of generational champions in\nfitness-based runs\n--The average complexity of the entire population in\nrandom-fitness runs\n\nThe question you pose in section 6.1 is: &quot;[D]oes the\ncomplexity always increase whether it helps in finding\ngood solutions or not?&quot;\n\nWouldn&#39;t the latter comparison provide better insight\ninto answering this question?\n\nYou&#39;re asking if the complexity always increases.  But\nyou don&#39;t say which complexity you&#39;re referring to. \nIf you&#39;re referring to the overall complexity of the\nevolving population, it seems very clear that yes, the\ncomplexity of the population always increases, whether\nor not a fitness evaluation is used.\n\n&gt; You see the key underlying issue is that IF\n&gt; complexity did\n&gt; NOT correlate to superiority in the robot duel, then\n&gt; it is\n&gt; *possible* in NEAT for the complexity of the highest\n&gt; dominant\n&gt; solutions NOT to go up.  And the reason it is\n&gt; possible is\n&gt; because, as the random run lines show, NEAT keeps\n&gt; simple \n&gt; solutions around as long as they are competitive.  \n\nYou said something similar in an earlier thread.  I\nstill don&#39;t see how the concept of &quot;competitive&quot;\napplies to a population with no selection pressure due\nto fitness being applied to it.\n\nIt seems to me that simple topologies probably persist\nin a random-fitness run of NEAT due to the effects of\nspeciation.\n\n&gt; I think maybe there is some confusion about what is\n&gt; being \n&gt; claimed; the claim is not that average complexity in\n&gt; NEAT\n&gt; runs does not go up.  \n\nOkay...I guess that&#39;s the meaning I took away from\nyour question in 6.1 (Is complexity inevitable?).\n\n&gt; Rather, the claim is that\n&gt; increasing\n&gt; sophistication is a result of increasing complexity,\n&gt; and\n&gt; further that the reason increasing complexity pairs\n&gt; with\n&gt; increasing sophistication is NOT because of some\n&gt; nuance of\n&gt; NEAT; it is because it is fundamentally advantageous\n&gt; to have \n&gt; more structure in this domain.\n\nBut in section 6.3 you go on to demonstrate that both\nfixed-topology runs and simplification runs show an\nincrease in fitness.\n\nWhat that demonstrates to me is that complexification\nis not *necessary* to increase performance in this\ndomain, but that it is a more effective way of\nincreasing performance in this domain.  Right?\n\n&gt; But\n&gt; what about when you are NOT stagnating- that&#39;s\n&gt; what&#39;s \n&gt; interesting- in that case, adding structure opens\n&gt; the door\n&gt; to more and more sophisticated behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think anyone who uses NEAT really finds that\n&gt; controversial; after all, that&#39;s the whole reason we\n&gt; are using NEAT isn&#39;t it?  ...because we want to be\n&gt; able\n&gt; to find more and more complex solutions, because we \n&gt; believe that will lead to more and more interesting \n&gt; behavior.  \n\nI certainly believe that NEAT&#39;s approach of starting\nminimally and complexifying is a very clever and\neffective way of searching the solution space of a\ngiven domain.\n\nBut I&#39;d probably qualify this last sentence of yours. \nI don&#39;t necessarily want to find more complex\nsolutions...I want to find the best solutions.  That\nincludes efficiency.  \n\nIf I start out with a minimal topology in Tic-Tac-Toe\n(99 genes--9 input, 9 output, 81 connections), and\nthat topology is sufficient to produce a perfect\nplayer, I don&#39;t want to evolve something with twice as\nmany genes.\n\nI think this may be a intellectual trap of sorts. \nWe&#39;re evolving neural networks, which control the\nbehavior of a system.  I think it may be misleading to\nassume that an increase in the complexity of behavior\nof an individual necessarily leads to an increase in\nfitness.\n\nCase from biology: Just last night I was watching\n&quot;Animal Countdown&quot; (I think that&#39;s the name) on Animal\nPlanet, and they were counting down the &quot;10 Laziest\nAnimals&quot;.  Kind of a subjective estimation, but #6 was\na porcupine.\n\nSo this weasel-like animal spotted the porcupine and\ndecided it wanted to eat it for lunch.  The only way\nit was going to do so was going to be if it could flip\nthe porcupine and attack its soft underbelly.  The\nweasel circled the porcupine, looking for an opening. \nThe weasel was using fairly sophisticated behavior to\ntry to deal with its prey.\n\nBut what was the porcupine&#39;s response?  Do nothing. \nIt didn&#39;t move an inch.  Why?  Because its morphology\n(spines) contributed to its high fitness...its\ninability to be attacked).  It didn&#39;t need a\nsophisticated behavioral innovation to deal with this\npredator.  A rabbit, for example, may have very\nsophisticated heuristics for evading prey.  But the\nporcupine&#39;s behavior was extremely simple.  And that\ncorresponding simplicity of behavior made the\nporcupine more fit. \n\nSo complex behavior doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to an\nincrease in fitness...wouldn&#39;t you agree?\n\nThe same can be said for morphological traits. \nParasite morphologies often simplify because the body\nof a host can often provide the necessary functions of\nparticular organs, such that parasites with simpler\nbody designs persist.\n\nFlightless birds are another example.  So are\ncave-dwelling lizards who evolve away pigmentation or\neyes.  These simpler morphologies require less energy\nand upkeep, and produce fitter organisms for that\nparticular environment.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
