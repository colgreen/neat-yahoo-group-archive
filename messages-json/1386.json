That helped.  Then I added the above formula to that penalization, \nso that the closer the dynamic range is to the expected, the less of a \npenalty it gets.  That seems to have made a big difference, because now \ntopologies aren&#39;t &#39;optimizing&#39; and then stagnating nearly as fast.  So while \nthe overall progress appears to be slower, it also appears as though it \nmight be more meaningful.\n\nI&#39;ll know in a few days how much of a difference it really made. :)\n\nIf only I had my own beowulf cluster!!!  :)\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
