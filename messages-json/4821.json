When \n&gt; &gt; this happens I want =\r\nto throw out the fitness of all the individuals in \n&gt; &gt; my population that =\r\nwere obtained from the old environment and force them \n&gt; &gt; to be reevaluate=\r\nd in the new environment. Does anyone have a suggestion \n&gt; &gt; for how this c=\r\nan be done?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Josh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Josh,\n&gt; \n&gt; The Experimen=\r\ntRun::evaluatePopulation(...) function is the one that loops\n&gt; through the =\r\npopulation and assigns fitness to all the individuals based on\n&gt; the experi=\r\nments. There are several experiments so that the application can\n&gt; be multi=\r\nthreaded.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as you aren&#39;t using MPI, all you have to do to chang=\r\ne an experiment\n&gt; (or the environment, as you call it), is loop through all=\r\n of your\n&gt; experiments in the ExperimentRun class, dynamically cast the exp=\r\neriment to\n&gt; your specific experiment class, and call some function that ch=\r\nanges the\n&gt; experiment in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be easiest to do this i=\r\nn between generations. In this case, you\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have to worry about re-=\r\nevaluating individuals who have already\n&gt; received a fitness, although I su=\r\npposed it could be done anytime. If, during\n&gt; a call to evaluatePopulation,=\r\n the environment needs to be updated, you&#39;ll\n&gt; have to write some code to a=\r\nbort the population evaluation and start it over\n&gt; again, to ensure that th=\r\ne entire generation of individuals is evaluated the\n&gt; same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason G.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
