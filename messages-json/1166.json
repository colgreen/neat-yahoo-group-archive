That would reduce \n&gt;memory\n&gt; &gt; &gt;bandwidth requirements...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I could try it and see what kind of difference it makes.  But this is a\n&gt; &gt;mathematical model domain, not a controller, so the added accuracy may\n&gt; &gt;actually be beneficial in the long run.  For a controller domain, I&#39;d \n&gt;even\n&gt; &gt;consider using integers...\n&gt;\n&gt;Float accuracy is about 6 sig figs, double is about 16 sig figs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Your image data looks like it&#39;s 16bit, whcih is 5 sig figs.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The output node is a summation node.  No sigmoid.  For a reason:  The \n&gt;output\n&gt; &gt;ranges need to be able to be more than +/-1.  So when I was first doing \n&gt;it,\n&gt; &gt;there were no sigmoids.  The sigmoids appear later as hidden nodes are\n&gt; &gt;added.\n&gt;\n&gt;Surely you are normalizing your pixel values to a range of 0 - 1 or -1 to \n&gt;1?\n\nYes.  +/- 1 at the inputs.  Outputs may go as high as +/- 2.\n\nI&#39;ll have to do some poking around to see if I can get away with floats \ninstead of doubles...  I&#39;ll try making a copy of one and converting all \n&#39;double&#39; to &#39;float&#39; and seeing if it outputs identical results.  If so, then \nyeah, I&#39;ll change it.  But that does pose an interesting question:  if I \nhave too many digits in my generated source code, will the compiler \nautomatically reduce it to the size of a float, or will it do the math as a \ndouble and then convert at the end?  How could I tell which way it chooses \nto do it?\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(if I may blow the trumpet for my inv-abs activation function here, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;should be more-stable w.r.t extreme numbers...)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I know you&#39;ve posted that before, but would you send it again so I have \n&gt;it\n&gt; &gt;for easy reference? :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;I was just playing with some equations, it&#39;s not easy to get the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;right properties.  But how about x/(n+abs(x))?  That&#39;s a sigmoid,\n&gt;symmetric\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;about zero, equal to +1 at +infinity and -1 at -infinity.  n controls \n&gt;the\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;steepness and is equal to the x value where the curve reaches +0.5...\n\nGreat...I&#39;ve written it down so hopefully I don&#39;t lose it.\n\n&gt;Yeah, I&#39;ve looked at the file.  You&#39;re right, none of the functions are\n&gt;complex enough yet to really analyze for efficiency issues.\n&gt;\n&gt;I do have a big question though: where&#39;s the input data.  e.g. all the\n&gt;functions I&#39;ve seen so far only read left, right, top, bottom, none of them\n&gt;reference texels in the input image.  It could just be that none of them\n&gt;evolved to access a pixel yet, but I don&#39;t even see the data array in \n&gt;there.\n\nOne source file does the evaluations for a single 9x9 input -&gt; 144x144 \noutput.  Thus, the pixel data is the same for every activation.  So, I \npre-calculate as much as I can before I generate the code.  The references \nto the pixel data are encapsulated in the first number in the calculation.  \nOnce the networks have hidden nodes that reference one of the variable \ninputs, then the activation functions will start to get more complicated.\n\nOf course, I can&#39;t do that once I use it for actual enlargement, but for the \nfitness evaluations, every little bit helps.\n\n\n\n"}}
