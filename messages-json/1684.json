I have just got the average number of gens to find a\n&gt;&gt;solution for XOR down to about 40, which is a nice result and also means\n&gt;&gt;I won&#39;t have to spend the next fortnight searching for bugs :) On that\n&gt;&gt;note I think I&#39;ll call it a day.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Oh?  I thought this was just the beginning.\n&gt;\n&gt;At least take your found parameters from XOR and try them on some other \n&gt;problem domains.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nSorry, I literally meant finish off for the day :)   The same code can \nalso be re-used to run one off benchmarks, e.g. how well does this set \nof parameters work on average on this domain, which is something that is \nalways going to be useful. And yeh, I&#39;ll be looking at applying the \nmeta-algorithm to other domains, the trouble is it&#39;s a lengthy process \nand thus I suspect it will be a long term investigation that runs \nalongside other investigations.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
