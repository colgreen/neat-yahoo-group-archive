That is, I&#39;m not sure the \nproblem is really to=\r\n do with my original simple speciation scheme.  \nIt sounds more like there =\r\nis a system parameter problem.  I&#39;m really \nwondering why the compatibility=\r\n threshold has to go above 40 before \nspecies are getting barely inclusive.=\r\n  It sounds like the whole \npopulation is spread out (in terms of either to=\r\npologies or weights, \nor both) like crazy.  Why would that happen in only 1=\r\n00 generations?\nBas, what is the rate at which you add nodes and links?  Al=\r\nso, what \nis the strength of your mutations?  Finally, what are the \ncoeffi=\r\ncients of the compatibility distance equation?  (they could be \ntoo big)\n\nI=\r\nt would be instructive to observe several examples of genomes that \nare out=\r\nside of 40 distance from each other.  What is causing that \nhuge distance? =\r\n It&#39;s possible that structure has been added willy-\nnilly and speciation wo=\r\nuld thus have no way of handling the \nexplosion.\n\nIn my experience, I have =\r\nnever seen a speciation dynamic so out of \ncontrol as the one Bas describes=\r\n unless some other parameter is \nscrewy.  Therefore, while I think all the =\r\ncreativity in this thread \nis fantastic, I think it really isn&#39;t addressing=\r\n the core problem \nBas is having.  I could be wrong, of course.  But it&#39;s w=\r\north trying \nto debug the situation a little before turning to alternative =\r\n\nmethods.  (With the rationale that alternative methods would be no \nmore l=\r\nikely to solve an unrelated systemic problem than the original \nmethod.)\n\nP=\r\nlease don&#39;t take this as discouraging the exploration of \nalternative speci=\r\nation schemes.  I have to say that this thread is \none of those enlightenin=\r\ng and substantive tradings of ideas that one \nrarely encounters on most int=\r\nernet newsgroups.  I&#39;m just saying \nBas&#39;s specific problem might be somethi=\r\nng else.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itsmebas&quot; &lt;Bas@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m evolving an extension of Stanley & Miikulainen&#39;s robot d=\r\nuel \ndomain\n&gt; in ANJI 2.01, but I&#39;m having trouble setting the speciation \n=\r\nthreshold.\n&gt; If I set it too high, all of my 100 chromosomes will (of cours=\r\ne) \nstay\n&gt; in one specie. But when I set it a bit lower, I end up with 100\n=\r\n&gt; species of 1 chromosome after some 100 generations. I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; fin=\r\nd the golden middle. On his FAQ\n&gt; (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/=\r\nneat.html), Kenneth \nStanley\n&gt; himself presents a method to automatically s=\r\net the speciation\n&gt; threshold by descreasing or increasing it with, say, 0.=\r\n3, whenever \nthe\n&gt; number of species becomes more or less than a preset tar=\r\nget amount \nof,\n&gt; say, 10.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, when I apply this method (with pop=\r\nulation size 100 and \ntarget\n&gt; species count 10), then after some 100 gener=\r\nations I end up with \n20 to\n&gt; 25 species and a speciation threshold of 40 a=\r\nnd rising. Of the\n&gt; resulting species, one specie contains 50 chromosomes, =\r\n10 species\n&gt; contain 5 chromosomes or less and 10 species contain just one =\r\n\nchromosome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else encountered such problems before, or have=\r\n some \nidea to\n&gt; what might be causing this? How do you keep a &#39;normal&#39; amo=\r\nunt of \nmore\n&gt; or less equally sized species?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
