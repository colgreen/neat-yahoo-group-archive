I wonder, are you guys going to\n&gt;write up a summary at some point of what was concluded, because I&#39;d\n&gt;like to get a sense what the final word is without reading through\n&gt;the whole thread?  It seems like you&#39;ve been making some progress\n&gt;towards figuring out what works and I hope to be on top of it\n&gt;eventually.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;But this is getting into the realms of the obsessive :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got good reason to be obsessive.  Let me give you an example:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Before I can evaluate my networks, I&#39;ve got to calculate the\n&gt;expected\n&gt; &gt; results.  I do that once and only once, and then refer back to\n&gt;those\n&gt; &gt; calculations for each network.  That saves me from doing it 999\n&gt;times more\n&gt; &gt; than I need to, which is good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My inputs are converted from pixel values to a &#39;relative\n&gt;intensity&#39; in the\n&gt; &gt; range of +/- 1.  So, naturally, I want the expected output to be\n&gt;in that\n&gt; &gt; same range.  So, after I shrink the 144x144 to 9x9, I convert the\n&gt;9x9 into\n&gt; &gt; the +/-1 range, and use those same parameters to shrink the\n&gt;original inputs.\n&gt; &gt;   Then, I have to calculate the expected results, which requires\n&gt;taking the\n&gt; &gt; average of every possible square area within the 144x144 region.\n&gt;There are\n&gt; &gt; 1,005,720 such regions.  Calculating those expected results was\n&gt;taking\n&gt; &gt; around 10 minutes...  I could have just settled for that.  But I\n&gt;didn&#39;t...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I decided to keep things as integers until the last possible\n&gt;step.  Leave\n&gt; &gt; the pixels as 16 bit unsigned integers.  To take the average, add\n&gt;them up\n&gt; &gt; and store the result in a 32 bit long.  Convert to a double when\n&gt;dividing by\n&gt; &gt; the number of pixels that make up the area.  Then convert that\n&gt;average to\n&gt; &gt; the +/-1 range.  WOW!  It did the same amount of work in about 10\n&gt;seconds!\n&gt; &gt; Talk about orders of magnitude!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The next thing to attack is the time it takes to generate the\n&gt;evaluation\n&gt; &gt; code.  Generating code that evaluates 500 networks on a single\n&gt;sample takes\n&gt; &gt; on average of about one minute for my laptop.  It takes less than\n&gt;5 minutes\n&gt; &gt; to compile and execute that code.  So a savings there is\n&gt;significant, and\n&gt; &gt; there is definitely inefficiencies in the process.  So next on my\n&gt;agenda is\n&gt; &gt; to speed up that process.  I&#39;m contemplating writing code which\n&gt;outputs code\n&gt; &gt; that is specific to a topology, and then calling that generated\n&gt;code with a\n&gt; &gt; specific network in order to output the optimized activation\n&gt;function.\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;ll be a debugging nightmare! But cool, in a morbid way...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But I&#39;m glad I&#39;m obsessive, I have saved myself boatloads of time\n&gt;in this\n&gt; &gt; experiment!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
