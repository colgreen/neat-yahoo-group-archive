Is this one doing that or no?  Would it be making very\n&gt;rapid movements in a small area?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDerek, it&#39;s not terribly easy to tell from the movie. Both mine and \nMattias&#39; sims show the poles attached to differenet points on the cart. \nMattias also chose to extend the short pole with a thin line ( I just \ndrew the short pole longer than it is, which I should really change \nbecause it is misleading). Both of these things make observation easier.\n\n From what I can see though it seems your solution isn&#39;t suffering from \nthe extreme wiggling that Gruau was trying to avoid. In his paper he \nstates that the wiggling increases in amplitude very slowly and \nultimately leads to the system becoming unstable, so one test is to see \nif your poles remain balanced in the simulator for a reasonable length \nof time.\n\nOn the other hand I&#39;ve never properly implemented the anti-wiggle \nfunction since I&#39;ve not seen the complete details. Are you using the \nfunction from the updated zip? If so this was just a &#39;home-brew&#39; \nfunction /based/ on Gruau&#39;s, not his actual function. I&#39;ve just scanned \nover his paper and it looks to me that he&#39;s evaluating over just 1000 \ntimesteps. So I&#39;ve experimented with a fitness function that I think now \nmatches his and I get solutions that can return the poles back to \nupright and generate hardly any movement at all, of either the poles or \nthe cart. BUT! These solutions (and I&#39;ve tried a handful) all become \nunstable sometime after 1000 timesteps have passed (e.g. the one I&#39;m \nlooking at failed at 2731, and a slight improvement on that one achieved \n7234). So I&#39;d really need to read this paper properly to determine what \nhe defines as a succesful solution, and whether I agree :) I&#39;d certainly \nrecommend you read it if you haven&#39;t yet, if for no other reason than to \nget the details of the fitness function correct. One thing I noticed is \nthat I  /think/ he uses 4.5 degrees as the starting angle for the large \npole, not one degree. Something that will make a solution harder to find \nI expect. I need to go and read the paper properly.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
