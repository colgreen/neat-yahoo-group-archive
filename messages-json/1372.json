Either that or some \n&gt;how allow additive and multiplicative inputs.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHi Ian,  you hinted at a number of interesting areas in your email, and \nhopefully I will get chance to research and experiment soon regarding \ndifferent types and configurations of neurons and networks. I agree that \nwe don&#39;t want to slavishly follow nature, but at the same time the basic \nfunctioning of natural neural nets is a lot more complex and subtle than \nthe basic models we have all been using to date. I can definitely see \nhow the presence of one particular neuro-transmitter may enhance the \neffect of another - and that this essentially describes a neuron that is \nmultiplying it&#39;s inputs. And if you think about how many \nneuro-transmitter chemicals there are and the plethora of different ways \nthey might be interacting, well who knows what important interactions we \nmight missing out on.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
