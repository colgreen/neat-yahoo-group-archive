I&#39;m glad you liked it.\n=\r\n\n&gt;  I do have a couple thoughts on the target-based\n&gt; experiment:\n&gt; \n&gt; Firs=\r\nt, the evolved results from the target-based runs all look really\n&gt; interes=\r\nting.  They do look like they were carved with a lathe, which is\n&gt; kind of =\r\nsurprising.  Maybe you should seek funding from a\n&gt; banister-design company=\r\n!\nThat would be hilarious. The lathe property makes sense, though, if you\nt=\r\nhink of what happens with a lathe: you subtract material along two\ndimensio=\r\nns while keeping radial symmetry around the rotating axis. I assume\nthe CPP=\r\nN is using the distance from center to come up with a way to do that,\nwhich=\r\n is helpful for this target.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, regarding the connection to=\r\n my paper with Brian, we\n&gt; observed basically two phenomena:  One is that i=\r\nf the target is\n&gt; sufficiently complex, it simply cannot be reached.  Howev=\r\ner, when the\n&gt; targets were simple enough, in fact they could be reproduced=\r\n reliably.\n&gt; Yet the problem when the targets actually were reproduced well=\r\n was that\n&gt; their CPPNs were two or three times as large as the CPPN that g=\r\nenerated\n&gt; the original target.  So our message was not simply that you can=\r\n&#39;t reach\n&gt; targets, but that even when you do, you pay a price with inelega=\r\nnt\n&gt; representation complexity.  Your case appears somewhere in the middle:=\r\n\n&gt; the attempts do not look bad, although they are not perfect\n&gt; reproducti=\r\nons either.\n\nI agree. It&#39;s a shame that I can&#39;t answer the question of whet=\r\nher the\ntarget-based CPPNs are unnecessarily complex/inelegant, because I d=\r\non&#39;t have\nnon-target CPPNs that produce the target. It would not be hard, h=\r\nowever, to\nconduct the same experiment you did in 2D in 3D.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am g=\r\nuessing that the target you chose is thus sort of on the\n&gt; borderline of co=\r\nmplexity that is almost reproducible, like the &quot;Eye&quot;\n&gt; target in our paper.=\r\n  What would be interesting would be to see the CPPN\n&gt; structures of the be=\r\nst approximations to see whether they are encoding\n&gt; the fundamental concep=\r\nt or stringing it together inefficiently.  I know\n&gt; you said that the morph=\r\nologies themselves don&#39;t look &quot;piecemeal,&quot; but\n&gt; they could still be constr=\r\nucted in a piecewise fashion mathematically.\n&gt; For example, figure 8i has s=\r\nome subtle ridges suggestive of unnecessary\n&gt; underlying complexity.\nThat w=\r\nould be cool to see. I wish I could drop these genomes into a DNA\nViewer li=\r\nke Picbreeder has. Maybe we should make one for EndlessForms.com.\n:-)\n\nBut =\r\n8i does seem to be the exception, the other shapes seem to be pretty\nregula=\r\nr. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another interesting factor is the number of evaluations to get wi=\r\nthin\n&gt; 90%.  It varies across your treatments, but 30,000 evaluations or so=\r\n\n&gt; looks like a reasonable expectation with your system.   With a\n&gt; populat=\r\nion of 15 in Picbreeder, that would be 2,000 generations, which\n&gt; is a real=\r\nly large number for the complexity of the target object (you\n&gt; can also see=\r\n objects of similar complexity in EndlessForms from 10 or 20\n&gt; generations)=\r\n.  So I think your experiment is pretty consistent with ours\n&gt; overall, tho=\r\nugh it wasn&#39;t geared at making the same point.\n\nI generally agree with you.=\r\n The main question we don&#39;t know is how hard this\nsphere target is on the s=\r\ncale explored in your paper with Brian.\n\nFor example, just playing around a=\r\n bit on EndlessForms I found this object\nin a few generations, and it is pr=\r\netty close to the sphere target. That\nsuggests similar results to your pape=\r\nr, where humans can find things quickly\nthat target-based evolution struggl=\r\nes with.\n\nhttp://endlessforms.com/o/7978\n\nSadly, it predates our ancestor v=\r\niew, so we can&#39;t see the exact historical\npath, but my guess is that some i=\r\nntermediate stages looked nothing like the\nfinal target. If anyone else evo=\r\nlves something like the sphere target,\nplease publish it and let us know.\n\n=\r\nThanks for your answer Ken.\n\nJeff\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@...=\r\nm &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , Jeff Clune\n&gt; &lt;jeffclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello everyone-\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hod Lipson and I have a new publication on=\r\n evolving 3D morphologies\n&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPNs, which explains the algorithm b=\r\nehind EndlessForms.com.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; PDF:  http://goo.gl/HRXLD\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Most =\r\nof you will at least enjoy quickly scanning the figures to see\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; e=\r\nvolved shapes, which are higher resolution and different than those\n&gt; on\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; EndlessForms.com.  You can also see a picture of the evolved shapes 3D\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; printed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The diversity of shapes I was able to discover just =\r\nplaying with the\n&gt; system\n&gt;&gt; &gt; myself for a few hours is pretty incredible,=\r\n which is a testament to\n&gt; Ken&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPN encoding. Additionally, I ran te=\r\nsts with and without recurrence\n&gt; in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPN genome, and with differe=\r\nnt inputs to the CPPN, and you can see\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; difference those choices =\r\nmake in the resultant objects. For example,\n&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPN recurrence, th=\r\ne shapes often look more fractal. I believe (but\n&gt; please\n&gt;&gt; &gt; correct me i=\r\nf I am wrong) that this is the first publication with a\n&gt; test of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPN=\r\ns with and without recurrence.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; FInally, I conducted target-based =\r\nevolution by evolving CPPNs to match\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; goal object. I&#39;d be intereste=\r\nd to hear if you think the goal was\n&gt; reached,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and how to interpret th=\r\nese results in light of Brian Woolley & Ken\n&gt; Stanley&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; paper on CPPNs=\r\n not being able to reach target 2D objectives.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What I like best a=\r\nbout being able to evolve 3D objects is learning how\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; CPPN search=\r\n space works: mutations frequently produce very sensible\n&gt;&gt; &gt; variation. Fo=\r\nr example, the two 3D printed elephants in figure one are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; brothers, an=\r\nd are close relatives of the three elephant-looking things\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; figure=\r\n 4 (b2-4). It&#39;s nice to see mutations have such smooth, sensible\n&gt;&gt; &gt; effec=\r\nts, instead of creating wildly different objects.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As always, plea=\r\nse let me know your thoughts and questions.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Je=\r\nff Clune\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Postdoctoral Fellow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hod Lipson&#39;s Creative Machines =\r\nLaboratory\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cornell University\n&gt;&gt; &gt; jeffclune@...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; www.msu.edu/~jcl=\r\nune\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n\n\r\n--B_3391947419_49000300\r\nContent-type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode:=\r\n space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-si=\r\nze: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D=\r\n&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; style=3D&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote id=3D&quot;MAC=\r\n_OUTLOOK_ATTRIBUTION_BLOCKQUOTE&quot; style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #b5c4df 5 solid; PAD=\r\nDING:0 0 0 5; MARGIN:0 0 0 5;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: #fff;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n    =\r\n  \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Jeff, your paper is a great explorations of the properti=\r\nes of the CPPN&lt;br&gt;\nencoding in 3D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bloc=\r\nkquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks Ken.

If anyone else evolves something like the sphere=\r\n target, please publish it and let us know.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nThanks for your answer Ken.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jeff&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote id=3D&quot;MAC_OUTLOOK_AT=\r\nTRIBUTION_BLOCKQUOTE&quot; style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #b5c4df 5 solid; PADDING:0 0 0 =\r\n5; MARGIN:0 0 0 5;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: #fff;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-in=\r\ndex: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nken&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;jeffclune=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hod Lip=\r\nson and I have a new publication on evolving 3D morphologies&lt;br&gt;\nwith&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; CPPNs, which explains the algorithm behind EndlessForms.com.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; PDF:  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://goo.gl/HRXLD&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/HRXLD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Most of you will at least enjoy quickly scanning the figures t=\r\no see&lt;br&gt;\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; evolved shapes, which are higher resolution and diff=\r\nerent than those&lt;br&gt;\non&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; EndlessForms.com.  You can also see a pict=\r\nure of the evolved shapes 3D&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; printed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The divers=\r\nity of shapes I was able to discover just playing with the&lt;br&gt;\nsystem&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; myself for a few hours is pretty incredible, which is a testament to&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nKen&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CPPN encoding. Additionally, I ran tests with and without =\r\nrecurrence&lt;br&gt;\nin the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CPPN genome, and with different inputs to th=\r\ne CPPN, and you can see&lt;br&gt;\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; difference those choices make in t=\r\nhe resultant objects. For example,&lt;br&gt;\nwith&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CPPN recurrence, the s=\r\nhapes often look more fractal. I believe (but&lt;br&gt;\nplease&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; correct m=\r\ne if I am wrong) that this is the first publication with a&lt;br&gt;\ntest of&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; CPPNs with and without recurrence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; FInally, I conduc=\r\nted target-based evolution by evolving CPPNs to match&lt;br&gt;\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; goal o=\r\nbject. I&#39;d be interested to hear if you think the goal was&lt;br&gt;\nreached,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; and how to interpret these results in light of Brian Woolley &amp; Ke=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\nStanley&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; paper on CPPNs not being able to reach target 2D o=\r\nbjectives.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What I like best about being able to evolve 3D=\r\n objects is learning how&lt;br&gt;\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; CPPN search space works: mutation=\r\ns frequently produce very sensible&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; variation. For example, the two=\r\n 3D printed elephants in figure one are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; brothers, and are close re=\r\nlatives of the three elephant-looking things&lt;br&gt;\nin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; figure 4 (b2-4=\r\n). It&#39;s nice to see mutations have such smooth, sensible&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; effects, =\r\ninstead of creating wildly different objects.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As always, =\r\nplease let me know your thoughts and questions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jeff Clune&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Postdoctoral Fellow&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hod=\r\n Lipson&#39;s Creative Machines Laboratory&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cornell University&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n jeffclune@...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n     \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/body=\r\n&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--B_3391947419_49000300--\r\n\n"}}
