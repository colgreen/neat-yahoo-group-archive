Yet it was still able to e=\r\nvolve good behaviors, though. I wonder, is this linked to the geometry at a=\r\nll? Perhaps only the fact that this indirect encoding searches trough less =\r\ndimensions, makes it more effective?\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nKenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Just for the record, I highly re=\r\ncommend this paper.  It&#39;s the most extensive study published on the effect =\r\nof varying geometry on HyperNEAT performance.  Some of its results are quit=\r\ne interesting.  \n&gt; \n&gt; For example, it suggests that HyperNEAT is still sign=\r\nificantly better than a direct encoding encoding even if its geometry is ra=\r\nndomized! (Although it is still worse than an engineered geometry.)  Jeff a=\r\nnd I have discussed how to interpret this result and my own opinion is that=\r\n most randomized geometries nevertheless still have some useful geometry, a=\r\nnd something is better than nothing.  So it suggests that you don&#39;t have to=\r\n necessarily hit on the &quot;perfect&quot; substrate geometry to get traction out of=\r\n HyperNEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet I think a big question that emerges from this result i=\r\ns whether it is somehow tied specifically to the quadruped domain.  It is p=\r\nossible that it has something to with the fact that a quadruped can get alo=\r\nng pretty well if all its legs move in tandem, so you have the opportunity =\r\nto represent that repetition regardless of how the legs are organized geome=\r\ntrically.  It is possible that other types of systems are less geometricall=\r\ny forgiving, though that remains to be seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, in practice, i=\r\nf the right geometry is even partially clear, the resultant informed substr=\r\nate configuration is probably going to be better than a random geometry.  T=\r\nhe &quot;engineered&quot; geometries (meaning they are designed by a human to make se=\r\nnse) still outperform the random ones in the paper, even as the random ones=\r\n outperform the direct encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, in my view, the most importan=\r\nt implication is that geometry matters.  If you can construct a sensible ge=\r\nometry, HyperNEAT will indeed take advantage of it to learn the task.  And =\r\neven if it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s better than having no geometric knowledge at=\r\n all.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Below is a link to a new HyperNEAT paper that=\r\n I will present at GECCO 2009\n&gt; &gt; this summer. It studies how sensitive Hyp=\r\nerNEAT is to different geometric\n&gt; &gt; representations of the same problem.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am especially excited about this paper because it was nominated f=\r\nor the\n&gt; &gt; Best Paper Award in the Generative and Developmental Systems tra=\r\nck. If you\n&gt; &gt; are going to GECCO this year, and enjoyed the paper, please =\r\nkeep it in mind\n&gt; &gt; when casting your ballot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The paper can be vie=\r\nwed here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-=\r\nHyperNEATSensitivity\n&gt; &gt; ToGeometry.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Abstract:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HyperNE=\r\nAT, a generative encoding for evolving artificial neural networks\n&gt; &gt; (ANNs=\r\n), has the unique and powerful ability to exploit the geometry of a\n&gt; &gt; pro=\r\nblem (e.g., symmetries) by encoding ANNs as a function of a problem&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; g=\r\neometry. This paper provides the first extensive analysis of the\n&gt; &gt; sensit=\r\nivity of HyperNEAT to different geometric representations of a\n&gt; &gt; problem.=\r\n Understanding how geometric representations affect the quality of\n&gt; &gt; evol=\r\nved solutions should improve future designs of such representations.\n&gt; &gt; Hy=\r\nperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\n&gt; &gt; qua=\r\ndruped robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representation.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHere, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometric\n&gt; &gt; r=\r\nepresentations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the quality\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantially affecte=\r\nd by\n&gt; &gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a direct encod=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; control even with randomized geometric representations, but perform=\r\ns even\n&gt; &gt; better when a human engineer designs a representation that refle=\r\ncts the\n&gt; &gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even choices in ge=\r\nometric\n&gt; &gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori can significant=\r\nly affect\n&gt; &gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representation can bias th=\r\ne type of\n&gt; &gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right symmetry more comm=\r\non than\n&gt; &gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest that HyperNEAT practi=\r\ntioners can\n&gt; &gt; obtain good results even if they do not know how to geometr=\r\nically represent\n&gt; &gt; a problem, and that further improvements are possible =\r\nwith a well-chosen\n&gt; &gt; geometric representation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As alwa=\r\nys, I look forward to any questions or comments you may have.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Chee=\r\nrs,\n&gt; &gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Universit=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
