In my experience most ANNs have weights here,\n&gt; &gt; lots of them.  It&#39;s often the case that the majority\n&gt; &gt; of the weights are between the inputs and the first\n&gt; &gt; layer of neurons.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think we&#39;re dealing with ambiguous terminology here.  The first\n&gt; layer of neurons in ANJI are responsible for nothing more than \npassing\n&gt; the input data on to the rest of the network.  They do have an\n&gt; activation function, but typically this is just linear (i.e., it\n&gt; effectively does not have an activation function).\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if you do not view these neurons as a layer, then what I would\n&gt; call the first hidden layer is what you would call the input layer. \n&gt; And yes, the inputs to this layer do have weights.\n&gt; \n&gt; ANJI does allow the first layer of neurons to be connected to each\n&gt; other if recurrency is enabled.  And, in NEAT there really is no\n&gt; concept of layers, just neurons and connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n\n\nRight--what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here is starting with a \nminimalst network.  FS-NEAT suggests not only starting wih the hidden \ntopology being evolved, but the input layer as well--with the input \nweights all set to zero, I&#39;m hoping the inputs will be evolved as \nwell.\n\nBrett\n\n\n\n"}}
