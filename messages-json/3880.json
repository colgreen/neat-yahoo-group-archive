The fitness function can&#39;t exactly be defined, since \nthey \n&gt; can be evolved towards some tasks like &quot;go there&quot; or something. I \n&gt; want to briefly describe the details behind it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The same network is used for both the body and the nervous system \nof \n&gt; the creature. First the body is built by a spatial CPPN and \nconverted \n&gt; to a mass-spring model. There are several tissues (the CPPN outputs \n&gt; tissue type instead of level of expression). One type of tissue is \na \n&gt; sensor tissue, which excites upon collision. Another type of tissue \n&gt; is a muscle tissue, which contracts the springs when excited. Like \na \n&gt; regular bilogical muscle. \n&gt; \n&gt; The key point is, that after the spatial CPPN builds the body, the \n&gt; same CPPN is then used for HyperNEAT (additional outputs, though), \nto \n&gt; evolve the connectivity of the neural network controlling the body. \n&gt; Inputs are located on sensor tissue only. Outputs are located on \n&gt; muscle tissue. Hidden nodes are located on the remaining tissue. \nThis \n&gt; is essentially evolving both the substrate and the connectivity of \n&gt; the network, but in a meaningful way, because of the geometry and \nthe \n&gt; simulated 2D physics space. \n&gt; \n&gt; The simulation is like this - when the sensor tissue is excited by \n&gt; some collision, this also plugs 1.0 into the associated HyperNEAT&#39;s \n&gt; network&#39;s inputs. When the outputs activation level exceeds some \n&gt; treshold, the associated springs on the muscle tissue are \ncontracted. \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that using the same network for both pusposes (spatial \nand \n&gt; connective) is better than using different networks.
