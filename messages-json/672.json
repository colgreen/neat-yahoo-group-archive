Ideally the cap would be related to the\nweight_mut_power in some way, such that there is room for several\nweight mutations in either direction.  \n\nFor example, if the max linkweight is 3 and the min is -3, then the\nweight_mut_power might make sense at about 0.5, so that there is room\nfor several increments or decrements in that range.  \n\nHere is some code to insert at the end of mutate_link_weights to cause\nthere to be a cap:\n\n//Cap the weights at 3.0 (experimental)\nif (((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight&gt;3.0) \n     ((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight=3.0;\nelse if (((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight&lt;-3.0)\n     ((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight=3.0;\n\nI encourage anyone who is running more than a few hundred generations\nto install a cap like this.  That way, your link weights cannot become\neventually so powerful that they overshadow the weights of any new\nlinks that might appear.  This may help a lot in some people&#39;s\nexperiments that are going for thousands of generations or more.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
