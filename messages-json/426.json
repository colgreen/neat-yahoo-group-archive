I don&#39;t\nknow if your examples were meant to be comprehensive,\nbut obviously there&#39;s stuff like the compatibility\ncoefficients and speciation compatibility threshold\nvalues.\n\nWe make a distinction between the domain (Tic-Tac-Toe)\nand the fitness function (direct evolution against\nrandom players, round-robin coevolution, etc.).  And\nthen for game domains there are all sorts of\nadditional parameters (win/loss/tie value, etc.).\n\nSome other specific comments:\n\n&gt;    &lt;end-condition&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;!-- optional end conditions. If more than\n&gt; one specified then \n&gt; terminate on whichever is true first --&gt;\n\nYeah...this is a good idea.\n\n&gt;       &lt;!-- keep track of innov num in case we wish\n&gt; to restart the run? --&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;max-innovation-id&gt;12345&lt;/max-innovation-id&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;/neat-run-info&gt;\n\nYes...we&#39;re currently working on loading a population\nfrom file.  This is a good idea.\n\n&gt;    &lt;generation id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;generation-info&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;save-time&gt;&quot;2004-02-24\n&gt; 00:00:12&quot;&lt;/save-time&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;max-fitness&gt;234&lt;/max-fitness&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;min-fitness&gt;123&lt;/min-fitness&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;avg-fitness&gt;222&lt;/avg-fitness&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;species-count&gt;5&lt;/species-count&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/generation-info&gt;\n\nHaving a species-count tag in generation info is a bit\nredundant, but not terribly.\n\n&gt; &lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src=&quot;0&quot; tgt=&quot;3&quot; \n&gt; weight=&quot;-1.3731676929130425&quot; enabled=&quot;1&quot;\n&gt; innov-id=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;\n\nWhy have an &quot;id&quot; and an &quot;innovation-id&quot;?  They should\nbe the same thing.\n\nOther than that, it definitely looks like a good start\nfor XML for loading parameters and reviewing stats\nduring and after a run.  \n\nAs I put in my previous mail, we currently use two\ntypes of XML to represent individuals: chromosome.xml\nand network.xml, basically mapping to the genotype and\nphenotype respectively.  I think this dichotomy is a\ngood idea, especially as indirect encoding is used. \nIn such cases, there will not be a one-to-one mapping\nof genotype to phenotype...agreed?\n\nThus, there&#39;s no real need to represent recurrent\nconnections in genotype XML...likewise, there&#39;s no\nreason to represent disabled genes in phenotype XML.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
