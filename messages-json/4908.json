You say that the sensor is set to &quot;200-d.&quot;  Is that literally=\r\n the value that is input, or is it normalized to a number between 0 and 1? =\r\n Note that for a neural network with regular sigmoid functions, an input wi=\r\nth a magnitude over 2 or so will simply lead to saturation, making it hard =\r\nfor the network to make any useful distinctions.  Therefore, normalization =\r\nis very important before inputting sensor values. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mark Ahlstrom &lt;lists@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The foo=\r\nd foraging experiment is the dangerous food foraging example  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; from &quot;E=\r\nvolving Adaptive Neural Networks with and without Adaptive  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Synapses&quot;=\r\n.    The sensors have been tried a few different ways.  They  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are arr=\r\nanged around the robot as described in the paper.  If there is  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; no fo=\r\nod item in the arc of the sensor, it is input to the network as  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 0.  =\r\nOtherwise, since I have a 100x100 grid constraining the space of  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the=\r\n objects, the sensor is set to 200-d where d is the distance to the  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nnearest food item in that sensor arc. Other was that sensors was  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; imp=\r\nlemented was as a count of the number of food items that the sensor  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ncould detect. The outputs are rate of left turn, rate of right turn (I  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; just take the difference to determine which way to turn) and the  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nforward speed of the robot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is related to a larger experime=\r\nnt I have been running over the  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; last couple years (at 1.5 months tim=\r\ne per run, it took a while,  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; particularly to debug a late run memory =\r\ncorruption).  That involved  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to fly airplanes along a random c=\r\nourse.  My hunch there was  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that the complexity of the environment an=\r\nd controlled entity left a  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; relatively naive (in the sense that it ju=\r\nst took position and attitude  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as input, and generated control settin=\r\ngs as output) neat approach  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; unable to discover a suitably complex co=\r\nntrol function.  Now Im not as  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sure.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; To Anthony&#39;s questio=\r\nns: 8 environments are generated for each  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; generation, and each netwo=\r\nrk is tested on all 8 environments.   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Multithreading isn&#39;t an issue, =\r\nsince Im keeping it single threaded for  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the moment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mark =\r\nAhlstrom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Nov 10, 2009, at 5:42 PM, Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; Mark, which food foraging experiment are you implementing?

My  control  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experiment (i.e. the one I think sh=\r\nould definitely give a solution)  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a re-implementation of the foo=\r\nd foraging problem.  The fitness  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; function is the same.  So doing n=\r\nothing nets a fitness of 32, and  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; max fitness is 60.  Instead what =\r\nIm seeing is a small improvement  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to average best fitness of about =\r\n35, and then almost every  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generation I have a couple outliers with=\r\n a fitness around 40-45.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is all using rtNeat.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, my question is whether or not I likely have some parameters  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tuned badly (not unlikely) and if so, what the likely culprits  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n would be.
