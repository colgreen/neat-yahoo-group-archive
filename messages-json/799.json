I didn&#39;t realize you\nwere looking at objects that weren&#39;t just considered as &quot;points.&quot;  \n\nWhen looking at large contiguous objects, it no longer makes sense to\nuse radar-like sensors.  Rays are better for that kind of thing.  So\nyou send out several rays (at different angles) and see where they\nintersect.  Generally radar sensors are better for point-like objects,\nsuch as people.  The reason is that rays are likely to miss small\nobjects that don&#39;t span most of the arc.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if your idea for a vision system is really much different\nfrom a bunch of ray and/or radar sensors.  It might just boil down to\nthe same information.  If not, maybe I am still misunderstanding a\nbit.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hey Chad, what do you mean by &quot;how many arcs it falls into?&quot; My \n&gt; &gt;understanding is that any object will in general only fall into\none \n&gt; &gt;arc. \n&gt; \n&gt; An object might fill more of the field of view than one arc. In\norder to\n&gt; allow \n&gt; the network to search for a hiding strategy, the environment must\nlet\n&gt; the \n&gt; agents hide. So the rock they are hiding behind may take 5 degrees\nof\n&gt; the \n&gt; field of view, and the agent might take 8 degrees of the field of\nview.\n&gt; Hiding \n&gt; behind that rock would prove ineffective to perceptive agent in\npursuit\n&gt; . \n&gt; The environment to me is just as important as the multi agent \n&gt; aspect. A single agent can use features of the environment to\nposition\n&gt; itself \n&gt; more optimally with regard to the other agents. \n&gt; I&#39;m particularly interested in the hiding strategy, because I think\nit\n&gt; requires \n&gt; both a visual type of perception, and some form of memory to\nremember \n&gt; a) that it is hiding, and \n&gt; b) who it is hiding from. \n&gt; \n&gt; The general gist is to randomize the environment during the search,\nmuch\n&gt; like the random objects being thrown at the agent in the new\nversion of \n&gt; Virtual Humans. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;That said, it is common practice in such &quot;radar&quot;-like sensor\nsystems \n&gt; &gt;to have the arcs slightly overlap so you don&#39;t get jumpy\ntransitions \n&gt; &gt;when an object moves from one arc to the other. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think using a narrow array of ray intercepts, and averaging the\n&gt; results of \n&gt; small clusters into each input would give me a rough vision system.\nI\n&gt; think \n&gt; that combined with the 360 degree radar-like sensor would provide a\n&gt; peripheral \n&gt; vs foveal input bouquet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Why arn&#39;t simple vision systems a common practice? Is it only\nbecause it\n&gt; takes longer to compute, or is there something else?\n&gt; \n&gt; chad\n\n\n"}}
