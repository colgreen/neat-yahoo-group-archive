Moreover, I doubt\nevolution can make too much progress with that many nodes (although I have\nseen fitness continue to increase even with such large genomes).\n\nI have tried dropping the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\nthat definitely changes the slope of the line, but it still linearly\nincreases. The good news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n\nAny thoughts? \n\n\nKind regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
