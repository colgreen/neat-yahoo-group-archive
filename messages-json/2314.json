I&#39;ve been \ntraveling and unable to follow the group for a while.  \n\nThere is a clear answer to the &quot;who to kill&quot; question in the \ncontinuous case: Kill the individual in the population with the \nworst adjusted fitness.  Adjusted fitnesses should always be kept up \nto date, which means after every replacement they should be \nrecalculated for the affected species.   Adjusted fitness means your \nfitness after fitness sharing has been taken into account.\n\nIan, it&#39;s true we faced this problem with rtNEAT and NERO.  And we \ntried several schemes.  Empirically, killing the adjusted loser \nworks best.  But it also makes sense logically, because fitness \nsharing is supposed to *protect* the less competitive species, and \nyou would be defeating that purpose if you killed off the absolute \nworst individual.  What if every time a new individual is born with \nnew structure, it tends to suck?  Then you will keep killing off the \ninnovative structures.  And that&#39;s what fitness sharing is supposed \nto protect, but it can&#39;t if you kill off the individual with \nabsolute worst fitness.  So you kill the one with the worst adjusted \nfitness, and the dynamics fall back to regular NEAT.\n\nMaking NEAT continuous actually has a fair number of similar hairy \nissues, including how to use a dynamic compatibility threshold and \nhow to appropriately choose the next parent species.  The ultimate \ngoal is to approximate the dynamics of original NEAT.  Our papers on \nNERO address the step by step &quot;rtNEAT&quot; process (rtNEAT is the name I \ngave to what you&#39;re calling continuous NEAT) in explicit detail, so \nyou may refer to them for guidance.  For example, see:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:utcstr-04-312\n\nNote that this tech report should soon be replaced by a superior \njournal article which is currently in publication.  But the tech \nreport does a good job of laying out the details in any case.\n\nAnother thing, which should not affect anyone, but is worth pointing \nout, is that rtNEAT is patent pending and the patent is held by UT-\nAustin.  That means if you wanted to make money off of it, you&#39;d \nhave to talk to them to get a license.  Of course research doesn&#39;t \nrequire any permission, so this shouldnt matter to most people.  But \nit&#39;s something to consider if you have greater ambitions.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \tThat got your attention?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI&#39;m starting to look at putting speciation into SLEAT.  And \nI&#39;m wondering \n&gt; exactly how to approach it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tLet me summarize NEAT-style speciation, then it will be \neasier to point \n&gt; out where my situation diverges.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; Species are each defined by an exemplar.  This is an individual \nchosen for \n&gt; use in comparisons.  Any individual within some threshold \nsimilarity to the \n&gt; exemplar is potentially member of the species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Individuals are assigned to the first species that they match and \nremain in \n&gt; the species.  Some implementations allow for periodic regeneration \nof species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because traditional NEAT is generational, exemplars are drawn from \nthe \n&gt; previous generation (is this right, I think the original paper is \nvague on \n&gt; this and I know it because it was discussed here previously, but I \nforget \n&gt; the details).  Each exemplar is one random (fittest?) member drawn \nfrom \n&gt; each species in the previous generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any new individual that fits no species becomes the exemplar (and \n&gt; presumably first member) of a new species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any exemplar that matches no individuals from the new generation \nrepresents \n&gt; a species going extinct.\n&gt; \n&gt; The purpose of speciation is to assign offspring between groups of \n&gt; individuals in a manner other than their simple proportion in the \n&gt; population.  Offspring are assigned to species based on \nthe &quot;adjusted \n&gt; fitness&quot; which is the maximum fitness seen in the species, divided \nby the \n&gt; number of members it has.  Offspring are assigned to each species \naccording \n&gt; to the proportions of their adjusted finesses (in \nchemical/physical speak, \n&gt; it&#39;s a partition function).\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; \tOK, now where I differ is my system is continuous, I create \none new \n&gt; individual at a time, present it to the population, and somebody \ndies as a \n&gt; result.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tNow no part of the standard evolution scheme is incompatible \nwith this, I \n&gt; can pick individuals from species probabilistically, according to \nthe \n&gt; adjusted fitness of the species.  I can introduce individuals one \nat a time \n&gt; and assign then to species.  I can spawn new species when an \nindividual is \n&gt; too different from any existing species...\n&gt; \n&gt; \tBut the one question that is not answered is: Who dies?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tAt present I kill the least-fit member of the population.  \nBut what is \n&gt; suited when their are species.  I see three plans:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) kill the population loser\n&gt; 2) kill the species loser in the species getting the offspring\n&gt; 3) kill the species loser in a random species\n&gt; 4) (FOUR plans, I said FOUR) kill a completely random individual\n&gt; \n&gt; \tWhat do people think?  Ken, I&#39;m particularly interested in \nyour take on \n&gt; this because you must have just done something similar for NERO...?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; \n&gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________ \n&gt; How much free photo storage do you get?
