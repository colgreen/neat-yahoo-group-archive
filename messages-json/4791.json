Can you give us your high\nlevel view of this area? I am simply curious. Do you think that there are\ncompanies out there that are using machine learning to make money in the\nmarkets, or is the general conclusion that it doesn&#39;t work (yet)?\n\nIn particular, do you think that anyone is using evolutionary algorithms to\nmake money? \n\nWe constantly hear about people working on the problem, and there are rumors\nthat it works, but I have not gotten a general sense of whether it is known\nthat it works, or known that it doesn&#39;t.\n\nPS. You may find this interesting:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24trading.html?_r=1&em\n\nI wonder if all of this automated trading hand coded, or if it is something\nmore based on machine learning (and possibly Eas)...\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: shanemcdonaldryan &lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 13:59:08 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Time Series Prediction and NEAT\n&gt; \n&gt; Spent quite a bit of time working on this problem. Not too successful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Go to Metatrader4.com and learn the meta trader language (pretty much c). It\n&gt; will allow you create scripts and backtest with historical data to see how\n&gt; they perform. If you write a DLL you can even call NEAT via Metatrader.\n&gt; \n&gt; I used to work for a company trading futures and I can tell you all the easy\n&gt; data mining type trading strategies are tapped out. You&#39;ll have to find\n&gt; something interesting to make it work. Ideally some sort of leading indicator\n&gt; or something very strongly co-ordinated so you can do pairs trading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sliding window would be my advise. But that is a pretty inconsequential detail\n&gt; as you&#39;ll need much more than a sliding window to make money in my experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tell me how you do and I can give you my advice. Though take it with a grain\n&gt; of salt because I didn&#39;t make my billions through this :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shane\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gururise&quot; &lt;gururise@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt; Browsing the archives, its obvious other&#39;s have worked on this problem using\n&gt;&gt; NEAT with varying degrees of success.  I&#39;m using the rtNeat C++ package under\n&gt;&gt; linux and am trying to evolve a time-series predictor applicable to either\n&gt;&gt; the stock market or forex markets.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Most of the published research used Neural Networks trained via backprop.\n&gt;&gt; These networks typically used a sliding window technique. For example, if you\n&gt;&gt; have 1000 days of historical data, a sliding window of 100 would feed the\n&gt;&gt; first 100 days of data as input, and the 101st day would be the predicted\n&gt;&gt; output from the net. Then the window would slide by 1 day, and you feed the\n&gt;&gt; next 100 days and so on an so forth.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to use a similar technique with NEAT with very limited\n&gt;&gt; success.  For inputs, I use change in price and normalized volume.  The\n&gt;&gt; fitness function is basically the inverse of the mean squared error of the\n&gt;&gt; predicted outputs vs. the actual data.  The output is trying to predict the\n&gt;&gt; change in price at the next time period (it could be positive or negative).\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve also switched from the default sigmoid activation function to a bi-polar\n&gt;&gt; sigmoid activation that allows for outputs in the range of [-1,1].\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; How are others using NEAT for time series prediction?  Are you using a\n&gt;&gt; sliding window technique, or just have a large input with one output?  Has\n&gt;&gt; anyone had success using NEAT to evolve a time-series predictor?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
