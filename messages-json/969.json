Do you mean they don&#39;t change the behavior\nof the phenotype?\n\n&gt; Try inserting a few extra neurons in the\n&gt; middle of your brain and see whether is doesn&#39;t screw you up. \n\nActually, it would probably depend on where you added them, but from\nmy understanding adding a few neurons at random in an average human\nbrain wouldn&#39;t have much of an effect at all.  We lose something like\nan average of 200,000 neurons on a daily basis (out of tens of\nbillions).  I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that adding three or\nfour wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference.\n\nI think the addition of neurons in the ANNs we&#39;re dealing with has a\nmuch greater impact, since our network sizes are in the dozens of\nneurons and connections.\n\n&gt; I think it&#39;s an accomplishment to add structure that doesn&#39;t have a\n&gt; deleterious effect.  \n\nI&#39;m not so sure it is.  If enough of this neutral structure builds up\nover time, and a very small percentage of it is ever coopted for\nadaptive purposes, then it&#39;s an efficiency to both your search and to\nyour network activation.\n\nIf at some point a significant amount of that neutral structure is\nexploited by the network, then it might be worth it, but again, I&#39;m\nhighly skeptical of this.  I think it makes much more sense to try to\nonly keep around mutations that show an immediate payoff for fitness,\neven if it is slight.\n\n&gt; Mathematically, it enters the solution into\n&gt; a part of new higher-dimensional space which can now be explored\n&gt; safely since it is starting at a robust point, i.e. a point where\n&gt; the extra dimensions have been optimized not to interfere with\n&gt; normal functionality.  \n\nBut as you point out, you are now in a higher-dimensional space, and\nunless the benefits of adding more time and energy to the search\noutweigh the cost, you&#39;re wasting valuable resources.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
