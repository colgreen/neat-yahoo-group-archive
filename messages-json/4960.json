I went to grad school at UT Austin with=\r\n Shimon Whiteson, who is now an assistant professor at the University of Am=\r\nsterdam (and who may still be reading this group).  It happens that his bro=\r\nther Daniel Whiteson is a physicist who I believe was working at Fermilab. =\r\n Daniel was therefore familiar with the deeper issues in the top quark prob=\r\nlem, and Shimon came to realize through speaking to his brother that they n=\r\needed some kind of learning technique.  I believe Shimon had the insight th=\r\nat a non-supervised approach (i.e. something that does not require targets =\r\nlike backprop) could potentially use fitness to optimize for the kind of an=\r\nswers that are really desired, rather than just for accuracy.  So for that =\r\npurpose NEAT was a good fit.  \n\nThey ended up actually running some such ex=\r\nperiments and seeing that it seemed to work well.  Somehow, that idea did u=\r\nltimately become accepted enough at the accelerator that apparently the hun=\r\ndreds of authors of that paper adopted it as the primary method for this pr=\r\noblem and it became a part of their methodology.  \n\nI was surprised of cour=\r\nse by how far it got.  Shimon has pointed out that maybe some other neuroev=\r\nolution approach or even some other machine learning approach could also ha=\r\nve done well (although Fermilab did try several approaches that did not far=\r\ne as well as NEAT at the time).  In a sense it may be luck for NEAT that NE=\r\nAT happened to be what was on hand.  However, in any case, it is to NEAT&#39;s =\r\ncredit that it was indeed the approach used for this accomplishment.\n\nken\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009=\r\n/11/29 Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One recent interesting real-world suc=\r\ncess is the most accurate measurement yet of the top quark mass at the Ferm=\r\nilab accelerator:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, that was very modestly put :) Seems to me t=\r\nhat this is a very\n&gt; prominent piece of research that could be a real boon =\r\nto NEAT in terms\n&gt; of exposure in the wider research community. I wonder wh=\r\nat the back\n&gt; story is there - perhaps Aaltonen or one of the other authors=\r\n arived\n&gt; at the conclusion that they needed something akin to neuro evolut=\r\nion\n&gt; and discovered NEAT via a search. Or perhaps there was some connectio=\r\nn\n&gt; at a cross discipline conference?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I feel like congratulati=\r\nons are in order.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
