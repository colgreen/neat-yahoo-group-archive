And am I on the same track as you here? \n&gt; If I am not, what is your reasons for desiring\n&gt; connections back to the input nodes outside the\n&gt; scope of LI?\n\nYeah, we&#39;re on the same track. :)\n\nYou bring up the utility of input nodes connection to\none another, but one might want a network in which\noutput values are fed back into input nodes.  Same\nwith hidden nodes.  Basically, recurrent connections\nare ways of holding information in memory, and there\nare probably many, many cases in which something held\nin the memory of the network may be effective in\nadjusting the input into the network.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
