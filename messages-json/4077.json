As some of you know from experience,\n&gt; evolving b=\r\nlack and white pictures with CPPN-like representations is\n&gt; fairly straight=\r\nforward, but adding color is a major challenge.  \nThanks\n&gt; in large part to=\r\n Nick Beato, who did the actual implementation on \nthe\n&gt; applet after many =\r\ngroup discussions, we now have an intuitive and \nfun\n&gt; color evolution syst=\r\nem that actually works.  An important aspect of\n&gt; our color system for the =\r\ncontinuity of the site is that it allows \nyou\n&gt; begin with one of the preex=\r\nisting black and white images (if you \nwant)\n&gt; and it will evolve color int=\r\no it seamlessly.  So all the existing\n&gt; images can now be colorized!\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\ne&#39;ve just begun to start publishing some color images, which you \ncan\n&gt; see=\r\n under our Newest Images category:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/imagedisplay.=\r\nphp?type=3DCREATED&page=3D0\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, in case you did not know, Picb=\r\nreeder also allows \nanonymous\n&gt; publishing, so you don&#39;t need an account to=\r\n play with and even \npublish\n&gt; color pictures.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
