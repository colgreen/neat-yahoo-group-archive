The ANN is complicated and large!  But I think\nthat&#39;s necessary.  Darren has solved a problem of the\ntype requiring active use of memory, after the weights\nare fixed.  The problem of pattern recognition by\nlooking at only part of the pattern, and then\nscanning, requires remembering what was seen.  This\nmay be the most difficult problem of this nature that\nhas been solved.  So, I am impressed.\n\nThe picture is too complex for me to interpret.  I\nwould like to know how many recurrent connections\nthere are, how many total weights & biases, and how\nmany neurons.  \n\nI might try to do this with one of my recurrent binary nets.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
