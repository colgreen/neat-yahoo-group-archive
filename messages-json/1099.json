I am doing my MTech\n&gt;thesis on REACHING WITH A ROBOTIC MANUPULATOR WITH\n&gt;FEEDBACK, at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur\n&gt;(India).\n&gt;After going through your work (NEAT), I have a small\n&gt;query which is as below:\n&gt; Can NEAT evolve the required network for the robotic\n&gt;manupulator(2D) to reach any point in the space\n&gt;without collision? If yes please guide me.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHi,\n\nCould you describe the problem in more detail? e.g. when you say that \nthe manipulator is 2D do you mean that the manipulator moves on an x,y \naxis and can pick up and drop objects in a 2D plane? Are there objects \nof  differents shapes and sizes that need to be detected by the network?\n\nIt&#39;s possible NEAT could evolve a network for your problem but you \nreally need to simulate the problem in code for a NEAT experiment. Is \nthere existing simulation code you could use?\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
