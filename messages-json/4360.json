I understand your motivatio=\r\nns and\nappreciate the idea.  You are interested in being able to formalize\n=\r\nencodings so that they can be expressed in a way that is better\nunderstood.=\r\n  I do not have any disagreement with this idea.  My\nuncertainty was only d=\r\nirected at grammatical encoding in particular\nand its search space-related =\r\nproperties.  I think perhaps my use of\nthe word &quot;formal&quot; seemed to be an at=\r\ntack on formalization in general,\nwhich was not intended.\n\nBy the way, have=\r\n you thought about whether your approach can describe\nDNA encoding?  Do you=\r\n think it should be able to?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jean-Baptis=\r\nte Mouret / Mandor\n&lt;mandor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \t\tHi Ken.,\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Kenneth S=\r\ntanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not dismissing GE, but I would want to h=\r\near an argument\n&gt; &gt; supporting it more from the encoding and search spaces =\r\nside rather\n&gt; &gt; than from the formal languages side.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you mix t=\r\nwo concepts: the tool used to express encodings and\n&gt; the encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; An=\r\ny encoding will be expressed in a form and I think you will agree\n&gt; that th=\r\nis form should be as formal as possible. A formal way to\n&gt; express encoding=\r\ns would allow us to rely on a solid basis as we would\n&gt; be able to reproduc=\r\ne experiments more easily and to draw a real\n&gt; picture of what our encoding=\r\n is (instead of relying on poorly defined\n&gt; concepts, figures, etc. to expl=\r\nain our work). For instance, a formal\n&gt; framework should make easy to defin=\r\ne variants of a same encoding to\n&gt; efficiently understand which biasesre us=\r\neful for a given class of\n&gt; problems. Moreover, once we have a good formali=\r\nsm, we can often think\n&gt; about more complex and abstract concepts.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;=\r\ns clear that the ideal formalism should allow to express any\n&gt; encoding: it=\r\n&#39;s a tool to explore encodings (at least a family of\n&gt; encodings) and to mo=\r\ndify the search space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, I think that designing such a formalis=\r\nm would be a decisive\n&gt; step to make future progress in our field because w=\r\ne really need a\n&gt; more solid basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the next question is: which fo=\r\nrmalism? We proposed (in the linked\n&gt; paper) to use attribute grammars and =\r\noperators inspired by genetic\n&gt; programming. They are powerful and many con=\r\ncepts can be easily\n&gt; expressed. For example it&#39;s easy to define a direct-e=\r\nncoding for\n&gt; neural-networks. Howerver, some neuro-evolution systems (espe=\r\ncially\n&gt; NEAT) cannot be fully described because they are not only encoding=\r\ns\n&gt; (e.g. in NEAT, there&#39;s the diversity preservation mechanism). I&#39;m\n&gt; rea=\r\nlly not sure that it&#39;s the best possible formalism but it&#39;s almost\n&gt; the on=\r\nly one I know.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the previously linked paper, we designed a modular a=\r\nnd hierarchical\n&gt; encoding with this formalism (i.e. we designed a specific=\r\n\n&gt; grammar). This shows at least that it&#39;s possible to express such\n&gt; conce=\r\npts in the formalism. As a consequence, we now have a\n&gt; hierarchical and mo=\r\ndular encoding and we can ask the next question\n&gt; (the one you ask): are th=\r\nese features really needed in an encoding?\n&gt; Our first results show that it=\r\n can lead to interesting results but\n&gt; it&#39;s not a definitive answer. The po=\r\nint is to have a solid tool to\n&gt; investigate this question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; http://animatlab.lip6.fr/~moure=\r\nt\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
