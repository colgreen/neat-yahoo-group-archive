We are now trying to extract Torque from =\r\nNERO and \nreplace it with a public domain engine.\n\nI think your domain coul=\r\nd be interesting but I don&#39;t know enough \ndetails about the tools and obsta=\r\ncles to add a lot of comment.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Faisal Ab=\r\nidi&quot; &lt;fabidi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a Computer Science (Bachelors) sen=\r\nior, a student researcher \nfor the\n&gt; Microsoft Innovation Centre at FAST-NU=\r\n, Pakistan. I plan to extend \nSharpNEAT\n&gt; to include Swarm behavior for my =\r\nfinal year project (NEATswarm).\n&gt; \n&gt; My first application idea was to demon=\r\nstrate NEATswarm in self-\norganizing\n&gt; p2p grids, but I decided to choose a=\r\nnother app to reduce the scope \nof my\n&gt; project.\n&gt; \n&gt; I came up with Autono=\r\nmous Lemmings. In AL, the population \n(individuals\n&gt; tentatively represente=\r\nd as spheres) lives in a world in which \nevery object\n&gt; can be seen as eith=\r\ner an obstacle or a tool. They&#39;re goal is to \nreach some\n&gt; arbitrary rally =\r\npoint. The individuals must work together to \nnegotiate\n&gt; obstacles in a ma=\r\nnner a bit like the classic Lemmings game, but \nwithout\n&gt; human interaction=\r\n (and in a 3d world). I still have to work out a \nway to\n&gt; contrast it with=\r\n the the performance of uncoordinated behavior. \nUnder my\n&gt; current vision =\r\nof AL, without coordination the pop may simply fail \nto ever\n&gt; reach the ra=\r\nlly point (I imagine they won&#39;t be be willing to stand \non each\n&gt; other&#39;s h=\r\neads so some can reach higher ground). The world will be \ndynamic\n&gt; (unexpe=\r\ncted crumbling,  Suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; So there&#39;s the same real-time aspect tha=\r\nt&#39;s in the nero game.\n&gt; Ken posted back in 2005 : &quot;someone who registered f=\r\nor Torque \n(which is\n&gt; cheap) could then download NERO and rtNEAT and obtai=\r\nn a research-\nonly\n&gt; license&quot;\n&gt; I found no news that this event has happene=\r\nd yet, so is there some\n&gt; alternative to rtNEAT that I could use?\n&gt; \n&gt; If a=\r\nnyone could suggest a variation on the &quot;obstacle-negotiation \ntheme&quot;,\n&gt; tha=\r\nt&#39;d be really cool. I have a team of 4 including myself. No \nentire\n&gt; depar=\r\ntments collaborating here:).\n&gt; I found a post where Mridul mentioned doing =\r\nan MS thesis on Swarm\n&gt; Intelligence for NEAT. Interesting stuff in the con=\r\nversation. Any \npointers\n&gt; would be greatly appreciated. And any comments a=\r\nbout the very \nfoundation of\n&gt; my idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Faisal Abidi\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
