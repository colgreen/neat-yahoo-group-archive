More generally though right now I&#39;m trying to clarify in my\nhead \n&gt; whether a complex development stage has any benefits over and above \n&gt; systems like my own (with some kind indirect encoding)- or whether\nthe \n&gt; development phase seen in biology is purely a necessity of existing\nand \n&gt; trying to grow in the real, physical world with limited resources\nto \n&gt; hand. Having said that any system with indirect encoding has to go\n\nDefinitely that is the big question.  What aspects of biological\ndevelopment are computationally efficient and what aspects are\nnecessitated by physics?  That&#39;s one reason I wrote the Taxonomy\npaper, to point out that no one has sorted this out yet.  There are\nseveral properties of biological development that we really need to\nimplement with experiments to see how they contribute to evolvability.\nIt is almost certain, though, that some of these properties are\ncrucial, such as canalization (as you say below).\n \n&gt; At the same time I can see that a more indirect encoding might\npossibly \n&gt; support robustness in a genome encoding (canalization). This is\nwere \n&gt; things get difficult, certainly the relative positioning in my own \n&gt; system gives us some sort of canalization as does my connection\nstrategy \n&gt; (connect to the neuron closest to the end of the connection), but\nthese \n&gt; are quite simple techniques and trying to envisage how greater\nlevels of \n&gt; indirection would be beneficial is difficult.\n&gt; \n\nYes I agree that your technique, particularly the closest-connection\nrule, provides some kind of canalization.\n(Cangelosi et al. implemented a similar rule)  But one thing\nthat I&#39;ve been talking about with people at UT is the connection\nbetween canalization and self-organization.  That is, a system\nthat is canalized needs to be ability to self-organize, since \notherwise it is brittle.  And self-organization would seem to require\nsome kind of signaling among parts.  So signaling might be key.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; For now I&#39;m interested in implementing speciation and seeing what\nsort \n&gt; of impact it has. As in crossover I intend to compare the tree \n&gt; structures in order to generate a compatibility number with which\nto \n&gt; drive the speciation. This then should create a system very much\nlike \n&gt; NEAT but with the ability to complexify - that&#39;s the theory anyhow\n:-)\n&gt; \n\nThat sounds like it will be quite interesting.  But when you said,\n&quot;NEAT but with the ability to complexify,&quot; did you mean &quot;but without\nthe ability to complexify?&quot;  I&#39;m not clear how complexification enters\ninto your system?\n\nAlso, are you putting in some kind of historical marking system?  If\nnot, how can you implement accurate speciation?  Similar looking trees\ncan have quite different meanings,can&#39;t they?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
