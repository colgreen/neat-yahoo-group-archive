Let me expand on it a bit.\n\nOne of the cur=\r\nrently leading problems in computational chemistry or\nmolecular modeling is=\r\n coming up with a method to predict the affinity\nof a small molecule for th=\r\ne binding site of a protein.  In the case\nwhere you have a model of the bin=\r\nding site (typically from a crystal\nstructure), there are tools that will a=\r\nccurately position a small\nmolecule into the binding site, however, there i=\r\ns not a good scoring\nfunction that will give you an estimate of the activit=\r\ny that small\nmolecule will have against the protein.  It seems counter-intu=\r\nitive -\nwe can accurately place the molecule in the right 3D conformation i=\r\nnto\nthe 3D binding site, but we can&#39;t really tell you how active it will\nbe=\r\n.  In other cases you do not have a model of the protein.  In both\ncases yo=\r\nu may have a number of compounds for which the activity is known.\n\nFor smal=\r\nl molecules to bind to a protein/enzyme, they will be required\nto make a nu=\r\nmber of interactions with that protein.  This implies that\nthey must be the=\r\n correct shape, obviously, but they must also place\nthe correct types of at=\r\noms/groups in the right place to make those\ninteractions.  Often, the bulk =\r\nof the compound is used to place things\ninto the right locations in order t=\r\no get an interaction - to get the\nright shape.\n\nGiven the CPPN&#39;s ability to=\r\n capture spatial relationships, I&#39;m\nwondering if it could be used as an eva=\r\nluator for the strength of an\ninteraction of this sort.  The spatial relati=\r\nonships of interest may\nstem from the small molecules themselves, the prote=\r\nin binding site, or\na combination of the two.  All of this is going on in a=\r\n 3D space\ndefined by the protein binding site.\n\nObviously I need to think a=\r\nbout this further, but there very well may\nbe something useful here that ha=\r\nsn&#39;t yet been tried.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot;=\r\n &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kirk, I think that&#39;s a very interesting potentia=\r\nl application area.  \n&gt; Let me make sure I&#39;m understanding how it would wor=\r\nk.  You are saying\n&gt; that you might capture the shape of a protein binding =\r\nregion (or some\n&gt; other important region) with a CPPN and then use that CPP=\r\nN-encoded\n&gt; model to test other chemical compounds?  \n&gt; \n&gt; But if you alrea=\r\ndy have a model of the intended shape, what additional\n&gt; capability would t=\r\nhe CPPN provide other than encoding the 3D model\n&gt; that you already have?  =\r\nOr do you mean you might try creating new\n&gt; shapes with the CPPN that you h=\r\naven&#39;t thought of and see how they\n&gt; react with known compounds?  There are=\r\n probably other ways it could go\n&gt; as well, but I&#39;m curious from the point =\r\nof view of computational\n&gt; chemistry where the most exciting opportunity wo=\r\nuld be.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdeli=\r\nsle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I may be over-interpreting the CPPN process, but it st=\r\nimulated a few\n&gt; &gt; ideas.  I work in the field of Computational Chemistry a=\r\nnd my in my\n&gt; &gt; day to day operations I deal with drug-like chemical compou=\r\nnds.  The\n&gt; &gt; 3D shape of a chemical is a principle determining factor of i=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; activity.  On top of 3D shape, you have different functional groups\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that impart different properties.  For example, let&#39;s say the shape is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; just right to bind to a particular enzyme (and prevent it from running\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; amok) but you need an oxygen atom at a particular location, or a\n&gt; &gt; ni=\r\ntrogen, or any atom with a hydrogen attached, etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are two w=\r\nays to get to this type of information.  First is\n&gt; &gt; having a large collec=\r\ntion of chemicals with a known endpoint.  For\n&gt; &gt; this I usually apply the =\r\nstandard pattern recognition tools.  Another\n&gt; &gt; more difficult approach is=\r\n when you don&#39;t have much data for\n&gt; &gt; chemicals, but you know the 3D struc=\r\nture of the enzyme and where you\n&gt; &gt; want your chemical to bind.  I&#39;m wonde=\r\nring if there is an application\n&gt; &gt; for CPPNs here.  Can the CPPN capture t=\r\nhe shape of the site along with\n&gt; &gt; the essential properties based on the p=\r\nrotein itself and then be used\n&gt; &gt; to assess different chemical compounds t=\r\nhat have not yet been tested -\n&gt; &gt; try to predict their activities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Any thoughts??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Kirk\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kirk, what is your id=\r\nea for applying CPPNs to pattern\nrecognition?  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am not sure I follow=\r\ned exactly how the CPPN would be connected\nto the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neural network?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Peter mentioned, we have used the idea of CPPNs to represent\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; connectivity patterns rather than the spatial patterns you saw\nin the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN paper.  These connectivity patterns can then be interpreted of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; neural network connectivity patterns, which means you can evolve\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n neural networks with regularities in their connectivities. \nThere are\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; currently four papers on this approach to evolving ANNs with CPPNs,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n which is called HyperNEAT.
