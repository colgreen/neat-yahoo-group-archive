My point was only that CPPNs can abstract away \nthe temporal=\r\n unfolding and local interaction that are usually \nassociated with developm=\r\nent.  You are saying something that does not \nseem in opposition to this po=\r\nint, but I may be misunderstanding.  It \nseems you are saying that &quot;pattern=\r\n recognition&quot; gives a powerful \ncapability to traditional developmental sys=\r\ntems in terms of being \nable to target mutations to specific areas.  I woul=\r\nd not disagree \nwith that point.\n\nHowever, what I would say, which may simp=\r\nly be consistent with what \nyou are saying, is that CPPNs abstract away the=\r\n need for there to be \nsuch pattern recognition in order to get either glob=\r\nal or local \ntargeted mutations.  I still submit that the targeted mutation=\r\ns to \nwhich you are referring ultimately hinge on &quot;where am I?&quot;  Because \nh=\r\now did the liver cell ultimately figure out it was a liver cell?  \nIt&#39;s bec=\r\nause of its neighbors, and so forth.  It&#39;s all context-\ndependent.\n\nOn the =\r\nother hand, in the CPPN, the liver is a local coordinate \nframe (i.e. some =\r\ninternal node) that is built upon (i.e. a function \nof) other coordinate fr=\r\names.  So in effect the same thing is going \non, just in a different way.  =\r\nBut ultimately it &quot;knows&quot; it is a \nliver cell in either case.  In the CPPN =\r\nthis knowledge is simply \nencapsulated as the node in the CPPN itself where=\r\n the coordinate \nframe is represented.  A mutation thereabout will effect o=\r\nnly those \ncells within that coordinate frame.  So you get targeted mutatio=\r\nns \njust as well without &quot;pattern recognition.&quot;\n\nI think what I&#39;m saying is=\r\n consistent with the results that you cite \nfrom your paper since I fully b=\r\nelieve that IF you are using a \ntraditional developmental encoding, &quot;patter=\r\nn recognition&quot; indeed \ncarries the benefits you cite.  So I expect you coul=\r\nd demonstrate it \nexperimentally. \n\nI think this is a great discussion to h=\r\nave.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one (small) point of clarification to add to you=\r\nr \nexposition  \n&gt; here:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;genes essentially &#39;pattern recognize&#39; certa=\r\nin areas in the\n&gt; &gt; organism&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is absolutely correct for biolog=\r\nical organisms, and for\n&gt; &gt; iterated developmental systems in general.  How=\r\never, the deep\n&gt; &gt; question is *why* should they need to &quot;pattern recognize=\r\n&quot; certain\n&gt; &gt; areas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And the answer is because they need to know wh=\r\nere they are.  In\n&gt; &gt; effect, in the physical universe, there is no intrins=\r\nic \ncoordinate\n&gt; &gt; system that cells can query to ask their location.  Thus=\r\n, they \nmust\n&gt; &gt; develop elaborate and ad hoc ways of communicating to each=\r\n \nother, as\n&gt; &gt; a group, where everyone is.  I send my neighbor signals, my=\r\n \nneighbor\n&gt; &gt; sends me signals back, and we negotiate our roles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\ny undoubtedly controversial contention is that the \nquestion &quot;where\n&gt; &gt; am =\r\nI?&quot; is the ONLY reason that such negotation is necessary.  If \nyou\n&gt; &gt; didn=\r\n&#39;t have to ask that question, then you would not need to \ntalk to\n&gt; &gt; your =\r\nneighbors in order to determine your role.  Rather, you \ncould\n&gt; &gt; just com=\r\npute your role as a function of your known\n&gt; &gt; coordinate/position in the w=\r\norld.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your answer to &quot;why we need to pattern recognize&quot; is a little  \n=\r\n&gt; incomplete. Basically you&#39;ve only answered this from the cell&#39;s  \n&gt; persp=\r\nective. Lets consider &quot;pattern recognize&quot; from the \nperspective  \n&gt; of the =\r\ndevelopmental program instead of the cell. Then the main  \n&gt; question is &quot;h=\r\now do I select a bunch of cells that match some  \n&gt; property?&quot; That is, I w=\r\nant to select some contiguous region, \ne.g.,  \n&gt; &quot;toe cells&quot; or &quot;heart cell=\r\ns&quot; or maybe I want to select something \nmore  \n&gt; developmentally useful, e.=\r\ng. &quot;epithelial cells&quot; or &quot;cells in some  \n&gt; stripe pattern along the HOX ax=\r\nis.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is this useful? Because then we can make mutations that \naffe=\r\nct  \n&gt; these areas and no others, i.e. mutation selectivity that is \ndefine=\r\nd  \n&gt; for some (hopefully) useful phenotypic axes of variation. A lot \nof  =\r\n\n&gt; useful things fall out naturally from this idea, like modularity \nor  \n&gt;=\r\n evolvability (this is where I cite my GECCO 2007 paper, which is \nnot  \n&gt; =\r\nyet on the web). In CPPN terms it would be like being able to \nselect,  \n&gt; =\r\nsay, all the black stripes in a sine grating, but not the white \nones.  \n&gt; =\r\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, CPPNs support this idea of regional \nselection  \n&gt; ver=\r\ny nicely, so I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t mention it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I tot=\r\nally agree that doing away with the &quot;negotiation&quot; \nstep  \n&gt; required for de=\r\nvelopmental systems using purely local interactions \nis  \n&gt; a useful optimi=\r\nzation, but I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to say that \nbeing  \n&gt; able to &quot;pattern =\r\nrecognize&quot; certain areas serves the sole purpose \nof  \n&gt; localization with =\r\nrespect to only the global coordinate system.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll go into this issue =\r\nin more detail in my talk at GECCO, but I  \n&gt; think its very important, and=\r\n our empirical results seem to back \nit  \n&gt; up quite strongly.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Joe\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
