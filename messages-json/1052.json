But for those\n&gt; who want to forge ahead, and actually try to capture realism, this\n&gt; might be a very interesting experimental domain.\n\nYou&#39;d pretty much have to have interaction with humans for the \nfitness function, right?  I doubt there&#39;s any fully automated way of \nclosing that final 1%.  But, maybe NPCs in games with rich 3D \nenvironments or the avatar on an online help system could get \nfeedback from the user regarding how much the character gives them \nthe willies.\n\n\n"}}
