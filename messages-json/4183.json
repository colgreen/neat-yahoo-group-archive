Good luck \ncreating a training set for a mobile robot. So, I dev=\r\neloped a few \nmethods to emulate a training set, effectively evolve the net=\r\nwork \ndynamically. But, this had several obvious deficiencies. I soon found=\r\n \nNEAT, rtNEAT, and hyperNEAT. \n\nFrom what I understand after reading sever=\r\nal publications and \nexperimenting with some established demonstrations, I =\r\nfound the the \nNEAT model is quite useful, but also presents several obstac=\r\nles of \nits own. In a physical robot, evolving networks is not very \npracti=\r\ncal. So, after some careful consideration, I came up with a \nsolution.\n\nThe=\r\n solution was to have two environments. One drives the robot with \na basic =\r\nhyperNEAT neural network, while a second environment runs in \na simulated e=\r\nnvironment. The NEAT in the simulation will be allowed \nto evolve until a t=\r\nhreshold is met for a Fitness improvement. When \nthis threshold is achieved=\r\n, that neural network is transitioned to \nthe live robot, and the simulatio=\r\nn is given fresh environment data \nfrom the sensors, and the cycle begins a=\r\ngain. This will allow the \nNEAT to evolve, and still allow for good operati=\r\non of the robot. \n\nA lot of this is going to be done in MRDS to minimise co=\r\nmputation in \nthe robot, and also take advantage of the physics and other \n=\r\ncomponents of the simulation environment.\n\nThis is the model I am going to =\r\ntry to implement, which then leads me \nto my question.\n\nQuestion 1:\nI have =\r\nbeen able to find quite a bit of documentation on the various \nforms of NEA=\r\nT. But, I have been able to find no information on how to \nactually use NEA=\r\nT in code. Perhaps I am not looking in the right \nplaces. Hopefully you can=\r\n point me in the right direction. \n\nQuestion 2:\nHas anybody done any work a=\r\nlong this line? I see many projects that \nuse NEAT for various organism sim=\r\nulations and such, but not really \nanything to drive a physical robot. I wo=\r\nuld appreciate any help on \nthis.\n\n\n"}}
