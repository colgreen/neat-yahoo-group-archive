In the new\ninitialise=\r\n() method, call super.initialise(0 and then create the robot\nNNs from the G=\r\nA population. You can then put these in an arena where\nyou feed the nets re=\r\nalt time inputs eg speed, direction etc.  As your\nbot goes around it will b=\r\ne given a raw score based on your criteria. \nAssign this score to the nets =\r\nChromosome.  Your fitness function then\nbecomes very simple. \n\n\tpublic doub=\r\nle evaluate(Chromosome genoType) {\n\t\treturn (genoType.fitness());\n\t}\n\nIs al=\r\nl it needs to be.  The evolution process then takes place as\nnormal and a n=\r\new generation is born.\n\nIf you want me to look over any code, feel free to =\r\nemail it to me.\n\nI will place a tutorial up soon (work is busy - family is =\r\nyoung - time\nis therefore short) that shows how to evolve a chess player. \n=\r\nDifferent domain, but similar principals in that there is no input data.\n\nA=\r\nny queries, please ask.  I want this software to be as useful as\npossible. =\r\n \n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;iwaneicher&quot; &lt;reicher@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; We&#39;re two students and our task is to find a NN that is able=\r\n to\n&gt; control a hexapod robot. To find a suitable NN, we want to use a\n&gt; Ge=\r\nnetic Algorithm. Inputs for the NN are leg positions, ground contact\n&gt; sens=\r\nors for each leg, desired walking speed and so on. Outputs of the\n&gt; NN are =\r\nthe next positions for all the joints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Know my question:\n&gt; Within the =\r\nXOR-Example (I runned NEATGATrainingManager) the Neural Net\n&gt; will be train=\r\ned with data provided by the xor/xor.csv file. \n&gt; In our Application (robot=\r\n) we don&#39;t have any training data available,\n&gt; we just want to evolve neura=\r\nl networks and evaluate them by applying\n&gt; the fitness function. (for examp=\r\nle how fast walks the robot,\n&gt; direction, etc.) How do we start NEAT, so th=\r\nat it does not need a\n&gt; trainig set? Is there an example/tutorial available=\r\n that shows how to\n&gt; use NEAT without a training set? Unfortunately, I coul=\r\ndn&#39;t work it out\n&gt; so far how to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot for any informati=\r\non!\n&gt; \n&gt; Iwan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
