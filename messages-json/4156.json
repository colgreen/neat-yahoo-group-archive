I\n&gt;&gt; have heard a bit about it but I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s being used for or\n&gt;&gt; whether it is intended to be a general-purpose tool for the public?\n&gt; \n&gt; We started our own Python implementation because we felt that&#39;s easier\n&gt; to extend and develop. I&#39;ve also taken a look at PyNEAT (another older\n&gt; NEAT Python version) but I couldn&#39;t make it work. It seems that it&#39;s\n&gt; not being developed any longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our version is closely based on your C++ sources and the great\n&gt; Simmerson&#39;s Java version. But our approach was a modular one. Well,\n&gt; any OOP based version is modular enough, but we&#39;ve tried to separate\n&gt; the concept of the experiment from the main code, meaning that you\n&gt; basically need to import the libraries, specify the config parameters\n&gt; and write a fitness function.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although everything seems to be working (including the XOR example),\n&gt; it&#39;s not &quot;officially&quot; released since I need to finish the FAQ and add\n&gt; a basic tutorial. But it&#39;s rather simple to checkout from the SVN\n&gt; repository and play with the XOR example. The only requirement is\n&gt; Python 2.5 (you still need some other libraries in order to plot the\n&gt; results).\n&gt; \n&gt; The NEAT-Python project URL is: http://code.google.com/p/neat-python\n&gt; (licensed under GPLv3)\n&gt; \n&gt; The name &quot;NEAT-Python&quot; is not a a very good one, I&#39;d really like to\n&gt; have something similar to PyNEAT, but that&#39;s already taken.\n&gt; Suggestions are welcome!\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, Peter B. has been working with NEAT-Python for a while now\n&gt; (he&#39;s on this group).\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If so, would you like me to link it from the NEAT Users page and my\n&gt;&gt; homepage?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure, that will help the project to reach a wider audience :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Cesar\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G. Miguel&quot; &lt;cesar.gomes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Derek,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; A friend of mine has implemented an InF module (as well as the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Izhikevich spiking model) for our NEAT Python project. I&#39;m not very\n&gt;&gt;&gt; familiar with them, but she&#39;s been working with these models in her\n&gt;&gt;&gt; research.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; You can browse the source code of our project here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://code.google.com/p/neat-python/source/browse -- what you want is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in /trunk/neat/ifnn. The code is a mix of Python and C++, but there is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a &quot;pure python&quot; version of the InF and some C++ bindings. You can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; easily understand the sources since Python is &quot;almost&quot; like\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pseudo-code :-)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hope it helps!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Cesar\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 1:45 AM, Derek James &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey all,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve just recently started working with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neurons, and since I don&#39;t have any prior experience with them and I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; relying on written resources, I thought I&#39;d post a quick question here\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to see if anybody else had done much work with them.
