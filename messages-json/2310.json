This \n&gt;is very like Colin&#39;s &quot;phased search who&#39;se exact name escapes me right now&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nActually I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called.\n\n&gt;\tThe way the works is simple, ever 5 or 10-thousand cycles, I iterate \n&gt;through every individual employing the hi-fi design principle.  (I call it \n&gt;this because of a story I read in some book, where the engineer says: &quot;I \n&gt;design the perfect hi-fi, management take components out until it stops \n&gt;working, then they put the last component back and sell it&quot;).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIn the software industry we just sell the product broken. That&#39;s \nprobably a Dilbert cartoon I expect.\n\n&gt;\tBasically each deletable feature (chromosome, rule or gene) of a genome is \n&gt;numbered and I run through them all, temporarily deleting them, \n&gt;recalculating the fitness, and then only putting them back if the fitness \n&gt;was reduced.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tTo make this run in reasonable time, I have had to employ some heuristics.\n&gt;\n&gt;[...] When trimming dead wood, I try trimming each \n&gt;feature the first two times it comes up (using its birth-date, the current \n&gt;cycle and the known frequency of trimming phases) and if it survives both \n&gt;of those, I assume it is important and I do not try to trim it again until \n&gt;the 10th trim-cycle after its birth.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I like it, oh was this the bit that was my idea? Actually \nSharpNEAT&#39;s GUI has an &#39;Enable weight fixing&#39; check box, which basically \nmeans fix any connection that survived a pruning phase, permanently. \nSubsequently both the pruning algorithm and the weight mutation routines \navoid these fixed connections. Dropping the fixed state after a few gens \nsounds like a good idea, although I was thinking about a more thorough \nrevision of how this system worked, perhaps using connection &#39;hardness&#39; \nvalues that change over time and which tell us how often we should \nperturb a weight or consider it for pruning. This I think is something \nelse that has been discussed before, anyway more on that another day.\n\n&gt;\tAnyway, this seems to keep the bload right down and also, I often seem to \n&gt;get fitness bursts just after trimming, which I attribute to cross-over \n&gt;become far more effective between individuals with no wasted genes...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYes that is a common observation of mine also. It may be crossover, in \nmy write-up I think I attributed this phenomenon to the deletion of \n&#39;deleterious structures&#39; or something like that, basically connections \nthat feed useless noise into networks.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
