I&#39;ve been discussing\nthis with my friend and we don&#39;t understand how innovation numbers are\nassigned to mutations.\n\nSuppose a mutation links node n to node m. If another mutation linking\nthese nodes occurs in the same generation, they are both assigned the\nsame innovation number, this part was clear. But what if a mutation\nlinking the same nodes occurs 100 generations later? Is it assigned\nthe same innovation number or a different one?\n\nI&#39;ve read Stanley&#39;s original C++ code and it seems that the new\nmutation is assigned a new innovation number, which makes sense to me,\nbecause the two genes are not homologous and tracking homology among\ngenes is the whole point of innovation numbers, right? But looking at\na Python and a Java implementation, both have a global list of\nmutations and will assign the same innovation number to a mutation\nlinking the same nodes. In this case, don&#39;t innovation numbers become\nuseless? All we need to know to align genes for reproduction is which\nnodes are getting linked by a certain mutation. Also we could be\naligning genes that have completely different roles in completely\ndifferent network architectures. It seems wrong to me.\n\nSo does anyone know how this should be done and why?\n\nThanks,\nCarolina\n\n"}}
