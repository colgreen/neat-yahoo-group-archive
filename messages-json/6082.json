Howev=\r\ner, in the video you can see that disk 1, 2 and 3 remain at their locations=\r\n (after a short journey of disk 2). This makes to me more sense as it seems=\r\n to be a state that offers the most future directions (highest entropy in f=\r\nuture states).\n\nHow does the validation in the stock-market example look li=\r\nke? \n\nAn important variable in their model seems to be tau (the time interv=\r\nal for which future states are evaluated). The decisions of the algorithm s=\r\neem to heavily depend on tau. If tau is too short, the algorithm might fail=\r\n to see the future entropy of a given solution. If tau is too long, the sea=\r\nrch becomes impractical. \n \nThe authors associate their algorithm with &quot;ada=\r\nptive behavior&quot; and the &quot;cognitive niche&quot;, which is difficult for several r=\r\neasons \n\nThe term &quot;cognitive niche&quot; itself is controverse. It refers more t=\r\no goal-oriented action planning and execution, involving communication (lan=\r\nguage in particular) and cooperation. The algorithm by Wissner-Gross might =\r\nshow behaviour that resembles natural behaviour in some limited simulations=\r\n but it does not mechanistically explain (and this is what they somehow cla=\r\nim) natural behaviour (of course, implicitly I assume that natural organism=\r\ns are not driven by causal entropic forces).\n\nI suppose while a human artis=\r\nt would collect all colouring and brushes to paint a picture and then paint=\r\ns a picture, an entropica artist would collect all colouring and brushes an=\r\nd then remain in a stable state to keep all possible future histories alive=\r\n (unless you increase tau to see that painting a picture brings you into a =\r\nstate with future histories that have even higher entropy). \n\nBest,\nMartin =\r\n\n\n\n"}}
