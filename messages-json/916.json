So, yes, the network &quot;forgets&quot; previous states.\n&gt; Allow the recurrent connections to be &#39;unstable.&#39; This may not seem\n&gt; sane, but remember, you can assume a network will behave robustly \nwhen\n&gt; you finish training it. If you train it to play a game, and memory \nhas\n&gt; an effect on it&#39;s fitness, you will most likely develop memory \nthrough\n&gt; recurrent connections that don&#39;t behave well when you ask them to \ndo\n&gt; something else, like repeatedly giving it the same gamestate, \nwhich is\n&gt; what stabalization does. Stabalization could be a usefull tool to\n&gt; improve fitness in a game where for each arangment of the board, \nthere\n&gt; is one best next move. An example might be the little triangle \npegboards\n&gt; where you jump pegs until only one peg is left. Competitive games\n&gt; usually don&#39;t have a single best move.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s my take.\n&gt; chad\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-----Original Message-----&gt; \n&gt; From: Robert Winkel\n&gt; Sent: 5/29/2004 8:39:11 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Network Stabilization Question\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve got another question regarding network stabilization.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying an experiment where memory is important.\n&gt; So, if I allow my network to stabilize, does this mean that\n&gt; it has &quot;forgotten&quot; past activations? If so, what approach\n&gt; should I take with relaxation? Set a specific depth? The\n&gt; in-built depth calculation routines are fairly pointless since\n&gt; memory implies recurrency and therefore any viable network\n&gt; will cause it to infinitely loop (well, up to a depth of 100)\n&gt; and always output 10.\n&gt; \n&gt; Say I wanted to do something like evolve networks to play\n&gt; a game which required a memory of the previous 5 activations\n&gt; in order for it to play well. Would a good relaxation value be\n&gt; 5? 6? Or is there a smarter way to approach this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Bull.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Open an Online Savings Account today & collect a bonus $30*! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
