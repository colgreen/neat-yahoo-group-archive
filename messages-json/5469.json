I suppose that at higher resolut=\r\nions the (representation of the) shapes become increasingly different (up t=\r\no a point depending on the similarity and complexity of the images, anyway)=\r\n and so it&#39;s easier to evolve a function that can differentiate between the=\r\nm.\n\nI don&#39;t know how I forgot the 3D representation experiment you performe=\r\nd; I read that paper (at least once), but I guess some time before I wrote =\r\nmy thesis! I just had another look at it, and am wondering what the results=\r\n would have been like for:\n * differently engineered 3D representations, eg=\r\n the &quot;The HipIO joint was placed just below the HipFB joint in the Z dimens=\r\nion&quot;, what would have happened if these were more widely separated?, and \n =\r\n* randomised 3D representations.\nDid you perform any other experiments (in =\r\nlarge or small numbers) using 3D representations? This is an area I&#39;d like =\r\nto explore some more.\n\nCheers,\nOliver\n\n\n\n\n"}}
