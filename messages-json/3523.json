Papers on NEAT says that it starts\nwith m=\r\ninimal networks, inputs fully connected to outputs, and\naccompanying diagra=\r\nms would show that the outputs are not connected to\nother outputs. However,=\r\n in the JNEAT package i used, i noticed that\noutputs are also linked to hig=\r\nher id outputs when i initalized the\npopulation with 0 hidden nodes ANN and=\r\n link probability of 1. Which\none is the correct version? which one is more=\r\n efficient?\n\nThanks. \n\n\n"}}
