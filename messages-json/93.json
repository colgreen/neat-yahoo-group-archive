Basically on close inspection of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; trees I can see a large number of redundant(neutral) nodes.\n&gt; Allowing\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you explain a little more what a &quot;neutral node&quot; is? Even a\n&gt; nonfunctional node should not cause too much problem if historical\n&gt; markings are used, since you know which neutral nodes came from\n&gt; which lineages. But I am not completely clear on what these nodes\n&gt; are and how they came to be.\n\nDue to the type of genome encoding I use it is possible to describe \nneurons that are not connected, either at all or perhaps connected but \nnot in a meaningful way. That&#39;s what I mean by neutral nodes in the \ngenome. Whether they are there or not does not affect a network&#39;s \nperformance on a given task. So as evolution progresses it is possible \nto aggregate neutral nodes unless some mechanism is used to keep the \nnumbers down. The obvious thing to do was to punish genomes with larger \nnumbers of nodes therefore preventing the number of nodes spiraling out \nof control. Now it seems that although this works (it keeps the number \nof nodes down) the punishment is quite weak and therefore large numbers \nof neutral nodes are still present in my populations - thus causing the \nlarge differences in compatibility number - thus causing speciation \nwhere perhaps it shouldn&#39;t.\n\nNow I suppose you could argue that the neutral nodes may have a positive \npurpose in that they may get connected to in future mutations. At the \nmoment though I just see the same basic genome being &#39;decorated&#39; with \nneutral nodes in many different ways - causing genomes that essentialy \ndescribe the same network to be placed in different species.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing to consider about speciation is that it goes hand in hand\n&gt; with complexification. In other words, speciation facilitates\n&gt; starting the entire population with a very small genome and\n&gt; complexifying from there. But if you *don&#39;t* start that way, then\n&gt; the effects of speciation are questionable, since many of the\n&gt; species will be protected without justification just because they\n&gt; happen to be in the initial population. \n\nI&#39;m not sure I agree. Although we give weaker genomes a chance by \nprotecting them in a species, overall, weak genomes and weak species \nwill be culled from the population. So if I create a population of \nrandom genomes then they will all be in a species of one to begin with - \nand the stronger genomes will progressively take over the population \nbased on their relative fitness.\n\n&gt; Does your system start\n&gt; minimally?\n\n\nI have initialisation routines for both ways - random and a population \nasexually reproduced from a single &#39;seed&#39; genome.\n\n&gt; [Stuff about a stepped punishment factor ]\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a sensible fix, but NEAT for example was designed to avoid\n&gt; the need for this kind of ad hoc fitness tinkering. If you start\n&gt; minimally and speciate, the system should tend towards minimality\n&gt; without the need for penalities.\n\nI think I&#39;m missing something! How do you prevent NEAT genomes/networks \nfrom growing out of control? After all a network may have thousands of \nneurons but only a couple of them may actually be performing the task at \nhand. Perhaps this is just a consequence of NEAT&#39;s speed - it doesn&#39;t \n(hasn&#39;t had to) evolve long enough to fall into this trap? How long do \nNEAT evolution runs normally last? From what I know so far I can only \nimagine that if we gave NEAT a problem that was too hard to solve and \nleft it to evolve for any considerable time then the genomes would just \nkeep getting longer - I&#39;m more than happy to be proved wrong though :)\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
