For example,\nits ant colony optimization algorithms broke numerous benchmark\nrecords and are now widely used in industry for routing, logistics\netc. - today entire conferences specialize on artificial ants. IDSIA\nis also the origin of the first mathematical theory of optimal\nuniversal artificial intelligence and self-referential universal\nproblem solvers. IDSIA&#39;s artificial recurrent neural networks learn to\nsolve numerous previous unlearnable sequence processing tasks through\ngradient descent, artificial evolution and other methods. Research\ntopics also include complexity and generalization issues, unsupervised\nlearning and information theory, forecasting, learning robots. IDSIA\nwas the smallest of the world&#39;s top ten AI labs listed in the 1997 &quot;X-\nLab Survey&quot; by Business Week magazine, and ranked in fourth place in\nthe category &quot;Computer Science - Biologically Inspired&quot;. IDSIA&#39;s most\nimportant work was done after 1997 though.\n\nFaustino Gomez\nSenior Researcher\nDalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence\nLugano, CH\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~tino\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
