Sort of low hanging fruit type problems if \nyou \n&gt; like that would f=\r\nurther demonstrate the effectiveness of CPPN&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be scanning the i=\r\nnternet for ideas on this but no doubt some \nof \n&gt; you have already discuss=\r\ned this and/or have some ideas on the \nmatter. \n&gt; Having just read Jason Ga=\r\nuci&#39;s + Ken&#39;s paper regarding the \n&gt; distinguishing of large and small obje=\r\ncts in a visual field it \nseems \n&gt; to me that CPPNs are ideally suited to s=\r\nuch visual tasks and that \n&gt; maybe there are some visual problem domains th=\r\nat would be \n&gt; appropriate. E.g. There&#39;s that old chestnut of detecting can=\r\ncer \ncells \n&gt; in slide cross sections - so improving accuracy on a well kno=\r\nwn \n&gt; problem domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
