Perhaps 8\n&gt; bits or even less? This would reduce the search space, but encourage larger structures.\n\nHi,\n\nStrictly speaking the signals and weights and already digitized in\nthat they&#39;re represented by a 32 bit floating point binary\nrepresentation (or 64bit for double precision). However your question\nessentially then becomes how much precision is necessary for a given\nproblem domain? and that&#39;s certainly an interesting question both from\nthe perspective of the maths of neural networks but also at the\nimplementation level where an 8 bit based ANN is is a lot less\ncomputing resource hungry compared to a 64bit one of the same\nstructural size/complexity.\n\nYou might be interested in the short article I wrote abotu\nimplementing neural nets with integer maths and /fixed/ point\narithmetic:\n\nhttp://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/integer_network.html\n\nIn terms of pushing NEAT to it&#39;s limits I think something like 16bit\nmaths running on CUDA or equivalent platforms is a logical goal in the\nnear term. There&#39;s potentially a three orders of magnitude speedup to\nbe achieved there.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
