I get abbreviation blindness sometimes)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Yeh I think that&#39;s right. These days Wikipedia has some info on these\n&gt;terms, but to be honest I think we need throw away all of these old\n&gt;terms and replace them with a proper classification system, since (to me\n&gt;anyway) all of these strategies are just variations on a theme.\n\nThat&#39;s probably a very cool idea, we could build in terms for the \nvarious things we already identified as coming in 47 different \nflavours, e.g. I had 8 different definitions for &quot;modular&quot; and we \nhave discussed several different forms of &quot;co-evolving&quot;...\n\nI&#39;m going to post about 47 different &quot;speciation&quot; strategies in a \nweek or so (that&#39;s on top of the areas we already covered)...\n\nOTOH, to get any wide usage (and such a system isn&#39;t useful unless it \nhas wide usage) you probably need some big name to push it at 2 or 3 \nbig conferences...\n\n&gt; &gt;       Generally, SLEAT runs fine up to the point where the PPS fitness\n&gt; &gt;(see my previous discussions) reaches about 90%.  Then it really\n&gt; &gt;starts to slow (never quite stopping, but how would I know...) and by\n&gt; &gt;the time it gets to around 92% the search is so slow that it becomes\n&gt; &gt;impractical to continue...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       How does that gel with folk&#39;s experience on similar problems?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Generally speaking I can confirm this observation. I think in your case\n&gt;the evaluation time is constant and it&#39;s the increasing complexity of\n&gt;the solutions that consumes time, yes? which is how I arrived at the\n&gt;phased pruning idea.\n\nNot really.  I mean at first that is what it is, the initial \nindividuals are so simple that they take no time to evaluate.  But my \n&quot;trim dead wood&quot; process does keep the size growth to a reasonable \nsteady increment, e.g. only really making new structure permanent \nwhen it has definitely added fitness to the individual.  There&#39;s also \nan unconfirmed &quot;downwards trend&quot; in size, e.g. where an advance is \nmade, and is bit bigger than the old champion, but it then shrinks a \nlittle over the next 50,000 cycles or so (NOT due to trimming the \ndead wood, I&#39;m talking about only comparing the sizes _after_ that).\n\n&gt;As for me I&#39;ve started redesigning sharpneat with a fresh slate using\n&gt;generics (templates). So far so good. At the most abstract level I have\n&gt;an IEvolutionAlgorithm interface that defines the concept of an\n&gt;algorithm with generations and actring on completely abstract genome and\n&gt;phenome types. My current NEAT code then sits on top of this (with a\n&gt;couple of design layers in between) quite nicely and acts as a default\n&gt;implementation right now to put some meat on the bones of the framework.\n&gt;I then intend to create a completely new genome representation based on\n&gt;many of the ideas on the group over the last year.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have to say that working with templates is a breath of fresh air, I\n&gt;think this new framework is going to make the old one look positively\n&gt;old hat!\n\nExcellent!\n\nThere may be some C# in my new job (not for a while, however), so if \nI get familiar in it, I might be very interested in your new framework...\n\n         Ian\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
