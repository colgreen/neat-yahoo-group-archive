There are\nsome pretty sick multiplication algorithms for larger matrices that work\nin about O(n^2.8) plus some large constant factor. I think most\nadvanced numerical analysis textbooks cover this.\n\nAnyone else know of any research?\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
