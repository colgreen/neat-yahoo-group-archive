It&#39;s great to have such a=\r\n comprehensive review of the subject.  Of course the area also has a lot of=\r\n potential and your paper helps to point the way forward.\n\nI also wanted to=\r\n mention a paper relevant to this subject that I published recently with An=\r\ndrea Soltoggio, based on work he did in part when he was visiting our lab h=\r\nere at UCF.  The paper, titled &quot;From Modulated Hebbian Plasticity to Simple=\r\n Behavior Learning through Noise and Weight Saturation,&quot; is available here:=\r\n\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2012/soltoggio-nn12\n\nIt&#39;s important =\r\nto note that the paper has no evolution - all the experiments are done with=\r\n small networks that learn entirely from their plasticity rules from scratc=\r\nh.  However, I think the unique new plasticity mechanisms that are introduc=\r\ned can probably provoke a lot of interesting new directions for neuroevolve=\r\nd networks.  Part of its story also goes against conventional wisdom:  It s=\r\nhows how neural noise can be an asset and that weight saturation, which is =\r\noften seen as a problem in Hebbian learning, can be turned into an advantag=\r\ne.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m proud to announce my first paper produced as part of my PhD=\r\n will\n&gt; be presented at the 25th Australian Joint Conference on Artificial\n=\r\n&gt; Intelligence, 4-7 December 2012.\n&gt; \n&gt; Title: Evolving Plastic Neural Netw=\r\norks for Online Learning: Review\n&gt; and Future Directions\n&gt; Authors: Oliver =\r\nJ. Coleman, Alan D. Blair\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; Recent years have seen a resurge=\r\nnce of interest in evolving plastic\n&gt; neural networks for online learning. =\r\nThese approaches have an\n&gt; intrinsic appeal =96 since, to date, the only wo=\r\nrking example of general\n&gt; intelligence is the human brain, which has devel=\r\noped through\n&gt; evolution, and exhibits a great capacity to adapt to unfamil=\r\niar\n&gt; environments. In this paper we review prior work in this area =96\n&gt; i=\r\nncluding problem domains and tasks, fitness functions, synaptic\n&gt; plasticit=\r\ny models and neural network encoding schemes. We conclude\n&gt; with a discussi=\r\non of current findings and promising future directions,\n&gt; including incorpo=\r\nration of functional properties observed in\n&gt; biological neural networks wh=\r\nich appear to play a role in learning\n&gt; processes, and addressing the &quot;gene=\r\nral&quot; in general intelligence by the\n&gt; introduction of previously unseen tas=\r\nks during the evolution process.\n&gt; \n&gt; The full paper is available at\n&gt; http=\r\n://ojcoleman.com/sites/default/files/files/ojcoleman_ajcai2012_evolving_pla=\r\nstic_neural_networks_for_online_learning_review_and_future_directions.pdf\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
