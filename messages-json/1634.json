The point being that if we take\n&gt; a moment to recognize that that is what we are doing, we might be able\n&gt; to draw from what has already been done in that field.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\nInteresting point. I wonder would there be a benefit to be had (in\nsome problem domains at least) from applying a modicum of backprop to\na NEAT network? Weights would then be &quot;nudged&quot; towards more\n&quot;appropriate&quot; levels (to direct the error-reduction endeavour) with\nmutation still available to escape from local minima.\n\nFor some classification and function approximation domains I can see\nthis being useful. Well, any domain where the outputs for a training\nset are known. You know, the type of problem  for which backprop has\nhistorically been useful. A big problem with vanilla backprop has\nalways been the fixed topology - NEAT offers a way out of that trap,\nbut the propagate-forward/backpropagate-errors idea could offer a\nshortcut to finding better weights for a given topology.\n\n--Mike\n\n"}}
