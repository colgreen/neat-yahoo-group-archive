You are more than\n&gt; =\r\nwelcome to take a look, though:\n&gt; http://code.google.com/p/pyneat/\n&gt; \n&gt; Ple=\r\nase let me know if you have any feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Brian\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cesar, I=\r\n agree it would be nice to make python NEAT available on the \n&gt; &gt; website. =\r\n I believe I asked Karl Lewin for permission to do that \n&gt; &gt; about three ye=\r\nars ago, but he told me the code wasn&#39;t in suitable \n&gt; &gt; condition to be re=\r\nleased.  Since then, we seem to have lost touch.  \n&gt; &gt; You are correct that=\r\n he is the one who produced a python NEAT version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think I remem=\r\nber others mentioning they were working on Python \n&gt; &gt; versions of NEAT but=\r\n I can&#39;t remember who it was.  If someone has \n&gt; &gt; such a version and wants=\r\n to make it available, I will be happy to \n&gt; &gt; link it from my website.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G.
