The interaction\n&gt; between\n&gt; complexification and simplification in NEAT has not\n&gt; been\n&gt; well studied.  However, we have studied\n&gt; simplification in\n&gt; isolation: We ran experiments where we started with\n&gt; large fully-\n&gt; connected topologies and then let them simplify by\n&gt; removing genes.\n&gt; This was far less powerful than starting minimally\n&gt; and \n&gt; complexifying, although it was interesting.  You\n&gt; tended to get \n&gt; spurts of several improvements in a row after every\n&gt; few \n&gt; simplifications, but the improvements tended to be\n&gt; miniscule \n&gt; compared to the ones you get with complexification. \n\nYeah, I think you mentioned that you had done\nsomething like this experimentally.  I probably would\nhave expected this approach to be less powerful than\nstarting minimally and complexifying, but by how much,\nI wouldn&#39;t have guessed...I&#39;m sure it depends on many\nother factors, as well.\n\nI would intuitively think that simplification would\nwork best in cases where either good solutions\nexisted, but were overly complex and inefficient, or\nin cases where features that were once adaptive have\nbecome unnecessary, or vestigial.\n\n&gt; In any case, if you start out minimally, and\n&gt; complexify *and* \n&gt; simplify (albeit at a lower rate than complexifying)\n&gt; that could\n&gt; be pretty interesting.  And it should work as you\n&gt; say- speciation\n&gt; will protect simplifications just as it does\n&gt; complexifications.\n\nI definitely want to do some experimentation along\nthese lines.\n\nI&#39;m guessing that simplification isn&#39;t all that\nimportant in small input/output domains.  NEAT does a\nwonderful job of mitigating against bloat and ensuring\nthat throughout the process simpler solutions prevail.\n \n\nBut my instinct tells me that in very high\ninput/output domains, efficiency is going to be even\nmore important, and that simplification may play an\nimportant role.\n\nFor instance, I don&#39;t think simplification will be an\nimportant attribute when evolving Tic-Tac-Toe players,\nbut in order to tackle Go, I think there may need to\nbe aspects of the GA that allow for underutilized\nportions of the network to be pruned out by evolution.\n I don&#39;t know, though.\n\nI think it would be very interesting to compare the\nimpact of simplification between two similar domains\nin which one has an order of magnitude more\ninputs/outputs.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to look at\nthis within the next 6 months or so. :)\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
