He found it could make a big\n&gt; impact.  If you feel performance could improve, it may be worth\n&gt; experimenting with activation functions a bit.  Maybe Mattias can\n&gt; comment on this since he went through a lot of interesting discoveries\n&gt; on that front.\n\nSigmoid;\nWhen I use a sigmoid that centers around 0.5 (it returns values in the \nrange 0 to 1) I get results that are on par with Kens. But when I use a \nsigmoid that&#39;s centered around 0 (range=[-1..1]) my results are far \nbetter than those reported by Ken.\n\nAlso, the fitness method for XOR is debatable; once a particular result \nis correct (on the right side of 0.5) the case could be given a fitness \nof 1. In kens code, returning 0.51 for a true means a fitness of \nonly .49 fabs(0.51-1) (though it&#39;s considered a hit). I would argue that \nit&#39;s of fitness 1. Finding correct answers is much faster with that \nfitness method, and it&#39;s valid because\n1) the particular case is allready solved, so further evolution should \nbe targeted at solving the other cases\n2) the completed result is as correct as the original method\n3) it&#39;s considerably faster to solve\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
