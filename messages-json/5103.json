Since th=\r\nen a few people have asked about the way we laid out the team on the substr=\r\nate and whether alternatives might be better.\n\nI am happy to announce, with=\r\n my co-authors David D&#39;Ambrosio, Joel Lehman, and Sebastian Risi, that we h=\r\nave extensively tested such an alternative z-axis-based encoding and publis=\r\nhed the results to appear in AAMAS 2010, available here:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.u=\r\ncf.edu/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html\n\nDirect Link: http://eplex.=\r\ncs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf\n\nWe believe this z-based substrate =\r\nlayout is superior to the previous one, particularly for scaling the size o=\r\nf the team, and should open up the field of multiagent learning further to =\r\nHyperNEAT.  The paper also includes the first published results on scaling =\r\nthe size of the team without further training, which works because HyperNEA=\r\nT can interpolate new policies for ANNs inserted along the z axis of the su=\r\nbstrate.  \n\nVideos that accompany the paper are here: \nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.=\r\nedu/mahnaamas2010.html\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
