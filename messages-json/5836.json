Jeff mentioned my &quot;strong opinions&quot; abou=\r\nt algorithm comparisons, so I thought it can&#39;t hurt to follow up on what Je=\r\nff said:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ken Stanley has strong opinions on why comparing different\n&gt;=\r\n algorithms on one or a few tasks tells us very little, which he may \n&gt; wan=\r\nt to chime in with. I generally agree with him that it is not \n&gt; terribly i=\r\nnformative, although I tend to think it is still somewhat \n&gt; tvaluable, whi=\r\nle he thinks it is mostly worthless! (Sorry if I am \n&gt; tincorrectly paraphr=\r\nasing you Ken). Ken is right that different \n&gt; algorithms perform very diff=\r\nerently on different problems, so a few tests provides too small a sample s=\r\nize to learn much. Moreover, every researcher inadvertently knows their own=\r\n algorithm much better than what they are comparing against, so they keep t=\r\nuning their algorithm to the benchmarks being used until they win, reducing=\r\n the value of the comparison. There&#39;s no great alternative, in my opinion, =\r\nso I still do it...but I increasingly agree with Ken that our time as scien=\r\ntists can better be spent on other chores (such as showing the new, interes=\r\nting, properties of our new algorithms...an example being HyperNEAT genomes=\r\n scaling up to very large networks without substantial performance drops).&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with these concerns but as Jeff hints I&#39;d go farther with it.=\r\n The problem here is more fundamental than simply that it&#39;s hard to tell wh=\r\nich algorithm is &quot;better&quot; from a few comparisons. The problem is that it&#39;s =\r\nnot even clear what &quot;better&quot; means no matter how many comparisons there are=\r\n. Quantitative comparisons imply that &quot;better&quot; means that an algorithms sco=\r\nres better on average on some performance metric. But for those who are pur=\r\nsuing revolutionary advances in AI, I&#39;m skeptical that it really matters wh=\r\nich algorithm scores better even across many benchmarks.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason is=\r\n that to me &quot;better&quot; should mean &quot;leads to the most new algorithms in the f=\r\nuture.&quot; In other words, it has little or nothing to do with performance. &quot;B=\r\netter&quot; means creating a foundation for new ideas and a new research directi=\r\non. We know it when we see it. We&#39;re talking about primitive AI algorithms =\r\nhere that are about 3 inches into a 10-million-kilometer marathon to the pi=\r\nnnacle of AI. If you&#39;re looking at two different algorithms then in effect =\r\nyou&#39;re comparing two different points in the vast space of all possible alg=\r\norithms. Given that there are probably light years of advances to go in the=\r\n direction of either one of them, why would you cut the path of either one =\r\nof them off regardless of the &quot;results&quot; if both of them are interesting ide=\r\nas?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you were running an evolutionary algorithm with diversity maint=\r\nenance of some kind, then how one arbitrary point in the search space compa=\r\nres to another would hardly matter. So why do we care about apple-and-orang=\r\nes comparisons in AI? \n&gt; \n&gt; I think it has become a convenient way to avoid=\r\n the sobering reality that most algorithms don&#39;t have any exciting ideas be=\r\nhind them. So the only thing you can do is look at a pointless comparison. =\r\nFor those algorithms that do have interesting ideas behind them, I don&#39;t ev=\r\nen need a comparison to know they&#39;re interesting, and even if they perform =\r\nworse than something else, the last thing I want to do is throw out an inte=\r\nresting idea. Who knows where it might lead?\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes comparisons are ve=\r\nry overrated. One type of comparison I do think can be useful once in a whi=\r\nle is to compare an algorithm with a variant of itself (which includes abla=\r\ntions). That can give a sense of what a new ingredient adds. But even then,=\r\n if the idea isn&#39;t inspirational, the performance gain won&#39;t matter much in=\r\n the long run. Because in the long run we aren&#39;t interested in performance =\r\ngains but rather in stepping stones to new frontiers. These things (i.e. pe=\r\nrformance and where an idea leads) are not correlated in any complex search=\r\n space and therefore we should should not be running the whole field of AI =\r\nresearch like a naive giant hill-climbing algorithm. The irony here is that=\r\n the world&#39;s greatest experts in search are doing exactly that at the meta-=\r\nlevel (i.e. at the level of how the community searches for new algorithms) =\r\nby focusing so intently on comparative performance results.\n&gt; \n&gt; The one ot=\r\nher kind of performance result I think is useful is when an algorithm does =\r\nsomething completely unprecedented. Of course, in that case, you don&#39;t need=\r\n a comparison because there&#39;s nothing to compare with. Though that won&#39;t st=\r\nop traditionalists from clamoring for a comparison anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
