In doing some runs with XOR with subtractive mutations, \nwe found that our smallest solutions do not require a connection \nfrom the bias input node.  This led me to wonder what would happen \nif I were to start with a more minimal arhitecture.  I did some runs \nstarting with 0 connections, and was still able to solve it in about \nthe same number of generations.\n\nSo a few question:\n- has anyone else tinkered with alternate starting architectures? \n- is there any reason to start with ANY hidden neurons or \nconnections?  \n- Ken, in your experiments, do you have the bias input fully \nconnected along with the other inputs?\n\nIt&#39;s possible that, with more complex domains, starting with such a \nsmall architecture would yield significantly slower results as the \nmembers of the population take longer to start up.  We&#39;ve read other \nexperiments where the starting architecture is a sparse randomly \nconnected matrix.  But that would still allow for the possibility of \nstarting with a connection that you never need, and never being able \nto get rid of it.  Starting with fewer connections might take \nlonger, but gives you a better shot at a minimal solution.\n\n\n\n"}}
