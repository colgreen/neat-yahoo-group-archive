But even if we did\nthat in the check=\r\ners task there is no way to be sure whether the\nresults extend to other dom=\r\nains, so to get a really general sense of\nwhich is better might take a lot =\r\nof work over several domains.  Then\nagain, perhaps we&#39;d notice something si=\r\ngnificant just in checkers that\nwe don&#39;t realize so you never know, but at =\r\nthe moment I think we are\ninvestigating too many other issues to really giv=\r\ne that one sufficient\nattention, even though it&#39;s interesting.  Hopefully s=\r\nomeone else will\nbe interested enough to investigate it.\n\nAs I mentioned in=\r\n the other message on this thread, our aim in this\nparticular experiment wa=\r\ns not really to evolve a fantastic checkers\nplayer, but rather to just show=\r\n the advantage HyperNEAT provides by\nlearning from geometry.  Recall that N=\r\nEAT could not even learn to\ndefeat the heuristic player at all in 20 runs, =\r\nwhile HyperNEAT defeats\nin around 8 or 9 generations on average!  That is q=\r\nuite a disparity\nand shows how important capturing the prevailing regularit=\r\ny is in this\ndomain.  Later it will be interesting to see how well we can d=\r\no in a\nabsolute sense, but that&#39;s a different paper.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; I enjoy=\r\ned reading the checkers paper and the reactions to it here on the\n&gt; forum. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have an immediate plan to test out different\nconfiguratio=\r\nns for\n&gt; the CPPN?

I just browsed around and\ncould not\n&gt; (quickly) find out if xCheckers u=\r\nses what would be considered a\nleading edge\n&gt; board evaluator. \n&gt; \n&gt; You me=\r\nntion below that it is difficult to evaluate your program against\n&gt; human p=\r\nlayers, but why not start by evaluating them against leading AI\n&gt; checkers =\r\nprograms? I know this comparison was not necessary for the\npoint\n&gt; you were=\r\n getting at in this paper, but it would be very interesting\nto know\n&gt; how t=\r\nhe HyperNEAT evaluator fares against the current best AI\nevaluators. I\n&gt; am=\r\n not sure what constitutes an exhaustive comparison between two\ncheckers\n&gt; =\r\nevaluators (all possible opening move sets?), but I gathered from\nyour pape=\r\nr\n&gt; that the test you conducted was more narrow than what I imagine would b=\r\ne\n&gt; involved in a true head to head comparison of evaluators.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally,=\r\n while it is cool that your program beats you guys at\ncheckers, it\n&gt; might =\r\nnot solely be because of the HyperNEAT-driven AI. The program\nis also\n&gt; usi=\r\nng alpha-beta and the like. I&#39;ll bet a rather poor position evaluator\n&gt; plu=\r\ns Alpha-Beta with a decent amount of lookahead could beat me at\ncheckers,\n&gt;=\r\n even if I was better at evaluating board positions on average.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks=\r\n again, it was a very enjoyable read.

We&#39;ll have =\r\nto think about some of them for awhile\n&gt; &gt; but here&#39;s a few answers:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The reason why I chose to use a separate output for each connection\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlayer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is because I wanted to\n&gt; &gt; sepa=\r\nrate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D CPPN method,\n&gt; &gt; then =\r\nthe two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;z&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; Because I&#39;m=\r\n only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\n&gt; &gt; layer did some =\r\nunique processing.  If there was only one output, it\n&gt; &gt; would be harder fo=\r\nr the connection layers to distinguish themselves as\n&gt; &gt; they would be too =\r\ndependent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs are\n&gt; &gt; not used and the tw=\r\no layers are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\n&gt; &gt; empirical tests on wh=\r\nich method is better so I do not have any\n&gt; &gt; evidence to back my claim, bu=\r\nt it&#39;s my intuition.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents other =\r\nthan Xcheckers.  I have\n&gt; &gt; had my friends and people in the lab play again=\r\nst the HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; opponent and it is definitely better than all of us :-=\r\n).  I would like\n&gt; &gt; to release a binary version so people can play the opp=\r\nonents at\n&gt; &gt; different generations and see the change in performance.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; One active area of interest is to figure out how good a HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nplayer is in a global sense.  In Chellapilla & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\n&gt; &gt; play=\r\ned human opponents in checkers on MSN Gaming Zone online and got\n&gt; &gt; an exp=\r\nert rating on that game server.  The problem with this is that\n&gt; &gt; it is ve=\r\nry time consuming to play games by hand. It would not be\n&gt; &gt; feasible for m=\r\ne to test several individuals in this way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have experimented wit=\r\nh coevolution, but I need to solve the\n&gt; &gt; aforementioned problem before I =\r\ncan say anything about the performance\n&gt; &gt; of the evolved individuals.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Jason Gauci=\r\n and I are pleased to share with you new results with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT  in o=\r\nur new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Conference on Artific=\r\nial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Critical Role of Geomet=\r\nric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cool, I enjoyed the p=\r\naper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; *=\r\n Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, =\r\nxyz, out) - which seems more natural\nto me?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * Was more than one CPPN c=\r\nonfiguration tried?
