This way involves coding of \nparameters inside the genotype, so the genome not only include \nnetwork information but also has a standalone gene containing weight \nmutation type (let&#39;s say 00 -- for proportional, 01 -- for fixed \nnumber and so on). During the mating, networks and these genes are \nrecombinated independently. In this case it&#39;s possible that \nindividuals that mutate defferently are present at one and the same \ntime. Thus a self-tuning is possible (with simultaneous task \nsolution!) and I think it&#39;s not so time expensive. And also if you \nuse some meta-GA, how are you going to set its&#39; parameters? ;)\n\nBest regards,\nYuri\n\n\n\n\n"}}
