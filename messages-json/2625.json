Erkin Bahceci, Igor Karpov and  \nmyself are planning on entering a NEAT-based system in the AAAI  \nGeneral Game Playing Competition:\n\nhttp://games.stanford.edu\n\nIts a pretty neat competition. Basically your agent is given a game  \ndescribed in a generic specification language and within some amount  \nof time it has to learn to play the game (hopefully well enough to  \nbeat your opponent). The game language is surprisingly general; games  \ncan have any number of players (e.g. tower-of-hanoi has 1 whereas  \nchinese checkers has 6) and they can be turn-based or simultaneous.  \nThe only restriction at the moment is that the games have to be  \nperfect-knowledge, which precludes things like battleship.\n\nThere are a few really nice points about GGP. First, it forces us to  \npay more attention to our algorithm and less to fine-tuning of  \nparameters and input representations. NE is much more difficult when  \nyou don&#39;t know what your inputs are going to be! Second, it should be  \na good indicator of where NE actually ranks in terms of being a  \ngeneral architecture for AI (the competition seems very fair and  \nconsists of three weeks of qualification rounds before the final at  \nAAAI). Third, the parser we&#39;re writing for the game language is  \ncompletely reusable, and gives us instant access to a pretty large  \nnumber of games for testing (finally we can run validations on simple  \ngames that are more interesting than tic-tac-toe). Some of the more  \nwell known games already included in ggp are Connect-Four, Othello,  \nTetris, Capture Go, Chinese Checkers, Guess the number, tower of  \nHanoi, nine-mens-morris, 10 Queens, rock-paper-scissors (for deciding  \nwho goes first, of course), and tic-tac-toe.\n\nWe&#39;ve just gotten to the point where we can do real experiments with  \nour system, so stay tuned for actual results.\n\nHas anyone else on the list thought about entering?\n\n-- Joe\n\n"}}
