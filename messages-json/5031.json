EC is a learning \n&gt; technique by which a population of individual agents adapt \n&gt; according to the selection pressures exerted by an \n&gt; environment; MASS seeks to understand how to coordinate the \n&gt; actions of a population of (possibly\n&gt; selfish) autonomous agents that share an environment so that \n&gt; some outcome is achieved. Both EC and MASS have top-down and \n&gt; bottom-up features. For example, some aspects of multi-agent \n&gt; system engineering (e.g., mechanism design) are concerned \n&gt; with how top-down structure can constrain or influence \n&gt; individual decisions. Similarly, most work in EC is concerned \n&gt; with how to engineer selective pressures to drive the \n&gt; evolution of individual behavior towards some desired goal. \n&gt; Multi-agent simulation (also called agent-based modeling) \n&gt; addresses the bottom-up issue of how collective behavior \n&gt; emerges from individual action.\n&gt; Likewise, the study of evolutionary dynamics within EC (for example in\n&gt; coevolution) often considers how population-level phenomena \n&gt; emerge from individual-level interactions. Thus, at a high \n&gt; level, we may view EC and MASS as examining and utilizing \n&gt; analogous processes. It is therefore natural to consider how \n&gt; knowledge gained within EC may be relevant to MASS, and vice \n&gt; versa; indeed, applications and techniques from one field \n&gt; have often made use of technologies and algorithms from the \n&gt; other field.\n&gt; Studying EC and MASS in combination is warranted and has the \n&gt; potential to contribute to both fields.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal of this workshop is to facilitate the examination \n&gt; and development of techniques at the intersection of \n&gt; evolutionary computation and multi-agent systems and simulation.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ECoMASS workshop welcomes original submissions in the \n&gt; theory and practice on all aspects of Evolutionary \n&gt; Computation and Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation, which \n&gt; include (but are not limited to) the following topics and themes:\n&gt; \n&gt; -Multi-agent systems and agent-based models utilizing \n&gt; evolutionary computation -Optimization of multi-agent systems \n&gt; and agent-based models using evolutionary computation \n&gt; -Evolutionary computation models which rely not on explicit \n&gt; fitness functions but rather implicit fitness functions \n&gt; defined by the relationship to other individuals / agents \n&gt; -Applications utilizing MASS and EC in combination \n&gt; -Biological agent-based models (usually called individual-based\n&gt; models) involving evolution\n&gt; -Evolution of cooperation and altruism\n&gt; -Genotypic representation of the complex phenotypic \n&gt; strategies of MASS -Evolutionary learning within MASS \n&gt; (including Baldwinian learning and phenotypic plasticity) \n&gt; -Emergence and feedbacks -Open-ended strategy spaces and \n&gt; evolution -Adaptive individuals within evolving populations\n&gt; \n&gt; *Paper Submission\n&gt; See http://www.cscs.umich.edu/ecomass/ for details.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Important Dates\n&gt; Paper submission deadline: 25 March, 2010 Notification of \n&gt; acceptance: 1 April, 2010 Final Papers Due: 13 April, 2010 \n&gt; Registration Deadline: 19 April, 2010\n&gt; \n&gt; *Workshop Chairs:\n&gt; Bill Rand, University of Maryland\n&gt; Rick Riolo, University of Michigan\n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; Modelling mailing list\n&gt; Modelling@...\n&gt; http://www.swarm.org/mailman/listinfo/modelling\n\n\n"}}
