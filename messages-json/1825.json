That is a problem in a=\r\nll Recurrent \nNetworks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; values are difficult to store more than 10-50=\r\n iterations in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; network (see LSTM Link for references). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \tI put LSTM inside a NEAT. The evolution make NEAT to use \n&gt; &gt; LSTM cel=\r\nls\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a productive way storing key values, recovering that values \nwh=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they are useful a forgetting them  if it is useful (The 3 LSTM \nce=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; functions).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tMy analysis of some of the solved proble=\r\nms suggest that LSTM \n&gt; &gt; helps to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT in some problems to reduce gr=\r\neatly the searching space \n&gt; &gt; helping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; memorize (some times to acc=\r\numulate) some important key events \nthat \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used after to get o=\r\nut the right outputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tAn intuitional example about reduction =\r\nof searching space is \n&gt; &gt; serial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; XOR, if you solve serial XOR with N=\r\nEAT you can see that the \n&gt; &gt; solution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; net use recurrent connection t=\r\no store the first value and \nlater it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compares with second value in t=\r\nhe serial sequence. In my \ncomputer \n&gt; &gt; (P4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2,4Ghz) it last around  =\r\n2 minutes to find a solution with NEAT \n&gt; &gt; alone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, when I us=\r\ne one LSTM cell in the NEAT-LSTM it last \nONLY 5\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SECONDS!!!!!.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)  Improving Work Methods in Real Automation Problems:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n       Motivation: Evolution systems have been achieving great \n&gt; &gt; results=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in last years. In my daily work in automation projects \nbusiness, I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to face another problem: cost. That is the reason that \nmost of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the times the industry try to avoid complex systems. Complex \n&gt; &gt; sys=\r\ntems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are difficult to develop, difficult to modify and difficult to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; maintenance. Most of the times, it is the last choosen \nresource. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tOther problems to use evolution systems are the \n&gt; &gt; uncertainty=\r\n.  Always,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is some likelihood that a problem will converge to a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; solution in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable time. Some time we can evaluate it, si=\r\nzing the \n&gt; &gt; searching\n&gt; &gt; &gt; space. Other times it very difficult to size =\r\nsuch space. \n&gt; &gt; Uncertainty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a variable related to, what is known =\r\nin business as, risk. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tSome recent experiment as in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ht=\r\ntp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/whiteson.gecco03.pdf \n&gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; that a way to reduce searching space is to &quot;draw&quot; the guide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution will be searched. Some of my research has gone in that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; direction. In most of the systems we have deal with, we have \nsome\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; previous knowledge about them. My work is focusing in how \norganize\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; such previous knowledge in: decision trees, tasks, abstraction \n&gt; &gt; leve=\r\nls\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and interdependences among them to reduce as much as possible \nthe=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; searching space. So the final goal is to find feasibility work \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmethods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tools to use evolution systems in real automation Industr=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Germ=E1n.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
