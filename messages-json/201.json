Philip\n&gt; Tucker (also on this list) and I are working on a Java\n&gt; implementation of NEAT that we hope to opensource in\n&gt; the near future.  We&#39;re primarily interested in board\n&gt; game domains, specifically the Gomoku/Renju/Go class\n&gt; of games, but also to a lesser degree, other game\n&gt; domains and real-time robot control.\n&gt; \n\nSo do you foresee your system being used by people \nwith little expertise who want\nto be able to quickly set up experiments, or more\nby serious researchers setting up very efficient \ndistributed experiments?  In other words, are you\ntrying to have an easy-to-use interface?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
