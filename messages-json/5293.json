So you would basically duplicate the node and its incoming and outgoing connections.\n&gt; That might be sort of like gene duplication that can then lead to a divergence. However, the new\n&gt; weights would perhaps need to be calibrated since it would double the power of the prior\n&gt; single-node output.\n\nInteresting. Alternatively you could divide up the existing\nconnections between the two nodes - but that would likely break the\nfunctionality of the existing structure. You could copy a subset if\nthe connections to the new node, but that likely just creates some\nbroken functionaloty again; best copy the whole thing and micro-mutate\nfrom there.\n\nI&#39;m thinking the output connection weights could be either initialised\nto zero, or drastically reduced (divide by some largish number). Or we\ncould skip copying the output connections altogether (maybe just one\nchosen randomly for starters) and allow micro-mutations to connect up\nthe new node&#39;s output side.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
