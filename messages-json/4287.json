We could click on a node in a CPPN and\nsee the patte=\r\nrn generated at that internal node (which is like an\nintermediate stage of =\r\ndevelopment).  It&#39;s very enlightening.  One\nthing it taught me is that a lo=\r\nt of the shapes are created through\nadditions and subtractions, in addition=\r\n to compositions.  But those\nadditions and subtractions are very important.=\r\n  \n\nUnfortunately that app has not been further developed at this time and\n=\r\nis no longer compatible with Picbreeder.  Perhaps we will get back to\nit so=\r\n that it can be made available at some point.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I&#39;m thinking that the benchma=\r\nrk result is less important than the\n&gt; &gt; comprehension of how the encoding =\r\nbuilt its results.  CPPNs have the\n&gt; &gt; nice property that they are fairly s=\r\ntraightforward.  You can look at\n&gt; &gt; each hidden node and look at the inter=\r\nmediate structure that it\n&gt; &gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, on the=\r\n other hand, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to explain, a=\r\nnd therefore more\n&gt; &gt; difficult to bias.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you done this Ken? Was i=\r\nt helpful to understand what was going on?\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you guys have a tool tha=\r\nt makes this easy to do? I think it would\nbe very\n&gt; instructive to be able =\r\nto look at the contribution of hidden nodes and\n&gt; subgraphs of the CPPN net=\r\nwork.\n&gt; \n&gt; jeff\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
