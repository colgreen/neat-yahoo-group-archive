One\n&gt; suggestion is to try pruning the networks with the addition of subtractive\n&gt; mutations (remove link & remove node). Or better try phased searching,\n&gt; complexification followed by simplification stages. This will improve things\n&gt; for sure. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently that the number\n&gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of time\n&gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory of the\n&gt;&gt; run. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt;&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second figure where the CPPN node\n&gt;&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing environment and those runs where\n&gt;&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One problem is that it makes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt;&gt; populations with 200-node genomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt;&gt; evolution can make too much progress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt;&gt; seen fitness continue to increase even with such large genomes).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have tried dropping the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt;&gt; that definitely changes the slope of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt;&gt; increases. The good news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Any thoughts? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
