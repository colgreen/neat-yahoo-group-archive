Thanks for setting this up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now we have to figure out what/how we want to break\n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; the site and how to save our documentation?\n&gt; \n&gt; As a starter suggestion, I&#39;d suggest creating\n&gt; directories for each implementation of NEAT, based on\n&gt; the language/platform its written in, with an\n&gt; accompanying directory for documentation for each, and\n&gt; a directory for examples/benchmarks for each\n&gt; implementation.  It would also be nice to have a\n&gt; top-level directory with documentation related to NEAT\n&gt; (research papers, etc.) and perhaps a doc with an\n&gt; overview of each implementation (i.e., an elaboration\n&gt; of the section of Ken&#39;s NEAT User&#39;s page that talks\n&gt; about deciding which implementation to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anybody else have ideas about how best to organize the\n&gt; NEAT repository?\n&gt; \n\nAre we making this a NEAT repository or a general neuroevolution\nrepository?  I had thought it was mostly going to be \nfor keeping around benchmarks and experiments people can\neasily take off the shelf and try out with any method.  \n\nI think having sections for NEAT will be nice, but I already have NEAT\nsoftware organized and available from my website and our NN-group\nwebsite here at UT Austin.  So I think making a more general\nrepository would really add extra value for the outside community.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
