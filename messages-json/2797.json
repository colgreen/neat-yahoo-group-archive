To find a suitable NN, we want to use a\nGenetic Algorithm=\r\n. Inputs for the NN are leg positions, ground contact\nsensors for each leg,=\r\n desired walking speed and so on. Outputs of the\nNN are the next positions =\r\nfor all the joints.\n\nKnow my question:\nWithin the XOR-Example (I runned NEA=\r\nTGATrainingManager) the Neural Net\nwill be trained with data provided by th=\r\ne xor/xor.csv file. \nIn our Application (robot) we don&#39;t have any training =\r\ndata available,\nwe just want to evolve neural networks and evaluate them by=\r\n applying\nthe fitness function. (for example how fast walks the robot,\ndire=\r\nction, etc.) How do we start NEAT, so that it does not need a\ntrainig set? =\r\nIs there an example/tutorial available that shows how to\nuse NEAT without a=\r\n training set? Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t work it out\nso far how to do it.\n\n=\r\nThanks a lot for any information!\n\nIwan\n\n\n\n"}}
