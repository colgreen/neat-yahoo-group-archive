The software is =\r\nfreely available here:\n\nhttp://maestrogenesis.com/\n\nIn this system, NEAT ev=\r\nolves CPPNs that take the pre-existing music, which is called the &quot;scaffold=\r\n,&quot; as input, and output an accompaniment for it.  The accompaniment general=\r\nly sounds plausible because it is a function of the scaffold.  In effect, t=\r\nhe software is based on a very simple musical theory that music sounds good=\r\n if the listener can perceive a functional relationship among the parts.  \n=\r\n\nThis theory is interesting in part because of how much it accomplishes all=\r\n by itself.  In other words, MaestroGenesis has no other musical knowledge =\r\nwithin it, yet it still produces plausible accompaniments just by exploitin=\r\ng the functional relationship.\n\nYou can learn more on how to use the softwa=\r\nre at the docs page, where there is also a tutorial video:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs=\r\n.ucf.edu/MaestroGenesis/docs\n\nThe download page is:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/MaestroGenesis/downloads\n\nFor those interested, a fair amount of academic=\r\n research has gone into this software, and links to all the relevant public=\r\nations are at:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/MaestroGenesis/relatedresearch\n\nBes=\r\nt,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
