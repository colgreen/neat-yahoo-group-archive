For example, the robot does not have feet (which are pretty\nnecessary for biped stabilization). When primates evolved from brachiation\nto bipedalism our bodies changed quite substantially to account for the\ndifferent type of locomotion.\n\nNevertheless, given how close the robots got to walking on two legs when we\nweren&#39;t looking for bipedalism, it would be a fun experiment to try. Even\ncooler would be to see if you could get such a transition when allowing the\nevolution of morphologies, especially if the bodies changed in similar ways\nas biological bipeds.\n\nThanks for the suggestion.\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Thomas Johnson &lt;thomas.j.johnson@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sun, 15 Feb 2009 18:48:15 -0600\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Evolving Coordinated Quadruped Gaits with the\n&gt; HyperNEAT Generative Encoding\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a random thought I had about evolving biped gaits: Have you considered\n&gt; first evolving a quadruped gait, then switching the fitness function to one\n&gt; that&#39;s similar to the quadruped fitness function but has additional rewards\n&gt; for spending more time on two legs? Since that&#39;s how it seems evolution\n&gt; worked out in the real world, maybe it would make it easier here.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2009/2/15 petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   Hi Jeff.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Here is my opinion about the 4 hypothesis you suggested.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Definitely true! :) While robots with 3+ legs are generally stable,\n&gt;&gt; biped robots have trouble keeping their balance. My zero-g experiment\n&gt;&gt; with novelty search showed that getting an oscillation pattern that\n&gt;&gt; resembles a walking human is not a big problem. But add gravity and it\n&gt;&gt; falls every time. Kind of frustrating :/\n&gt;&gt; It is possible to get a good biped walking behavior with HyperNEAT or\n&gt;&gt; just regular NEAT, but it is hard to get results in practice.. Tyler\n&gt;&gt; Streeter has done such experiments, in fact my own experiments were\n&gt;&gt; inspired by his work.\n&gt;&gt; It is interesting that NEAT performs well even in cases of only one\n&gt;&gt; leg. Remember that NEAT Hopper demo?\n&gt;&gt; So I guess the failure of my experiments is not because it is\n&gt;&gt; incredibly hard to evolve good biped walking gait. It is hard indeed,\n&gt;&gt; but not that hard :)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gaits.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yes, inputting just a sine wave to the substrate is something clever\n&gt;&gt; and I never thought of that. I actually prefer leaky integrators\n&gt;&gt; because a CTRNN substrate made up by leaky integrators doesn&#39;t need\n&gt;&gt; any inputs to make oscillations. It doesn&#39;t need inputs and timing at\n&gt;&gt; all. The time constant range in the leaky integrator substrate becomes\n&gt;&gt; the thing that is as important as the period of the sine wave in your\n&gt;&gt; system.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Probably. The main reason behind why leaky integrator-based substrates\n&gt;&gt; may perform worse is because not all networks are guaranteed to\n&gt;&gt; oscillate. Some just stabilize forever. Getting oscillation with leaky\n&gt;&gt; integrator networks is like a small short-term challenge of its own.\n&gt;&gt; :) Inputting a sine wave explicitly makes the whole thing different.\n&gt;&gt; But there is an interesting observation of leaky integrator substrates\n&gt;&gt; evolving with HyperNEAT. The neural activity itself appears\n&gt;&gt; distributed in a complexifying geometric pattern. The time constants\n&gt;&gt; and biases of the neurons are generated by a 2D/3D spatial CPPN.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output of\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I used the same :) The outputs are all the target joint angle rescaled\n&gt;&gt; to min/max angle of the particular joint. But I tried applying forces\n&gt;&gt; and even direct angular velocities. It is interesting, it has\n&gt;&gt; different dynamics but the PID-based setup is closest to reality\n&gt;&gt; anyway :)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Very interesting paper! :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It reminds me about the experiments I made with HyperNEAT for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controlling biped robots. Did you try using leaky-integrator based\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neurons for the substrate?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I found them very useful for generating\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oscillation patterns. Substrates of leaky integrators with tanh()\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; activation functions produce oscillations much easier than others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hm.. I should really try with robots with 3 legs or more. Getting\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biped walking with HyperNEAT is perhaps too ambitious right now.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I have thought a lot about your biped experiment. I&#39;d be really\n&gt;&gt; interested\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in hearing your opinion, and that of anyone else on this list, as to\n&gt;&gt; why\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your results were so different from mine. I found that it did not\n&gt;&gt; take that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; much tuning to get HyperNEAT to evolve really good quadruped gaits.\n&gt;&gt; But, as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you note, it was much harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I can suggest a few hypotheses as to what explains the difference.\n&gt;&gt; These are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; not mutually exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one of\n&gt;&gt; them\n&gt;&gt;&gt; explains most of the difference, but instead that they add up to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difference.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt;&gt; gaits.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt;&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are other differences of course, such as the inputs and the\n&gt;&gt; number of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hidden nodes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; This would be easy to test by simply trying a biped with my setup.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I have some other obligations that will prevent me\n&gt;&gt; from\n&gt;&gt;&gt; testing this anytime soon, but if you (or anyone else) would like to\n&gt;&gt; give it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a try, that would be cool. I can send you the code I used. One would\n&gt;&gt; just\n&gt;&gt;&gt; need to change the quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could\n&gt;&gt; try to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mimic my setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I do have access to a huge computing cluster. So, if someone makes\n&gt;&gt; the code\n&gt;&gt;&gt; modifications to my setup (which I know compiles on our cluster) and\n&gt;&gt; sends\n&gt;&gt;&gt; them to me, I can do a batch of runs.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt;&gt; gaits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; This would be an easy test. You could just plug a sine as an input\n&gt;&gt; into your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; biped. Note: I found that the period of the sine wave made a huge\n&gt;&gt;&gt; difference. If I made it too fast or too slow, evolution basically\n&gt;&gt; ignored\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the signal. Within the range of periods that worked, I found that I\n&gt;&gt; got\n&gt;&gt;&gt; different types of gaits with different period speeds. With slower\n&gt;&gt; periods,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I observed cool tortoise-like gaits with left-right symmetry. With\n&gt;&gt; medium\n&gt;&gt;&gt; periods, I got the gaits in the paper. With faster periods, I saw\n&gt;&gt; slightly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; more frantic versions of the gaits in the paper.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period for a short while and\n&gt;&gt; it was a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; miserable failure. I&#39;d like to try that again, and would be\n&gt;&gt; interested to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hear people&#39;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe that\n&gt;&gt; attempt\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in another email. If someone out there is curious, let me know and\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll send\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I did not try leaky integrators. Did you ever try your setup without\n&gt;&gt; them?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I did not try them because the default sigmoid neurons worked so\n&gt;&gt; well out of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the box that I did not experiment with alternatives. Both Ken\n&gt;&gt; (during\n&gt;&gt;&gt; preliminary conversations about the paper) and one of the papers&#39;\n&gt;&gt; reviewers\n&gt;&gt;&gt; asked about leaky integrators, so there is clearly some interest out\n&gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in seeing how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt;&gt;&gt; we used in the paper.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Do most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better? Why? I\n&gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; never worked with them, nor do I know that much about them, so I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that they could have\n&gt;&gt; made\n&gt;&gt;&gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be cool to test them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be\n&gt;&gt; able to get\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to this in the near future so if someone out there wants to swap\n&gt;&gt; them in and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; give it a go, that would be interesting.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt;&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I could not figure out whether your setup did this as well. What\n&gt;&gt; were the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; outputs in your system?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Do you think any/all of these hypotheses explain the difference in\n&gt;&gt; results?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What other likely hypothesis am I missing (I am sure there are\n&gt;&gt; lots).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks again for checking out the paper,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; PS. Tripods would be fun. I also think adding feet and a flexible\n&gt;&gt; torso\n&gt;&gt;&gt; would be interesting.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT I have wanted to see how\n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perform at controlling legged robots.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepted, so I can share\n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you now.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A copy of the paper, and videos of the simulated robots, can be\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obtained\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNE\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you find it interesting.

E., Ofria, C., & Pennock, R. T.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Evolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative\n&gt;&gt; encoding.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing\n&gt;&gt; Special\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Section\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; navigating\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rough terrain, but the design of their control software is both\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; challenging\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce\n&gt;&gt; these\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; active\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solutions, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the\n&gt;&gt; problem&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; promising\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easily\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neuroevolutionary\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which\n&gt;&gt; may\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aid its\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vastly\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results\n&gt;&gt; suggest\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems\n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complex,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
