I guess\n&gt; you could continue on the existing code base anyway. Also IKVM\n&gt; (www.ikvm.net) allows you to use Java frameworks in a .Net environment\n&gt; - my only concern there though is there will be a slight loss of\n&gt; performance (but not that much).\n&gt;\n\nOn one hand, I&#39;d have to rewrite distributed SharpNeat over again. This wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily be a big deal, but in general .NET Remoting is much better than Java\nRMI from a design level. Also, GUI development in Java is a horrendous ordeal\ncompared to VS and the resulting front end has a tendency to look like an OS/2\nprogram.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree that Java is the preferred language for most research\nnowadays, and the cross platform compatibility is a big plus. While I wouldn&#39;t\nsay that Eclipse is a dominant IDE compared to VS, you make a good point that\nif you&#39;re broke/unfunded and don&#39;t have a student license then VS can&#39;t do much\nfor you. Additionally, I&#39;m currently doing a software engineering MS with a\nfocus on Java tools, and being able to apply them to SharpNeat in a case study\nin one of my papers would be fun.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;d say if you can do it without requiring too many changes to the\nAPI, go for it. At the end of the day, SharpNeat is a means to an end for most\npeople, not the end itself. Whether it&#39;s C# or Java, I think what most people\nare interested in is really just the XML ANN that it produces.\n\n&gt; Oh and the other issue is that of support for generics/templates. Both\n&gt; Java and .Net have this now but in the Java world generics are still\n&gt; just language level constructs - they are not supported in the VM and\n&gt; hence there is no performance benefit(e.g. from avoidance of\n&gt; boxing/unboxing of value types), only a coding efficiency/compactness\n&gt; benefit. I understand this issue is being considered in the Java\n&gt; world, but it&#39;s not here now, today.\n&gt;\n\nI wouldn&#39;t hold my breath on that happening. When generics were first being\ndiscussed in Java, there were several proposed approaches, some of which did\nmodify the VM and the Bytecode language. Performance issues were discussed here\nas well as reasons for doing it. In the end, the reason that they chose to make\ngenerics only syntactic sugar was because if they modified Java Bytecode, they\nwould break countless legacy applications (hence the name of the paper, &quot;Making\nthe future safe for the past&quot;). Nevertheless, all that you&#39;re going to lose from\nan efficiency standpoint is having to call CHECKCAST in the bytecode a few\ntimes.  That&#39;s not a big deal.\n\nWesley\n\n"}}
