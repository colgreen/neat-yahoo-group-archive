The fitness function has so much to do in shaping the landscape that I don&#39;t understand how its sensible to say something like &quot;we can solve the ___ task.&quot;  It is essentially possible to cheat to solve a task by constructing a fitness function which is multi-tiered and points the algorithm in the right direction to the solution for most complicated problems, right?  Or am I just crazy?\n\n"}}
