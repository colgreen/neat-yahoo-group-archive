How \nabout something like:\n\n- lots and lots of inputs, all normalised\n- one weight on each input\n- before running each individual, run through the input weights and zero \nall except the highest N\n\n         This way, only the N most regarded inputs are used by any \nindividual, but the population as a whole can explore the whole input \nspace.  Speciation can allow groups which use different inputs to \ncompete.  Rare cross-species crosses can try to merge the use of different \nsets of inputs.  Because the &quot;circuitry&quot; for every input is always present, \neven when not in use, the system has a memory of how it used to use it, for \nwhen it comes back, etc etc.\n\n         You might want to scan the network for neurones made inert by the \nzeroed weights, just to reduce the CPU...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
