You do a great job characterizing the situation.\n\nAs=\r\n for your last question on why there is not a top tier conference in\nEAs, t=\r\nhat is a serious problem in the community.  You mentioned\n&quot;Foundations on E=\r\nAs&quot; but I think your meant &quot;Foundations of Genetic\nAlgorithms&quot; (FOGA), whic=\r\nh indeed has a low acceptance rate.  But FOGA\nis not the conference you&#39;re =\r\nlooking for unless your paper is\ntheoretical because FOGA is a theory confe=\r\nrence.  For the rest of us,\nthere is no venue with a low acceptance rate.\n\n=\r\nThe reason for this lack of a selective venue is historical and\ncomplicated=\r\n.  Many of the major figures in EA history had different\nviews about how a =\r\nconference should be run and what its goals should\nbe than people in other =\r\nareas of machine learning.  There was an\nemphasis on inclusiveness and some=\r\n had the philosophy that the prism\nof history, rather than a few reviewers,=\r\n should have the final say on\nwhat paper is great or not great.\n\nUnfortunat=\r\nely for those of us in academia, that philosophy is no help\nto us (as you p=\r\noint out) when we are tying to get jobs or tenure,\nwhere acceptance rates a=\r\nre scrutinized.  It really needs to change,\nand I believe it will, but it i=\r\ns probably going to take a generational\nchange in leadership.  So unfortuna=\r\ntely it could take a long time.\n\nIn the meantime, we can still submit to co=\r\nnferences like AAAI and\nICML.  The only problem is that the barrier to entr=\r\ny for EAs is higher\nthan for other areas because of their lack of mainstrea=\r\nm acceptance in\nmachine learning.  So we have to first justify using an EA =\r\nat all,\nwhereas another method like value-function RL can just start from t=\r\nhe\npremise that it&#39;s a good idea to begin with.  Still, people have\nsucceed=\r\ned in getting into these conferences with EA-based work, and it\nis seeping =\r\nin more and more.\n\nIn fact, the floodgates could open if EAs really start t=\r\no have\nsignificantly better results.  I believe that is possible because th=\r\ne\nemphasis on representation in EAs is going to lead to new domains\nbeing a=\r\nccessible.  We will see.\n\nAnother historical factor is that in America, the=\r\n academic lineages\ncoming out of other areas of AI for whatever reason esta=\r\nblished\nthemselves in the top departments before EAs became popular, which\n=\r\nmeans EAs are not well-represented in US computer science departments,\nwhic=\r\nh is a self-perpetuating problem.  Interestingly, the situation is\nsomewhat=\r\n different in Europe than in the US.  In Europe, EAs are more\nmainstream.  =\r\nIn the UK for example most faculties that have AI\nresearchers include EA re=\r\nsearchers.  There is just a different history\nthere.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just want to add to tw=\r\no of the issues raised here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  So you see, in\n&gt; &gt; building a new algo=\r\nrithm or a new theory with practical implications,\n&gt; &gt; often traditional pr=\r\noblems are exactly the wrong vehicle to discovery\n&gt; &gt; because they perpetua=\r\nte the same dogmatic perspectives that already\n&gt; &gt; permeate the field to be=\r\ngin with and cause it to be staying in one\n&gt; &gt; place.   Thus all of these a=\r\npplications are chosen with careful\n&gt; &gt; scrutiny with a sincere belief in t=\r\nheir practical ramifications.\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; This is really starting to be recogn=\r\nized by a lot of the machine \n&gt; learning crowd. At ILP 2007, Pedro Domingos=\r\n gave an invited\npresentation \n&gt; entitled &quot;Structured Machine Learning: Ten=\r\n Problems for the Next Ten \n&gt; Years.&quot; (http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/p=\r\nedrod/papers/ilp07.pdf) \n&gt; While it&#39;s a different subdomain of machine lear=\r\nning, he had the same \n&gt; thoughts on &quot;traditional&quot; problems as targets for =\r\nnew research. From\nthe \n&gt; article:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We need to avoid falling into loc=\r\nal optima in our research: once a \n&gt; &gt; problem is solved\n&gt; &gt; &quot;80/20,&quot; we sh=\r\nould move on to the next larger one that includes it, \n&gt; &gt; not continue to =\r\nrefine our\n&gt; &gt; solution with diminishing returns. Our natural tendency to d=\r\no the \n&gt; &gt; latter greatly slows down the\n&gt; &gt; progress of research. Moreover=\r\n, the best solutions to subproblems \n&gt; &gt; taken in isolation are often not\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the best ones in combination. Because of this, refining solutions to \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; subproblems can in fact be\n&gt; &gt; counterproductive=97digging deeper into th=\r\ne local optimum instead of \n&gt; &gt; escaping it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second point I want t=\r\no address is on the use of NEAT, or more \n&gt; generally EAs, in &quot;Fortune 100 =\r\ndefense firms.&quot; I recently\ninterviewed at \n&gt; BBN Technologies, and they tol=\r\nd me about one project their Cambridge \n&gt; team worked on and is now deploye=\r\nd in Iraq. When a convoy of troops is \n&gt; traveling and a sniper fires a sho=\r\nt, an array of microphones mounted on \n&gt; top of one of the vehicles records=\r\n the sound, then runs a \n&gt; multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to determ=\r\nine the distance, \n&gt; elevation, etc., that the shot originated from. The re=\r\nsult is that when \n&gt; an insurgent sniper fires a shot, within 3 seconds the=\r\n entire convoy \n&gt; turns around and fires everything at that spot. Apparentl=\r\ny the mic\narray \n&gt; system works well enough that it has been nicknamed the =\r\n&quot;Octopus of\nDeath.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Warning: the rest of this message is extremely off=\r\n topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s just my thoughts/experiences though. For what it&#39;s wort=\r\nh, I\nthink \n&gt; it&#39;s pretty hard to deny that EAs have fallen out of favor wi=\r\nth the \n&gt; mainstream machine learning crowd. To a large degree, I believe t=\r\nhis is \n&gt; the result of an easily satisfied community. Groucho Marx said, &quot;=\r\nI \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want to belong to any club that would have me as a member&quot; an=\r\nd \n&gt; the same is true of research communities. Conference quality is \n&gt; det=\r\nermined almost entirely by acceptance rates. The &quot;top tier&quot; \n&gt; conferences =\r\nin AI like AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, etc. all have acceptance\nrates \n&gt; around or b=\r\nelow 25%. The EA community decided to break off and form\nlots \n&gt; of special=\r\nized conferences, which would be fine, except that these \n&gt; conferences hav=\r\ne ridiculous acceptance rates of around ~45% or higher. \n&gt; With such a low =\r\nbarrier to entry, the amount of rigor applied to EA \n&gt; papers is routinely =\r\nunacceptable and occasionally shameful. The result \n&gt; is that work by Ken&#39;s=\r\n group at UCF or Risto&#39;s group at UT Austin gets \n&gt; best paper at GECCO or =\r\nCEC, but among a lot of machine learning faculty \n&gt; it still isn&#39;t consider=\r\ned as prestigious as a paper accepted to one of \n&gt; the top tier conferences=\r\n mentioned above, despite the fact that the\nwork \n&gt; is more likely to have =\r\na significant impact on practical machine\nlearning.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a Software Engi=\r\nneering student, I know what it&#39;s like to be on the \n&gt; other extreme end of=\r\n the spectrum. SE conference acceptance rates at\nthe \n&gt; top tier are dippin=\r\ng into the low teens or even single digits. This \n&gt; certainly has a lot of =\r\nnegative implications for researchers. Many \n&gt; times, reviewers simply look=\r\n for any little way to reject a paper, and \n&gt; you typically have to resubmi=\r\nt 2 or 3 times, with major revisions and \n&gt; additions each time, before a p=\r\naper is accepted. However, when a \n&gt; graduating PhD. student has several pu=\r\nblications at ICSE, OOPSLA, FSE, \n&gt; etc., their resume automatically gets t=\r\nhem considered for tenure-track \n&gt; positions at top 10 schools. There are j=\r\nust no such conferences in the \n&gt; EA domain where people would look at a se=\r\nt of publications and say\n&quot;Wow, \n&gt; he got in there--TWICE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So I guess=\r\n the question that I&#39;m throwing in here is: why isn&#39;t there a \n&gt; top tier c=\r\nonference for EAs? How about Foundations of Evolutionary \n&gt; Algorithms (FEA=\r\n)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
