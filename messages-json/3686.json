To test it, I&#39;m \nrunning\n&gt; XOR with fixe=\r\nd topology, but my runs only seem to train to three of\n&gt; the four fitness c=\r\nases. Let me describe what I&#39;m doing, and maybe\n&gt; someone can spot a flaw? =\r\nI can also send the source code to anyone\n&gt; that asks -- you just need ECJ.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There are three input nodes (0, 1, 2). The first two are the inputs\n&gt;=\r\n (taking values of 0.0 or 1.0) and the third is a fixed bias node\n&gt; (always=\r\n of value 1.0).\n&gt; \n&gt; The output node is 3, and the hidden node is 4. The co=\r\nnnections are \nas\n&gt; follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; (0, 1, 2) -&gt; (3, 4)\n&gt; 4 -&gt; 3\n&gt; \n&gt; which m=\r\nakes 7 connections in all. The activation function of each \nnode\n&gt; is 1/(1+=\r\nexp(-4.9*x)).\n&gt; \n&gt; The fitness function is defined as the sum of 1.0 - abs(=\r\ntarget -\n&gt; output), which means that the worst individuals have a fitness o=\r\nf 0\n&gt; and the best have a fitness of 4.\n&gt; \n&gt; I initialize the population wi=\r\nth N networks. The weights in each\n&gt; network are uniformly distributed as [=\r\n-5,+5). Initially, all \nnetworks\n&gt; are in one species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since individua=\r\nls do not differ in topology, they always have the \nsame\n&gt; number of genes,=\r\n so the delta between individuals is calculated as\n&gt; M*W/7, where M is the =\r\nmatching factor, W is the absolute difference \nin\n&gt; weights, and 7 is the n=\r\number of matching genes. I&#39;m using M =3D 2.0 \nfor\n&gt; my runs, since that see=\r\nms to keep around 3 species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each generation, the individuals in each =\r\nspecies are evaluated, and\n&gt; ordered from fitness best to worst. The best i=\r\nndividual in each\n&gt; species is copied into the next generation. The overall=\r\n fitness of\n&gt; each species is also computed taking the average fitness of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; individuals in that species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each species is then assigned a numb=\r\ner of new individuals to create,\n&gt; which is proportional to the species fit=\r\nness.\n&gt; \n&gt; To create a new individual, I take one parent from the top 40% o=\r\nf \nthe\n&gt; species, and another parent randomly from the species (or with 0.1=\r\n%\n&gt; probability an elite from a different species). I cross the parents,\n&gt; =\r\nwhich involves randomly selecting each gene from each parent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, wi=\r\nth probability 50%, I mutate the weights of the result: With\n&gt; 90% probabil=\r\nity, each weight is perturbed by a gaussian of standard\n&gt; deviation 2.0, an=\r\nd capped to +/- 5.0. Otherwise (10% probability) \nthe\n&gt; weights are uniform=\r\nly selected from [-5, +5).\n&gt; \n&gt; Once the individuals are created, each indi=\r\nvidual is compared with \none\n&gt; representative from the previous species. If=\r\n the individual matches \nto\n&gt; within 2.0, the individual is assigned to tha=\r\nt species. Otherwise, a\n&gt; new species is created, with that individual beco=\r\nming the\n&gt; representative for that species. On a typical run, the number of=\r\n\n&gt; species bounces between 2 and 3, with occasional excursions to 4.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhat&#39;s about it. I end up with individuals that satisfy three of the\n&gt; four =\r\ncases. Can any one spot an obvious flaw? Parameters that are\n&gt; obviously wr=\r\nong? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; --Rob\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
