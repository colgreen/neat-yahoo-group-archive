Mï¿½ndez wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve just begun experimenting with sharpNeat.  I&#39;m adding my own\n&gt;experiments, documenting the process a bit, and in the meantime have\n&gt;run into a couple of small things which I believe are bugs. What&#39;s the\n&gt;proper procedure for contributing to the project?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFor now you can email me direct on my cgreen or sharpneat address, it \ndoesn&#39;t matter which. Alternatively I&#39;ve created a new mailing list \ncalled sharpneat-developers which should appear on the sourceforge \nproject page within the next 6-24 hours (according to sourceforge help \ndocs) - don&#39;t subscribe to the existing announcement list though as I&#39;ve \nflagged it for deletion.\n\nRegarding your other (private) email I take it you&#39;re making some \nprogress in understanding how to plug in new experiments? There aren&#39;t \nany existing docs right now and I don&#39;t plan to write any as I&#39;m \nplanning to do some more significant re-structuring. That said it \nwouldn&#39;t take long to go over the basics if you still need some help.\n\nWelcome to the group,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
