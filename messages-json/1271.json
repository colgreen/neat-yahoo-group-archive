Compare the last right and left footsteps.  The \nfitness is the lesser y-distance (ie, how far the back foot&#39;s last step \nwas from starting point).  I found this to work a little better at \navoiding the &quot;just fall forward&quot; local minima of CoM distance (but it \ndoes suffer from other early traps, like shuffling the feet forward).\n\nMostly I&#39;ve been using NEAT directly from your linux version, plus the \nconstant-species-count change and some other minor tweaks.  I played \naround with different activation functions, but didn&#39;t notice any \nimprovement and am using only sigmoid now.\n\nThe phrase you quote is meant to say that my ESN approach can be \nevaluated by comparing its performance to that of NEAT on the same body, \nmuscles and physics settings, ie, using NEAT as a benchmark.  NOT that \nthey are equivalent.\n\nESN&#39;s use a form of backpropagation to train the connections to and from \na big, fixed &quot;clump&quot; of (often hundreds of) neurons with some nice \nmathematical properties that imply internal cyclical activation.  The \nfact that they are designed to work in cyclical domains is the reason I \nwanted to try something with them for a locomotion controller.  My \napproach so far is just to replace backpropagation with simple weight \nand enabled-or-not evolution.\n\nI&#39;m not applying NEAT to the ESN stuff (yet) because I&#39;m hoping to first \nget a better intuitive feel (and some code) for evolving networks with \ndifferent &quot;plasticities&quot;, in this case the totally-fixed clumps and the \nevolved connections to/from the I/O.  In the long run, I&#39;d like to be \nable to compose together layered behaviors-- eg, balancing, walking and \njumping.  Obviously, that&#39;s a bit of the holy grail, but I&#39;m hoping to \ntest soon using NEAT to evolve different networks for different tasks, \nand then evolve them all together-- perhaps treating each NEAT-evolved \nnetwork as just an ESN clump.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d love to hear any feedback-- I know similar ideas have been \ntossed around by a lot of people, anybody want to share any war stories?\n\nAlso, sorry about the movies; I know almost nothing about video and \ncodecs, but I&#39;ll try converting them to something more common (is \nquicktime the best?).\n\nThanks,\nDex\n\n\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt; Brian (or do you go by Dexter?),\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested in your methodology: what was your fitness function,\n&gt; and did you do anything special to change NEAT&#39;s neural model or\n&gt; just use it as-is? \n&gt; \n&gt; I notice you mention Echo State Networks.  I don&#39;t know much about\n&gt; these, but you say in your research & theory section, &quot;The success\n&gt; of the Evolved ESN approach can be compared to that of the NEAT\n&gt; algorithm on identical morphology.&quot;  It sounds as if you will evolve\n&gt; this ESN networok...so my question is, why not evolve it with NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; One last thing is I can&#39;t view your videos no matter what I do.  Are\n&gt; they available in any other format?  I downloaded DivX and no luck...\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Dexter Allen &lt;vector@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Hey Tyler--\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Those animations look great.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Tyler Streeter wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m using an incremental fitness function.  I use\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; training wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; center of mass moves too far) at first until they\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; learn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; remove this external help, seed a new population with\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m curious why you restart the population rather than just\n&gt; changing the\n&gt;  &gt; fitness function in the middle of the run?  Is it that you want to\n&gt;  &gt; whittle away all but the best species?  Are the genes in the first\n&gt; run\n&gt;  &gt; treated differently in the second run somehow?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; (first oscillate legs, then worry about\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; balancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; teach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; block torso seems to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; does the ANN\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; joint (which\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; stop)?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; The ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; rotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; from the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; just the two hip joints.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; My ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; modified PID (proportional integral derivative)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; controller to calculate the torque necessary to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; achieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; higher-level control system: the brain has desired\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; angles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; much force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the same type of controller but just have a constant\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; desired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; angle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; swing freely.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve been doing some similar stuff lately, same intent, but some\n&gt;  &gt; different specifics from Tyler&#39;s.  FWIW, NEAT is the best\n&gt; controller\n&gt;  &gt; evolver I&#39;ve found so far. :-)  If anybody&#39;s interested, there&#39;s a\n&gt;  &gt; couple animations up now:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; http://pantarhei.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; Brian Dexter Allen\n&gt;  &gt; http://www.luminousbeings.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; *Yahoo!
