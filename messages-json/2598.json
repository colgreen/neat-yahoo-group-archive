BTW do you know if you can set the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n graphs to roll when the number of data points hits a certain number?\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis was one of the things I managed to do in RudyGraph by using a\n&gt; &gt; circu=\r\nlar buffer based plot set.\n&gt;\n&gt; My model is sufficiently expensive that the =\r\nimpact is negligible.\n(BTW,\n&gt; I&#39;ve switched, as recommended, from relaxing =\r\nto a max 5 step\nevaluation,\n&gt; which has doubled throughput). I don&#39;t know a=\r\nbout &quot;rolling&quot; the\ngraphs,\n&gt; I suspect it might be achievable by deleting t=\r\nhe earliest point(s)\nfrom\n&gt; the PointPairList that drives the display.\n\nYes=\r\n. There&#39;s PointPairList.RemoveAt(index), so setting index =3D 0 will\nremove=\r\n the oldest point. And GraphPane.XAxis.MinAuto =3D true will let the\nX axis=\r\n adjust. A &quot;smooth&quot; rolling action could be acheived by explicitly\nsetting =\r\nthe XAxis.Min/Max properties at each update. Setting the &quot;X&quot;\nvalue on addin=\r\ng to a series to ea.Generation (what I should have done in\nthe first place)=\r\n would prevent unwanted behaviour emerging once the\nrolling point is reache=\r\nd.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
