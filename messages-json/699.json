Two legs each doing planar motion in\ndifferent planes will not be stable in the real world;\nit will wobble from side to side with increasing\namplitude.  I think the demo is &quot;rigged&quot;.\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I wanted to add: After looking closely at\n&gt; &quot;Generation 0&quot; in that \n&gt; clip, it&#39;s pretty clear there is some kind of\n&gt; constraint.  Even this \n&gt; flailing body on the ground is alternating its legs,\n&gt; albeit in an \n&gt; unproductive way.  But how can that alternation be\n&gt; present at \n&gt; generation 0?  Obviously they somehow forced it that\n&gt; way.  I think \n&gt; it&#39;s pretty exciting because I doubt they have the\n&gt; same quality \n&gt; neuroevolution technology as NEAT, which suggests\n&gt; that the problem \n&gt; actually isn&#39;t that hard given the right\n&gt; constraints, which implies \n&gt; Tyler could possibly evolve even more sophisticated\n&gt; behaviors than \n&gt; these guys have.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot;\n&gt; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Wow, that&#39;s pretty nice!  Did you see the demo of\n&gt; their evolution:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://www.naturalmotion.com/pages/technology_hiw.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s very strange that it&#39;s walking well after\n&gt; only 20 \n&gt; generations.  \n&gt; &gt; It makes you wonder what constraints they put in\n&gt; there.  However, \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; does show this pursuit is feasible.  But it\n&gt; clearly needs the \n&gt; right \n&gt; &gt; joint controls, fitness function, and possible\n&gt; constraints.  For \n&gt; &gt; example, maybe it must be impossible for it to\n&gt; move both legs \n&gt; &gt; forward at the same time?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ai_junkie_dot_com&quot;\n&gt; &lt;fup@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you guys might be interested in taking a\n&gt; look at this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.naturalmotion.com/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They have had considerable success with evolving\n&gt; human motion. \n&gt; &gt; There&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not a lot to read but you&#39;ll enjoy watching the\n&gt; demos.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
