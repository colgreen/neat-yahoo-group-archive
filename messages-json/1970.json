It went ve=\r\nry well indeed and I&#39;ve put it online now\n&gt;so anyone who is interested can =\r\ncheck it out at:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.redcrocodile.net/source/\n&gt;\n&gt;Any feedback wou=\r\nld be greatly appreciated, but don&#39;t forget that I&#39;m\n&gt;still relatively new =\r\nto the field of NE :)\n&gt;\n&gt;(2) Right, so after this last 3 months of work (an=\r\nd ~6 months of\n&gt;research) I am seriously thinking about continuing on study=\r\ning\n&gt;computational neuroscience and the many topics that Ken and his\n&gt;colle=\r\nagues have been working on: intelligent systems, NE, AE, plastic\n&gt;synapses,=\r\n and modular NN design along with heterogeneous NN designs\n&gt;such as gas net=\r\ns (which I know very little about at the moment).  The\n&gt;work/research that =\r\nI would do would be applied to autonomous agents\n&gt;using environments/scenar=\r\nios from video games as testbeds.  The entire\n&gt;field fascinates me and has =\r\ndone so for a significant amount of time.\n&gt;  The reasons behind such contem=\r\nplations are numerous and well thought\n&gt;out, but I won&#39;t dwell on them any =\r\nfurther for the moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;So, now that I have a BSc (Hons) in Computer Gam=\r\nes Technology, my\n&gt;question to the group is where I should go from here.  I=\r\nf I continue\n&gt;with education, the goal at the end of the journey will be a =\r\nPhD.  No\n&gt;doubt about it.  I read Julian&#39;s post about the University of Sus=\r\nsex\n&gt;and that appears to be a MARVELOUS institute for such studies, but I\n&gt;=\r\nam curious to know if anyone else has any recommendations.  Quick\n&gt;info: Ca=\r\nnadian student willing to study anywhere (on a reasonable\n&gt;budget).  Additi=\r\nonally, I should be receiving a first class degree\n&gt;(knock on wood).\n&gt;\n&gt;(3)=\r\n I am unsure as to whether or not it is necessary to get an MSc\n&gt;before get=\r\nting a PhD.  I am 27 now (took several years off to work\n&gt;before going to U=\r\nniversity) and would rather not spend a year doing an\n&gt;MSc if it is not nec=\r\nessary.  Then again, I know very little about this\n&gt;issue.  What are people=\r\n&#39;s opinions about this?\n\nIt&#39;s not necessary.\n\nGenerally in the UK, if you a=\r\nre doing a higher degree by research (and you \nwill be) then what happens (=\r\nused to happen) is you only get registered for \nan MSc (e.g. 1 year) by the=\r\n university, and that gets converted to a three \nyear PhD course if you per=\r\nform satisfactorily during the first year.  It&#39;s \na bit of a formality, e.g=\r\n. you have to be _terrible_ before they chuck you \nout after 1 year and it =\r\nhardly happens to anybody.\n\nThat said, that is done mostly for UK political=\r\n/funding issues (e.g. \nuniversities get scored on what proportion of studen=\r\nts finish the course \nand funding support from the government for higher de=\r\ngrees tends to be \nlimited to one for student).  So doing an MSc first does=\r\nn&#39;t generally make \nsense for a UK student.\n\nSo depending where you mean to=\r\n get the money from, your case may be different.\n\n&gt;(4) I am not rich.  Any =\r\nuniversities that offer the potential for paid\n&gt;discussion/assistant positi=\r\nons while studying are going to have to be\n&gt;tops on my list.  Is this somet=\r\nhing that I might expect from\n&gt;Universities or not?\n\nNot sure about the fun=\r\nding situation for a non-EU national, many awards in \nEurope are limited to=\r\n EU nationals.  OTOH, most other countries have some \nsort of scheme in pla=\r\nce for sending students here to study.  Those would be \nsomething you&#39;d hav=\r\ne to research back home.  Where did you get the money \nfor your BSc.\n\nThere=\r\n are a smaller number of research assistantships.  These are where a \nstaff=\r\n member has money to hire a research assistant and can pretty much \nchoose =\r\nwho they like.  I suspect that employment regulations would be \npretty rela=\r\nxed, given where you&#39;re coming from and the fact that it is \nfixed term and=\r\n educational.  Research assistants are often expected/allowed \nto register =\r\nfor a PhD but not always, so check that.\n\nIn the past, RA&#39;s paid better tha=\r\nn studentships, but pretty poorly by any \n&quot;professional&quot; scales.  They are =\r\ngenerally aimed at young single persons \nwith no huge expenses.  Good place=\r\ns to look for these are in relevant \nmagazines (e.g. New Scientist) and the=\r\n university&#39;s own web-sites.\n\n&gt;Again, I am very na=EFve when it comes to po=\r\nst graduate studies so any\n&gt;information that anyone may offer would be grea=\r\ntly appreciated.\n\nISRT alcohol is involved in the process somewhere :)\n\nIt =\r\ndepends a little on your relationship with your supervisor.  Some grant \nyo=\r\nu complete freedom to make your own way.  Others already have an agenda \nan=\r\nd try to make you stick with it.  You will need to meet the supervisor \nand=\r\n get a feel for their personality and style.  It&#39;s also good to talk to \nth=\r\neir existing students and possibly also those from neighbouring \nlaboratori=\r\nes/offices.  You might be able to do this in the guise of asking \nabout loc=\r\nal accomodation/social life.  It&#39;s also fairly common to be handed \nto anot=\r\nher student for a quick tour of the department, although that \ndepends on h=\r\now old/fat/self-important the supervisor is.\n\nDo you have any feedback in A=\r\nbertay from people on previous year&#39;s courses \nwho went into research.  Hav=\r\ne you talked it over with the staff in Abertay, \nthey will probably be keen=\r\n to help.  Also, if there are any research places \ngoing in Abertay, then u=\r\nsually a student already on site has the great \nadvantage in claiming them.=\r\n\n\nI see your qualification is in games.  That is a three edged sword, becau=\r\nse \n(i) it tries to show you are qualified to work in the games industry, (=\r\nii) \nbut games courses are new and not automatically trusted by the games \n=\r\nindustry, and (iii) it can be read as implying you are not qualified for \na=\r\nny other industry.\n\nYou could consider doing a year or two in industry firs=\r\nt and then looking \nfor a PhD:\nadvantages: it gives you an incredibly more =\r\ndetailed view of where the \nresearch fits into the world, it shows you how =\r\nreal software engineering is \nnothing like computer science, you get lots o=\r\nf coding experience, you see \nthe infamous project management in action\ndis=\r\nadvantage: you get used to a high salary, can be stressful\n\n&gt;Thanks so much=\r\n for all your help so far and I look forward to reading\n&gt;your responses to =\r\nthis post.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sincerely,\n&gt;Michael Frayn\n\n         Ian (possibly a little ou=\r\nt of date here)\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
