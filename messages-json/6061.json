For a\ngiven problem domain the set of option preserving actions is usually\nfairly narrow in relation to all possible actions, so the resulting\nagents (if they are able to preserve options) will inevitably\ndemonstrate something akin to intelligent behaviour.\n\nI&#39;d be interested in others&#39; take on this. This idea that intelligence\nis related to entropy is not entirely new so I&#39;m not quite sure what\nnew ideas this paper offers (if any). What are good methods for\nmeasuring (or estimating) future history preservation? (entropy). I\nhave some initial ideas but I&#39;ll leave it at that for now.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
