So I&#39;m not quite sure why this is occur=\r\ning.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I would set OutputCount to 1, and also modify Substrate.cs so =\r\nthat\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t try to read the bias weight from output[1]. Basically you=\r\n\n&gt; can comment out lines 298 to 311 (the section of code that adds a bias\n&gt;=\r\n connection). It&#39;s not clear if that is what you did so report back if\n&gt; th=\r\nis isn&#39;t working.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
