SharpNeat 2 (SN2) is nearing release and a=\r\nllows metrics to be plugged and thus compared, there&#39;s a bit more to it tha=\r\nn that and I&#39;m currently writing some documentation to explain how this wil=\r\nl work along with some issues to keep in mind, pros and cons, etc.\n\n  Anywa=\r\ny in writing up this stuff I ended up documenting how the original metric w=\r\norks, as described in the original NEAT paper in 2002. Now I&#39;ve got a suspi=\r\ncion that this came up long ago but in that paper the distance is given as:=\r\n\n\n  d =3D c1*E/N + c2*D/N + c3*W\n\n  (E,D are the # of excess and disjoint g=\r\nenes. W is the total weight diff).\n\n  N is the number of genes in the longe=\r\nst genome. So the contribution of excess/disjoint genes to d is normalized.=\r\n In Ken&#39;s original code this equation is commented out and replaced with th=\r\ne equivalent of:\n\n  d =3D c1*E + c2*D + c3*W\n\n  This makes more sense to me=\r\n, it puts far more emphasis on the difference in topology than the first ve=\r\nrsion and is sort of related to edit distance and manhattan distance. \n\n  F=\r\nor the record SN1 also uses the latter equation and the other implementatio=\r\nn I checked just now was ANJI2 which uses the former. Not sure what the imp=\r\nlications of this are but I suspect it would have a significant effect on s=\r\npeciation with secondary effects from there. Others may wish to review the =\r\nmetric in their implementations.\n\n  Colin.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n  No virus found =\r\nin this incoming message.\n  Checked by AVG - www.avg.com \n  Version: 8.5.40=\r\n9 / Virus Database: 270.13.76/2345 - Release Date: 09/04/09 05:51:00\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_017E_01CA2E35.92DDBC30\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18812&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 =\r\nface=3DArial&gt;Colin,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;Thankyou for the clarification =\r\nabout the genome \ncompatability metrics.
