After reaching =\r\na predefined fitness value I switch over to the next set of input data. Whe=\r\nn the fitness is too low the training begins for this data and continues un=\r\ntil the predefined fitness value is reached and so on.\nAfter a few iteratio=\r\nns the network produces perfect outputs on some sets of data. Consequently =\r\nthe best fitness value is extremly high. When I now switch to a new set of =\r\ndata it&#39;s nearly impossible to reach this fitness and so the best genome wi=\r\nll never change again, even if it performs really bad on different inputs.\n=\r\nMy idea was that I could reset the best fitness each time when I change the=\r\n input data. The data is changed within the EvaluateNetwork method; is ther=\r\ne also a way to reset the best fitness from within this method? Or should I=\r\n better change the whole workflow?\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel_kuppitz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have =\r\na general question regarding the learning process.\n&gt; \n&gt; After playing aroun=\r\nd with NERO the last days, I&#39;ve learned a lot about how networks learn, but=\r\n I still found no answer to this elementary question: In which sequence sho=\r\nuld I train a network that has to solve more than one task. NERO isn&#39;t buil=\r\nd with HyperNEAT, but I think my questions target HyperNEAT as well as NEAT=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider 9 stages:\n&gt; \n&gt; Network is ...\n&gt; \n&gt;   1: quite good in task =\r\n#1\n&gt;   2: really good in task #1\n&gt;   3: perfect in task #1\n&gt;   4: quite goo=\r\nd in task #2\n&gt;   5: really good in task #2\n&gt;   6: perfect in task #2\n&gt;   7:=\r\n quite good in task #1 and #2\n&gt;   8: really good in task #1 and #2\n&gt;   9: p=\r\nerfect in task #1 and #2\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously I&#39;ll begin with stage 1, but what&#39;s=\r\n next? Should I continue to train my network in this task (continue with st=\r\nage 2) or should I switch to the next task (stage 4/7) and come back to sta=\r\nge 2 later.\n&gt; The next question is: How should I calculate the fitness when=\r\n the network is trained in task #2.  Should solutions for task #2 be reward=\r\ned higher than those for task #1 (stage 4) or should solutions for task #1 =\r\nstill get the same reward as in stage 1 (stage 7)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe there&#39;s no ge=\r\nneral answer to my questions, but what&#39;s the best practice? What makes sens=\r\ne, what does not?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
