In fact, there is=\r\n a solution with no hidden neurons (which must have a recurrent connection =\r\non the output).  The pole balancing tasks turned out to require much less s=\r\ntructure than was thought, which is something NEAT discovered.\n\nken\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;genemerdock&quot; &lt;genemerdock@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m exper=\r\niencing some strange behavior from NEAT, I&#39;ve rewritten the Double Pole Wit=\r\nhout Velocities and with Damping recently using another language, and plugg=\r\ned it back in. \n&gt; \n&gt; After running the experiment many times, every once in=\r\n a rare while NEAT manages to solve the Double Pole Balancing without veloc=\r\nities and with Damping experiment using 1 Neuron.
