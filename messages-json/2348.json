A genome with 100% sucess \nrate(26/26) was found after 7 hrs. However the max fitness in the \npopulation was 25/26 after only 74 mins. Actually this is a little \nbetter than the results I published in my phased search write up, so \nmaybe some recent bug fixes have had a positive impact or maybe it&#39;s \njust a one-off result.\n\nTo clarify, this is an experiment with 26 input bitmaps of size 7x9 (=63 \ninputs) which together present images of the 26 lower case letters of \nthe alphabet to the network.  Hence there are 26 outputs for the network \nto indicate which bitmap it thinks it is being shown.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
