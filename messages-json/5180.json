Our paper, &quot;=\r\nEvolving the Placement and Density of Neurons in the HyperNEAT Substrate,&quot; =\r\nwhich will be presented at GECCO this year, is available here:\n\nhttp://eple=\r\nx.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/risi.gecco10.html\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/pa=\r\npers/risi_gecco10.pdf\n\nThis paper introduces a theory on how node placement=\r\n should relate to connectivity and then applies that theory to construct an=\r\n algorithm that derives the placement and density of hidden neurons in the =\r\nsubstrate automatically.  One interesting aspect of this new approach (call=\r\ned Evolvable Substrate HyperNEAT or ES-HyperNEAT) is that it introduces no =\r\nnew representation at all.  In other words, the CPPN is no different than i=\r\nt was for traditional fixed substrate evolution.  Thus ES-HyperNEAT can be =\r\napplied as HyperNEAT normally would be yet now without worrying about where=\r\n to place hidden nodes or how many there should be. We hope this paper will=\r\n provoke renewed thinking and ideas on the subject of substrate evolution, =\r\nand we will be interested to hear your thoughts.  As far as we know, this p=\r\naper is the first to be published on this subject.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
