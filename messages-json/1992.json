Not that it really affects the experiment \nvery much, so long as the angle isn&#39;t so large that the pole cannot be \nstraightened.\n\nJust to clarify for anyone who was wondering, this is a piece of source \ncode from Kens C++ NEAT source that initialises one of the  pole \nbalancing experiments. The fact that I recognise it so readily probably \nsuggests I should get out more :)\n\nColin.\n\nnishiharashino wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello, \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I found \n&gt;       \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  if (!generalization_test) {\n&gt;    state[0] = state[1] = state[3] = state[4] = state[5] = 0;\n&gt;    state[2] = 0.07; // one_degree;\n&gt;  }\n&gt;  else {\n&gt;    state[4] = state[5] = 0;\n&gt;  }\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;at void CartPole::init(bool randomize) in experiment.cpp randomize).\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that one_degree is 0.0174532.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Is it true??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Shino\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
