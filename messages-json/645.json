I made a further change so that the sensor sectors are now shown \nalso.\n\n&gt;You mentioned your imperfect results and I was thinking\n&gt;this may be due to your style of evaluation as opposed to your NEAT\n&gt;implementation.  For example, do you start each trial from a random\n&gt;position (either the prey or the predator)?  Or is something\n&gt;randomized about the prey? \n&gt;\nYes. The agent starts a random position at least 4 units from a wall. \nThe prey is then placed at a random angle between 2 and 4 units away. \nThe prey&#39;s movement is also partially random, basically it&#39;s probability \nof moving away from the agent increases as the agent gets closer - so at \na large distance the prey moves completely randomly.\n\n&gt; Randomization can cause noise in the\n&gt;evaluation, which means something looks like a champ might just be a\n&gt;lucky break, which can wreak havoc with fitness consistency.  It\n&gt;sometimes makes more sense to make things deterministic, even if that\n&gt;is counterintuitive.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk I&#39;ve just made a few changes to always start in the centre, and to \nperform 16 tests which are basically placing the prey at a distance of 4 \nat 16 different angles (0, 22.5, 45, etc). This still leaves the random \nprey movement which I&#39;ll set to always move directly away from the agent \nfor the initial moves, leaving movement to be partialy random from \nthereon. This isn&#39;t so bad since the main problem is to get the agent to \nremember where the prey was last seen before it moved out of sensor \nrange during the initial steps - the subsequent increases in difficulty \nby increasing the speed of the prey aren&#39;t actually necessary IMHO.\n\nAnother point is that I do try to counteract the effects of noise by \nperiodically re-evaluating members of the population that persist from \ngeneration to generation, therefore one lucky result will only skew the \nsearch for a while. Of course you may get one(or more) lucky result per \ngeneration, so this isn&#39;t a perfect solution by any means. In fact I may \nscrap this approach altogether, it was just a temprary hack really.\n \nAnyway I&#39;ll let you know how it goes, my gut feeling here is that you&#39;re \nright but that there is also a problem elsewhere. Therefore my overall \nstrategy for the moment is to port the pole balancing problem domain \nfrom the original NEAT and see how SharpNEAT performs in comparison.\n\nThanks for the feedback,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
