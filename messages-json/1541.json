Certain information, when it is promulgated,\ncauses a reaction in demand, which has an influence in the price. \nLooking at past performance then is only looking at half the\nequation...\n\nNow, this is probably an intractible thing to do, but what if...\n\nSuppose you were to monitor the internet.  Monitor news stories,\narticles, blogs, etc.  Feed that in (in some form or another) as\nadditional inputs to correlate with the numbers themselves.  Give the\nnetwork something besides the numbers themselves to use as indicators\nof future behavior.  Let it learn the kinds of things that foreshadow\nfuture rises or falls.  Then, as such things start to appear in the\ncommunications, the algorithm is better equipped to predict the\nfluctuations that are psychology driven instead of formula driven.\n\nJust an idea. :)\n\n"}}
