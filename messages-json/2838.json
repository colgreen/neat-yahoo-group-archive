I did have success combining\n&gt;&gt; evolution and learning.  However, unlike what you described, my\n&gt;&gt; thesis included the learning within the life of the network rather\n&gt;&gt; than after the evolution is complete.  So, evolution would create a\n&gt;&gt; network, then that network would learn to perform a task, then it\n&gt;&gt; was evaluated based on its ability to learn the task.  The learned\n&gt;&gt; weights were NOT passed onto the next generation.  The idea was to\n&gt;&gt; evolve a network that was better at learning.  I was able to show\n&gt;&gt; this was possible using the task of learning to solve polynomials.\n&gt;&gt; A very simple example, but functional.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I know people have combined NEAT with BP in the past.  For\n&gt;&gt; example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Chris Christenson had some success with it, but I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; still reading this group.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, the number of generations (and hence the length of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; time) it takes to solve a problem depends on problem difficulty,\n&gt;&gt; so\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s difficult to give an accurate estimate, but 7 hours is\n&gt;&gt; probably\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a reasonable expectation for the problem you cite.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, supervised classification problems tend to be faster than\n&gt;&gt;&gt; control problems since they don&#39;t involve a domain simulator, so\n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can expect it to be possibly a lot faster.  However, if you use BP\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you have to factor in the time that adds to each evaluation,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; depending how you fold it into your procedure.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also guessing you will not need two hidden layers of 8 hidden\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nodes each to solve your problem.  NEAT usually discovers that it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; takes a lot less than you expect to solve problems that seem like\n&gt;&gt;&gt; they should be difficult.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, NEAT has been applied to real world industrial problems\n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; simulation, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s been literally used in e.g a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; real factory or something like that.  But a 300 instance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; classification sounds fairly straightforward.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry , just to clarify for (3) if we took an example with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say 300 training samples, with say 100 samples in the test set.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to try and get an idea.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi I&#39;m taking a look for possibly using in for my Masters\n&gt;&gt;&gt; project,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which  needs evolving the architecture for a neural net for a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; real\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; world application.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have read some of Ken Stanley&#39;s papers on the web but beyond\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a beginner, so if I may ask some beginner&#39;s questions:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) I think my neural net may be evolved using GAs , but fine\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tuned to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; optimise using standard BP (ie hybrid approach). Has anybody\n&gt;&gt;&gt; else been\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down that path using NEAT, taking e.g. the weights evolved\n&gt;&gt; using\n&gt;&gt;&gt; NEAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; & feeding them into some standard BP software?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Has NEAT been used in any &#39;real world&#39;/industrial\n&gt;&gt;&gt; applications yet?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a &#39;how long is a piece of string question&#39;...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)  As yet  have no feel for how long the evolution might\n&gt;&gt; take.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ran a few of the downloaded sample executables they seem to\n&gt;&gt; take\n&gt;&gt;&gt; quite\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a while to run. My neural net has 8 inputs, one output and if\n&gt;&gt; we\n&gt;&gt;&gt; guess\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at a final neural net of 2 hidden layers with 8 nodes per\n&gt;&gt; layer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If we\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used say a 2GHz PC doing nothing else - could we guess at 7\n&gt;&gt; hours\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (i.e. an overnight run) to evolve or is it more likely to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; several\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days?
