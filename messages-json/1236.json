As soon as I get the first version completed, I am\nthinking I will put up a small site for it.  That way, someone can browse\nthrough the Javadocs and look through some example XML docs of persisted\nnetworks.  As for a design document, I will think about it.  I would prefer\nto have most of it in the Javadocs.  I think it will involve less rewriting\nand be more self-contained and more likely to be kept up-to-date that way.\n\nI am still doing the rework to incorporate the design changes about which I\ntalked with Derek and Philip.  I am pretty thoroughly Javadoc-ing as I am\nwriting the code.  It may be another couple weeks of spare time work before\nI am able to thoroughly test the code.  I only get around 5-10 hours a week\nto work on my projects.  If all goes well, that will climb to 15-20 here\nsoon.\n\nThank you for the feedback on the input node activation function question.\nI am feeling more confident about my understanding of the ANN nuances.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, July 25, 2004 10:46 AM\nSubject: RE: [neat] An ANN design question...\n\n\n&gt; &gt;As I have written previously here, I am working on an optimized ANN\n&gt; &gt;implementation in Java which I have named SEMIANN (Sparsely Evaluated\n&gt; &gt;Matrix Interace Artificial Neural Network).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you get a chance and can write up a design document explaining the\n&gt; methodology used, I&#39;d like to read it. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;It is my understanding from the small number of ANN implementations I\nhave\n&gt; &gt;seen (around 5)\n&gt; &gt;including that of David Fogel (author of book titled &quot;Blondie24&quot; from\nwhich\n&gt; &gt;I am duplicating\n&gt; &gt;experiments), the input data is placed directly into the input node.  The\n&gt; &gt;data is not bounded\n&gt; &gt;(other than the actual limits of a float or double).  And the input node\n&gt; &gt;does *not* have an\n&gt; &gt;activation function.  The unbounded data present in the input node is\nthen\n&gt; &gt;used in the activation\n&gt; &gt;of the hidden nodes (simple 3 layer feed forward network).  Any sort of\n&gt; &gt;altering the input data is\n&gt; &gt;then handled by the weight attached to that input node.  The GA process\n&gt; &gt;will then drift the\n&gt; &gt;weights around such that inputs which are not so valuable are muted with\n&gt; &gt;smaller weight values.\n&gt; &gt;And inputs which are important are magnified with higher weight values.\n&gt; &gt;And all of these weights\n&gt; &gt;will eventually form a function over which the input data is &quot;normalized&quot;\n&gt; &gt;based on each input&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;relative importance, a sort of first approximation of the input data&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;inter-relatedness.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is what I have seen, as well.  And it is how my Perl version of NEAT\nis\n&gt; implemented.  Obviously, I didn&#39;t port Ken&#39;s C++ code to Perl, I took the\n&gt; ideas from the papers and re-implemented them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;In contrast, Philip and Derek indicated an input data point entering\ntheir\n&gt; &gt;ANN implementation is\n&gt; &gt;actually being pushed through the input node&#39;s activation function.  Then\n&gt; &gt;the &quot;modified&quot; data\n&gt; &gt;point is now placed into the input node.  It is then used in the\nactivation\n&gt; &gt;of the &quot;hidden&quot; nodes.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m inclined to think that for a controller, which is what NEAT is most\n&gt; often applied to, that the practice of running the input values through\nthe\n&gt; activation function doesn&#39;t hurt it much.  But I can easily imagine\ndomains\n&gt; where the practice could render it nearly impossible for NEAT to evolve a\n&gt; solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sidenote: In SEMIANN, I do not allow a connection to have a destination\nof\n&gt; &gt;an input node.  So\n&gt; &gt;there is no need for an activation function at an input node.  And input\n&gt; &gt;node is treated as just\n&gt; &gt;an unbounded data point.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ditto for Perl NEAT.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
