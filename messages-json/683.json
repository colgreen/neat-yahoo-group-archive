My mind is kind of geared in that\n&gt;direction at present.  I guess I would like to leave\n&gt;that option (transferring neural nets to real robots)\n&gt;open, so I am trying to focus on more realistic\n&gt;senses.\n\nThen I would suggest you leave out the joint position sensors I mentioned \nbefore.  Hopefully muscle contraction sensations and touch sensations and \njoint limit sensors should be enough.\n\nMore on kinesthetic sense...\n\nHold your arms straight out in front of you.  Cross them at the elbows.  Now \nput them palm together and lock the hands together.  Now rotate the hands \ndown and back up so that now they are pointing at your face.  Have somebody \npoint to a finger without touching it.  Now without taking too long to think \nabout it, try to move the finger that they are pointing to.  Usually, you \nwill move the wrong one.  You LEARN to get it right.  But initially, you \nmove the wrong one.  Indicating that the kinesthetic &#39;sense&#39; is not direct, \nit is constructed based on other senses.\n\nAnother tidbit...they have identified the region where that sense is \nprocessed.  They can stimulate that region and cause one&#39;s sense of body \nposition to shift.  Interesting, eh? :)\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTest your �Travel Quotient� and get the chance to win your dream trip! \nhttp://travel.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
