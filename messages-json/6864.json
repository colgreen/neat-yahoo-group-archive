The full Call for Papers for the\nspecial issue, along with paper submission instructions, is available\nat: http://bit.ly/2wkiqnh\n\nWe believe that this is a great opportunity to strengthen the field\nand to bring together researchers from many directions through the\npublishing of this special issue.\n\nWe would like to invite all speakers and attendees of the First\nInterdisciplinary Workshop on Social Learning and Cultural Evolution\nto submit a paper for the special issue.
