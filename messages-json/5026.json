I&#39;m a java developer. \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Trevor =\r\nBurton &lt;worldofpaper@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently asked about C# and Java ver=\r\nsions of NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; I downloaded Ugo Vierucci&#39;s JNEAT code, got it working =\r\nand started having a\n&gt; nose through the source - it&#39;s a bit of a mess and d=\r\nifficult to follow or\n&gt; adapt because of that. So i thought i&#39;d take a crac=\r\nk at refactoring it a\n&gt; little and that little has ended up being a complet=\r\ne re-write. I&#39;ve given it\n&gt; the rather imaginative title of JNEAT2 - but th=\r\nis&#39;ll probably change when\n&gt; the right name suggests itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not f=\r\ninished yet but thought i&#39;d just post as i&#39;ve been really enjoying\n&gt; this p=\r\nroject and hopefully others will find it useful once i&#39;m done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basical=\r\nly i&#39;ve:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    - Seperated the core NEAT classes from the UI and the l=\r\noading mechanism -\n&gt;    There&#39;s a nice easy way of creating new UI&#39;s to vie=\r\nw the evolution/winners\n&gt;    etc. etc. now.\n&gt;    - All the properties are l=\r\noaded via Spring&#39;s IOC container - so\n&gt;    everything is in easy-to-read xm=\r\nl or properties files.\n&gt;    - Experiments are created as JAR files - with a=\r\nll the spring context\n&gt;    files defining the experiment&#39;s parameters/genom=\r\nes/training data etc and\n&gt;    compiled .class files inside - these are load=\r\ned by JNEAT2 and the experiment\n&gt;    can be executed - the settings can be =\r\nadjusted and the experiment re-run or\n&gt;    saved back out as a new JAR file=\r\n so experiments can easily be transferred.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a Flash/Flex develop=\r\ner primarily so my interest in abstracting the UI\n&gt; elements is so i can bu=\r\nild a Flex client for this Java &#39;back-end&#39; - this way\n&gt; i can have a web-ba=\r\nsed interface for experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is purely a personal project at th=\r\ne moment - so i plan on releasing the\n&gt; finished code as an open-source pro=\r\nject and developing some experiments with\n&gt; it once i&#39;ve got things working=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep the list updated with my progress and if anyone has any\n&gt; =\r\ncomments/suggestions/requests feel free to drop me a line.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Trevor Burton\n&gt; http://www.flashmonkey.org\n&gt; http://www.infrared5.c=\r\nom\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
