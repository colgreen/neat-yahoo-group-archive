It really is\n&gt; &gt;appreciated.  And helpful!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Certainly has. My initial test was somewhat lacking so I decided to bite\n&gt;the bullet and have written a new optimized neural net class to test\n&gt;some of the theories/ideas posted on the list. Result? Currently I&#39;m\n&gt;looking at about a 12x speedup on very large networks and about 3x on\n&gt;smaller, more realsitic networks. I may have to sacrifice a little bit\n&gt;of this to get dynamic activation fucntions back, but yeh, nice result\n&gt;huh :)\n\nNice :)\n\nNow move on to &quot;ludicrously large&quot; networks (tm).\n\nBut seriously, I&#39;m glad to have been useful.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
