Surely if there are\nrecurrent paths then the network is no longer FF? Anyway I think the\nscheme I&#39;m proposing (and variations on it) allows for fast evolution\nof networks of with various kinds of restrictions. By FF I mean DAGs,\nbut I think the idea could be applied to evolve trees and potentially\nother types of structure.\n\nThe main motivation for me is that although extra work is required in\nthe mutation and crossover schemes, the resulting networks can be\nefficiently computed. If all you wanted was an FF network then\nevolving cyclic/recurrent networks as I do currently is very wasteful.\nOther times you genuinely want strictly FF-only, e.g. I suspect HMMs\nfall into that category, though I may be wrong on that one.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
