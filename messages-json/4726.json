The problem is that once you encapsulate several=\r\n genes into one gene, it becomes too easy to repeat that module all over th=\r\ne place, which runs a high risk of putting it in places it does not belong.=\r\n  Most large complex modules do not easily fit literally anywhere.\n\nA bette=\r\nr approach is through indirect encoding, like in HyperNEAT, which tends to =\r\nelaborate on preexisting regularities to create additional complexity.  So =\r\nI think HyperNEAT is a more promising direction for encoding regularities o=\r\nr repeating substructures than a system that tries to create an explicit hi=\r\nerarchy.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interesting. Do you think this result in some simplifie=\r\nd hard and fast\n&gt; &gt; rules you/we can use to get near optimal experimental s=\r\netups with\n&gt; &gt; minimal effort/thought?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Colin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; have you guy=\r\ns considered for NEAT v2 a gene to be not just a link, but a group of links=\r\n ? And even more, a gene to be a well defined large network ? I have found =\r\nthis video called &quot;inner life of a cell&quot;, amazing video btw:\n&gt; http://www.s=\r\ntudiodaily.com/main/searchlist/6850.html\n&gt; for example, check the motor pro=\r\ntein walking on the video and carrying a sphere of lipids, that gene has on=\r\nly one function of &quot;moving stuff&quot;. Could next version of NEAT evolve someth=\r\ning like that and separate it as a net and name it as some sort of &quot;complex=\r\n gene&quot;, for later reuse to build more complex structures? For example, it w=\r\nould scan through whole population, and recognize inside each network, a sm=\r\nall subnetwork that is repeating along many species, then it would disconne=\r\nct this network, and name it as a gene. Do you think it could work ?\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhanks for your comments.\n&gt; Nikolai\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
