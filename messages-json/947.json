They can&#39;t represent a weight \nmore than some limit, by virtue of their physical structure.  Having \nmultiple connections between neurons is a work-around allowing it to have \nmore dynamic range available to it.\n\nArtificial neural networks with double-precision floating point weights have \nmore than enough precision for the tasks we are assigning to them.  Having \nmultiple connections is an unnecessary redundancy.  Can it work?  Obviously. \n  But it is an inefficient way to do things, and adds nothing of value in \nthe process that I am aware of.\n\n\n&gt;From: &quot;Umer Iqbal&quot; &lt;umeriqbal81@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Connections\n&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Jun 2004 09:26:07 +0500\n&gt;\n&gt;In the case of natural neural networks, do we have more than one \n&gt;connections between two neurons?\n&gt;If so, should we or shouldn&#39;t we incorporate them in ANNs ?\n&gt;\n&gt;Umer..\n&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   From: yurifromtomsk\n&gt;   To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, June 02, 2004 6:27 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [neat] Re: Connections\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Here&#39;s a thought...  Why give connections a unique innovation number \n&gt;at all?\n&gt;   &gt;   Why not assign their unique ID based on the innovation numbers of \n&gt;the\n&gt;   &gt; nodes they connect?  If you create a new connection between nodes 253 \n&gt;and\n&gt;   &gt; 275, then the ID for the connection could be &quot;253:275&quot;.  Store the\n&gt;   &gt; connections in a hash table, and you have instant prevention of \n&gt;duplicates.\n&gt;   &gt; Then, even if a connection is created 10 generations later, if it \n&gt;connects\n&gt;   &gt; the same nodes, it&#39;s the same gene.  Even if the organism has \n&gt;subsequently\n&gt;   &gt; gone off and formed its own species.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Any reason why that wouldn&#39;t work?\n&gt;\n&gt;   I think there is a problem to appear. You idea supposes some global pool \n&gt;for connections information. Right? So there is no way to keep connections \n&gt;that do link the same neurons but have different weights. It&#39;s just because \n&gt;such connections are always the same for hash function as they have similar \n&gt;IDs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
