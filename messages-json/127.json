Here you&#39;re inputting\n&gt; the\n&gt; smallest amount of information necessary for the\n&gt; network to play the game successfully.  I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; exactly how this would work in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; If, for example, the network outputs two positions,\n&gt; and both are empty, there is no state change to the\n&gt; table, right?  So you have no input to the network\n&gt; (I\n&gt; suppose you could input all zeros).\n&gt; \n&gt; So do you activate the network again, and take those\n&gt; outputs?  Or do you just take the next highest\n&gt; outputs\n&gt; that correspond to spaces occupied with cards? \n\nThat would correspond to an illegal or invalid move. \nMy approach to evolution is very draconian; if a game\nplaying ANN wants to make an invalid or illegal move I\ngive it a very low fitness, and end the game right\nthere.  That ANN will soon be eliminated from the\npopulation.  Usually, in the beginning, that happens\nto most of the ANNs, but hopefully not all of them.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
