Could you explain how GA works in \nNEAT? The=\r\nre is elitism in the program, I thought it would ensure the \nconvergence of=\r\n the algorithm, but it seems there are other mechanisms \nthat govern the pr=\r\nocess. Since the elites are preserved, why does the \nprocess still get stuc=\r\nk? And the networks have barely grown too \nlarge, with an average number of=\r\n hidden nodes less than 10 for \nseveral hundred generations. I think the al=\r\ngorithm optimizes too \nslowly, is there some method to change this? I am un=\r\nder MATLAB_NEAT, \nand unfamiliar with programming languages other than C an=\r\nd java.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Check your speciation parameters and the importance factor=\r\ns for \n&gt; speciation. Sometimes there are too many species, sometimes there =\r\n\nare \n&gt; too few. The dropoff age is important, too. The overall slow down \n=\r\nis \n&gt; because the networks grow in size and the simpler species reach \nthei=\r\nr \n&gt; dropoff age and get killed of by NEAT. This is the explanation why \n&gt; =\r\nthe fitness drops, too. You can have an absolute elitism where the \n&gt; best =\r\nspecies never get killed, no matter how old it is. It seems \nthat \n&gt; a fitn=\r\ness plateau is being reached and NEAT finds it difficult to \n&gt; optimize in =\r\na high-dimentional space, the smaller species already \n&gt; being dead and the=\r\n more complex are left.\n&gt; A possible thing to try is to implement a pruning=\r\n mechanism. The \n&gt; phased pruning techniqe by Colin Green (found in SharpNE=\r\nAT) is the \n&gt; one I recommend. This will improve the speed as well as the q=\r\nuality \n&gt; of the overall search. With phased pruning, the lower dimentional=\r\n \n&gt; space is searched better. This helps finding the best starting \npoint \n=\r\n&gt; for future generations. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n\n\n\n\n"}}
