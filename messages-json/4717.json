Indeed, I am using a highly =\r\ndistributed form of TWEANN based on NEAT run on hybrid, heterogeneous compu=\r\nter clusters.  I&#39;ve been playing around with various parallelization scheme=\r\ns, different data reduction schemes based on a wide variety of experiments =\r\nand data. In order to do this both efficiently and effectively, and retain =\r\nthe mathematical graph structures, I went back to first principles and re-e=\r\nngineered the elemental hierarchy as shown in the Package Dependencies jpeg=\r\n attached. The MathLib has certain imports into the Graphs namespace (throu=\r\ngh a GraphLib which is not shown to retain clarity).\n\nObviously, there is a=\r\n lot of detail missing, but the major insight I noticed was how information=\r\n in genomes and neural networks gets encoded in the graph structure. Unlike=\r\n a matrix, one cannot just look at a network structure and recognize the in=\r\nformation, but very much like a CPPN, one can perturb the very compact stru=\r\ncture through the interfaces (inputs) and get consistent patterned represen=\r\ntations out.  This is a very efficient encoding mechanism, indeed.\n\nNotice =\r\ntoo that I have separated the concern of Entities, such as Individuals, Pop=\r\nulations and Species from their genomes.  This is somewhat similar to separ=\r\nating the location vertices (I&#39;m using n-dim hyperpoints) from the nodes in=\r\n graphs.  Nodes can, and are, inherited to be neural network neurons, and c=\r\nombined with genetic information, to become genetically inspired artificial=\r\n neural networks.  Yet, the topological aspects are described at a very pri=\r\nmitive level (the mathematical graph structure). I am experimenting with co=\r\n-evolutions of higher level constructs GA&#39;s and TWEANNs and comparing them =\r\nwith low level mathematical graph constructs (representations).\n\nFinally, I=\r\n have turned my HyperNEAT inspired TWEANN loose on the problem space of con=\r\nfiguring the hybrid, heterogeneous compute clusters in solving the dynamics=\r\n of partitioning the data and tasks given various contexts (schedules of ex=\r\nperiments, priorities, the existing configuration capabilities of the clust=\r\ner hardware) to see if it can evolve better &quot;compute fabrics&quot; than I can ha=\r\nrd-code using the parallel_for loops on the CPUs (used in distributing code=\r\n modules) and various CUDA structures on the GPUs.  That answers so far hav=\r\ne been humbling.\n\nKen Lloyd\n\n\nFrom: Colin Green \nSent: Thursday, June 25, 2=\r\n009 4:09 PM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com \nSubject: Re: [neat] Re: about the inn=\r\novation number\n\n\n\n\n\nHi,\n\n2009/6/25 Ken Lloyd &lt;kalloyd@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt; Did=\r\n anyone else find it problematic that the NeuronGeneId was generated\n&gt; just=\r\n like the InnovationId for the ConnectionGene?\n\nNot especially but I did de=\r\ncide to use two separate incrementing\ncounters, one for neurons and one for=\r\n connections. The two types of\ngene have their own &#39;ID&#39; space. I think my m=\r\nain motivation was to\nprevent the ID space from being exhausted - y&#39;know if=\r\n some day this\nbecomes distributed neat and/or running on much faster hardw=\r\nare and/or\nfor long timescales. I like to over engineer shall we say.\n\n&gt; In=\r\n my implementation, I\n&gt; decided to use a GUID for gene identification, and =\r\nonly use the innovation\n&gt; number for sequencing (aging) the connection gene=\r\ns - substantially reducing\n&gt; the range of the innovation numbers.\n\nWell, a =\r\nGUID is 4 bytes which is a bit of overkill (a bit rich given\nmy previous se=\r\nntence :), also if you use standard approaches of\ngenerating GUID&#39;s they wi=\r\nll have some problems.\n\n1) Performance. GUIDs are typically a hash of hardw=\r\nare IDs (network\ncard MAC and other things), current time, and any other so=\r\nurce of\nrandomness such as a background service that measures the interval\n=\r\nbetween key presses. These all sap performance and can also result in\nclust=\r\ners of very close GUIDs if you ask for a few (or many) in a short\ntime peri=\r\nod (e.g. within a 50/th of a second).\n\n2) The uses of hardware IDs also mea=\r\nns you probably are generating IDs\nwithin a narrow sub-set of all possibke =\r\nIDs - that is you get the\noverhead of dealing with 4 bytes without the bene=\r\nfits of more IDs.\nThis also means that GUID clashes might occur - an increm=\r\nenting value\ngives you efficient utilization of the availablke ID space.\n\nO=\r\nK on the other hand a GUID might be a good solution in a distributed\nsettin=\r\ng - you can generate a GUID with practical zero chance of\nclashing with GUI=\r\nDs generated on other machines. However you still\nneed a central register o=\r\nf all IDs from all machines in order re-use\nIDs correctly when adding new n=\r\nodes and connections.\n\n&gt; The search space for identifying identical preexis=\r\nting connections is always\n&gt; problematic (due to the time penalty it impose=\r\ns), even if done efficiently.\n&gt; How about a small static structure similar =\r\nto a step function CPPN (ok, just\n&gt; an array, diagonalized of course) to ta=\r\nke the endpoints of connections as\n&gt; inputs and generate a value (1 or (tru=\r\ne) =3D prior exists, 0 =3D it doesn&#39;t).\n&gt; Here, using the endpoint GUIDs ke=\r\neps the array small enough, only encoding\n&gt; surviving searchable neurons.\n\n=\r\nI /think/ you&#39;re effectively describing a hashmap that uses the\nconnection =\r\nendpoints as a key and stores the connection ID as the\nmapped value. This i=\r\ns what sharpneat does, however I think the hashmap\nis discarded after each =\r\ngeneration (so we ensure ID use only within a\ngeneration). Sharpneat 2 take=\r\ns a more pragmatic approach of keeping a\npermanent history of innovation ID=\r\ns keyed by endpoints as before, but\nthe history length is limited (it&#39;s a h=\r\nybrid of a circular buffer and\na hashmap) so as to prevent it expanding ind=\r\nefinitely and consuming\nall memory and increasing lookup time.\n\nBTW Coding =\r\non V2 will resume shortly - I&#39;ve been busy with moving and\nstuff the last f=\r\new months. I&#39;ve also been catching up on HyperNeat and\nnovelty search paper=\r\ns, so hopefully this help me design the code to\nassist in these research di=\r\nrections.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n\n\n\nNo virus found in this incoming message.\nCh=\r\necked by AVG - www.avg.com \nVersion: 8.5.339 / Virus Database: 270.12.91/22=\r\n01 - Release Date: 06/25/09 06:22:00\n\r\n------=_NextPart_001_00B0_01C9F5BA.0E4561C0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3Dtext/html;charset=3Diso-8859-1 http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.7100.18&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY \nstyle=\r\n=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff; PADDING-LEFT: 10px; PADDING-RIGHT: 10px; PAD=\r\nDING-TOP: 15px&quot; \nid=3DMailContainerBody leftMargin=3D0 topMargin=3D0 Canvas=\r\nTabStop=3D&quot;true&quot; \nname=3D&quot;Compose message area&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCalibri&gt;=\r\nColin,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCalibri&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DCalibri&gt;Actually, there is more to the story.&nbsp; Indeed, I am \n=\r\nusing a highly distributed form of TWEANN based on NEAT run on hybrid, \nhet=\r\nerogeneous computer clusters.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been playing around with various \n=\r\nparallelization schemes, different data reduction schemes based on a wide \n=\r\nvariety of experiments and data.
