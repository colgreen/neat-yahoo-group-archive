Also, I was wondering (since you&#39;re at MIT) if you were working \nwith Dr. O&#39;Reilly?\n\n&gt;My question, then, is this: how do you set the parameters that govern\n&gt;the NEAT system?  I&#39;ve played with mutation rates (especially\n&gt;structural), speciation settings (including dynamic thresholding), and\n&gt;the other odds and ends (popsize, minimum size for elitism, fraction\n&gt;of parents to reproduce, weight caps), but I&#39;m not always sure what\n&gt;I&#39;m looking for when I make changes.  What, aside from a solution, are\n&gt;the variables to look for when evaluating the quality of a run?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nUnfortunately the only advice I have is to tweak the parameters as \nsystematically as possible and record all the results :) As Derek \npointed out there is the possibility of tweaking the parameters during \nthe course of evolution (similar to what is done in evolution \nstrategies), and every now and then someone proposes to build a \nmeta-genetic algorithm, but to answer your question, no I don&#39;t think \nthere is really anything worthwhile outside of being as systematic as \npossible with ad-hoc tweaking. I would contend though that tweaking is \nmuch less important than building a good algorithm. As long as your \nparameters are sane (large enough population, low enough mutation rate, \ngood dynamic thresholding, etc), evolution generally can sort out the \nrest for itself. Basically, in tweaking an evolutionary system, unlike \nin tweaking an engineered system, the changes often just get lost in the \nnoise of the algorithm.\n\nTo answer your second question, we generally look at algorithm \nefficiency and solution quality. The efficiency can be measured as just \nhow many generations it takes to get to a certain benchmark fitness. \nSome other things you might want to look at is the variance of the \ngenotypes (to check how converged the population has become), the \n&quot;shape&quot; of the fitness curve (e.g. if there are any spikes which may \nindicate topological breakthrough, or just stagnation, etc), and how the \nspecies&#39; are divided (i.e. do one or more species dominate the \npopulation). These are all off the top of my head, but each one gives \nanother clue as to what actually occured during evolution, and I think \nat least during the testing phase of your algorithm, its more important \nto look at these than just the final solution quality.\n\nGood luck on your project.\n\nJoe\n\n"}}
