But, I&#39;ve been\nworking on my own C++ implementation of NEAT for a couple years.  The\nproblem is that I simply don&#39;t have time anymore.  However, it&#39;s killing\nme that all the work I did do is simply sitting on my drive.  Hopefully\nsomeday I&#39;ll be able to finish it all up but in the mean time I thought\nI&#39;d send it out in case someone wants to adopt it.  It&#39;s actually pretty\nfar along and, in fact, at one point was pretty much fully functional.  Of\ncourse, not being satisfied, I started rewriting some of the classes and\nnow it&#39;s in a somewhat broken form.  That being said, the core classes\n(node, network, genome, etc) I believe to be quite solid and quite fast. \nOne cool thing the network class does is print out networks in a form\n&quot;viewable&quot; by the graphviz dot program.  At some point I do plan on\nwriting a front end that allows for &quot;on-the-fly&quot; viewing of the networks. \nI&#39;m just trying to figure a good architecture that won&#39;t slow down the\nsimulation too badly.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m going to attempt to upload all the source to the yahoo group\nunder NEAT C++.  If anyone does take a crack at it please drop me a line. \nAlternatively, if anyone looks at it and says, man, that&#39;s a bunch of\ncrap, we&#39;ve already got stuff way better than this...I&#39;d like to hear that\nas well.  Just don&#39;t try to convince me that C# is just as good, just as\nfast, etc :)\n\nThanks, best!\n\n- jeff\n\n\n"}}
