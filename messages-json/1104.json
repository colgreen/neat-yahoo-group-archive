It really is \n&gt;appreciated.  And helpful!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCertainly has. My initial test was somewhat lacking so I decided to bite \nthe bullet and have written a new optimized neural net class to test \nsome of the theories/ideas posted on the list. Result? Currently I&#39;m \nlooking at about a 12x speedup on very large networks and about 3x on \nsmaller, more realsitic networks. I may have to sacrifice a little bit \nof this to get dynamic activation fucntions back, but yeh, nice result \nhuh :)\n\nMore details soon.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
