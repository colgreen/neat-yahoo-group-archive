It\n&gt; would be really interesting to see movies of the the eye examining a\n&gt; fingerprint.\n\nWell, there you go.  I&#39;ve uploaded another Flash movie,\n&quot;left_loop2.swf&quot; into the files section of the group:\n\nhttp://f6.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/4AeaQcXY5lgs-UB2o8GRVhmNYECb-SIVrixEfUUQ7ZnnUfHOWucQ1WZHRBRPJTxW6aEQJLDF0w2xu1KtIUF1Ig/left_loop2.swf\n\nThis particular network is evolved to recognize the left loop class of\nfingerprints.  Here are some samples of the different classes:\n\nhttp://www.nist.gov/srd/fing_img.htm\n\nFor now we&#39;re just focusing on the four-class problem, lumping\ntogether arch and tented arch (which together only make up about 5-6%\nof fingerprints in the natural population anyway).\n\nSo if you watch the movie, you&#39;ll see that the eye always seems to\nzoom in on the core of the print, then oscillate in that core area. \nFor left loops, though, it zooms into the core, then always drifts\naway to the left.  It&#39;s interesting to note that it pretty easily\ndistinguishes between right loops and arches, while the class that\nseems difficult to distinguish between the most is whorl.\n\nI didn&#39;t include the affinity representation in the uploaded movie,\nbut with whorls, the eye begins to drift the left, spitting out high\naffinities, but then apparently notices that the ridge lines don&#39;t\ncontinue to slant the same way they do in a left loop pattern, so the\neye returns to the core of the whorl and oscillates.\n\nNow, I actually thought that loops would be more likely to be confused\nwith arches, but apparently the eye doesn&#39;t have much problem making\nthat distinction.\n\nOne of the things I&#39;m really pleased about is that the neural network\ndoesn&#39;t seem to have a problem handling images where the contrast\nlevels are quite different.  We did a few brief experiments with\nfingerprint images that we had done some preprocessing on, to try to\nfilter out some of the noise and heighten the contrast of the ridge\nlines to the background, but that doesn&#39;t seem to really affect the\nevolving fitness much.  So it&#39;s nice that the system seems to be able\nto handle raw images.  Most other systems do a lot of\ncomputationally-expensive pre-processing of the images.  In fact, one\nof the most successful research projects we read about take up to 10\nseconds per print for classification.  I don&#39;t know what kind of\naccuracy rate we&#39;ll end up with, but we&#39;ll definitely be able to beat\nthat by a long way.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
