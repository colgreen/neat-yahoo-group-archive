A popular quick\n&gt; start guide:\n&gt; http://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/22/QuickstartGuidetoSubversiononSourceForge.aspx\n&gt; for SVN on sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/docs/E09).\n\n\nThanks, I have today managed to get the SharpNEAT sourcecode into a\nsourceforge SVN repository at https://sharpneat.svn.sourceforge.net/\n\nI did however get into a bit of a mess initially because I assumed the\ncode would go straight into a trunk dir - which it didn&#39;t - so I had\nto then create one and move the code a couple of times. So now there\nis a load of history associated with the freshly uploaded files. Apart\nfrom that I think everything is right and I think I&#39;m understanding\nthe basic philosophy behind SVN.\n\n\n&gt; http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/ &quot;AnkhSVN: A Subversion addin for Microsoft\n&gt; Visual Studio .NET&quot;. I use it extensively, works beautifully (much\n&gt; better than the inbuilt Visual Source Safe) although its still handy\n&gt; to have tortoisesvn installed as well for the off rare chore.\n\nThanks I just installed it. The only niggle I&#39;ve got is that the diff\ncommand seems to do an actual diff as in creating a patch file -\nrather than the nice side by side comparison view in Eclipse - I know\nI know, I keep going on about Eclipse :)\n\n\n\n\n&gt; There is a .NET plugin for Eclipse floating around but have never used\n&gt; it myself.\n\nYeh I came across a few links to a plugin from Progressive I think it\nwas. The plugin is dated 2004 and only provides basic C# support such\nas syntax colouring/completion - there&#39;s no debugger support.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
