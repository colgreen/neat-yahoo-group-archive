The\n&gt; add_connection mutation rate is the probability that an *individual\n&gt; genome* might have a single connection added.  In other words, in a\n&gt; population of 100 individuals and a 0.02 rate, you would expect to\n&gt; get on average 2 new connections over the entire population in a\n&gt; single generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, it is also true that only one add connection mutation\n&gt; can happen to a single individual in a generation.\n\nWow.  Okay.\n\nWe made the assumption that NEAT worked similiarly to biological\nmutations.  Because what you are describing is definitely *not* the\nway biological mutations work, or what &quot;mutation rates&quot; mean.  In\nbiology, the mutation rate refers to the frequency of mutations per\n*gene* per unit of time.  And though I&#39;m not extremely familiar with\ngenetic programming, my understanding was that mutation rates referred\nto the probability of a given binary bit position being flipped.\n\nIt does not seem intuitive to assume that mutation rates are referring\nto individuals, rather than genes or smaller units.\n\n&gt; It seems to me that your interpetation was that the mutation rate is\n&gt; on a &quot;per empty slot&quot; basis.  That&#39;s radically different than my\n&gt; NEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at all...is\n&gt; that how ANJI has been working?\n\nYeah.  And it works.\n\nIt seems straightforward to say that there are 10,000 potential\nlocations for a structural mutation, so a given rate (e.g., 0.01)\ndescribes the probability for a mutation occurring at that location. \nBasically, you&#39;re describing the rate at which a given individual can\nbe mutated, with exclusion (so a given chromosome cannot have more\nthan one type of mutation...can a single chromosome have both an add\nconnection and add node mutation in the same generation?).\n\nIt also seems confusing that the rates for mutating connection weights\nwork one way (occurring with a given probability based on the number\nof locations), while the structural mutation rates define something\nelse entirely.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
