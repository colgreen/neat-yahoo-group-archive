At least at the beginning of the evolution,\nwhere there is few graph isomorphisms.\n  Sadly, checking if two graphs are isomorphs is both\nan expensive and difficult task if you don&#39;t pick a\nparticular familly of graphs, like planar graphs. You\ncan check if two graphs are isomorph by using a simple\nbacktracking algorithm, but it&#39;s slow if you need\ncomplex graphs...\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; a ï¿½crit :\n\n&gt; We may address it in future experiments in order to\n&gt; speed them up, \n&gt; but I probably would not make it the focus of a\n&gt; publication because \n&gt; its solution is likely fairly straightforward, i.e.\n&gt; not that deep in \n&gt; a research sense. Also, the problem of revisiting\n&gt; the same points is \n&gt; known in stochastic algorithms already.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most obvious way to address the problem is\n&gt; simply to compare \n&gt; new genomes with what&#39;s come before.  Of course,\n&gt; such comparisons \n&gt; become increasingly expensive as the generations\n&gt; increase, and at \n&gt; some point, it becomes cheaper simply to evaluate\n&gt; everyone rather \n&gt; than try to figure out who is a repeat.  Depending\n&gt; on available \n&gt; resources, you can program it to look for duplicates\n&gt; as long as it&#39;s \n&gt; computationally advantageous.  It may turn out not\n&gt; very useful for \n&gt; most of the run.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a potential for more sophisticated\n&gt; appraches, e.g. maybe \n&gt; some kind of hashing scheme, but they would need to\n&gt; promise \n&gt; sufficiently impressive results to justify their\n&gt; effort.  I am not \n&gt; sure how much effort is justified by a 10%\n&gt; improvement.  I am \n&gt; guessing work has been done on this problem before\n&gt; outside of NEAT, \n&gt; but I don&#39;t know about it offhand.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rafael C.P.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;kurama.youko.br@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any plan for addressing this issue in a future\n&gt; paper and/or \n&gt; implementation?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Nov 26, 2007 12:23 PM, Kenneth Stanley\n&gt; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy, thanks for pointing this issue out. Those\n&gt; are interesting\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  statistics. It is indeed best to avoid\n&gt; reevaluating an organism \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  is the same as one that has come before. 10% is\n&gt; not terrible \n&gt; but it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  does mean evolution could have been even\n&gt; faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot;\n&gt; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Investigation of redundant organisms in NEAT\n&gt; using standard \n&gt; param\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; values has shown an approximate 10 percent\n&gt; redundancy factor \n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  follows:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Population Size: 100\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Number Outputs: 10 (i.e. 10-dimensional\n&gt; coordinate space)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Distance Tolerance: 1.0E-6 (in non-normalized\n&gt; coordinates)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Duplicates in Generation 1 were ignored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;A&quot; = Generation Number\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;B&quot; = Cum # of Redundant Organisms (i.e. less\n&gt; than tol \n&gt; distance\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  apart)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;C&quot; = Total Number of Organisms Evaluated\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 1,0,100\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 2,8,200\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 3,17,300\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 4,30,400\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 5,44,500\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 6,56,600\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 7,65,700\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 8,76,800\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 9,94,900\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 10,115,1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; In instances in which the fitness\n&gt; computational requirements \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  non-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; trivial, screening and fitness substitution\n&gt; for redundant \n&gt; organisms\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; justified.
