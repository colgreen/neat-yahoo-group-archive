Of course, you have clearly been thinking about=\r\n that, and it may be possible to make progress following your line of reaso=\r\nning.  Maybe if parasites could be categorized into classes and novelty was=\r\n a concatenation of behaviors across all known classes it could make more s=\r\nense of the behavior space than just a raw behavior characterization.  I&#39;m =\r\nsure there are many other ways to think about it too.\n\nOne other thing to n=\r\note is that it may not really be &quot;competitive&quot; coevolution per se if you im=\r\nplemented such an experiment.  If novelty is the driving force, it&#39;s not cl=\r\nearly competitive or cooperative, which of course is perfectly fine in any =\r\ncase.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Joel,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the feedback. I was just thinking ho=\r\nw difficult the problem would\n&gt; be with the parasite agents doing things di=\r\nfferently each time. Thus the\n&gt; novelty metric would have to encompass the =\r\nnovel behavior relative to what\n&gt; the parasite did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another random tho=\r\nught is that if you could automate recognition of the\n&gt; differing behaviors=\r\n/techniques of the parasite, and develop a completely\n&gt; different novelty s=\r\nearch for just that one type parasitic behavior. Thus you\n&gt; end up with a l=\r\narge modular NN, with each module being a novelty search\n&gt; generated NN dev=\r\neloped to handle that particular type of technique/behavior\n&gt; of the parasi=\r\nte. A higher level NN would handle recognition of the\n&gt; parasite&#39;s behavior=\r\n, and select the appropriate NN module to use against the\n&gt; parasite in tha=\r\nt instance. I think I spotted some papers floating about on\n&gt; automatic dec=\r\nomposition of problems, maybe that can feed into such random\n&gt; thinking.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Not a well formed thought as of yet, but it&#39;s always good to type out br=\r\nain\n&gt; farts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Drew\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, May 27, 2011 at 2:28 PM, joel278 &lt;l=\r\nehman.154@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Drew,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As far as I know, com=\r\npetitive coevolution and novelty search have not yet\n&gt; &gt; been combined in a=\r\nny publications.

I think it is particularly promisin=\r\ng if done right because\n&gt; &gt; competitive coevolution is a potential a path t=\r\no open-ended evolution (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; the red queen hypothesis). However, in pra=\r\nctice coevolution is subject to\n&gt; &gt; coevolutionary forms of &quot;deceptive loca=\r\nl optima&quot; (e.g. mediocre stable\n&gt; &gt; states, disengagement ,etc.) which nove=\r\nlty search has proved effective with\n&gt; &gt; dealing with in other non coevolut=\r\nionary domains.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Joel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ze_d=\r\nakster&quot; &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about merging no=\r\nvelty search with competitive coevolution,\n&gt; &gt; and haven&#39;t been able to fin=\r\nd any papers describing such an undertaking yet.\n&gt; &gt; Anyone aware of any pa=\r\npers covering that topic?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Much thanks in advance for any tips.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
