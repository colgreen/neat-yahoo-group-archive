Therefore, it makes sense to start with the \nsimples=\r\nt possible concept and work towards more experimental \ncomplexity slowly.  =\r\nOtherwise, there are too many simultaneous open \nissues.\n\nOne other note: Y=\r\nou probably should give the CPPN a way to express \nbiases for the nodes in =\r\nthe substrate.  Jason has done work on this \nissue, and there are a number =\r\nof ways to do it.  But without bias, \nthe substate ANN is a little bit disa=\r\nbled.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_cherv=\r\nenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, a 2D space was the first realization. But things=\r\n got \ncomplicated \n&gt; mainly because there is no way to make a matrix-like i=\r\nnput layer, \nand \n&gt; to place the hidden and output nodes in positions that =\r\nare \nmeaningful. \n&gt; An intuitive idea is to put the output at the center an=\r\nd the inputs \nand \n&gt; hidden neurons around it, but then it becomes not a vi=\r\nsual field, \nyou \n&gt; know, a grid of inputs. The solution was to add an extr=\r\na dimention \nand \n&gt; to put the hidden and output nodes behind the input lay=\r\ner, not on \nit. \n&gt; I think this is good, even in reality there are only 3D =\r\nneural \n&gt; networks, 2D is just a simplification. \n&gt; Someone had mentioned t=\r\nhat a roving eye is a controller and a \n&gt; classifier at the same time. I gu=\r\ness it is hard for HyperNEAT to \nfigure \n&gt; out how to control the eye at fi=\r\nrst. This is very important. \n&gt; Currently I am trying out Jason&#39;s suggestio=\r\nn about it (normalizing \nthe \n&gt; inputs to avoid the multiplication problem.=\r\n), but it still doesn&#39;t \n&gt; learn to find the shape on the field. \n&gt; Perhaps=\r\n I should not use a roving eye at all? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On May 1, 2007, at 4:51 AM,=\r\n petar_chervenski wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate space is 3D cartesi=\r\nan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you tried it on a 2D space?
