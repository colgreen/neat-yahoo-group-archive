I tried the library i=\r\nncluded in HyperNEAT, but that wont compile because the tinystrdll.cpp file=\r\n requires a tinystr.h file that is not in the HyperNEAT archive. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jgmath2000&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNEAT supports being built as a DLL but it isn&#39;t necessary, in fact the exis=\r\nting build system builds NEAT as a static library.  Are you using the cmake=\r\n scripts to build HyperNEAT? The manual has instructions on how to use cmak=\r\ne scripts to build HyperNEAT and these scripts build NEAT and Tinyxmlplus t=\r\no static libraries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that I&#39;m using tinyxmlplus, which is =\r\na different library from tinyxml and adds support for creating .xml.gz file=\r\ns (compressed xml files), as well as a host of other changes.  I do not thi=\r\nnk that using the regular tinyxml library will work with HyperNEAT.  The ti=\r\nnyxmlplus library is included in the HyperNEAT download.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason=\r\n G.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;erikcss&quot; &lt;erikcss@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am making some progress here on my p=\r\nroject.
