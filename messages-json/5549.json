The main intention behind developing\nthis environment, is to provide a test-bed for reinforcement learning,\nand learning in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent\nenvironments. The communication between the environment and the\nclients is done through a text-based network protocol; thus, one can\ncreate a client in any desired programming language as long as that\nlanguage supports networking. Currently there are several agents\ndeveloped in C# and sample agents in C++ and Java, which can be easily\nextended to fit one&#39;s experiments&#39; needs.\n\nThe developers believe, this environment is useful also for teaching\nand demonstrating related fields in the class, or defining proper\nassignments for the students.\n\nPlease read the user&#39;s manual to get more information about the environment:\nUser&#39;s Manual: http://gridsoccer.codeplex.com/releases/view/64543\n\nThe developers appreciate any kind of feedback ranging from bug report\nto feature suggestion. Please let us know if you plan to use this\nenvironment in your research or classroom.\n\nThanks,\nThe Grid-Soccer Simulator Developers\nSina Iravanian\nSahar Araghi\n\n"}}
