Perhaps we should\n&gt; specify an optimal \n&gt; number of species we would like (based on population\n&gt; size), calculate a \n&gt; &#39;compatibility&#39; number for each member of the\n&gt; population and then divide \n&gt; them up into that number of species. \n\nYes, Ken talks about dynamic thresholding in the NEAT\nUsers FAQ.  This seems like a reasonable approach, but\nleads to a couple of points.\n\nThe philosophy behind speciation then shifts from:\n\n--species are subgroups that vary topologically by a\nparticular amount\n\nto:\n\n--a species is not defined as much by topological\ndifference as by the number of species threshold\n\nThat is, in the second case, a given species could\nhave much more or much less topological difference\nbetween its individuals.  This approach seems less\ndesirable to me, since it seems less\nbiologically-inspired.  You&#39;re enforcing an arbitrary\ndivision of the population, rather than defining\nspecies primarily by a distance function.\n\nIf you do use dynamic thresholding and define a set\nnumber of species, this approach then leads to the\nquestion: What is a good number of species for a\npopulation?\n\nAnd should the number of species allowed then be\nproportional to the population size?  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
