I will link it \nfrom my =\r\nhomepage.  One question..you mentioned:\n\n&gt;  - Use of textures as an input m=\r\nap (enabled if there is an image \nfile\n&gt; named &quot;txt1.png&quot; on the &quot;c:&#92;jccpn&#92;=\r\ninput&quot; folder)\n\nHow is the texture map input into the CPPN?  I like what it=\r\n does but \nI&#39;m not sure what the specifics are.  How many inputs are sent i=\r\nntp \nthe CPPN from the texture map, how and when are they fed in, etc..?\n\nt=\r\nhanks,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;William Monti&quot; &lt;william.monti@..=\r\n.&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a student of Artificial Intelligence, and I=\r\n have been \nresearching\n&gt; about it for the last years, after some implement=\r\nations I am \nreleasing\n&gt; my last one based on the idea of Genetic Art Tool =\r\nby Mattias\n&gt; Fagerlund.\n&gt; \n&gt; The project website is http://sourceforge.net/=\r\nprojects/jcppn (there\n&gt; are some generated images on the screenshot section=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; Below are some of the main differences on my implementation:\n&gt;  - Us=\r\ne of HSL color scheme instead of RGB, what gives more natural \ncolors\n&gt;  - =\r\nUse of perlin noises as a type of a transfer function instead of\n&gt; applying=\r\n it to input coordinates (the transfer functions used are:\n&gt; sigmoid, gauss=\r\n, perlin, cosine, inverse and binary)\n&gt;  - Use of textures as an input map =\r\n(enabled if there is an image \nfile\n&gt; named &quot;txt1.png&quot; on the &quot;c:&#92;jccpn&#92;inp=\r\nut&quot; folder)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is just a preview version, I still need to work improvi=\r\nng the\n&gt; usability and add more features to it (I already made it produce 3=\r\nD\n&gt; model textures to apply on an avatar skin/clothing)\n&gt; \n&gt; To run it, use=\r\n the following command line:\n&gt; java -Xmx256M -jar jcppn.jar\n&gt; (It will work=\r\n if you double click on the jar file, but it will lack\n&gt; memory while savin=\r\ng images).\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a brief overview of the GUI:\n&gt;  - The numbers on ea=\r\nch image is the specie #\n&gt;  - Use the slider of each image to define its fi=\r\ntness, the checkbox\n&gt; will mark the organism for elitism, copying it to the=\r\n next \ngeneration\n&gt;  - Click on an image to open the god mode window\n&gt;  - T=\r\nhe Generate button will evolve the generation\n&gt;  - The load button will loa=\r\nd a previously saved .org file (there \nare\n&gt; some files attached to this e-=\r\nmail)\n&gt; God Mode:\n&gt;  - Click on the image to save it do disk (an organism f=\r\nile and a\n&gt; 1024x1024 png image, it will take some time to render it, pleas=\r\ne \nwait for\n&gt; the &quot;Images saved&quot; message box)\n&gt;  - The weights of the netwo=\r\nrk are shown on the middle pane, and the\n&gt; connections on the right one.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Known issues:\n&gt;  - There are some memory leaks while rendering the image=\r\ns, if you \nget\n&gt; problems of the image not being saved, close the program a=\r\nnd reopen\n&gt; it. (The organism file will be always saved, so you can restore=\r\n \nyour\n&gt; work on the new session).\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; William Monti\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
