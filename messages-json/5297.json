Alternatively you could divide up th=\r\ne existing\n&gt; connections between the two nodes - but that would likely brea=\r\nk the\n&gt; functionality of the existing structure. You could copy a subset if=\r\n\n&gt; the connections to the new node, but that likely just creates some\n&gt; bro=\r\nken functionaloty again; best copy the whole thing and micro-mutate\n&gt; from =\r\nthere.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m thinking the output connection weights could be either init=\r\nialised\n&gt; to zero, or drastically reduced (divide by some largish number). =\r\nOr we\n&gt; could skip copying the output connections altogether (maybe just on=\r\ne\n&gt; chosen randomly for starters) and allow micro-mutations to connect up\n&gt;=\r\n the new node&#39;s output side.\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s a good idea to make the output conn=\r\nections simply have much lower weight but keep the input connections the sa=\r\nme.  It would be similar in effect to a minor tweak of the original output =\r\nweights.  So it would likely not have any profound effect, and allow evolut=\r\nion to take it from there and potentially partition function further.  It s=\r\neems like a good idea for experimentation.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
