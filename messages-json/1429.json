Actually I think you answered this question yourself in your\n&gt; response to John -  crossover. \n\nWell, this still doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  How are you handling\ncrossover?  ANJI works as the original NEAT paper described--when two\nindividuals mate, the topology of the fitter individual is used, while\nweight values for common connections have a 50/50 chance of coming\nfrom either parent.\n\nEven if you&#39;re handling it another way, it still doesn&#39;t seem to make\nsense.  Our mutation rates for blended runs for Tic-Tac-Toe were :\n\nadd neuron: 0.005\nadd connection: 0.01\nremove connection: 0.02\n\nThey were roughly balanced, and as a consquence, the average\ncomplexity for most runs remained steady.\n\nYour subtractive mutation rates were triple your additive ones, so\naverage complexity should be decreasing each generation.  Does your\nmethod of crossover always take the topology of the more complex\nindividual or something?\n\n&gt; I truly beleive that this is down to species culling, and the phased\n&gt; search graph backs up the idea. SharpNEAT employs elitism at the species\n&gt; level, that is, each species&#39; keeps at least it&#39;s 1 best genome and in\n&gt; the experiments actually kept the best 20%,.\n\nI&#39;m sorry...I still don&#39;t understand the explanation.  But if you&#39;re\nusing Ken&#39;s basic NEAT implementation and population fitness is\nsteadily *decreasing* throughout the run, it certainly seems that\nsomething is wrong.\n\nKen?  Have you looked at the fitness graphs on Colin&#39;s page?  Does\nthis make sense to you?\n\n&gt; Have a look back in the archives, I think species culling was discussed\n&gt; some time ago when I poitned out that quite often a jump in fitness can\n&gt; be seen shortly after culling the fittest species. \n\nYeah, I remember the discussion and thought it made sense at the time\nas a way of enhancing the performance of a run.  I don&#39;t see how it\nshould be *degrading* the performance of traditional or blended NEAT.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
