After \nusing it, I can see that there is indeed a process of \ncomplexification that happens to the networks.  It&#39;s really \ninteresting to see how the increases in network complexity contibute \nto the richness of the image.\n\nOne thing that would be very interesting would be an interface, for \nexample sliders, where you yourself could adjust the weights of the \nchampion  and see the effects.  I think this would help people (me \nat least) understand what the different dimensions of variation of \nthese complex images are with respect to the network.  It would be \ncool for example to discover that increasing the value of a weight \nchanges the orientation or expands the size of some element.  It \nwould also be fun to play with.  Most importantly, it would give you \na sense of what kind of variation is possible, and what is not.\n\nAnother thing that might be useful is if you could actually paint a \ntarget image and then evolve for n generations towards that target \nwith normal NEAT evolution.  Then you could play with the art \nevolution starting off the champ of that pre-evolution.  That way, \nyou might get creative variations on images that you actually want.\n\nA full-window view of a single requested image would also look great.\n\nWhile the whole art/fun factor is very cool, I also feel that we can \nlearn a lot about how neural networks of increasing \ncomplexity &quot;think&quot; with a tool like this.  You start getting an \nintuition about the way changes in weights maniuplate various \ncomponents of their functionality, and how those components \ninteract.  So it&#39;s really valuable educationally.\n\nken\n\nPS check out the &quot;ear&quot; I evolved in the photos section \n   :) &lt;-- a proud evolutionary artist\n\n\n\n\n"}}
