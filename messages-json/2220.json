As a\npoint of interest, it is actually implemented as a table with linear\napprox.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it is fast and it also isn&#39;t.\n\nYou&#39;re right of course and have clearly done more work with nns than I\nhave.  However, I am inclinded to argue that for the current architectures\nsitting on most of our desktops, it is fast.  I realize this is why many\nattempts at making custom hardware have been carried out with some success\n(actually, I have no idea how much success).  I would imagine that given\nthe sort of flexibility you almost always want (have any of us ever\nfinished a network simulator and said, Eureka! It&#39;s perfect!?) that this\nsort of approach is up there for speed/flexibility trade off.  But I\nimagine it is this sort of thing that was the stuff of your philisophical\ndiscussion and when I get a chance I would like to read it.\n\nI am consoled to hear that the &quot;collection&quot; stage is the bottle neck.  I\ndon&#39;t know how much more time I could spend staring at the lines of code:\n\nif(enabled)\n  sink+=weight*pParent-&gt;source\n\nlooking for optimizations\n\nAlso - and I&#39;m getting ahead of myself here as I had hoped to get into\nsome of these discussions a little further into my work - I feel a lot of\nthe speed from this sort of architecture comes from the ability to do\ntopographical transformations in place without serializing the network\ninto a genome.  When I do serialize I see performance hits there.\n\nThanks for your thoughts,\n\njeff\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have it working now and thought I would post the quasi-pseudocode\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for how this works in my implementation:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For Each neuron\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     if not input neuron, init TotalInput=0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     Init Fired=False\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Next\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; For each TimeStep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;     For each Neuron\n&gt;&gt; &gt;         init fired switch to false\n&gt;&gt; &gt;         For each Link\n&gt;&gt; &gt;             IF link is active &&\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                links output neuron=currentNeuron &&\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                links input neurons totalValue &gt; 0 THEN\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                 IF link has fired=FALSE THEN\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                    IF links input neuron &gt; threshold THEN\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                       FIRE Neuron by adding its weight to the links\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                         output neuron\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                       Store the fired neurons ID\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                     END\n&gt;&gt; &gt;                 END\n&gt;&gt; &gt;              END\n&gt;&gt; &gt;          NEXT Link\n&gt;&gt; &gt;      NEXT Neuron\n&gt;&gt; &gt;      FOR EACH Link that fired, set its fired value to TRUE\n&gt;&gt; &gt; NEXT Timestep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
