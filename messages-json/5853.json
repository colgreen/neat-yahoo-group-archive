Coleman, Alan D. Blai=\r\nr\n\nAbstract:\nRecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in evolving pl=\r\nastic\nneural networks for online learning. These approaches have an\nintrins=\r\nic appeal =96 since, to date, the only working example of general\nintellige=\r\nnce is the human brain, which has developed through\nevolution, and exhibits=\r\n a great capacity to adapt to unfamiliar\nenvironments. In this paper we rev=\r\niew prior work in this area =96\nincluding problem domains and tasks, fitnes=\r\ns functions, synaptic\nplasticity models and neural network encoding schemes=\r\n. We conclude\nwith a discussion of current findings and promising future di=\r\nrections,\nincluding incorporation of functional properties observed in\nbiol=\r\nogical neural networks which appear to play a role in learning\nprocesses, a=\r\nnd addressing the =93general=94 in general intelligence by the\nintroduction=\r\n of previously unseen tasks during the evolution process.\n\nThe full paper i=\r\ns available at\nhttp://ojcoleman.com/sites/default/files/files/ojcoleman_ajc=\r\nai2012_evolving_plastic_neural_networks_for_online_learning_review_and_futu=\r\nre_directions.pdf\n\n"}}
