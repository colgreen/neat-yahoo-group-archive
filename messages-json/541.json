Your \n&gt; code queries the DOM for XML tags that it knows\n&gt; about. Any newer tags or \n&gt; tags you&#39;r not interested in are simply ignored.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Because unknown tags can be ignored this makes\n&gt; XML ideal for defining \n&gt; data interchange standards. XML from external\n&gt; sources (e.g. a different \n&gt; NEAT implememntation) can be checked against a\n&gt; definition file. \n&gt; Historically this was done with a Data Type\n&gt; Definition (DTD) file, the \n&gt; more recent approach is to use XML Schema Definition\n&gt; (XSD) files. XSD \n&gt; can allow for &#39;open-ended&#39; areas in the XML that\n&gt; allow for non-standard \n&gt; XML to be legal, e.g. tags that are specific to a\n&gt; particular NEAT \n&gt; implemenation that no-one else cares about.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Easy and standardised manipulation. The XML\n&gt; Stylesheet Language \n&gt; Transformation (XSLT)   is itself an XML dialect\n&gt; that has been adopted \n&gt; by the W3C. Transformations can be written to\n&gt; transform XML into a new \n&gt; format. A nice example as mentioned on this group\n&gt; would be converting \n&gt; NEAT network XML into SVG (Another XML dialect for\n&gt; defining graphics) \n&gt; that can then be rendered with an SVG viewer.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Readability of the data. OK I admit that this is\n&gt; subjective :)\n&gt; \n&gt; XML is everywhere these days. E.g the HTML\n&gt; &#39;language&#39; which historically \n&gt; was a bit of an untamed beast has been standardised\n&gt; as an XML dialect - \n&gt; XHTML. This gratefully simplifies web development\n&gt; since XHTML pages can \n&gt; now be manipulated and built with standard and\n&gt; already existing XML \n&gt; processors. The old windows INI files have mostly\n&gt; been replaced with \n&gt; XML, look at any config file in Windows for an\n&gt; example. My own day job \n&gt; revolves around building XML manipulation tools and\n&gt; defining XML \n&gt; dialects that are used to convey data between\n&gt; companies, \n&gt; insurance/mortgage applications, that sort of thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; XML isn&#39;t suited for everything but it&#39;s always\n&gt; worth considering and \n&gt; I&#39;d recommend you cast an eye over the wealth of\n&gt; info on the web before \n&gt; dismissing it :)\n\nThanks for the reply; cleary you put some effort into\nit.  I am still not able to see its value for\nscientific work.  It seems to me to be a part of\nbusiness and web programming, where perhaps it is\nuseful.  For scientific work I think it will mainly be\na source of delay and failed projects.  Don&#39;t forget\nthat learning about the various software systems you\nmentioned requires time.  \n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
