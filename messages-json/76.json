But it was not meant \nto be :).\n\n&gt;Can you elaborate more on your flocking experiments? It sounds \n&gt;interesting. How you rewarded flocking behaviour etc?\n\nWe used sigmoid functions to calculate fitnesses. In the flocking \nbehaviors, we tried to minimize the area of the minimum-enclosing-\nrectangle (MER) of the robots. Whereas, we also tried to maximize the \ndistance moved by the center of the MER.\n\nHave you done any similar experiments?\n\nRegards, \n- Umer\n\n\n\n"}}
