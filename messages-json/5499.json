The pruning potentially gets you back\nto a population of low complexity networks that have more diversity\nthan we normally start with. The motivation is that this might help in\nthe &quot;you can&#39;t get there from here&quot; problem of being stuck in some\nsub-space of the fitness landscape. Starting with no nodes or even no\nconnections puts the whole population in one part of the sub-space\nfrom which it might struggle to escape - this is especially true if\nyou factor neywork size into the fitness function which is an idea\nI&#39;ve bounced around before.\n\nFurther to this I&#39;m also thinking about network mutations that do more\nthan the current &#39;micro&#39; mutations we all tend to use (add/delete\nconnection or weight change). We sort of do something like this\nalready in that a weight change mutation can be for a single\nconnection or applied to all or some proportion of connections. In\naddition I propose that connection addition/deletion mutations that\nperform multiple mutations as one operation might have beneficial\neffects over and above the normal approach of aggregating positive\nmutations over time and through crossover. Again the motivation is in\nhelping NEAT to make slightly bolder jumps into new regions of the\nfitness space (but not too bold).\n\nOne can also invisage having a very large number of new connections as\npart of a single mutation, but that have very low connection weights\nsuch that they are almost functionally redundant (but not entirely).\nThe beneficial connections may &#39;grow&#39; in strength and the useless ones\nwould get eliminated during pruning.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
