It&#39;s just a question\nof whether you feel comfortable releasing it to the general public yet\nor if you want to hold off.  In general, NEAT packages linked from our\npages are downloaded several hundred times a year.  I&#39;m sure there are\npeople out there who would appreciate a C# version.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; SharpNEAT, a C# .Net implementation of NEAT now has a rudamentary\nweb \n&gt; site where you can download the current source code and .Net\nbinaries.  \n&gt; There is also a brief set of questions and answers that explain\nwhat \n&gt; it&#39;s all about and where it&#39;s going.
