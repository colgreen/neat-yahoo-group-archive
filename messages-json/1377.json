It means \nthat oddballs are more likely to pass on their genes, just because they are \ndifferent than the rest.  The 90% of the population, since they only \nrepresent 10% of the total range of fitness values, only get a 10% \nrepresentation in the selection process.  So whether or not any particular \nnetwork has the same chances of reproducing as another network really \ndepends on how close to the center of a cluster it might be.\n\n&gt;That does sound like it preserves diversity but it has almost no \n&gt;convergence.\n\nAs described, true.\n\nAssume that all networks chosen for breeding are passed on as elites, plus \none or two asexual reproductions each and the rest through crossover.  This \nwould definitely encourage diversity, which can either speed up or \nsignificantly slow down the search, depending on how you look at it.  But it \nwould virtually eliminate convergence.\n\nNow, if you first select the champion network for breeding before selecting \nany others, then it should converge just fine, while still preserving \ndiversity, and *maybe* increasing the search&#39;s ability to escape a local \noptima.\n\n&gt;Perhaps if you want diversity a roulette wheel method would be better.\n\nHow would that work, exactly?\n\n\n\n"}}
