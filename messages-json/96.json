Although we give weaker genomes a chance by \n&gt; protecting them in a species, overall, weak genomes and weak \nspecies \n&gt; will be culled from the population. So if I create a population of \n&gt; random genomes then they will all be in a species of one to begin \nwith - \n&gt; and the stronger genomes will progressively take over the \npopulation \n&gt; based on their relative fitness.\n&gt; \n\nFirst, I&#39;m not sure why every genome would be a in a species of size \n1?  Wouldn&#39;t some of them by chance be in the same species?  This of \ncourse depends on the compatibility threshold.\n\nMore importantly, although it is true that down the line the better \nrandom topologies will come to dominate, you still end up wasting \nsignificant time evaluating completely useless random topologies.\nBecause the population is speciated, you waste even more evaluations \nthan you normally would since these poor random topologies will \npersist longer than normal due to fitness sharing.  \n\nThe reason starting minimally takes care of this problem is that \nthen every topological innovation is tried and tested, leading to \ntopologies that have been justified through evaluations and \ntherefore *desereve* to be protected a species where they have a \nchance to elaborate.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a sensible fix, but NEAT for example was designed to \navoid\n&gt; &gt; the need for this kind of ad hoc fitness tinkering. If you start\n&gt; &gt; minimally and speciate, the system should tend towards minimality\n&gt; &gt; without the need for penalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I&#39;m missing something! How do you prevent NEAT \ngenomes/networks \n&gt; from growing out of control? After all a network may have \nthousands of \n&gt; neurons but only a couple of them may actually be performing the \ntask at \n&gt; hand. Perhaps this is just a consequence of NEAT&#39;s speed - it \ndoesn&#39;t \n&gt; (hasn&#39;t had to) evolve long enough to fall into this trap? How \nlong do \n&gt; NEAT evolution runs normally last? From what I know so far I can \nonly \n&gt; imagine that if we gave NEAT a problem that was too hard to solve \nand \n&gt; left it to evolve for any considerable time then the genomes would \njust \n&gt; keep getting longer - I&#39;m more than happy to be proved wrong \nthough :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nSpeciation has a more powerful effect than you are imagining.  \nSpeciation means that with a very hard problem NEAT will *both* keep \ngetting more complex *and* stay simple.  That&#39;s because the simpler \nspecies is protected, and therefore will never go extinct as long as \nit is competitive (and in a hard problem where NEAT can&#39;t make \nprogress, all the species will look about the same: bad).  On the \nother hand, other more complex species will also continue to \nappear.  That&#39;s what&#39;s so appealing about speciating based on \ntopolgoies- it means that NEAT doesn&#39;t put all its eggs in one \nbasket.  It maintains simple candidates and increasingly complex \nones at the same time.  Thus, it does not suffer from universal \nbloat.\n\nWe have run experiments to demonstrate this property empirically.  \nIn the experiments, we assigned completely random fitness to all the \ngenomes.  Now, you might expect complexity to just keep rising in \nsuch a situation, but in fact, because of speciation, a very simple \nspecies persisted throughout the runs, while at the same time \ncomplexity in other species continued to increase.  \n\nken  \n\n\n"}}
