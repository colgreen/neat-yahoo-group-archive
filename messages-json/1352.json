Ultimately,\n&gt;though, from what I read he is using a purely boolean approach to his \n&gt;activation mechanism (below\n&gt;&lt; 2 does not fire, &gt; 1 does fire).  Without smooth activation functions, \n&gt;it means the evolved\n&gt;network by its nature must then create smoothness where it is needed IN \n&gt;THE CONNECTIVITY.  That\n&gt;seems very inefficient.\n\nThis is true.\n\nThere is, however, an angle to these things when we think about \nefficiency.  When we think about the things we would like &quot;AI&quot; to achieve, \nwe inevitably do it by comparison to ourselves.  And we achieve \nintelligence, not only via unknown techniques, but also by bringing huge \nhardware resources to the problem.\n\nThus, when we consider a technique and call it &quot;inefficient&quot; we need to \nrecall that inefficiency is a relative thing, and that if computers were \n(say) 1000-fold more powerful, such inefficiency might become \nirrelevant.  In that context, some other advantage of the &quot;inefficient&quot; \nresult might be found to achieve a result that is otherwise unattainable.\n\nI&#39;m not saying this is the necessarily case here (in fact I&#39;m just being \nargumentative :) but it did occur to me while the bit-by-bit approach (as \nopposed to real-valued approaches) is less efficient in needing far-larger \nnumbers of neurones to handle real values, it might be more evolvable \nbecause if a &quot;behaviour&quot; is composed of a very large number of these 1bit \nneurones, it can be very smoothly mutated -- one 1bit neurone at a time.\n\nOTOH, he has no real-valued weights, which are another good source of \nsmoothness.\n\n&gt;It is an interesting experiment.  I would have to see it perform over the \n&gt;long term to be\n&gt;convinced the results were equavalent to using a smooth activation \n&gt;functions (i.e. sigmoidal).  I\n&gt;just don&#39;t think they are.  Human distinctions in reality of \n&gt;fuzzy.  Formal logic is just a small\n&gt;subset of human intelligence.  And very few humans use formal logic.  And \n&gt;a pretty large number of\n&gt;these produce &quot;valuable&quot; solutions to problems.\n\nI was most concerned that he doesn&#39;t seem to have updated it in 2 years, \nbut I was jsut hoping he was taking longer than expected :)\n\n&gt;Then the guy kind of lost me with his whole &quot;Terran/Artilect&quot; discussion \n&gt;at the end.  I was not\n&gt;prepared for that.  I then became all that much more suspicious he is just \n&gt;another &quot;over-the-top\n&gt;dreamer&quot;, scaling up a very simple view of logic as the basis for \n&gt;&quot;artificial intelligence&quot; - a\n&gt;way over-abused term.  :^)\n\nI skipped that section altogether.  I would have dismissed him, if he had \nnot built custom hardware for the project, which implies a degree more \n&quot;realism&quot; than your usual dreamer.\n\nIt was mainly his take on CA&lt;-&gt;ANN which I thought worth mentioning.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
