Me,\nand every PhD student I kno=\r\nw, got registered for a three-year PhD\nstraight away, after having complete=\r\nd a one-year MSc, possibly in some\nother university.\n\n(4) The postgraduate =\r\ntuition fee for an EU national, or EU resident,\nis about 3 000 pounds/year.=\r\n For non-EU people it is about 10 000, a\nhefty amount. But after having stu=\r\ndied in Scotland for four years, you\nmight be considered an EU resident. Th=\r\ne rules are tricky - an MA\nstudent I know, being a Canadian citizen, manage=\r\nd to get the lower fee\nafter showing that she was registered with the Spani=\r\nsh authorities as\nresident in Spain for the last few years, which she had i=\r\nn fact spent\nin Indonesia. But she sure knew how to argue those things. Ano=\r\nther\nfriend of mine got both tuition and living expenses funded by the\nUniv=\r\nersity of West of England, even though he&#39;s from Norway, which is\noddly eno=\r\nugh not part of the EU.\n\nI completely agree with what Ian says about superv=\r\nisors.\n\n(By the way, Ian, you mentioned a position paper about modularity s=\r\nome\ntime - is that available?)\n\nJulian\n\n"}}
