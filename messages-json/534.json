Here is a link to our new paper on evolving\na roving eye for Go:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04\n\nThis paper discusses an &quot;eye&quot; that is the same size no matter what\nsize\nthe Go board is.  The eye moves around at will and finally decides\nwhere to place a piece.  The nice thing about this representation is\nit can scale, while keeping its learned knowledge, from smaller to\nlarger boards.\n\nDarren Izzard, check out the Acknowledgments section.  I put you in\nthere since you contributed to getting me thinking along these lines\nwith your roving eye work (which is currently available in this group\nthrough the files section).\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
