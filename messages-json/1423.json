It is possible to get wider networks \nbecause of the phenomenon Chad described.  Note that in \naddition &quot;splitting&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily the only way a node could be \nadded either.  You could potentially just add a new chain (i.e. link-\nnode-link) to the network without disabling or removing anything \nthat&#39;s already there.\nI don&#39;t think any version of NEAT does that currently but \ntheoretically it can work as well.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hmmm, I thought the answer to this one was simple, but now that I \nthink\n&gt; about it.... \n&gt; John, you said that your implementation remembers the gene&#39;s \ninnovation\n&gt; number relating to which connection is severed. So that means that \nif\n&gt; the link that was disabled to add a node were to be reenabled, then\n&gt; split again, it would be interpreted as the other node that did \nthe same\n&gt; thing. So in that case, it would inhibit horizontal growth, an \nkarl put\n&gt; it. But in NEAT as I am understanding it from ken&#39;s paper, the link\n&gt; could be reenabled, then split again, which would disable it \nagain. So\n&gt; the pattern of reenabling and splitting could repeat indefinitely \nto\n&gt; create a wide topology with a large parallel hidden layer. \n&gt; Did I get it right? \n&gt; chad \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-----Original Message-----&gt; \n&gt; &gt;From: blackkm7\n&gt; &gt;Sent: 8/19/2004 11:00:00 AM\n&gt; &gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [neat] Re: genotype vs phenotype\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m still new to NEAT, but from my limited understanding, if you \n&gt; &gt;prevent certain kinds of (add node) innovations from repeating, \nthen \n&gt; &gt;there are certain types of net topologies that cannot evolve. \n&gt; &gt;Specifically, how might a hidden layer evolve that was larger \nthan \n&gt; &gt;the input/sensor layer? Horizontal growth as oposed to vertical?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now that I think of it, I&#39;ve only seen vertical growth in jNeat. \n&gt; &gt;Does NEAT prevent horizontal &quot;bulge&quot; in topologies?
