It w=\r\nill allow you create scripts and backtest with historical data to see how t=\r\nhey perform. If you write a DLL you can even call NEAT via Metatrader.\n\nI u=\r\nsed to work for a company trading futures and I can tell you all the easy d=\r\nata mining type trading strategies are tapped out. You&#39;ll have to find some=\r\nthing interesting to make it work.

But that is a pretty inconsequential detail as=\r\n you&#39;ll need much more than a sliding window to make money in my experience=\r\n.\n\nTell me how you do and I can give you my advice.

I&#39;m using the rtNeat C++ pac=\r\nkage under linux and am trying to evolve a time-series predictor applicable=\r\n to either the stock market or forex markets.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of the published re=\r\nsearch used Neural Networks trained via backprop.  These networks typically=\r\n used a sliding window technique. For example, if you have 1000 days of his=\r\ntorical data, a sliding window of 100 would feed the first 100 days of data=\r\n as input, and the 101st day would be the predicted output from the net. Th=\r\nen the window would slide by 1 day, and you feed the next 100 days and so o=\r\nn an so forth.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to use a similar technique with NEAT=\r\n with very limited success.  For inputs, I use change in price and normaliz=\r\ned volume.  The fitness function is basically the inverse of the mean squar=\r\ned error of the predicted outputs vs. the actual data.  The output is tryin=\r\ng to predict the change in price at the next time period (it could be posit=\r\nive or negative).  I&#39;ve also switched from the default sigmoid activation f=\r\nunction to a bi-polar sigmoid activation that allows for outputs in the ran=\r\nge of [-1,1].\n&gt; \n&gt; How are others using NEAT for time series prediction?  A=\r\nre you using a sliding window technique, or just have a large input with on=\r\ne output?  Has anyone had success using NEAT to evolve a time-series predic=\r\ntor?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
