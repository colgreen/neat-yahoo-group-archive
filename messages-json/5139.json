It does not kill of species\n&gt; after e.g. 50 generations;  rather, it kills the species off after 50\n&gt; generations of *stagnation*, which means lack of improvement in maximum\n&gt; fitness.  The idea is, if a species has not improved in a long time, then the\n&gt; investment that it represents in CPU resources may not be worth it, so it can\n&gt; be caused to die out by massively penalizing it.  Of course, using this\n&gt; technique is optional and up to the experimenter.\n\nHi Ken-\n\nA quick and minor question: out of curiosity, how does this technique behave\nif the population as a whole has stagnated for more than 50 generations\n(which is very common at the end of long runs).\n\n-jeff\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sorry, that last message was sent prematurely.  I&#39;m still pretty\n&gt;&gt; clumsy on the iPhone.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I found separate speciation code in the reproduction logic that\n&gt;&gt; appears to be correct.  My only concern, then, is the growth of the\n&gt;&gt; number of species mentioned in the original email.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m also curious about the &quot;dropoff age&quot; feature that kills off\n&gt;&gt; species that have been around for a certain number of generations\n&gt;&gt; (default is 50).

There is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot going on here, but I think I can state the problem simply\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without getting into the details of the JNeat code.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken&#39;s paper describes speciation as occuring every generation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Speciation entails iterating over the population, and performing\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some rudimentary clustering using a compatibility function and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; threshhold.  Pretty straightforward.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed, this algorithm is implemented in JNeat as the speciate()\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; method, but its only invoked at the beginning of evolution and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never again!  The growth and death of species afterwards is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; determined by some code in the epoch() method that does not appear\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to resemble NEAT speciation.  I&#39;m concerned that whatever JNeat is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing, it isn&#39;t what Ken had in mind, and it leads to some strange\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior.  Attached is a graph showing how the number of species\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grows during a run of the XOR experiment.  With a population size\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 500, it increases almost monotonically to 400 before leveling\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off after 40 generations.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shouldn&#39;t the speciate() method be called after ever generation/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; epoch?  Isn&#39;t this way too many species?  Approximately how many\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; species would you expect for the XOR experiment with 500 individuals?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Daniel\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
