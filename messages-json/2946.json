Or would the turn also have an input that says what\n&gt; ha=\r\nppened preflop and on the flop?\n&gt;\n\nThe latter, as I described in either my =\r\noriginal or second post on\nthis thread.  The point of having separate netwo=\r\nrks is to be able to\nhave a fixed number of inputs, which wouldn&#39;t be possi=\r\nble otherwise\ndue to variations in the betting rounds and the number of car=\r\nds on the\nboard.\n\nThink about it like this: you&#39;re on the flop and want to =\r\npass the\ninformation about preflop betting and the 3 community cards on the=\r\n\nboard.  If you have 1 network that is supposed to deal with the turn\nand r=\r\niver as well as the preflop/flop play, you will have to have some\nnodes for=\r\n the turn and river community cards (ignoring betting even).\n Since you are=\r\n not on those rounds, you can either put in some sort of\nnegative value (-1=\r\n probably) and hope the network learns that -1 means\nno card; or you can ha=\r\nve a 2nd node for each card node and have 0\nrepresent &quot;no card&quot; and 1 repre=\r\nsent &quot;is a card&quot;, and expect the\nnetwork to learn the association there.  H=\r\nowever, if you have a\nseparate network for the flop, you KNOW you need 3 fl=\r\nop card nodes and\ndon&#39;t have to worry about anything else.\n\nAn analogous ar=\r\ngument applies for betting information about each\nround.  You can use bet l=\r\nevel, aggressor, and position to fully\ndescribe a previous round of betting=\r\n (in a 2 person game, which is\nwhat we&#39;re trying to do in the AAAI competit=\r\nion).  This provides a\nfixed size of 3*round for betting information.  It&#39;s=\r\n pretty clever and\nelegant, I think. :)\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that is a really good=\r\n idea. Sounds like there are a few \n&gt; interested\n&gt; and talented people.\n&gt; \n=\r\n\nI am really excited about the idea of parallelizing NEAT as a first\nstep, =\r\nactually.  The downside here might be that we would be cutting\nit close for=\r\n the competition deadline.  However, I think we can work\non the two at the =\r\nsame time by using a serial implementation and then\nlater converting it ove=\r\nr (which should be seamless).\n\nThe first step for the poker code would prob=\r\nably be to get a\nsimulation engine that we can all agree is sufficient.  Mo=\r\nst of my\ncode is psuedo-windows proprietary.  It was written with the idea =\r\nof\nscraping a poker table&#39;s screen and composing a game state from that,\nan=\r\nd I didn&#39;t lay out the headers very well, so there&#39;s a couple of\nthings tha=\r\nt won&#39;t compile on linux.  However, I used only STL\ncontainers, so the logi=\r\nc should compile fine.  If you guys wanted to\nuse mine (at least as a quick=\r\n and dirty implementation), I&#39;ll see if I\ncan refactor the code this weeken=\r\nd and upload it somewhere.  I&#39;d\ncertainly be open to a different (likely be=\r\ntter) engine if there&#39;s one\nfreely available in C++.  Either way, please le=\r\nt me know.\n\n\nWesley\n\n\n"}}
