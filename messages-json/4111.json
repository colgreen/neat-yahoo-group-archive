It may be a misleading place to \nt=\r\nest out ideas, although this domain is easy to visualize and the \nresults a=\r\nre easier to interpret. For example consider 2 individuals \nseparated by a =\r\nwall, but their distance (the line through the wall) \nis so small that it i=\r\ns considered a dense area. But getting around \nthe wall requires another be=\r\nhavior than just hitting it from the \nother side. I guess that this issue b=\r\noils down to conflation, which \nwe discussed already. \n\nBy the way I made t=\r\nhat experiment that you mentioned about, with the \nbehavior characterizatio=\r\nn being almost complete (in fact I use the \nlast N points visited and sampl=\r\ned on regular intervals, i.e. not at \neach timestep) and performance was ac=\r\ntually the same. Maybe even \nbetter. In fact the performance was the same (=\r\nI mean number of \nevaluations to find a solution, not computation time) eve=\r\nn when I \ngive 1000 timesteps to individuals, so it is 2000D space (x and y=\r\n are \n2 dimentions not one). How did you compare distances in such a high \n=\r\ndimentional space? I used just the average distance between points \nand it =\r\nworked well. \n\nI think that novelty search then should be applicable to pro=\r\nblems of \nany dimentionality. For example consider my biped project. A beha=\r\nvior \ncan be characterized simply by the joint angles over timesteps. In \nf=\r\nact I am going to test NS combined with indirect encoding \n(HyperNEAT) on t=\r\nhis project soon. \nIt is good to note that I made an experiment where I cha=\r\nracterized \nthe behavior as the network&#39;s outputs over time. That experimen=\r\nt \nfailed, as I guessed. So the behavior should be characterized not on \nho=\r\nw the network performs, but on how the *object* controlled by the \nnetwork =\r\nperforms in its environment. So I think that it would be hard \nto apply nov=\r\nelty search on domains where the actual network&#39;s outputs \nare used directl=\r\ny as behavior, i.e. time series prediction for \nexample. Because there are =\r\nso many possibilities. But on the biped \nexperiment, there are many constra=\r\nints, like gravity, inertia, \ncollisions, etc. So it may be more effective =\r\nthere. \n\nOK well I agree about speciation, its main purpose is to protect n=\r\new \ninnovations, no matter how fitness is assigned, based either on \nnovelt=\r\ny or an objective function. I tried making the compatibility \ntreshold so h=\r\nigh that it means no speciation, and interestingly I \ndidn&#39;t see any differ=\r\nence in the behavior density distribution. Maybe \nthis kind of explains why=\r\n the solutions found by NS are so compact. \nIn fact in most solutions the m=\r\naze is solved by a network without \nhidden nodes. But all tests and experim=\r\nents I make is on the maze \ndomain, so the results may lie to me. I need to=\r\n test that on more \ndomains to see if there is any difference, in order to =\r\nhave any \nstrong conclusions. \n\nPeter \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenne=\r\nth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are these issues regarding speciation=\r\n in novelty search really any\n&gt; different from the very same issues in fitn=\r\ness-based search?  I am\n&gt; still thinking about this issue, but I am not sur=\r\ne they are really\n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n&gt; In NEAT-based novelty search, speciatio=\r\nn is still happening as \nnormal.\n&gt;  One thing speciation does in fitness-ba=\r\nsed search is protect unique\n&gt; individuals who may have lower fitness based=\r\n on the idea that they \nmay\n&gt; take a while to reach their potential.  By an=\r\nalogy, in novelty \nsearch,\n&gt; the effect is to protect genetically unique in=\r\ndividuals who may not \nbe\n&gt; very novel behaviorally on the chance that they=\r\n too may need some \ntime\n&gt; to discover how to do something novel.\n&gt; \n&gt; In o=\r\nther words, speciation means less greedy search.  In some cases,\n&gt; of cours=\r\ne, being less greedy means being slower (such as when there \nis\n&gt; a single =\r\nglobal optimum on a giant hill across the entire search\n&gt; space).  In parti=\r\ncular, if the most fit (or most novel) individuals\n&gt; for whatever reason tu=\r\nrn out to be the best jumping-off points for\n&gt; even more fit (or more novel=\r\n) individuals, then the time spent on\n&gt; protected individuals was &quot;wasted.&quot;=\r\n  Yet that would not be the case \nin\n&gt; all domains, so to forego such prote=\r\nction is to take a risk in \ngeneral.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could be that in the maze doma=\r\nin a greedier kind of novelty \nsearch\n&gt; would be faster.  But would that be=\r\n true in other domains?  An\n&gt; interesting question is the extent to which n=\r\novelty search is better\n&gt; served by greediness than fitness-based search.  =\r\nI am not sure if\n&gt; there is any basis to believe that it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea =\r\nof taking species age into account might be interesting, \nbut\n&gt; the questio=\r\nn is still why this consideration would matter more or \nless\n&gt; than in fitn=\r\ness-based NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, the way I see speciation interacting with nov=\r\nelty search is\n&gt; to protect small species that have unique genotypes even i=\r\nf those do\n&gt; not translate to novel behaviors in the hope that unique genot=\r\nypes \nmay\n&gt; have the potential to turn into unique behaviors if given the \n=\r\nchance. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is possible that I am misinterpreting the idea that you gu=\r\nys are\n&gt; developing, so please do clarify my comments if that is the case. =\r\n\n&gt; Novelty search does challenge a lot of common assumptions about \nsearch.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_cherv=\r\nenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I believe so.
