What is going to be invented next year?  How can\n&gt; &gt;we know whether someone will come up with an ingenious marketing idea\n&gt; &gt;at an otherwise lackluster company?  Other human initiatives like\n&gt; &gt;deciding to take on a rival or even war also are frequently almost\n&gt; &gt;impossible to predict until it&#39;s too late (at least too late to make\n&gt; &gt;an economic gain from the prediction).  Accurately predicting the\n&gt; &gt;ideas and initiatives that various individuals will come up is perhaps\n&gt; &gt;as difficult as the problem of AI itself, since it would require\n&gt; &gt;accurately simulating the thought processes leading up to the\n&gt; &gt;decisions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Of course, not to be too pessimistic, there are still some trends that\n&gt; &gt;can be followed with a level of success, but I just don&#39;t think\n&gt; &gt;there&#39;s ever going to be an extremely accurate prediction model.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; {Idea] Many stock price movements are unpredictable, but some of the\n&gt; movements may be predictable after effects of the unpredictable moves.\n&gt; Therefore the key in making money would be to be ability to determine\n&gt; when the predictable movements are occuring (or are about to occur) and\n&gt; to trade based on the prediction, and to ignore all other\n&gt; non-predictable movements. Therefore something akin to a confidence\n&gt; output would probably be a good thing, so instead of always trying to\n&gt; predict tomorrows price the network has the ability to admit that it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t &#39;understand&#39; the current conditions and therefore won&#39;t be\n&gt; making a prediction today.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin.\n\n\nThis is EXACTLY what I&#39;m trying to do. Events which happen out of the \nblue like Septembet the 11th happen very infrequently.\nWhat&#39;s more likely to happen is an event will develop over a period of \nweeks, and the thing driving the price will be the sum total\npsychology of all the traders.\n\nI plan to &#39;show&#39; the last N days worth of stock data to the network and \nget it to return a number from\n -1 to +1 based on sell through to buy. Most of the time I would expect \nthe network to return zero values, but once in a while where\nit thinks a stock has suddenly entered a predictable domain I would hope \nit would put it&#39;s hand up with a strong buy or sell signal. For\n1 stock this may happen once every few months, but by applying it to \nevery stock in the FTSE 350 and S&P 1000 every night, I\nwould hope to get a few good candidates a week which would definitely be \nenough to make a lot of money IF (and obviously it&#39;s a\nbig IF) the network has learned to &#39;fill it&#39;s boots&#39; only when it thinks \nthere&#39;s a very good opportunity available.\n\nChoosing the fitness function to try to drive this sort of behaviour is \nobviously critical - I have a few ideas, I guess I will just have to try\ndifferent things out and see what works well on historical time series. \nIf you were to take a stock graph for one of the majorly traded stocks\noff the yahoo site and label the bottom of the y-axis as 0 and the top \nas 1, you would not be able to work out which stock the graph\nbelonged to. They all have self similar fractal / chaotic features and I \nthink it&#39;s fair to lump them all into some sort of &#39;equivalence class&#39;. \nThis only\ngoes for frequently traded high liquidity stocks though. So I think \nrescaling the data so the y-axis goes from 0-&gt;1 is a fair thing to do. \nEspecially\nwhen you think that the actual y-axis on the graph on the web page is a \npixel index in a picture which is always 500 pixels high or whatever.\n\nI have no idea wether any of this will actually work. If it does, then \nI&#39;m in the money. If not, I will have learned a hell of a lot trying.\nI&#39;m currently impelementing my own C++ version of NEAT which is heavily \nbased on Ken&#39;s C++ code, but removing all the redundant stuff like\ntraits and recurrence which won&#39;t be needed for what I&#39;m trying to do.\n\nEmyr\n\n\n"}}
