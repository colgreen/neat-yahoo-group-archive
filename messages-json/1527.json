I started with just wanting to use genetic \nalgorithms to evolve the topology of neural networks rather than just \nthe weights (the only application I had seen previously).  From there, \nI&#39;ve gradually gotten more specific in what I&#39;ve wanted to address as I \nread more papers.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not suggesting you commandeer a plane but I&#39;m guessing that there \n&gt; is\n&gt; some pretty acurate flight sim code out there somewhere.\n\nOn that suggestion, I&#39;ve emailed an old friend at NASA to see if he can \npoint me towards any particular problems, topics, or other research on \nflight control systems.  With luck, he may have access to some decent \nsource code as well, or know someone who does.\n\n&gt; Out of curiosity whereabouts are you studying? Austin?\n\nI&#39;m studying at East Carolina University.  Unfortunately, while my \nprofessors are very supportive of my research in the area, it&#39;s not an \narea that they have much expertise in.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out \nwhere I want to go for a PhD.\n\n\t\tMark Ahlstrom\n\n\n"}}
