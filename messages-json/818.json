A burst of stimulation can set off these self-sustaining \nstates and a further burst can switch them back off. This is because a \nbiological neuron can only fire so often, presumably because it has to \n&#39;re-charge&#39; or refill its store of neuro-transmitter before it can fire \nagain. So if the number of interconnections is high then the neurons \nfire too often, they deplete their neurotransmitter and are unable to \nfire in response to incoming signals, this then leads to the \nself-sustainability coming to an end. If there are too few \ninterconnections then the self-sustainabilty never gets going. So there \nis some range of  interconnection proportion that can support the \nself-sustaining activity.\n\nI think recurrent connections have already been shown to provide memory \nin ANN&#39;s and in NEAT. Certainly the prey capture domain evolved very \nsimple recurrent connections back onto the source neuron that allow the \nagent to remember for a short while where the prey was last seen after \nit had moved outof sensor range.\n\nWhat this paper is doing is showing that large numbers of biological \nneurons can participate in large scale recurrency and therefore this \ncould theoretically be the basis for short term memory in biological brains.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
