If we take a problem that requires a network \nwith color inputs as an example, we might not find a good solution if \nthe problem is too complex, in this case one technique that can be \nemployed is to search for solutions to a simpler problem that is \nclosesly related to the problem we are trying to solve, say, recognising \nobjects in monochrome instead of in color . The resulting network can \nthen be used as a seed or starting point for the more complex (color) \nproblem search.\n\n&gt; I want to find a color network in a comparable amount of time to a \n&gt; monochrome network.\n\nBut a color signal by its very nature conveys more information than a \nmonochromatic one, therefore any network that has to process this \ninformation would need to be more complex and will therefore require (on \naverage) longer search times.\n\n&gt; Are there ways of using previously discovered topologies to speed up \n&gt; searches?\n\n\nSee above. As an example take a look at one of Ken&#39;s recent papers \n(co-authored) &quot;Evolving a Roving Eye for Go &quot;, where networks are \nevolved to play Go, firstly on a 5x5 board and then on a 7x7 board.\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=145\n\nAnother example would be: &quot;Incremental Evolution Of Complex General \nBehavior&quot;\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=35\n\n\n&gt; Something that comes to mind from colins advice is to have stratified \n&gt; features, and when one stratus of inputs reaches an acceptable \n&gt; fitness, freeze evolution on those elements, and force the new stratus \n&gt; of features to evolve around the previous features. This would keep \n&gt; the dimensionality the same, and assuming that each stratus was of \n&gt; comparable size, the search time would only increase linearly to the \n&gt; number of additional inputs.\n\nAh I see, interesting idea. So long as the new problem with an increased \nnumber of inputs is an extension from the original problem rather than a \nmodification then such a technique probably would be faster, since it \navoids searching the network structure and weights that already do a \nperfectly good job. On the other hand the existing structure may have \nspare functional capacity that can handle the new problem by adjusting \nweights and modifying connections, in which case searching the existing \nstructure may result in a smaller network overall.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
