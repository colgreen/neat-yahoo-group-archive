I&#39;d restart it and try to think \nof a new, easier evaluation to start with.  It would at least be a \ngood proof of concept for your system if you could get them to do \nsome easier, related task; then you&#39;d at least know the system works \nas you expect.  Then you can increment up to more interesting tasks.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Since I restarted the experiment the other day, it&#39;s managed to \nget through \n&gt; about 1500 generations.  It is currently averaging 26 generations \nan hour, \n&gt; which is not bad compared to what it was (less than 2).\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t gotten anywhere to speak of.  The fitness \nis \n&gt; remaining mostly flat, right down near the bottom where it has \nbeen since it \n&gt; started.  But then, I knew this was a hard domain...  Which is why \nI wanted \n&gt; to use NEAT:  I wanted to use just the right topology for it!  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Right now, there are 7 machines at work and 4 at home working on \nthe \n&gt; experiment.  3 of the 4 at home aren&#39;t really that fast, either.  \nWhereas 6 \n&gt; of the 7 at work are pretty fast.  So I talked to the IT guys at \nwork.  \n&gt; They&#39;re going to let me take my controller machine to work and \ngive it a \n&gt; spot in the server room.  That&#39;ll reduce the latency in \ntransferring work \n&gt; packets to those machines.  I estimate about a 2x increase in \nprocessing \n&gt; speed once the controller is close to the worker machines and the \n&gt; generational latency is eliminated.  That&#39;ll be nice.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll probably give it about another week or so, and then I&#39;ll \nstart worrying \n&gt; about whether or not it will be capable of finding a solution to \nwhat I have \n&gt; asked it to do.  I *know* it is capable of the first task I have \nasked of it \n&gt; (model the pixel inputs).  I&#39;m not so sure about the second part \n(a \n&gt; mechanism for querying that model).\n&gt; \n&gt; A thought just occurred to me, and I want you guy&#39;s input into \nit.  When I \n&gt; split a connection to make a new node, should I be adding a \nconnection to \n&gt; the bias input immediately, rather than relying on it to evolve on \nits own?  \n&gt; That way it has a means by which it can make the most of that node \nright \n&gt; away?  What do you think?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
