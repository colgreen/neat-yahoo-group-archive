That will give reviewers a\n&gt; whole new justification for completely ignoring the main of idea of the\n&gt; paper.\n&gt;\n&gt; Students will also become overwhelmed with code emergencies (since\n&gt; publication will depend now upon strangers running your code) and code\n&gt; cleanups demanded by random strangers who may themselves be at fault or\n&gt; simply ignorant.  Furthermore, in a few years we will have massive\n&gt; repositories of junk code (think of the hundreds of papers published only\n&gt; at GECCO in one year) that is so out of date that it requires deprecated\n&gt; compilers and computing platforms even to run.  But we will be required to\n&gt; maintain these repositories, which will become increasingly ignored,\n&gt; simply to maintain the appearance of rigor.\n\nI think there is a large difference between reviewing the code and\nrequesting that the authors make it available. I don&#39;t expect reviewers to\nrun the code when it&#39;s available. First, re-launching experiments may\nrequire weeks of computations on large clusters. Second, I fully\nunderstand that releasing &quot;clean code&quot; is a huge job and not our main job\n(Science).\n\nHowever, I view the code as the detailed, technical description of a\npaper. It contains all the parameters and all the implementation details,\nincluding those that the authors thought were not important (but that may\nbe actually important). We don&#39;t need to be able to compile the code in\nthe future, we only need to be able to read it.\n\nWhen I reuse an algorithm described in a paper, I often re-implement it.\nIt&#39;s a good exercise and it helps keeping my framework clean and\nconsistent. But I always find very helpful to have have access to the\nsource code so that I can understand the small details and see the\n&quot;tricks&quot; used by the authors. For instance, I&#39;m very happy that Sebastian\nand you released the source code of the node placement algorithm for\nHyperNEAT: thanks to it, we were able to reimplement it in our framework\nin a few hours/days. Otherwise, it would have been much more difficult.\n\n\nBest regards,\n-- JBM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
