I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea in my head for\nsome time of doing an implementation of NEAT in F#.  For the uninitiated, F#\nis MS&#39;s functional .NET solution to the manycore system.  It is completely\ninteroperable with C#/VB and can use the .NET framework.  I&#39;m still getting\ncompletely ramped up on it but it seems like it might be very well suited to\nNEAT.  I was wondering what people think about this.  Waste of time?  Maybe\nNEAT would be better suited to hadoop or something like that.  Maybe\nsomething like this has already been done.  Anyway, I welcome thoughts.\nThanks,\n\nJeff\n\n-- \n...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\ninteresting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in,\nfits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it?
