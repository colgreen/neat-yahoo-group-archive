There&#39;s a lot of disagreement=\r\n and confusion over the the question of what to take from biology and what =\r\nto abstract away.  It sounds like you are interested in a number of low-lev=\r\nel phenomena that researchers often do not incorporate into neural models. =\r\n Some of these are undoubtedly critical (such as plasticity) while others m=\r\nay or may not be important (such as polarity).  But I guess what&#39;s interest=\r\ning is whether there is anything we can say in general on what we should ca=\r\nre about.  I&#39;ve found it interesting sometimes to start from the assumption=\r\n that the seemingly most essential phenomena are actually unnecessary.  Tha=\r\nt is, it&#39;s easy and natural to kind of look at a list of low-level natural =\r\nfeatures and say &quot;hey, your model is missing this or that,&quot; but it&#39;s much m=\r\nore challenging to start by saying, &quot;all of this could be irrelevant and I =\r\nhave to find an argument for why it&#39;s relevant.&quot;  \n\nBut even more interesti=\r\nng than that, I think, is to try to abstract away phenomena that seem essen=\r\ntial into something that looks very different.  For example, a CPPN is a ki=\r\nnd of abstraction of development through growth and local interaction, yet =\r\nthe CPPN does not itself involve any growth or local interaction.  So you g=\r\net a kind of new perspective on what really makes developmental what it is =\r\n(and the answer may turn out to be something much more abstract, like simpl=\r\ny function composition).  \n\nNature chooses specific phenomena that are nece=\r\nssitated by physics to embody its essential functions, but those functions =\r\nthemselves may be significantly more abstract than the physical apparatus t=\r\nhat embody them.  The challenge is to find that right level of abstraction =\r\nto get the same kind of power without the cost.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;olivercoleman04&quot; &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I&#39;ve be=\r\nen doing some research into neuroscience and the functional\n&gt; properties of=\r\n biological neural networks that might be useful for\n&gt; online-learning / ad=\r\naptive networks. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts if\n&gt; you&#39;re interested in t=\r\nhis, I wrote a blog post about it at\n&gt; http://ojcoleman.com/content/models-=\r\nbrains-what-should-we-borrow-biology\n&gt; &lt;http://ojcoleman.com/content/models=\r\n-brains-what-should-we-borrow-biolog&#92;\n&gt; y&gt;   . Below is a snippet...\n&gt; Chee=\r\nrs,Oliver\n&gt; &quot;There is a chasm between the two sets of people who commonly c=\r\nreate\n&gt; artificial neural network (ANN) models. Computational neuroscientis=\r\nts\n&gt; are, by definition, interested in creating models that are biologicall=\r\ny\n&gt; realistic, although the focus is on the elucidation of the computationa=\r\nl\n&gt; and information processing properties and functions of the biological\n&gt;=\r\n neural network (BNN) structures being modeled. On the other hand, most\n&gt; m=\r\nachine learning and artificial intelligence researchers are generally\n&gt; not=\r\n fussed about biological realism, opting for neural network models\n&gt; that, =\r\nwhile biologically inspired, seem to be based on an understanding\n&gt; of the =\r\nbrain from many decades ago (a primary example of which is the\n&gt; almost ubi=\r\nquitous use of a rate-based encoding scheme for neuron action\n&gt; potentials)=\r\n.\n&gt; Why have ML and AI researchers and teachers been so singularly focused,=\r\n\n&gt; for the most part, on vastly simplified models?  (Of course, there are\n&gt;=\r\n some exceptions, but they are just that.) Why haven&#39;t the models we\n&gt; typi=\r\ncally use been kept up-to-date with findings from neuroscience?\n&gt; Perhaps i=\r\nt&#39;s simply because a lack of computational power has made more\n&gt; biological=\r\nly realistic models too cumbersome to work with? Perhaps it&#39;s\n&gt; simple iner=\r\ntia, using the same model we&#39;ve always used, and that\n&gt; everyone else is us=\r\ning, and that we understand well? Perhaps most of us\n&gt; think more biologici=\r\nally plausible models are not necessary?\n&gt; As noted in the first blog post,=\r\n my current research project will\n&gt; explicitly attempt to make use of known=\r\n functional properties of\n&gt; biological neural networks in order to create a=\r\nrtificial neural networks\n&gt; that perform online learning, by way of self-mo=\r\ndification mechanisms\n&gt; modelled on those found in biological neural networ=\r\nks. I&#39;ve been\n&gt; collating a list of these known low-level functional proper=\r\nties and\n&gt; their probable/speculated (depending on level of available evide=\r\nnce)\n&gt; role in various learning mechanisms employed in biological neural\n&gt; =\r\nnetworks. And let me tell you, I found it quite an eye-opener! That is,\n&gt; o=\r\nnce I had deciphered some of the neuroscience lingo. Perhaps that&#39;s one\n&gt; m=\r\nore barrier to ML and AI researchers incorporating these functional\n&gt; prope=\r\nrties into their models?\n&gt; So I now present these eye-opening properties, a=\r\nnd their possible\n&gt; relevance to online-learning...&quot;  Read more at\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/ojcoleman.com/content/models-brains-what-should-we-borrow-biology\n&gt; &lt;http:=\r\n//ojcoleman.com/content/models-brains-what-should-we-borrow-biolog&#92;\n&gt; y&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
