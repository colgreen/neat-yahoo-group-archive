Additionally, methods from computational intelligence \npromise=\r\n to have a big impact on game technology and development, assisting \ndesign=\r\ners and developers and enabling new types of computer games. The \n2011 IEEE=\r\n Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games brings \ntogether leadin=\r\ng researchers and practitioners from academia and industry \nto discuss rece=\r\nnt advances and explore future directions in this quickly \nmoving field. \n\n=\r\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n\n    =\r\n* Learning in games \n    * Coevolution in games \n    * Neural-based approac=\r\nhes for games \n    * Fuzzy-based approaches for games \n    * Player/Opponen=\r\nt modeling in games \n    * CI/AI-based game design \n    * Multi-agent and m=\r\nulti-strategy learning \n    * Applications of game theory \n    * CI for Pla=\r\nyer Affective Modeling \n    * Intelligent Interactive Narrative \n    * Impe=\r\nrfect information and non-deterministic games \n    * Player satisfaction an=\r\nd experience in games \n    * Theoretical or empirical analysis of CI techni=\r\nques for games \n    * Comparative studies and game-based benchmarking \n    =\r\n* Computational and artificial intelligence in: \n          o Video games \n =\r\n         o Board and card games \n          o Economic or mathematical games=\r\n \n          o Serious games \n          o Augmented and mixed-reality games =\r\n\n          o Games for mobile platforms \n\n\nThe conference will consist of a=\r\n single track of oral presentations, \ntutorial and workshop/special session=\r\ns, and live competitions. The \nproceedings will be placed in IEEE Xplore, a=\r\nnd made freely available \non the conference website after the conference. \n=\r\n\n\nIMPORTANT DATES: \nTutorial and special session proposal deadline: January=\r\n 31, 2011\nPaper submission deadline: March 15, 2011 \nConference starts: Aug=\r\nust 31, 2011 \n\n\nGeneral Chair : Sung-Bae Cho\nProgram Co-Chairs: Simon Lucas=\r\n and Phllip Hingston\nCompetition Chair: Julian Togelius \nPublicity Chair: C=\r\nlare Congdon \nProceedings Chair: Mike Preuss\nLocal Chairs: Kyung-Joong Kim,=\r\n Kyu-Baek Hwang, Eun-Youn Kim \n\n\n\n"}}
