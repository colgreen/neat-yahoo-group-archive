Also SharpNEAT used a route pre-determined\nusing the optimal TSP solution, which was NOT anywhere near the\noptimal PTSP route. The winner (Martin Byrod) found a far better route\nusing a GA approach and a simple PD controller to generate seed\nsolutions for the GA to optimize for a given candicate route.\n\nBasically what I&#39;m trying to say is that the route finding was the\nmost important aspect of the PTSP problem, and so I essentially took\nthe wrong approach by focusing on optimizing the controller. It seems\nobvious now of course :)\n\nColin\n\nP.S. There is a short (3 page) paper describing Martin Byrods solution\nwhich I can probably find a link to if anyone&#39;s interested. I\ndefinitely recommend it as background reading if you&#39;re going to enter\nthis comp.\n\nP.P.S I say I /may/ have a go because I&#39;m currently working on an\nalgorithm for the NetFlix prize (www.netflixprize.com). So far I don&#39;t\nanticipate using NEAT for this though.\n\n"}}
