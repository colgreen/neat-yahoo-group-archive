BTW, I will also be\n&gt; &gt; presenting a paper=\r\n that utilizes the same domain at the same GECCO\n&gt; &gt; track, and it also has=\r\n been nominated for the Best Paper Award.  It\n&gt; &gt; introduces a new abstract=\r\nion of indirect encoding for evolving\n&gt; &gt; symmetric and modular neural netw=\r\norks:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?valsalam:gecco09\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So it =\r\nlooks like we are going to have an exciting competition for the\n&gt; &gt; Best Pa=\r\nper Award :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Congratulations! The paper looks very cool. I wish you t=\r\nhe best of luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- Table 1, listing the gaits for different leg ord=\r\nerings, is\n&gt; &gt;    particularly interesting because it gives insight into th=\r\ne type of\n&gt; &gt;    patterns that the CPPN tends to produce. Do you have onlin=\r\ne videos\n&gt; &gt;    of the different gaits?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- What is the phase diffe=\r\nrence between the legs for the gaits with\n&gt; &gt;    left-right and front-back =\r\nsymmetry (Table 1)?  In particular, do\n&gt; &gt;    they qualify as pace and boun=\r\nd respectively, i.e. is the phase\n&gt; &gt;    difference between the sides a hal=\r\nf-period? (I usually find it\n&gt; &gt;    useful to plot the leg angles as a func=\r\ntion of time to determine\n&gt; &gt;    the leg phases more accurately than by obs=\r\nerving the videos.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I looked at these videos a while back and found th=\r\nat most of the bilaterally\n&gt; symmetric gaits have two of the legs stiff and=\r\n the other two doing most of\n&gt; the work. So, I would not classify those as =\r\npace and bound. At the moment, I\n&gt; do not recall any true pace and bound ga=\r\nits. I will look into that again,\n&gt; but at the moment I am swamped with a p=\r\naper deadline and the end-of-semester\n&gt; rush. I don&#39;t have any videos poste=\r\nd yet, but I will try to get to that\n&gt; before I leave the country (I&#39;m off =\r\nto Norway soon for the Congress on\n&gt; Evolutionary Computation).\n&gt; \n&gt; I have=\r\n looked at plots of the angles over time in the past, as in this\n&gt; paper:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/supportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNEA=\r\nT\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not yet done that for the gaits in the GECCO paper. It would =\r\nbe\n&gt; interesting to try.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I still plan on using angular vel=\r\nocities instead of desired\n&gt; angles with HyperNEAT. That may produce more n=\r\natural pace and bound gaits,\n&gt; especially when using a geometric representa=\r\ntion that is biased toward\n&gt; producing such gaits.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- What kind of g=\r\naits did the HyperNEAT experiments with randomized\n&gt; &gt;    geometry produce?=\r\n  Are they similar to the gaits in Table 1, with\n&gt; &gt;    all four legs in sy=\r\nnchrony occurring in the majority of trials?\n&gt; \n&gt; If memory serves, the ans=\r\nwer is yes. They mostly produced gaits with all\n&gt; four legs in synchrony. I=\r\n&#39;ll try to check in on that when I have a sec to\n&gt; provide a more definitiv=\r\ne answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- In the randomized experiments, do you think keeping the=\r\n PRYS inputs\n&gt; &gt;    fixed and randomizing only the other inputs would produ=\r\nce better\n&gt; &gt;    results?  It seems to me that including the PRYS inputs in=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt;    randomization may disrupt the geometry more since they do not h=\r\nave\n&gt; &gt;    a clear geometric interpretation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting. I would thin=\r\nk the opposite. Since they have no proper geometric\n&gt; location, why should =\r\nit matter one way or the other if they are included in\n&gt; the randomization.=\r\n In a sense, their current position is random. Why do you\n&gt; think HyperNEAT=\r\n will do better with PRYS where it is than in any other\n&gt; random location? =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- You mention that each controller was simulated for 6000 time st=\r\neps,\n&gt; &gt;    but the simulation was terminated early if the controller did n=\r\not\n&gt; &gt;    produce good behavior.  Do such early termination occur during th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;    evaluation of champions evolved by HyperNEAT as well?  Also, how\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;    long was each time step?\n&gt; \n&gt; Those 6000 seconds correspond to 6 seco=\r\nnds of &#39;real&#39; simulated time. I&#39;m\n&gt; nearly sure that the answer to your que=\r\nstion is that some of the HyperNEAT\n&gt; champs do not fall over in the time a=\r\nllowed and others do. Another\n&gt; interesting question is what happens if I t=\r\nake the final HyperNEAT champions\n&gt; and run them for more than 6 seconds. T=\r\nhis would test whether they have\n&gt; evolved a true, general gait. I plan on =\r\nperforming that study when I put\n&gt; these results into a journal article.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I am sorry I can&#39;t provide less qualified answers at the moment, but I\n&gt;=\r\n really am overwhelmed with work. I will try to get you better answers when=\r\n\n&gt; the storm clears. \n&gt; \n&gt; Congrats again on your best paper nomination. It=\r\n is fun that we are working\n&gt; on different ways of evolving controllers for=\r\n the same domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; Vinod\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At =\r\nWed, 15 Apr 2009 20:07:52 -0400,\n&gt; &gt; Jeff Clune wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Below is a link to a new HyperNEAT paper that I will present a=\r\nt GECCO 2009\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this summer.

This paper provides the first extensive analysis of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sen=\r\nsitivity of HyperNEAT to different geometric representations of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; prob=\r\nlem. Understanding how geometric representations affect the quality of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n evolved solutions should improve future designs of such representations.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; quadruped robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometr=\r\nic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; representations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the =\r\nquality\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantial=\r\nly affected by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a d=\r\nirect encoding\n&gt; &gt;&gt; control even with randomized geometric representations,=\r\n but performs even\n&gt; &gt;&gt; better when a human engineer designs a representati=\r\non that reflects the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even=\r\n choices in geometric\n&gt; &gt;&gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori =\r\ncan significantly affect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representa=\r\ntion can bias the type of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right s=\r\nymmetry more common than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest tha=\r\nt HyperNEAT practitioners can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; obtain good results even if they do not =\r\nknow how to geometrically represent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a problem, and that further improv=\r\nements are possible with a well-chosen\n&gt; &gt;&gt; geometric representation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; As always, I look forward to any questions or comments yo=\r\nu may have.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution=\r\n Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yahoo! =\r\nGroups Links\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
