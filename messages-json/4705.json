I did it saving the serialization of the population=\r\n object. The evolution starts and moves through epochs. Unfortunately I&#39;m e=\r\nxperiencing a problem in the NEATSpecieManager class. From line 49:\n\nif (ap=\r\nplicantGenes[applicantIdx] instanceof NEATLinkGene) {\n\tweightDiffTotal +=3D=\r\n (((NEATLinkGene)applicantGenes[applicantIdx]).getWeight() - ((NEATLinkGene=\r\n)repGenes[repIdx]).getWeight());\n}\n\nThe sum of weightDiffTotal at line 50 l=\r\nooks at the weight property of NEATLinkGene or NEATNodeGene, because Genes =\r\ncan be both Links and Nodes. \nUnfortunately, for some reason, sometimes, I =\r\nget a ClassCastException because it casts the object to a Link even if it&#39;s=\r\n a Node.\nThe applicantIdx as a certain value... let&#39;s say, 80, while repIdx=\r\n is 1.\nTo solve this I simply catch the exception and skip the instruction.=\r\n.. and I know that this is bad! That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.\nShould i change the ca=\r\nst and comprare Links with Nodes? To be honest... i&#39;m not really sure of wh=\r\nat&#39;s going on here.\n\nI hope you can help me. Thanks!\n\n\n"}}
