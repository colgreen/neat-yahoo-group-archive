It looks like disabling complexity regulation did\n&gt; eliminate the dip in fitness (thanks Colin!). Seems odd that it would have\n&gt; this affect. Maybe it&#39;s a bug?\n\nThere was quite a nasty bug (fixed in SVN on August 1st, revision 34)\nwhereby connection gene objects were being shared between genomes,\nhence a mutation of that connection on one genome would affect other\ngenomes. This is one mechanism by which the best fitness could get\nerroneously reduced. The pruning phase I think increases the mutation\nrate, hence this bug could be the underlying cause of your problem. If\nyou&#39;re not using version 2.1 then I&#39;d encourage you to look through\nthe SVN submission history to check if there are other fixes and mods\nthat may affect your work.\n\n\n&gt; As far the elitism issue, it&#39;s some weird property of having a lot of\n&gt; individuals with 0 fitness.\n\nThanks for the feedback. Will consider your points and look into it.\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
