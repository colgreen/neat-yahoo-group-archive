It does\n&gt; make you wonder why\n&gt; it needs 40 neurons?  (I assume you mean 40 hidden\n&gt; neurons.)\n&gt; What is going on that such a small amount of\n&gt; information is being\n&gt; encoded by so many variables?  I also wonder about\n&gt; the theoretical\n&gt; aspects...what is the theoretical minimum # of\n&gt; neurons needed?\n\nI think there is more going on than is immediately\napparent.  There are 8 input lines.  The ANN &quot;sees&quot;\nthree sets of these before it makes its first move,\nalthough the first set is always the same,\nrepresenting face down.  The second set is really not\nimportant.  Perfect play could be based just on the\nlast set of 8 lines.  (so maybe you are right.)\nThe ANN, remembering what it &quot;saw&quot;, must then pick one\nof four cards by settinng one output line.  To play\nperfectly it must use what it remembers.  Then, based\nof this result, and again using its memory, it must\npick the remaining correct card.\n\nBTW, the hidden neuron classification does not really\napply here, or must be carefully defined.  All neurons\nreceive all inputs.  All neurons also receive inputs\nfrom all the other neurons, and from themselves. \nHowever, only the first four neurons are output\nneurons, so you could say that there are 36 hidden\nneurons.  In this case the only difference between\nhidden or not hiddent is that the non-hidden neurons&#39;\noutput is used.\n\nBTW, I allow the net to settle while holding the input\nvalues.  I let it take up to 16 updates for the\noutputs to reach a state where only 1 line is high. \nOf course it may not really have settled, just because\n1 line out of only 4 outputs is high, but that&#39;s the\nway the current code is.  Maybe that&#39;s a serious\ndefect, and I should require all the outputs to\nstabilize.\n\n&gt; You may want to try ablating neurons, or cutting\n&gt; them out of the\n&gt; network one by one, and seeing if it still performs\n&gt; alright.  It may\n&gt; turn out some of them don&#39;t matter.  Note that you\n&gt; can ablate a neuron\n&gt; either by literally removing it, or by turning it&#39;s\n&gt; output into random\n&gt; noise.  I&#39;ve heard arguments for doing it both ways.\n&gt; \n&gt; It also makes you wonder how NEAT would do, since it\n&gt; complexifies..perhaps it can find a smaller\n&gt; solution?  Maybe you could\n&gt; upload the code for this smaller game as well.\n\nI will do that.  I think that neat could evolve a\nperfect player of this 4-card game, although I&#39;m not\ncertain.  We can&#39;t be certain until someone sets it up\nand does it.\n\nm\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
