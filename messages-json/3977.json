As a =\r\nresult, if e.g. a forward drops\nback momentarily to play defense, he does n=\r\not suddenly switch roles\nand *become* a fullback.  Rather, he goes back to =\r\nbeing a forward.\n\nWhat would happen if your role in soccer switched instant=\r\naneously with\nyour position?  Then the team could end up with problems wher=\r\ne e.g.\neveryone on the team becomes offense at the same time by accident\nsi=\r\nmply because they momentarily moved up the field.  Then who will go\nback to=\r\n defend?  It seems there is a use to roles defined a priori.\n\nYet I imagine=\r\n in other domains role makes more sense based on current\nposition alone.  S=\r\no it is probably domain-dependent, and an\ninteresting issue to think about.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@.=\r\n..&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing I thought about when I read the paper was, what wo=\r\nuld \n&gt; happen if the CPPN generates the connectivity patterns depending on =\r\n\n&gt; the relative positions of each individual in realtime while on the \n&gt; fi=\r\neld? It would require a great deal of computation time (it has to \n&gt; rebuil=\r\nd the phenotype once per timestep per individual) but it may \n&gt; show intere=\r\nsting results. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanl=\r\ney&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio and I discuss the potential=\r\n for HyperNEAT \n&gt; &gt; controlling multiple heterogeneous agents in this new \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; paper, &quot;Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning,&quot; to appear at \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n GECCO 2008:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\n&gt; &gt; option=3Dcom_c=\r\nontent&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#dambrosio.gecco08\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Direct Li=\r\nnk:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_gecco08.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nWe also have a nice sample of videos that depict various evolved \n&gt; &gt; teams=\r\n in action:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/multiagenthyperneat\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe interesting idea in this paper is that just as a single \n&gt; &gt; connective =\r\nCPPN can encode how a single network varies over space, \n&gt; &gt; it can also en=\r\ncode how a *set* of networks (each representing the \n&gt; &gt; policy of one agen=\r\nt on the team) varies over space.  In this way, \n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT can learn an=\r\n expression that encodes how policies vary \n&gt; &gt; over the team geometry.  Fo=\r\nr example, in a soccer team agents vary \n&gt; &gt; from defensive to offensive as=\r\n you move away from the goal.  Part \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the power of this approach i=\r\ns that it means basic skills can be \n&gt; &gt; learned and shared among the whole=\r\n team, since the CPPN encodes how \n&gt; &gt; those skills vary across the field.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
