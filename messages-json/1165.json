For example, an agent \ncould have a 1000x1000 array of inputs, but if they represent a million \nunrelated channels, then the agent has less it can learn than if they \nrepresent one high-resolution video feed.\n\n&lt;&lt;Not that this is currently a practical problem size :) &gt;&gt;\n\nThen, there&#39;s a second barrier, of the &quot;evolvability&quot; of the agent, e.g. if \nthe gaps between functional solutions are too wide, then no amount of time \nor population-size will make the jump into the complicated stuff.\n\n&lt;&lt;  Incidentally this suggests a simple model for why populations pause \nlongest between big fitness jumps:\n\n1) and fitness jump available in the local solution-space will be made on a \nfaster time scale\n2) longer jumps across solution space will occur at frequencies with some \nsort of inverse relation to the jump length\n3) long jumps may land in the foothills of another &quot;mountain&quot; on the \nsolution space (the parameter search community generally regard increasing \nquality as downwards, so &quot;basin&quot; is the more common term...)\n4) but you will only ever see the results of that jump if the mountain \narrived on is higher than the previous equilibrium, in which case the \nmutant species will rapidly run up hill as far as it can and take over the \npopulation (or at least the number-one spot)\n\nThus long pauses occur before big jumps because they are the delay after \nall available &quot;easy&quot; improvements have been made, but while we are waiting \nfor a single low probability event. &gt;&gt;\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
