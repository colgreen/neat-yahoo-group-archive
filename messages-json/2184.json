It&#39;s debatable \n&gt; whether this is a necessary feature or simply a byproduct of biology - \n&gt; it&#39;s much easier for two neurons in close spatial proximity to be \n&gt; connected than those farther apart.  But do neural networks have hubs?\n\nNot sure but I thought I&#39;d add that the clusters in mammalian brains are \narranged in columns. The neural column is, I think, the basic unit of \nrepetition, and interconnections within a column have been observed to \nbe far more numerous than those between columns.\n\n\n&gt; 4) The NEAT paradigm is not biased toward either of these network \n&gt; features.  Any node has an equal chance connecting to any other node \n&gt; (excepting the initial connections between input and output nodes).\n\nWhich would be more like the case /within/ a neural column, for example, \nwhich contains far more neurons (approx. 100k is a figure I recall) than \nany NEAT evolved ANN I&#39;ve ever seen. If clustering is a strategy for \ndealing with complexity, and our ANN&#39;s don&#39;t get very complex then it&#39;s \nnot clear that it would be a useful strategy to engineer into NEAT. On \nthe other hand clustering may happen at numerous levels, so e.g.a neural \ncolumn may contain sub-clusters, some of which may contain very small \ngroups similar in size to our ANN&#39;s.\n\n\n&gt; Despite this lack of bias in the evolutionary model, do clusters or \n&gt; hubs emerge?  If they are crucial features of an effective network, \n&gt; should we build such biases into the evolutionary process?  For \n&gt; example, the likelihood of a connection being added between two nodes \n&gt; could be proportional to the connectivity distance between the two \n&gt; (this could be based on a unidirectional or bidirectional traversal of \n&gt; connections).  Or, the weight could be proportional to this distance.  \n&gt; As an alternative to connectivity distance, we could give the nodes a \n&gt; spatial layout, perhaps on a 2-dimensional surface, and have \n&gt; connection mutation be relative to that spatial distance.\n\nAs an aside, laying neuron&#39;s out in a grid space, 2D, 3D or otherwise \n(why not 4D or more?) is something I&#39;ve considered when thinking about \nindirect encodings. &#39;growing&#39; neurons within a limited space is one way \nof preventing an indirect encoding from growing ANN&#39;s too large to \nsimulate.\n\nActually when I started out doing work on neuro-evolution my first \ninstinct was to use grid layouts (I used hexagonal grids) and the \nquestion of how many dimensions I should use came up. It occured to me \nthat real world neural nets exist in 3D due to physical constriants - \nthere are only 3 spacial dimensions! - and this presents a limit to the \namount of connectivity a biological neural net can achieve, because of \nthe physical size of neurons and their connections and the limited space \navailable. Therefore it makes sense to connect more to your neighbours \nthan to distant neurons.\n\nOf course the ANN&#39;s in NEAT are effectively dimensionless, any neuron \ncan connect to any other without any limits or concept of relative \ndistance and the lack of this restriction is one of the benefits we have \nover biology. Perhaps though clustering is not just a strategy for \ndealing with physical limitations, but actually has other positive side \neffects.\n\nTrying to engineer some kind of clustering factor into NEAT is an \ninteresting idea. I don;t think it&#39;s a substitute for the  existing \nmodular NEAT approaches because there is no repetition of \nclusters(unless maybe you can identify them), but it may be a more \nefficient way of evolving small ANN&#39;s in general.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding on the 4D comment above - when I started out with\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; - Philip\n&gt;\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Philip Tucker\n&gt; ptucker@... &lt;mailto:ptucker@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
