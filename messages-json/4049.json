But =\r\nare \nthey &quot;smart&quot; in a sense.. For example, does the robot in the 2D maze \n=\r\nexperiment succeed just because of luck? It is possible that a \nbehavior th=\r\nat appears a solution to be discovered, but the robot acts \nlike a beheaded=\r\n fly and reaches the solution by accident? How much \nthis depends upon the =\r\nenvironment and the inputs provided? Is it the \nsame with fitness-based sea=\r\nrch? I am asking this because I am about \nto introduce novelty search to ti=\r\nme series forecasting which is very \ncomplex domain in terms of characteriz=\r\ning behavior. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;ksta=\r\nnley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter C&#39;s message brings up another issue that might b=\r\ne useful to\n&gt; Peter B:  For ambulation, it might be more effective to use l=\r\neaky\n&gt; integrator neurons than the usual feedforward neurons that are used =\r\n\nin\n&gt; most ANN models.  The leaky integrators are better for precise \ntimin=\r\ng.\n&gt;  However, they may not be necessary if joint angles are being \nprovide=\r\nd\n&gt; as input.  But when joint angles are not provided, I do not think I\n&gt; h=\r\nave ever seen a regular recurrent ANN (i.e. non-leaky or not some\n&gt; other s=\r\npecial type of neuron) be able to make something walk.  In\n&gt; fact, the &quot;fla=\r\niling&quot; motions are often reduced significantly by \nleaky\n&gt; integrator neuro=\r\nns.  Tyler Streeter saw this when he worked on his\n&gt; biped with NEAT, which=\r\n actually stopped flailing after switching to\n&gt; leaky integrators.

As you are=\r\n experiencing, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even wi=\r\nth feature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selection.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be=\r\n \nuseful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because it does not care about the # inputs or outputs (a=\r\nnd \ncan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potentially exploit geometric regularities), but configuri=\r\nng \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate then becomes the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ass=\r\numing all of that stuff is set up well with whatever \nsystem, \n&gt; &gt; then \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty search is a potentially winning approach.  Yet as you \n&gt; &gt; po=\r\nint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In fact, we \n=\r\nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to these \nquestio=\r\nns \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general principles might hel=\r\np for \nnow: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not=\r\n not need to \ncontain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every point ever visited.  Therefore, it ten=\r\nds to grow much \n&gt; &gt; slower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations.  However, if=\r\n it is indeed getting \ntoo \n&gt; &gt; big  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreasonable t=\r\no collapse some of the archive \n&gt; &gt; points, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although there is no s=\r\ntandard method yet for how that should \nbe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done.  But we have reas=\r\non to believe there will be effective \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple ways to do that.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, the issue of one individual looking different jus=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same behav=\r\nior is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated.  For certain phase disaparities, the two \nindi=\r\nviduals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but it is true that at some=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disparity, they may look very different.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whether that fact is actually problematic to the novelty \nsearch \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it would simply reward both types of behavior.  \n=\r\nIt \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the phase difference is a result of some =\r\nuseful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, which could make it a stepping stone to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  Or, it is possible that it is superfluous \n=\r\ninformation \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply takes some extra time exploring the ar=\r\nea around the \nphase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shifted individual.  So it is hard to say a p=\r\nriori whether it \nis \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major concern.  We will have better an=\r\nswers to such questions \nas \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; technique is further explored=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I agree that it would be nice to be able to say=\r\n the \ntwo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase-shifted individuals are largely the same if that i=\r\ns \nindeed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you want to say.  And for that, you would need a pa=\r\nttern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. \nsometh=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  Ther=\r\ne are \n&gt; &gt; certainly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available.  However, it&#39;s import=\r\nant to recognize \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident at this point that ig=\r\nnoring the phase shift \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than taking it into con=\r\nsideration, because \ntaking \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means =\r\nadding more information to the \n&gt; &gt; novelty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So overall I think novelty search is a very promising \ndirection \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go for such problems, but it is still in the realm of \nresearc=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no existing precedent), so it will involve \n=\r\nconsiderable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error to get it right until all these issue=\r\ns are \n&gt; &gt; fleshed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out more clearly.  Ultimately, though, if our h=\r\nypothesis \nabout \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty vs. fitness is correct, novelty search ma=\r\ny turn out \nto be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way to get certain highly complex typ=\r\nes of \nbehavior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in some domains, which is a sobering tho=\r\nught.  But if \nit \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true, then there is not much to do other=\r\n than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; \n&lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fasc=\r\ninating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new approach.

I&#39;ve also been trying to incorpor=\r\nate CMA-ES in \norder to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimize weights but I haven&#39;t had much s=\r\nuccess meshing \nthis \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later today when I am home I will post my source file=\r\ns for \n&gt; &gt; anyone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual =\r\ncreature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FINALLY=\r\n, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represented\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount \nof \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; proposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if ther=\r\nes a \nnew \n&gt; &gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to =\r\na list of discovered behaviours. This \n&gt; &gt; works \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I=\r\n imagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of information to \nhold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I can compare the behaviour of 2 \n&gt; &gt; r=\r\nagdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; is there any compact encoding tha=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work? Since it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluatio=\r\nns to \nget \n&gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this right now, there=\r\ns going to \nhave to \n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate behavi=\r\nours in some way that \nis \n&gt; &gt; fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to compare;=\r\n what if a Tori has identical behaviour to \n&gt; &gt; another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later instead? Just \n&gt; &gt; comparing \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviours it would appear that they were 100% un=\r\nique, \nyet \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer would instantly notice =\r\nthe similarity in how they \nact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
