In fact, you could be\nintroducing damaging sampling bias by pointing NEAT away from optima\nthat might be too small to hit with the initial population, but may be\nreachable from initial low-fit individuals.\n\nMy guess is that you won&#39;t do any harm, but nor will you see\nimprovement.  It&#39;s easy enough to test, though, so give it a shot.  My\nintuitions are wrong often enough.\n\nOn Jan 3, 2008 6:45 PM, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any significance to the composition of generation zero beyond\n&gt; that of providing a radomized evaluation/starting point of the design\n&gt; space?
