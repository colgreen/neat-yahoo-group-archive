That=92s great!\n\nI love the paper in general=\r\n. I also have a question about one specific result that I find quite intere=\r\nsting. Actually, it=92s something that I=92ve noticed in previous NS papers=\r\n, but it really jumped out at me in your paper. As such, Joel also may have=\r\n thoughts on the subject. \n\nFigure 7 is fascinating to me. The first thing =\r\nthat jumps out (which I=92ve noticed in previous NS papers), is that there =\r\nare very few points in the upper right corner of the hard map for the Novel=\r\nty Search treatment (by =93upper right corner I=92m including the thin hall=\r\nway that leads to the open, upper-right corner). Similarly, there are few p=\r\noints in the intermediate chambers of the Medium map for the NS treatment (=\r\nI=92ll focus on the hard map the rest of this email, but all of the observa=\r\ntions apply to the medium map too). Those non-well-tread areas suggests a h=\r\nuge nonlinearity in exploratory skills: my hypothesis is that the search pr=\r\nocess searches for a long while and then, boom, it suddenly produces a robo=\r\nt with the right skill set and then the problem is solved. One might expect=\r\n different from NS: one could expect it to slowly fill up the map. In fact,=\r\n this seeming nonlinearity is one reason that Roby Velez and I wanted to in=\r\nvestigate whether NS does produce such general exploratory skills in the 20=\r\n14 GECCO paper we posted recently (video: http://youtu.be/P-EqOBqjTyU   =97=\r\n pdf: http://goo.gl/Iv180r ).\n\nIf you watch videos of robots in the lineage=\r\n that produces the champion, do you see such a nonlinearity? Are there a se=\r\nries of robots that get just a bit further down the path and then, all of t=\r\nhe sudden, an amazing robot that happens to explore all the way to the goal=\r\n? If not, what is the explanation for the scarcity of points? It seems a bi=\r\nt weird that NS can produce a robot that goes all the way to the goal witho=\r\nut stopping at lots of intermediate points unless it really is good at some=\r\n general exploration skill such as wall-following, and it thus happens to w=\r\nander past the goal (at which point the stopping criterion kicks in). \n\nInt=\r\nerestingly, the fitness treatment also has this paucity of points in the up=\r\nper right-hand corner. That suggests that fitness is also producing these g=\r\neneral exploratory skills on par with NS, which is exactly what Roby and I =\r\nfound. So, if the NS robots do exhibit this nonlinear skill level-up, it se=\r\nems fitness does too. Do videos of the champ lineage show a nonlinearity he=\r\nre too? \n\nThose questions could have been asked of the original NS papers. =\r\nSpecifically in light of the new data in this paper, it=92s also interestin=\r\ng to note how the pattern changes for the other treatments. The directed tr=\r\neatment has a few more points, though it is not obviously more and could be=\r\n noise and not signal. But it=92s clear that IEC and NA-IEC are very differ=\r\nent. \n\nIEC had to inch its way toward a solution. One can empathize with th=\r\ne pain the human subjects (eplex lab members and friends/family, I presume!=\r\n) had to go through to get to a solution. Why do you think IEC was worse th=\r\nan directed evolution in this regard? I can=92t think of a good explanation=\r\n, and would be interested in your thoughts. One fun thing you could do with=\r\n this data set is test the evolvability of these genomes in the large maze =\r\nfrom the paper Roby and I just put out (and other mazes): the prediction ac=\r\ncording to the thesis that objective-driven evolution creates non-evolvable=\r\n, brittle, overwrought genomes is that these genomes would not be very evol=\r\nvable compared to the NS and Fitness genomes. \n\nThe NA-IEC data is also int=\r\neresting. On the one hand, it=92s less pathological than IEC in that there =\r\nare fewer points. But, as you mention, the humans did transition into objec=\r\ntive-driven evaluators at corners: it seems they selected anything that tur=\r\nned the corner just a bit more, inching their way around the bend. If that=\r\n=92s true, we should also expect these genomes to be less evolvable than th=\r\nose evolved by NS, Fitness, and even DirectedFitness. Why do you think NS d=\r\noesn=92t produce these corner bends, but NA-IEC does? Maybe it=92s because =\r\nNA-IEC doesn=92t spend so much time spinning its wheels early before findin=\r\ng that nonlinear level-up robot that can suddenly explore really well. \n\nWh=\r\nat do you think? It would be interesting to carry those experiments out, bu=\r\nt even if that never happens I=92d enjoy hearing your thoughts and predicti=\r\nons on these subjects. \n\nCongrats again on the nice work!\n \nBest regards,\nJ=\r\neff Clune\n\nAssistant Professor\nComputer Science\nUniversity of Wyoming\njeffc=\r\nlune@...\njeffclune.com\n\nOn May 6, 2014, at 12:36 PM, kstanley@...=\r\ns.edu wrote:\n\n&gt; Brian Woolley and I are pleased to announce our new GECCO p=\r\naper, &quot;A Novel Human-Computer Collaboration: Combining Novelty Search with =\r\nInteractive Evolution.&quot;  \n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/woolley_gecco=\r\n14.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; This paper discloses some interesting results that show that in=\r\n the hard maze domain, a human in collaboration with novelty search (and an=\r\n objective optimization function) can actually do better than novelty searc=\r\nh alone, fitness alone, human+objective optimization alone, and more.  By b=\r\netter I don&#39;t just mean in terms of number of evaluations, but even (surpri=\r\nsingly) in total clock time.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The main insight is that humans and nov=\r\nelty search (NS) are complementary forces.  NS does a great job of collecti=\r\nng potential stepping stones from the search space, but humans are extremel=\r\ny sensitive to certain very delicate key features (that may be difficult to=\r\n formalize even in a behavior characterization).  Thus if NS does most of t=\r\nhe work but humans are allowed to interleave a few very critical key decisi=\r\nons, the collaboration makes a good team.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I think of NS in this cont=\r\next as a sort of substitute for all the other users on Picbreeder when you =\r\nare instead alone by yourself with only a computer to help you.  Ideally, y=\r\nou&#39;d have hundreds of people scavenging the search space and presenting you=\r\n with every interesting stepping stone that they can, but short of that, NS=\r\n can play a similar role.\n&gt; \n&gt; One other aspect of this study that I think =\r\nis particularly interesting is the insight that we do not necessarily &quot;help=\r\n&quot; people simply by trying to figure out where they want to go and then auto=\r\nmating the search towards that inferred objective.  I think a lot of people=\r\n have the intuition that it would be cool if interactive evolution could fi=\r\ngure out the kinds of things you like and then sort of accelerate itself by=\r\n choosing the stuff you would have chosen, but much faster.  However, what =\r\nthis study shows is that we humans have a much more pressing problem than s=\r\nimply wishing to be a faster version of ourselves - rather, we need to push=\r\ned out of our comfort zone from time to time to help us see the possibiliti=\r\nes we never imagined.  Otherwise we, just like an objective search, may ten=\r\nd to stagnate.  NS can provide that push.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail=_32CBDB03-5539-4473-A5FE-0E1C3A3668E6\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=windows-1252\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html charset=\r\n=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-=\r\nmode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;&quot;&gt;Hello Ken and Brian,&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Congrats on your nice paper, especially for being nominat=\r\ned for a Best Paper award.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/woolley_gecco14.pdf&quot;&gt;http://e=\r\nplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/woolley_gecco14.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This paper discloses =\r\nsome interesting results that show that in the hard maze domain, a human in=\r\n collaboration with novelty search (and an objective optimization function)=\r\n can actually do better than novelty search alone, fitness alone, human+obj=\r\nective optimization alone, and more.&nbsp; By better I don&#39;t just mean in t=\r\nerms of number of evaluations, but even (surprisingly) in total clock time.=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main insight is that humans and novelty search (NS) are =\r\ncomplementary forces.&nbsp; NS does a great job of collecting potential ste=\r\npping stones from the search space, but humans are extremely sensitive to c=\r\nertain very delicate key features (that may be difficult to formalize even =\r\nin a behavior characterization).&nbsp; Thus if NS does most of the work but=\r\n humans are allowed to interleave a few very critical key decisions, the co=\r\nllaboration makes a good team.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think of NS in this context =\r\nas a sort of substitute for all the other users on Picbreeder when you are =\r\ninstead alone by yourself with only a computer to help you.&nbsp; Ideally, =\r\nyou&#39;d have hundreds of people scavenging the search space and presenting yo=\r\nu with every interesting stepping stone that they can, but short of that, N=\r\nS can play a similar role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other aspect of this study that I thi=\r\nnk is particularly interesting is the insight that we do not necessarily &quot;h=\r\nelp&quot; people simply by trying to figure out where they want to go and then a=\r\nutomating the search towards that inferred objective.&nbsp; I think a lot o=\r\nf people have the intuition that it would be cool if interactive evolution =\r\ncould figure out the kinds of things you like and then sort of accelerate i=\r\ntself by choosing the stuff you would have chosen, but much faster.&nbsp; H=\r\nowever, what this study shows is that we humans have a much more pressing p=\r\nroblem than simply wishing to be a faster version of ourselves - rather, we=\r\n need to pushed out of our comfort zone from time to time to help us see th=\r\ne possibilities we never imagined.&nbsp; Otherwise we, just like an objecti=\r\nve search, may tend to stagnate.&nbsp; NS can provide that push.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bes=\r\nt,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ken&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email -=\r\n-&gt;\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail=_32CBDB03-5539-4473-A5FE-0E1C3A3668E6--\r\n\n"}}
