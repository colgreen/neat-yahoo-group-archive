Any node has an equal chance connecting to any other node\n&gt; &gt; (ex=\r\ncepting the initial connections between input and output nodes).\n&gt; \n&gt; Which=\r\n would be more like the case /within/ a neural column, for example,\n&gt; which=\r\n contains far more neurons (approx. 100k is a figure I recall) than\n&gt; any N=\r\nEAT evolved ANN I&#39;ve ever seen. If clustering is a strategy for\n&gt; dealing w=\r\nith complexity, and our ANN&#39;s don&#39;t get very complex then it&#39;s\n&gt; not clear =\r\nthat it would be a useful strategy to engineer into NEAT. On\n&gt; the other ha=\r\nnd clustering may happen at numerous levels, so e.g.a neural\n&gt; column may c=\r\nontain sub-clusters, some of which may contain very small\n&gt; groups similar =\r\nin size to our ANN&#39;s.\n\nMost of the cases mentioned in the book have numerou=\r\ns levels of\nconnectivity.  Clusters, clusters of clusters, clusters of clus=\r\nters of\nclusters, etc..  Not sure about the brain, though.\n\n&gt; Of course the=\r\n ANN&#39;s in NEAT are effectively dimensionless, any neuron\n&gt; can connect to a=\r\nny other without any limits or concept of relative\n&gt; distance and the lack =\r\nof this restriction is one of the benefits we have\n&gt; over biology. Perhaps =\r\nthough clustering is not just a strategy for\n&gt; dealing with physical limita=\r\ntions, but actually has other positive side\n&gt; effects.\n\nOne of the features=\r\n of cluster connectivity mentioned in the book is\nthat such connections are=\r\n sparse and largely random.  For a modular\napproach to approximate this, ra=\r\nndom inter-module connectivity might\nbe necessary.\n\n- Philip\n\n"}}
