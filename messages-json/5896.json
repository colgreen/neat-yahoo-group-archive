I agree with some of your points from your post but I also wanted to men=\r\ntion a couple where I differ.  \n\nI agree strongly with your conclusion that=\r\n simply because phenotypic diversity is a good thing does not mean that gen=\r\notypic diversity should be discarded.  They play different and complementar=\r\ny roles.  I&#39;m glad to hear you drew that conclusion from this work.\n\nWhere =\r\nI somewhat differ is on the &quot;bolting on&quot; issue.  You mentioned that I have =\r\npointed out that in target-based search evolution &quot;never takes the time to =\r\nredesign from the ground up&quot; and keeps &quot;hacking in/bolting on new things th=\r\nat happen to work.&quot;  However, I would like to make a distinction between yo=\r\nur characterization and my view.  First, my view is that *all* evolution &quot;n=\r\never takes the time to redesign from the ground up&quot; and keeps &quot;hacking in/b=\r\nolting on new things that happen to work,&quot; both in non-objective and object=\r\nive-based evolution.  Those are ubiquitous qualities of evolution regardles=\r\ns of how it&#39;s rewarded:  Its mutations are inherently ad hoc and it is virt=\r\nually impossible to &quot;redesign&quot; an ad hoc construction in the middle of a se=\r\narch.  That&#39;s true in nature, in Picbreeder, in objective-based algorithms,=\r\n and probably true in Avida (though I&#39;m not experienced in Avida).\n\nSecond,=\r\n in my view the key distinction between non-objective and objective search =\r\nis that objective search tends to produce representations that are *piecewi=\r\nse*.  In other words, while both non-object and objective search proceed in=\r\n an ad-hoc &quot;bolting on&quot; manner, the bolted-on components in the objective s=\r\nearch tend to be irregular additions that slightly raise fitness at the exp=\r\nense of ruining the representation for future generations.  That is because=\r\n in objective search there is no reward for establishing any regularities. =\r\n In non-objective search, on the other hand, often a regularity is preserve=\r\nd because it offers something fundamentally new (i.e. neither good nor bad)=\r\n and then later becomes the basis for endless elaboration (like bilateral s=\r\nymmetry).  You can&#39;t establish something like symmetry early in an objectiv=\r\ne search because symmetry on its own looks nothing like the final objective=\r\n, even if theoretically it would be helpful in principle in finding it.  \n\n=\r\nI&#39;m also not sure whether it&#39;s really accurate to say Avida is &quot;not target-=\r\nbased.&quot;  It&#39;s true that it&#39;s not as explicit as a single simple objective f=\r\nunction, but the fact that there are several logical operations that explic=\r\nitly give an advantage to organisms that execute them actually does create =\r\na form of objective-driven pressure.  In other words, the creativity of evo=\r\nlution in Avida with such a priori human-defined rewards is to some extent =\r\nhampered by the need to stay competitive on those arbitrary objectives.  So=\r\n I&#39;d expect it to be closer to objective search (when used in that mode) th=\r\nan non-objective search, though somewhere on the continuum between them.  I=\r\n also understand that Avida as a platform doesn&#39;t have to be run with those=\r\n rewards, but if I understand correctly they are traditional and used in th=\r\nis particular paper as well.\n\nHowever, I think these differences in perspec=\r\ntive don&#39;t really detract from the main point of the paper regarding ontoge=\r\nny and phylogeny.  But I mention them mainly as a side-conversation on obje=\r\nctive vs. non-objective search and their effects.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jeffclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted t=\r\no let you know about a new paper I recently published. I did not use NEAT, =\r\nbut there are messages in the paper that relate to some of the conversation=\r\ns we&#39;ve had on this list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clune J, Pennock RT, Ofria C, Lenski RE\n&gt; On=\r\ntogeny tends to recapitulate phylogeny in digital organisms. \n&gt; The America=\r\nn Naturalist.  2012. 180: E54=96E63.\n&gt; PDF: http://jeffclune.com/publicatio=\r\nns/2012-CluneEtAl-OntegenyRecapitulatesPhylogeny-AmNat.pdf\n&gt; Popular press =\r\nwriteup of the paper: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/12081013=\r\n3155.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; The first relevant subject regards evolving good representati=\r\nons. The work of Joel, Ken, and colleagues has shown some interesting thing=\r\ns regarding when we can expect bad representations, such as in target-based=\r\n search, where evolution keeps hacking in/bolting on new things that happen=\r\n to work, and never takes the time to redesign from the ground up (or even =\r\nat middle levels). Nature, however, does something similar (though perhaps =\r\nto a much lesser degree): vestigial organs and developmental stages hang ar=\r\nound, including intermediate developmental forms that are built and then di=\r\nssolve entirely. In this paper we looked into whether we could see evidence=\r\n of that &quot;bolting on&quot; in Avida, a digital evolution platform that is not ta=\r\nrget-based in that it does not have an explicit fitness function. We found =\r\nevidence for bolting on, just as we would expect from the existence of vest=\r\nigial developmental stages in biological organisms: new functionality tende=\r\nd to appear later in the development of an organism, because mutations that=\r\n changed things more fundamentally/deeper in the representation were more l=\r\nikely to be deleterious and were more quickly weeded out by selection. I th=\r\nink the lesson is that this bolting on process is largely inevitable, thoug=\r\nh I think it is a fascinating question whether it is less of an issue in di=\r\nvergent search vs. convergent search. \n&gt; \n&gt; A second issue related to this =\r\nlist is that, because evolution tends to quickly select away mutations that=\r\n deeply change representations, it is likely a good idea to have something =\r\nlike the genomic diversity protection in NEAT. Because recent work has show=\r\nn that phenotypic/behavioral diversity is more effective than genotypic div=\r\nersity, many people may be switching to phenotypic diversity and abandoning=\r\n genomic diversity: this work suggests that both may be important. For exam=\r\nple, mutations that affect a representation deeply may initially hurt the o=\r\nrganism&#39;s ability to do something behaviorally different/interesting, for t=\r\nhe same reason that such mutations hurts fitness (e.g. they cripple the org=\r\nanism). Protecting that innovation for a while may thus pay off.  In other =\r\nwords, because selection will quickly work to eliminate deep changes, we sh=\r\nould probably protect them for a while if we want to see better representat=\r\nions emerge.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the paper, we focus on an interesting consequence of=\r\n bolting on: if new functionality is added to the end of an organism&#39;s life=\r\n, then the order that an organism develops will tend to contain information=\r\n about the order that traits evolved in its lineage, and vice-versa. That h=\r\nelps settle an age old debate by showing that &quot;ontogeny tends to recapitula=\r\nte phylogeny&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know if you have any questions or commen=\r\nts. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Visiting Scientist\n&gt; Cornell Univ=\r\nersity\n&gt; jeffclune@...\n&gt; jeffclune.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
