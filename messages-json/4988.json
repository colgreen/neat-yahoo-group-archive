S=\r\no we wouldn&#39;t even have to worry about weights only the &quot;activation functio=\r\nns&quot; ie: operators.  We are likely to produce more structure, but that is wh=\r\nat NEAT is good at.\n\nThis makes the search space MUCH smaller, though I sus=\r\npect much of the meaning of each bit has to be discovered first.  This got =\r\nme thinking about using HyperNEAT&#39;s ability to establish relationships betw=\r\neen inputs/outputs.  So what if we used a one bit substrate?  Something whe=\r\nre any multibit inputs are arranged near each other, but where each bit can=\r\n be accessed separately?  Then we have only operators and  connections, but=\r\n no weights.  \n\nPeople in this group have more experience with NN&#39;s so I am=\r\n just looking for a feasibility assessment before I start programing it and=\r\n possibly wasting my time.\n\nShould I try this first with NEAT or HyperNEAT?=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
