In addition\nthe sailboat has this strange quirk that there is a\nrange of forbidden directions, where the boat cannot\nsustain a velocity vector.  Also, the controller has\nto choose a path to follow, then set both the rudder\nand sails.  (although with a NN this is not explicit)\nThere is a range of rudder/sail combos that will\nfollow a given path, but one combo will be fastest.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s written in C.

They won&#39;t\nnecessarily obtain the exact same results.  Using NEAT\nis not fully automatic, some manual &quot;shifting&quot; is\nrequired. :)\n\nm\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
