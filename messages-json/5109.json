That is, [0, 0.5, 1 , 1] is the coordinate of a connection, so I am no=\r\nt sure what you mean when you ask if it is &quot;input&quot; first?  Activation trave=\r\nls down all connections in the same layer simultaneously in the same timest=\r\nep, and is summed at the target neurons.   So order shouldn&#39;t matter, thoug=\r\nh I may be misunderstanding.\n\nOne thing that I can answer is that links do =\r\nnot have state, though nodes have state.  However, like I said, I may not b=\r\ne understanding the question fully.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jto=\r\nddowen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  My unde=\r\nrstanding of recurrence and\n&gt; neuron links in NEAT is that during each time=\r\nstep new input data is\n&gt; presented to the ANN and travels to the next neuro=\r\nn until ultimately\n&gt; reaching the output.  Therefore, using the NEAT struct=\r\nure at\n&gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html\n&gt; &lt;http://www.cs.ucf.edu=\r\n/%7Ekstanley/neat.html&gt;  it would take 3 timesteps\n&gt; for activation from in=\r\nput 1 to traverse neurons 16, 269 and then 5,\n&gt; although data is also going=\r\n directly from 1 to 5 (through a direct link)\n&gt; in one step.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the ab=\r\nove is correct, how do the HyperNEAT timesteps work?  Using the\n&gt; model fro=\r\nm http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.u=\r\ncf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html%20&gt;  does [0, 0.5,\n&gt; 1 , 1] get input, =\r\nthen [0.5, 0, 1, 0.5] next?  If so, it would seem to\n&gt; me the order you tra=\r\nversed the points in the substrate would affect the\n&gt; output.  Or, do you k=\r\neep the &quot;state&quot; of each link activation stored\n&gt; separately from one input =\r\nsubstrate to another (one checkerboard play to\n&gt; another); in other words, =\r\nare you keeping (4096 + 64) &quot;states&quot; for each\n&gt; timestep?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Todd\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
