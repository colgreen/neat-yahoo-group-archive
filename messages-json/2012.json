Try going to the main PTSP page at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/sml/gecco/PTSPComp.html\n&gt; \n&gt; There you will see a link to the &#39;Final League Table&#39; which is a \n&gt; snapshot from the closing date, and the &#39;Map-30-g5&#39; link a bit \nfurther \n&gt; down is the ongoing league table that contains my latest \nsubmissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW an overnight run has slightly improved my best solution to 889 \n&gt; timesteps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n"}}
