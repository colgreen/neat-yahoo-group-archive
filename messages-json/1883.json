I might be able to swing that although my contacts there\n&gt; &gt;  tend to be graphics-researchers, not AI folk.

I tend to forget him because I hardly \never met him.  But of course you are quite right, and he has a whole group \nusing ANN&#39;s.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to the CIG conference, by the way, even though my\n&gt;own contribution might not be the most exciting stuff around it looks\n&gt;like there will be lots of interesting papers.\n\nThe ones I saw looked very good.\n\nIt was a welcome contrast, because I reviewed a couple for a graphics/games \nconference just before, and they were frankly lame.\n\nIan\n\n&gt;Julian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
