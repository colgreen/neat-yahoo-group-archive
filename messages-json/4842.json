I am\n&gt; currently working on a version of NEAT that will integrate with t=\r\nhe Neuroph\n&gt; Neural Network library in Java.\n\nInteresting idea. I must look=\r\n into that project a bit more deeply.\n\n\n&gt; I must admit I have implemented t=\r\nhe=A0first version you described and it seems\n&gt; to work quite well, when I =\r\nchanged it to the=A0second version I get some\n&gt; strange behaviour:\n\nYour fi=\r\nrst problem is that you have too many species even with\nequation (1). For a=\r\n population size of 150 you probably don&#39;t want any\nmore than 10-15 species=\r\n at most, certainly if you have a lot of\nspecies with just one member somet=\r\nhing is not quite right. It could be\nthat you just need to set the compatib=\r\nility threshold higher, what\nSharpNeat1 (SN1) and other packages do is dyna=\r\nmically adjust the\nthreshold at each generation to try and keep the number =\r\nof species\nnear some target value. In fact SN1 uses a min and max number of=\r\n\nspecies and only updates the threshold if the number is outside that\nrange=\r\n; that helps prevent the number of species oscillating up and\ndown too much=\r\n (some heating thermostats use the same approach).\n\nThe fact that you see m=\r\nore species with equation (2) is exactly what I\nwould expect. If you think =\r\nabout two genomes both with many genes but\nthat are all different, so there=\r\n are no matching genes. (2) says that\nthe distance between them increases w=\r\nith the number of mismatched\ngenes. (1) on the other hand scales the distan=\r\nce to the range 0-1, so\nslightly dissimilar genomes are about as distance f=\r\nrom each other as\nwildly different genomes.\n\nWhen you switch from (1) to (2=\r\n) the chances are that distance between\ngenomes is very much higher and the=\r\nrefore you need a higher\ncompatibility threshold, otherwise all of the geno=\r\nmes are deemed to be\nincompatible with other and thus placed into separate =\r\nspecies.\n\nIf you start to consider matching genes then thinsg get worse. Th=\r\neir\ndistance isn&#39;t scaled adn so it can greatly exceed 1. Therefore\nmatchin=\r\ng topologies with many matchign genes and thsu weight\ndifferences can be de=\r\nemed to be further apart than two genoems with\ncompletely different topolog=\r\nies.\n\nSo personally I would say that (2) is the better equation and I would=\r\n\nsuggest that you switch over to (2) and then try and tackle the\nproblem of=\r\n too many species from there.\n\n\n\n&gt; How would this specie saturation affect =\r\nthe performance of NEAT? If we have\n&gt; a fixed population size, and after 14=\r\n0 generations every population member\n&gt; is in a specie all on it&#39;s own what=\r\n affect will this have on the results of\n&gt; the remaining 360 generations? I=\r\nf we use an elitist strategy (which I keep\n&gt; the best organism in each spec=\r\nie, and throw the rest away) then we won&#39;t be\n&gt; able to get any further tha=\r\nt the results from the 140th generation?\n\nExactly. Another problem would be=\r\n that we can&#39;t produce offspring by\ncombining two parent from the species. =\r\nWe have to use asexual\nreproduction 100% of the time or select a parent fro=\r\nm another species\n- which is less likely to produce fit offspring. There ar=\r\ne probly\nother issues as well.\n\n\n\n&gt; I am currently working with a similarit=\r\ny metric for the speciation based on\n&gt; behaviour. Instead of using the &quot;beh=\r\naviour&quot; instead of the fitness score\n&gt; like the novelty search, or using a =\r\nMOEA of the fitness and novelty I\n&gt; thought it would be interesting to try =\r\nand speciate based on the behaviour\n&gt; and see how well that compares with n=\r\novelty search and the MOEA approach of\n&gt; fitness and novelty. I will provid=\r\ne some updates as I get further into my\n&gt; work.\n\nNice idea. What do you do?=\r\n Perhaps keep an array of network outputs\nand compare them?\n\n\n\n&gt; This is my=\r\n first post to the group -=A0I did go back and read your other posts\n&gt; abou=\r\nt the compatability metric from the archive, and a quick search didn&#39;t\n&gt; sh=\r\now up anyone else seeing this behaviour. However I do apologise if I have\n&gt;=\r\n reposted something someone has already said.\n\nNo worries. BTW I do have a =\r\nworking version of NEAT usign k-means\nclustering which is my attempt at imp=\r\nroving speciation, particularly\nthe problem of too many or too ferw species=\r\n and how best to\ndynamically adjust the compatibility threshold. I was inte=\r\nnding to\ncleanup the code a bit more and write some explanations before\nrel=\r\neasing it but I don&#39;t mind dropping a zip file somewhere if you or\nanyone e=\r\nlse wants to take a look now.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
