Excellent.\n\n&gt; I did however get into a bit of a mess =\r\ninitially because I assumed the\n&gt; code would go straight into a trunk dir -=\r\n which it didn&#39;t - so I had\n&gt; to then create one and move the code a couple=\r\n of times. So now there\n&gt; is a load of history associated with the freshly =\r\nuploaded files. \n\nHappens to us all first time setting up... its not a prob=\r\nlem :).  \n\n&gt; &gt; http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/ &quot;AnkhSVN: A Subversion addin for\n=\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio .NET&quot;.\n&gt; Thanks I just installed it. The only niggl=\r\ne I&#39;ve got is that the diff\n&gt; command seems to do an actual diff as in crea=\r\nting a patch file -\n&gt; rather than the nice side by side comparison view in =\r\nEclipse \n\nA niggle you can scratch.. just set the AnkhSVN config file to us=\r\ne a\nthird party diff tool:\nhttp://www.nabble.com/External-Diff-td5358541.ht=\r\nml#a5359335\n(http://www.google.com/search?q=3Dankhsvn+external+diff+tool)\n\n=\r\ntortoisesvn.tigris.org has a great diff/merge tool, or you also have\nthe mo=\r\nre specialised winmerge.org which is better in situations when\ndiffing/merg=\r\ning something very complex, but you will probably want\ntortoise svn install=\r\ned anyway since it very convenient sometimes to\nwork with SVN from within f=\r\nile explorer.  \n\n\n\n"}}
