An difference at or beyond 1 gets the maximum\n&gt;possible error.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Some test cases, say you have two test images and for a particular\n&gt;output you are expecting the values -0.8 and 0.8.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is the error for different output values:\n&gt;\n&gt;o = -0.8, error = 0+1 = 1\n&gt;o = 0, error = 0.935 + 0.935 = 1.87\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So now you value getting one of the test cases correct and one wrong,\n&gt;over getting them both halfway right.\n&gt;\n&gt;Some variation on this might work. Not that you might want to tweak the\n&gt;equation slightly - if I had used 0.5 instead of 0.8 in the example then\n&gt;your problem re-appears, so you might want the function to max out earlier.\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure the reasoning here is exactly right.  The reason being, that \nit is not the shape of the error-curve leading the system into a false \nminimum -- after all, with the current system the networks could already \nscore better by giving two different, partially correct answers, instead of \nalways saying zero (e.g. -.4 and +.4 would give a total error of 0.8 \ninstead of 1.6).\n\nBut I don&#39;t feel any clearer analysis coming on as yet :)\n\n--\n\nOn a related note...\n\nUsually, errors are squared before totalling them.\n\nSUM((o - e) ^ 2)\n\nThis is for several reasons:\n\n1) simplifies statistics, &quot;abs&quot; is an algebra nightmare\n2) tradition\n3) treats the sum of the errors as a single Pythagoran distance across a \nhyper-space.  e.g. if each test-case&#39;s error is plotted on a different \naxis, then the sum or the squared errors is the square of the overall \ndiagonal distance.  This is kinda reassuring that the experiments do not \ninterfere with one another (being on their own axis) but only in a vague \nhand-waving sort of way.\n4) larger errors are considered higher priorities than small ones.  This \ncould be a problem with your experiment.  Without the squared term, every \nerror has an equal weighting, irrespective of its size.  In the long term \nthis would not be a problem, but if we suppose that the system has to start \nwith a change that improves some tests at the expense of others, then if \neverything has the same weighting, maybe that first step does not look like \nan improvement...\n\n[[Optionally, you can take the average and square-root as well.  This does \nnot alter any rankings, but it allows comparisons between experiments with \ndifferent sample sizes:\n\n         Sqrt(SUM((o - e) ^ 2) / N)\n\n   This is the root mean squared (RMS) error and is the most &quot;normal&quot; error \nmeasure...\n]]\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
