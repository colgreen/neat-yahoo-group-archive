I have been traveling a lot recently and am\nfinally able to catch up on emails.\n\nIn my GECCO 2009 paper that Ken mentioned, I also represented the same\nproblem (evolving gaits for simulated quadrupeds) in one, two and three\ndimensions. \n\nThe approach I took may give you some ideas for representing your problem in\nthree or more dimensions.\n\nI found that a 3D representation did not beat a 2D one (although both the 3D\nand 2D representation statistically beat the 1D one by the end of the run).\nSo you may not find any performance improvements by adding dimensions (as\nopposed to representing different kinds of inputs within a lower\ndimensionality). However, I did not try putting different *types* of input\ninformation in different dimensions.\n \nI would be interested to hear your experience with representing your problem\nin 3(+)D, especially if you are able to compare it to alternate\nrepresentations (e.g. 2D) or setups (e.g. the r(x) idea).\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 29 Jun 2009 19:31:16 -0700\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] GECCO 2008 Multiagent Paper Question\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am working on a project that needs a substrate of more than 2\n&gt; dimensions. Looking at David and Ken&#39;s GECCO&#39;08 paper, I would have\n&gt; expected a 3d substrate for the heterogeneous agent experiment. Is there\n&gt; some insight I&#39;m missing behind using the special r(x) function rather\n&gt; than making a 3rd dimension?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n\n\n\n"}}
