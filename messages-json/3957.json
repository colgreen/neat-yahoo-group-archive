The program is also\n&gt;  using alpha-beta and the like. I&#39;ll bet a rather poor position evaluator\n&gt;  plus Alpha-Beta with a decent amount of lookahead could beat me at\n&gt; checkers, even if I was better at evaluating board positions on average.\n\nGood point, Jeff. This was one of my big problems with Blondie24\n(although to the author&#39;s credit, he did address the issue, along with\nmany other objections). The question is the amount of work being done\nby the ANN vs. the brute-force approach of tree search. The Blondie24\nnetwork did better than a crude board estimation such as simply\ncounting the number of opponent and friendly pieces on the board, but\nnot a whole lot better.\n\nOn a related note, I just saw today that the Go program MoGo beat a\n5th Dan Go professional in 9x9 play:\n\nhttp://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/2278450.html\n\nMoGo uses Monte Carlo methods, which from what I understand is a\nvariant of brute-force search, which I don&#39;t think sheds much light on\nhow humans solve such problems and won&#39;t scale or generalize very\nwell.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
