Their\n&gt; complete paper list is here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://helen.cs-i.brandeis.edu/papers/\n&gt; \n&gt; But the stuff on Pareto coevolution can give you a lot of insight\n&gt; into what coevolution is really trying to do and what it needs to do\n&gt; it.\n\nThanks, Ken.  I&#39;ve looked at a bit of the Pareto Coevolution stuff,\nand we&#39;ve discussed it a bit on the list...a long while back, I think.\n But from what I understand, current methods of pareto coevolution are\nvery computationally expensive, and are intractable in all but trivial\ndomains.  But I get you&#39;re point about looking into the research to\nunderstand coevolutionary concepts.\n\nAlong these lines, I like the idea of &quot;speciated sampling&quot;, though I\ndon&#39;t think you gave it a name.  You used this technique in the JAIR\npaper, correct?  Sampling evenly from species, rather than randomly\nfrom the population as a whole?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
