But there&#39;s\nno=\r\n support for that yet and I don&#39;t see any reason that the same concepts\nwou=\r\nldn&#39;t be applied to C# or the other languages when/if they show up.

Has the potential for exposing vast computing resources for\nrelatively =\r\nlittle coin.  Of course, at this point, if you were going to\ndevelop someth=\r\ning for Azure (or something similar), there are better\nlanguages than F# (p=\r\nrobably C# for Azure and java for just about anything\nelse - amazon EC2, ha=\r\ndoop, etc).\n\n- Jeff\n\n\nOn Sun, Nov 22, 2009 at 5:19 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...=\r\nxas.edu&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff, I&#39;m not familiar enough with F# to judge w=\r\nhether it is well-suited\n&gt; for NEAT or not.
