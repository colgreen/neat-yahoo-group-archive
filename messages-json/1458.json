What have you done to deal with this problem?  Did\n&gt; &gt; you just tweak stuff until you got good results?  Or have you analyzed the\n&gt; &gt; problem and determined an optimal solution?\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, if the problem really is as you&#39;ve conceptualized it, that you\n&gt;want to mutate a topology, then only perturb weights before adding new\n&gt;topology, you could implement something similar to Colin&#39;s phased\n&gt;approach.  Only instead of alternating phases of adding and\n&gt;subtracting topology, you could have alternating phases of adding\n&gt;topology and mutating weights only.\n&gt;\n&gt;Otherwise, yeah, it sounds like it&#39;s just a matter of experimenting\n&gt;and tweaking to find the appropriate mutation rate.\n\nHow about always adding new topology with its weight(s) set to zero (and \nnot turning off the connection it replaces).\n\nThat way the addition of new topology is always a minor disruption and the \ntopology then hangs around and can have weight-increasing mutations tried \non many occasions to give it the chance to become relevent.\n\nOh, and from the point of view of culling, any connection which has not \nmanaged to get its weight increased to more than 1% of the other weights on \nits node after (say) 500 generations is a candidate for culling.\n\nAs is any node whose total contribution to down-stream nodes remains \nsimilarly minute.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
