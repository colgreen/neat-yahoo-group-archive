Or has anyone else seen this approach to\n&gt;board analysis/game play?\n\nI seem to remember a mention of something like this in terms of\nshape-recognition (albeit simpler) in a SANE paper, but I can&#39;t remember\nwhich one. As for game play, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone trying it, but it\ncertainly sounds like an interesting idea, especially applied to Go. Clearly\nit would make the network more easily able to recognise localised patterns.\n\n&gt;Did you toy around with any of these ideas before\n&gt;settling on your approach?\n\nI didn&#39;t think of zooming, but the vector idea was roughly similar to the\ncontinuous-space variant I tried, where the network outputs the distance it\nwants to travel horizontally and vertically, rather than just taking &gt;.5 to\nmean a boolean output. What I mean is this:-\n\nX1=output 1 (&quot;left&quot;)\nX2=output 2 (&quot;right&quot;)\nY1=output 1 (&quot;up&quot;)\nY2=output 2 (&quot;down&quot;)\n\nnew X coord=old X coord+X2-X1\nnew Y coord=old Y coord+Y2-Y1\n\nNow, in your case you&#39;d probably want to scale the outputs up a bit so it\nwould move in larger jumps more easily.\n\nI should say this variant didn&#39;t do nearly as well as the discrete grid in\nthe tests (see below).\n\n&gt;Hmm...and what was their success rate in guessing the\n&gt;correct shape (I&#39;m assuming they eventually evolved to\n&gt;guess better than chance).\n\n100% after 1590 generations.\n\nThe continuous-space variant, on my best run, 93% after 2890 generations. At\nthat point, evolution had seemed to stagnate a bit.\n\n&gt;There&#39;s actually a &quot;Files&quot;\n&gt;section on the Yahoo Groups page.\n\nOK, I&#39;ll look into that a little later today.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
