As I mentioned, we have run novelty search\n&gt; in these mazes where the behavior is around 400 dimensions, which come\n&gt; from (x,y) on each timestep.  \n\nWhile this is encouraging, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve actually tested &quot;full&quot;\ndimensions. If it requires 100.000 tests to solve a maze with a size of\nNxN pixels, a maze of NxNxN voxels should require (sqrt(100.000))^3=31.6\nmillion tests, simply because you now have a vastly larger space to\nsearch. Add another dimension to that and you&#39;re cozying up to 10 billion\ntests. \n\nThe fact that storing every visited x,y over 400 timesteps does&#39;t require\nmany more tests indicates that the path space for NEAT is fairly uniform\nin these tests, though it certainly could have exploded, it didn&#39;t.\nProbably for the reasons you suggest of complexification, try a sligthly\ndifferent path and you end up somewhere else, filling up the search space\nof possible ending positions pretty fast.\n\nThis wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t happen in a volume (for lack of a better word)\nwith many more dimensions. \n\n&gt; Thus the space of possible trajectories is astronomical.  Yet even so,\n&gt; with that type of characterization, there was no performance hit (in\n&gt; experiments not yet published).  What do you think that implies?  Do\n&gt; you really feel that one astronomical space is more expensive than\n&gt; another?  For example, we might have a 3 dimensional maze with a\n&gt; similar number of timesteps, but that would simply increase the\n&gt; dimensionality of behavior from 400 to 1200.  Those are still both\n&gt; extremely high dimensional characterizations.  If moving from 2\n&gt; dimensions to 400 doesn&#39;t hurt, why would moving from 400 to 1200?  \n\nI do think that the two spaces are uncomparable. I&#39;ve tried to speculate\non why, but I think that your explanation ultimately is the correct one,\nit&#39;s related to complexification. But adding another true dimension\nincreases the problem search space by a great factor.\n\n&gt; However, we are talking about comparing already-characterized\n&gt; behaviors, so the &quot;n&quot; in O(n^2) is not the same &quot;N&quot; that is in the\n&gt; O(N) for number of evaluations.  \n\nNo, N grows steadily and at one point the test of whether the solution is\ntruly novel will take longer than the actual test itself. granted, you&#39;d\nbe in the range of hundreds of millions of tests before that happens, but\nbeyond that point, progress will steadily decrease. Actually, it steadily\ndecreases from the first novelty inovation, but too slowly to be noticable.\n\n&gt; Comparing two strings is not as expensive as evaluating \n&gt; an individual.  \n\nTwo strings, no, comparing 1 string to N strings will become expensive for\nvery large N.\n\nO(N^2) looks good for small N. Then, suddenly; whammo! Simplest method,\nusing a bucket hash method with K buckets, you reduce the problem from\nO(N^2) to O((N/K)^2), which is still O(N^2). So for large N, you&#39;re still\nstuck. That&#39;s for very large searches though.\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
