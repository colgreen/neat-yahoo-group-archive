I think I&#39;ve found the problem.\n\nBy random chance I had a run of the full 7 outputs find a solution.  \nWhen examining it, compared to all the failed attempts, and also \nlooking at the differences in the 1 output solutions that worked or \ndidn&#39;t, it turns out that this problem apparently requires the BIAS \nnode.\n\nIn all the failed runs, the BIAS node was apparently evolved out of \nconsideration before it could prove its worth.  And because JNEAT \n(out of the box) eliminates any unused nodes during crossover \noperations, the apparent local optimum was a permanently stuck \nsituation.  Without the BIAS node there is no possible solution.\n\nLuckily I remembered reading something in the FAQ in the \nsection: &quot;Can I start NEAT with some inputs disconnected? (IMPORTANT)&quot;\nthat tells how to overcome the node elimination problem.  When I \nimplemented this sugestion, all new runs quickly got past the \nformer &quot;permanent&quot; local optimum.\n\nIt still takes a long time to actually evolve a winner each run, but \nI now have confidence that it probably will find a solution given \nenough time.\n\nKarl\n\nBTW, Ken I had experimented with the fitness function as you suggest \nin an attempt to get past the problem, but, apparently without the \nBIAS node, nothing worked.\n\nNow to deal with the excessive complexity/bloat that some runs seem \nto produce... :)\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Karl,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to follow on a bit on what Colin said.  I agree Colin&#39;s \n&gt; method might help but I want to just point out what might be going \n&gt; on.  You seem to have run into a classic local optimum.  It&#39;s \n&gt; probably a situation where it&#39;s very easy to get some of the \n&gt; classifications right using some rough heuristic which is found \n&gt; early on, but then to get any of the other classifications right \n&gt; requires *sacrificing* the naive function that was found first, \n&gt; which is almost never going to happen since it means dropping in \n&gt; fitness for a while.  The presence of species should help with this \n&gt; problem but the basin around the initial poor solution may be so \n&gt; large that it&#39;s virtually inevitable to get pulled in.\n&gt; \n&gt; This kind of thing seems to happen more in classification problems \n&gt; than control problems (just based on my observations, not \n&gt; experimental backup).  I&#39;d try Colin&#39;s suggestions but if that \n&gt; doesn&#39;t work then probably the fitness function needs some tuning,\n&gt; perhaps extreme ad hoc tuning based on what you know is happening.  \n&gt; In other words, which examples does it tend to get right when its \n&gt; stuck?  Maybe you can do something to avoid awarding that situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;blackkm7&quot; &lt;karl.black@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Colin,\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the write-up... interesting ideas!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you know if anyone has added &quot;phasing&quot; or de-complexification \n&gt; &gt; mutation code to JNEAT? and is it available?  I&#39;d like to try it \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; the digital output experiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Karl\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Karl,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your diagram looks OK here BTW :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem domain you describe is very similar to the Simple-\n&gt; OCR \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment in SharpNEAT, which just happens to be the \nexperiment \n&gt; &gt; used in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my recent phased search write-up. I also observed poor results, \n&gt; &gt; although \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the OCR domain has a lot more input and output nodes than your \n&gt; &gt; digital \n&gt; &gt; &gt; display domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I raised a number of issues in the write-up which I \n&gt; can&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do justice here so I would recommend you have a read and see \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think. From my experiments with Simple-OCR and knowing that \nyour \n&gt; &gt; digital \n&gt; &gt; &gt; display domain problem has far fewer inputs and ouptuts, I am \n&gt; &gt; fairly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; confident that this could be solved in SharpNEAT in it&#39;s \ncurrent \n&gt; &gt; state. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am willing to implement it and make another release if there \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doubters :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh the URL for the write-up is \n&gt; &gt; www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/phasedsearch.htm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
