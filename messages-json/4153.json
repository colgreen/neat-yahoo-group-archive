I flagged it as something to\nbe thought about and replied to, and then it scrolled off my screen into\nemail purgatory. \n\nI do think that HyperNEAT can exploit non-geometric regularities to a\nproblem. Imagine a medical diagnostic classification problem such as\ndeclaring the risk of heart attack. Your inputs are variables that do not\nhave any geometry to them (weight, age, number of years smoked, presence of\ngene x, etc). Imagine further that these variables could be grouped into\ngroup A and B. \n\nGroup A needs to be put through the following complex\nfunction/transformation: 1-2-3-4-5  (each number could represent a node+link\nthat performs a mathematical operation).\n\nGroup B needs to be put through 6-2-3-4-7.\n\nA direct encoding would have to independently create the 2-3-4 module each\ntime it needs to be used (twice in this example). HyperNEAT, by virtue of\nbeing a generative/indirect encoding, only has to create it once and can use\nit many times. \n\nOne could, of course, envision that there are 100 groups that each need the\n2-3-4 module, at which point the benefit of the generative encoding becomes\nmore obvious.\n\nDo you (and others) agree that this is an example of HyperNEAT outperforming\nneat because it exploits a regularity of the problem that is non-geometric?\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 19 May 2008 04:17:26 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HyperNEAT Outputs for Stock Trading\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you feed into the CPNN if not geometric information?  The CPNN\n&gt; is used to exploit the geometric information in HyperNeat, but if this\n&gt; is not relevant to a domain, such as stock trading, how do you get it\n&gt; to encode the substrate in a meaningful way?\n&gt; \n&gt; Be great to further this discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There are other benefits to HyperNEAT that have nothing to do with\n&gt; geometry,\n&gt;&gt; no? It is an indirect encoding, and thus is more likely to create\n&gt; modular\n&gt;&gt; phenotypes that exhibit repetitions and symmetry (with and without\n&gt;&gt; variation).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Unless I am mistaken, these benefits can cause HyperNEAT to\n&gt; outperform NEAT\n&gt;&gt; even on problems where geometry is not being exploited.

Unless you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; believe there is some geometric regularities in those time series\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no point to use HyperNEAT. Try regular NEAT first.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My goal is to evolve a stock trader.  The inputs are various\n&gt;&gt;&gt; technical\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indicators, but I like the output to indicate five states--Buy/Sell\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (going long), Short/Cover (going short), and do nothing.  Ideally,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each signal would be a 1 or 0 (all zeros indicates to do nothing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (i.e.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep current position - long, short, or out).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Is this best framed as a classification problem (now is a good\n&gt;&gt;&gt; time\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to buy, sell, short, cover), or would some type of 0-1 analog output\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be best (meaning buy when buy is &gt; sell by 0.2 or something)?  How\n&gt;&gt;&gt; do\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you force a binary output in the software anyway?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Should I try to predict the percentage change (up or down) over\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next n time periods, and then only buy or sell when there is say a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3%\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change from now?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. when recurrence evolves in NEAT, does it look back only 1 time\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; period, or can it evolve longer lookbacks?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --Thanks, Todd\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
