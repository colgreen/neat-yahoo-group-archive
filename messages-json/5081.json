However,\n&gt; there is research that looks at the issue in more rigorous detail.  For\n&gt; example, Shimon Whiteson&#39;s paper, &quot;Critical factors in the empirical\n&gt; performance of temporal difference and evolutionary methods for reinforcement\n&gt; learning,&quot; is an excellent study of the effect of nondeterminism and other\n&gt; factors on NEAT and SARSA (a value-function-based reinforcement learning\n&gt; algorithm):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://staff.science.uva.nl/~whiteson/pubs/whitesonjaamas09.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; In particular look at figures 9 and 15.  In figure 9, NEAT rises to a fitness\n&gt; of 14 seconds hold time in the traditional nondeterministic Keepaway soccer\n&gt; task.  This figure is actually good, and does better than SARSA at 12.\n&gt; \n&gt; But in figure 15, in a deterministic version of the task, NEAT rises to an\n&gt; amazing 200 seconds of hold time!  SARSA on the other hand only rises to about\n&gt; 25 seconds.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I think we have to be careful with analyzing the &quot;problem&quot; of\n&gt; nondeterminism.  In fact, NEAT is still working relatively well with it, when\n&gt; compared to other (non-evolutionary) algorithms.  Yet when the nondeterminism\n&gt; is taken away, NEAT is unstoppable, as if it were unleashed.  The story is\n&gt; more that determinism is a powerful grease on the wheels of evolution, rather\n&gt; than that nondeterminism is cataclysmic.  (It is also important to note that\n&gt; the genome that achieves 200 seconds may not be better in general than the one\n&gt; that achieves 14 - I don&#39;t think Shimon tested both of them in a\n&gt; nondeterministic scenario to find out.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I don&#39;t think natural evolution handles noise any better.  Great\n&gt; people constantly die young, which of course is absolutely deplorable and can\n&gt; hardly be &quot;good&quot; for evolution, unless one takes the circular view that\n&gt; anything natural evolution does is what it&#39;s supposed to do.  (That is, if\n&gt; someone died, that must be good because they weren&#39;t fit enough.)  I think a\n&gt; more reasonable interpretation is that natural evolution succeeded despite\n&gt; being handicapped by noise rather than because it handles it in some elusive\n&gt; way.  If we could give everyone in nature a fair shake, the whole thing would\n&gt; probably go a lot faster and smoother.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would guess that this phenomenon is very general.  The more noise, the more\n&gt; chaotic evolution becomes.  Of course, there are happy mediums.  Sometimes a\n&gt; little noise can help achieve generality at the cost of many evaluations.  Yet\n&gt; if it can be avoided somehow by being more clever about being deterministic\n&gt; then it should.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do view it as a research challenge.  I am not a big fan of noise because of\n&gt; its deleterious effects and indeed &quot;deterministic noise&quot; is often better, but\n&gt; I believe there may be even better ways to get the generality you want without\n&gt; the cost of noise, and I consider it an interesting research question.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks for your thoughts on this Ken.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a shame that non-deterministic fitness has such an adverse effect here,\n&gt;&gt; given that many real problems are noisy, and that natural evolution handles\n&gt;&gt; a ton of noise.

In a stagnant situation, you do not have information (i.e. a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gradient) suggesting which direction is right to go.  Therefore, the most\n&gt;&gt;&gt; principled response is to expand your options while never putting all your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; eggs in one basket.  When fitness is stagnant, we cannot know if further\n&gt;&gt;&gt; search within the currently dimensionality might eventually find a solution,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; or if the current dimensionality is insufficient and contains no solution at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; all.  In the latter case, the number of nodes and connections would need to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ascend to higher dimensionality.  Because we do not know which case we are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; when stagnation occurs, the best idea is to try both:  Some species start\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arriving with bigger networks while others keep searching in the same old\n&gt;&gt;&gt; spaces.  Thus, we would expect the *range* of sizes to increase along with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; average size.  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Your situation with nondeterminism is probably somewhat similar, causing the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; average size of solutions to go up because of stagnation.  However, because\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the champion will keep changing with the randomized evaluation, you will\n&gt;&gt;&gt; observe this phenomenon in the champion itself.  The more noisy it is, the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; more it is probably observable (i.e. because the more &quot;random&quot; it is who\n&gt;&gt;&gt; happens to look best at any given time, in effect leading to a kind of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sampling of the population through the champion).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, that may not be a complete explanation for the steep angle of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; incline.  I would guess that nondeterminism is also causing a general\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unhealthiness about the evolutionary process overall. Nondeterminism is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; highly\n&gt;&gt;&gt; destructive to evolutionary algorithms.  This issue is controversial (even\n&gt;&gt;&gt; within my own group!) but my personal opinion is one should avoid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nondeterminism unless it is absolutely essential.  For example, you can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; choose\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a random order of examples but then subject everyone to the same random set\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a kind of &quot;deterministic randomness.&quot;  Of course, you are banking on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; impartiality of randomness to give you maximal generality, but it will often\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be outweighed by its unhealthy side effects on the population.  So I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt;&gt; guessing that part of the phenomenon is just a side-effect of an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; inconsistent\n&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluation scheme leading to relative chaos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; There may also be more to it; it merits further investigation as well.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello Ken-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am plotting the number of CPPN nodes in the generation champion.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This fitness function is not deterministic (here I am running the bit\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mirroring problem, and I randomly generate 10 different sets of inputs per\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; organism per generation).

If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the same champion stick around\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new individuals occasionally come\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the same fitness as the champion, but it would be very surprising if\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is happening on every single generation.  Yet that would seem to be the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility with the number of champion nodes going up so rapidly even\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fitness is flatlined.  So what is going on during the fitness plateau?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes exactly are being measured to get the node counts?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently that the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; number\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of time\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; added\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second figure where the CPPN\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; node\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing environment and those runs\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One problem is that it makes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; populations with 200-node genomes is really slow.
