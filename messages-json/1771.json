If you \n&gt;use absolute sensors and outputs, e.g. &quot;look north, south, east, \n&gt;west&quot; and &quot;move north, south, east, or west,&quot; then there is a need \n&gt;to rediscover the same principle more than once: if something is \n&gt;perceived in a certain direction then move in that direction.  \n&gt;Because this principle would need to be discovered for each \n&gt;available direction, there is more room for failure or subtle flaws \n&gt;in at least one of the directions.\n&gt;\n&gt;On the other hand, if you use relative (i.e. egocentric) \n&gt;representations, principles generally only need be discovered once.  \n&gt;For example, if something is in front of you, then move towards it.  \n&gt;Otherwise, if something is at angle from your front (notice- \n&gt;relative), then turn until you point towards it.  These principles \n&gt;apply in any position, and therefore are likely to end up more \n&gt;accurate overall.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFollowing on from this it occurs to me that domains such as prey capture \naren&#39;t all that different to the roving eye type domains, that is we \nhave a grid &#39;world&#39; and an agent that moves over the grid, receives \ninput from it and uses those inputs to make motor output decisions. The \nmain difference being that in prey capture I&#39;m using sector based \ninputs, and roving eyes generally use raster based inputs.\n\nAs I recall Derek and Philip&#39;s image recognition work uses an egocentric \neye and this makes sense to me since the same pattern in different \nrotations only needs to be learned once, which then leads me to ask if \nan egocentric eye was used, or has been tried at playing Go. I don&#39;t \nthink the eye in your paper used rotation did it Ken? Not to mention the \nzooming function which may or may not be useful depending on the type of \nboard game.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
