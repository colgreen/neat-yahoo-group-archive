That is, these &quot;walkers&quot; are really just\nfloating in mid-ai=\r\nr, and if you actually placed them on the ground\nwith gravity, they would p=\r\nrobably not balance?  Similarly, the\nswimmers may or may not swim in the fr=\r\niction of water?  In other words\nyou are discovering the aesthetic look of =\r\nvarious activities but not\nnecessarily the mechanical nuances?\n\nAssuming I =\r\nam understanding that correctly, there is still a puzzle to\nget them to go =\r\nstraight to walking on hard ground through novelty\nsearch.   But I think yo=\r\nu&#39;re oscillation-detection novelty\ncharacterization is quite clever and is =\r\nprogress in that direction.\nVery interesting work overall! \n\nken\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi=\r\n Jeff, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am glad that you like my program and enjoy it! :) \n&gt; \n&gt; I kn=\r\now it would be cool to browse the archive, or have an external \n&gt; routine t=\r\nhat queries the archive by different criteria to show me \n&gt; what was achiev=\r\ned during the run, but this program now is actually a \n&gt; stepping stone for=\r\n another research project I have, evolving leaky-\n&gt; integrator substrates b=\r\ny HyperNEAT combined with evolving the \n&gt; substrate itself, all used in one=\r\n Alife simulation of mass-spring \n&gt; creatures, sensing collision and reacti=\r\nng by contracting the springs. \n&gt; And all this with Novelty Search searchin=\r\ng for new and new behaviors. \n&gt; I believe that this is a pretty serious tes=\r\nt of how far complexity \n&gt; can go in such open-ended domain. I can later mi=\r\nx it with fitness \n&gt; search once a good population has evolved, on objectiv=\r\nes \n&gt; like &quot;swimming&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me mention about one interesting experimen=\r\nt I made with the NS \n&gt; NEVH. I restricted the substrate connectivity so th=\r\nat output-&gt;output \n&gt; connections are not queried. Then I made the environme=\r\nnt to 0 gravity \n&gt; and removed the ground plane. The behavior characterizat=\r\nion was \n&gt; changed like this. The behavior data is a vector of 15 doubles \n=\r\n&gt; representing the outputs. Each time an output oscillates (going to \n&gt; +tr=\r\neshold and then -treshold, or vice versa), its corresponding place \n&gt; in th=\r\ne vector is incremented. \n&gt; So the vector is actually counting how many osc=\r\nillations the outputs \n&gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate oscillating w=\r\nith high frequency \n&gt; is very far in the behavior space. Different outputs =\r\noscillating are \n&gt; counted too. The behavior distance metric is the eucledi=\r\nan distance \n&gt; between these 15-D vectors. \n&gt; \n&gt; So novelty search now has =\r\nto find new ways to oscillate the entire \n&gt; body, to do repeating movements=\r\n. In all the runs, Novelty Search with \n&gt; HyperNEAT finds walking gaits 100=\r\n% of the time, in the first 1000 \n&gt; evaluations. There are also swimming ga=\r\nits and all kind of stuff (I \n&gt; saw one individual actually dancing :)) \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; So what was stopping it from walking before, is the gravity. Keeping \n&gt; =\r\nbalance on one leg and trying to walk at the same time turns out to \n&gt; be v=\r\nery hard task. One environmental constraint that would be useful \n&gt; to make=\r\n it walk is, when only one foot has stepped on the ground, \n&gt; stick that fo=\r\not to the ground. So the chance the humanoid to fall is \n&gt; minimized. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n As for the novelty search stagnation, where getting new behaviors \n&gt; becom=\r\nes hard, the population begins to do something like a random \n&gt; probing any=\r\nthing that is not the same stuff. Then it begins to rely \n&gt; entirely on mut=\r\nation to get out somehow. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jef=\r\nf Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I finally borrowed a windows machine from =\r\nsomeone and looked at \n&gt; this. It&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; really fun to watch! I am leaving i=\r\nt running overnight to see what \n&gt; happens.\n&gt; &gt; So far the best I have seen=\r\n has been about a five mini-step shuffle\n&gt; &gt; backwards...although I have se=\r\nen a few three mini-step forward \n&gt; shuffles.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you post either =\r\nthe genome and or a movie of the best org \n&gt; you&#39;ve seen so\n&gt; &gt; far? \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I second the notion that it would be cool to browse the archive, \n&gt; esp=\r\necially\n&gt; &gt; if you could choose archive members to view based on max distan=\r\nce \n&gt; from 0,0\n&gt; &gt; or something like that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It might help you to vi=\r\nsualize things if you added another viewing \n&gt; mode that\n&gt; &gt; put a dot in t=\r\nhe 3D viewer for every x,y,z coordinate in the \n&gt; archive (one\n&gt; &gt; color) a=\r\nnd in the current population (another color).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Watching this also m=\r\nakes me wonder about the population losing its \n&gt; gradient\n&gt; &gt; and disengag=\r\ning. Here is the potential concern (and I think mattias \n&gt; and ken\n&gt; &gt; disc=\r\nussed this already): Once all the easy to access points are \n&gt; found, if\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; most of the orgs are not getting somewhere new, they will all have \n&gt; equ=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; fitnesses and the search will not be focused on the outside edge. \n&gt;=\r\n Do you\n&gt; &gt; think this is happening (and might this be why David mentioned =\r\nthat \n&gt; he saw a\n&gt; &gt; lot of repeats toward the end)? The visualization I ju=\r\nst proposed \n&gt; might help\n&gt; &gt; on this front. Do the points added in the arc=\r\nhive tend to be \n&gt; further and\n&gt; &gt; further away from 0,0....or is it just f=\r\nilling in the spaces in the \n&gt; nearby\n&gt; &gt; vicinity? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Despite these=\r\n concerns/suggestions, it is very fun stuff to look \n&gt; at...and\n&gt; &gt; its exc=\r\niting that you are hybridizing these ideas so quickly and \n&gt; testing\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nem. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Digital Evolution Lab, M=\r\nichigan State University\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: D=\r\navid D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:46:57 -0000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New file=\r\n uploaded to neat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I though=\r\nt it would be awhile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combi=\r\nned.

The behavioral=\r\n diversity was really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby st=\r\neps and guys that \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them did &quot;=\r\nthe chair&quot;), although \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were still a good number of repeats, e=\r\nspecially near the end \n&gt; (falling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty co=\r\nmmon).
