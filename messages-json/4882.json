While thi=\r\ns is what makes indirect encodings so powerful, the drawback is that it is =\r\nhard to make a population drift in a particular gradient along the fitness =\r\nlandscape. In practice, I&#39;ve noticed that adding recurrence magnifies this =\r\nproblem without providing much benefit in terms of overall fitness.\n\nJason =\r\nG.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n2009/11/3 Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Colin, it is probably not a critical d=\r\necision whether CPPNs are recurrent or not (at least for the purposes of Hy=\r\nperNEAT), but it\n&gt; &gt; does have implications.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. From read=\r\ning your response my instinct is to use feedforward\n&gt; as the default/baseli=\r\nne for CPPNs and to look toward recursive CPPNs\n&gt; as a research path from t=\r\nhere. The function composition aspect of\n&gt; feedforward networks is simple t=\r\no understand (again, it&#39;s like an\n&gt; expression tree with a little extra com=\r\nplexity - but not as much as a\n&gt; recursive network).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But if you r=\r\neally want to kind of understand what types of things CPPNs will output, it=\r\n&#39;s best left feedforward, because then it can\n&gt; &gt; be understood as sums and=\r\n compositions of functions, which is conceptually pure and follows the theo=\r\nry in the papers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Totally agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example. Picbreeder is str=\r\nictly feedforward, and that helps us to understand the function of internal=\r\n nodes in Picbreeder\n&gt; &gt; networks (we hope to soon make public the structur=\r\ne of CPPNs within Picbreeder, which is very educational).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Will look=\r\n forward to it. I appreciate the amount of work it takes to\n&gt; get this kind=\r\n of thing up and running.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
