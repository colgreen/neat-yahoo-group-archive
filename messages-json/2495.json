When I&#39;m\n&gt; finished, I plan to evolve neural nets to control a\n&gt; CYE robot, taking\n&gt; input from a roving eye on the (dynamic) video input\n&gt; from the robot&#39;s\n&gt; video camera, and outputting data about how to\n&gt; move/zoom the roving\n&gt; eye and how to change the robots speed and heading.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I can&#39;t decide how I will go about\n&gt; evaluating the networks&#39;\n&gt; fitnesses. I would think it would be impractical to\n&gt; actually have the\n&gt; robot run using each neural net from every\n&gt; population (and it would\n&gt; involve lots of extra code to manage automatically\n&gt; guiding the robot\n&gt; back to its charging station when its batteries run\n&gt; low).\n&gt; \n&gt; However, the robot will eventually use the champion\n&gt; network to\n&gt; actually perform a task, so the networks will need\n&gt; to learn how to\n&gt; process dynamic video data and respond accordingly.\n&gt; I can&#39;t think of a\n&gt; way to simulate this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought maybe I would run the robot manually\n&gt; through a number of\n&gt; ideal courses, recording the video, and compare\n&gt; networks&#39; responses to\n&gt; the necessary responses for those courses, but I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure that will\n&gt; work, as the responses during simulation would not\n&gt; affect the video\n&gt; data. The final net&#39;s responses will actually move\n&gt; the robot and\n&gt; therefore affect the video data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else tried anything like this, or does\n&gt; anyone have any\n&gt; ideas about how to evaluate these networks&#39;\n&gt; fitnesses?\n\nI&#39;m afraid that neuroevolution requires a computer\nsimulation of the system to be controlled by the ANN. \nIf there is any other way of doing it I would be very\ninterested in knowing about it.\n\nUsing a simulation instead of the real system allows\nyou to evaluate the fitness of thousands of candidate\nANNs.  This is required to accomplish evolution.  Of\ncourse if the simulation is not an accurate\nrepresentation of the real system, the the ANN that\ndoes a good job controlling the simulation may not do\nas well controlling the real system.\n\nMitchell Timin\n\n\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
