I know this to be a \nparticularly acute problem (at least here in the UK) because I tried \nit a few years ago and, even explaining that I hadn&#39;t published \nanything because the games industry is paranoid and _never_ publishes \nanything (this 99.5% true) I still couldn&#39;t get them to rate me.\n\n\tSO, I&#39;d quite like to publish some of my current work (when it gets \nresults that is, but the reason I mention this now is that at the \nmoment its looking very promising).  And I was wondering what people \nthought the prospects are.  I mean, do journals generally have a rule \nthat says you have to be a member of a university before they&#39;ll look \nat your work?  I&#39;m guessing not because, of course, many corporate \nR&D depts also regularly publish.  But what are the prospects for an \nunknown individual?  Would your submission get the same treatment as \nanybody&#39;s?  Or would they throw it on a &quot;possible loonies&quot; pile and \nforget about it?\n\n\tWould I need somebody in a university to &quot;front&quot; it for me -- e.g. \nlist themselves as the corresponding author and me as the co-author \nof the work?  If that&#39;s the case, I would be quite open to the idea, \nI mean it even seems reasonably honest, not really different from \nputting your laboratory head on your papers because he provided the \nenvironment in which the work happened (even if he actually \nunderstand nothing of your work -- this used to happen in \nbiochemistry, mentioning no names...).\n\n\tOpinions?\n\n\tIan\n\n\t\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
