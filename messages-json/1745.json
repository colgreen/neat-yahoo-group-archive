While it would certainly increase the number \nof generations needed \n&gt; to get something acceptable, it might also make a solution that is \nable to generalize. That \n&gt; is, it might make a solution where there isn&#39;t a pixel-feature \ncorrespondance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n\nI think that&#39;s a totally valid approach and should be looked into.  \nIt may help a lot.  We just had results today suggesting that \nlonger, more diverse training experiences lead to better \ngeneralization, which suggests that the more varied the examples, \nthe better it generalizes.  That in turn suggests that adding some \nnoise might help.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
