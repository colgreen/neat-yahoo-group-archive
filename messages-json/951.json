There is alot of really good research going on at this\n&gt; school, and since about 2/3rds of the course is research based there are\n&gt; alot of good opportunities for advisors.\n&gt; \n&gt; The course website is here:\n&gt; http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/msc-nc/\n\nThanks for the link.  It does sound like what I&#39;m looking for...though\nI was hoping to find a PhD program to enter directly, though that may\nnot be realistic.  It&#39;s nice that the program is compacted into a\nyear, though I&#39;d guess it&#39;s pretty intensive.\n\nIt sounds a bit like the program at the Univ. of Sussex, which I did\nrun across in my search:\n\nhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/1-3-2-2-7-1-2.html\n\nHave you (or anyone) heard anything about that program?\n\n&gt; Additionally, it only takes 1 year for a master&#39;s degree over here - which\n&gt; is a good thing because it does tend to be rather expensive in the UK. The\n&gt; course was designed to identify good researchers, with a strong push to\n&gt; continue on with a PhD. However, there are far fewer funding options for\n&gt; americans over here, which is why I&#39;m most likely not going to be able to\n&gt; continue on here after this year.\n\nThat&#39;s too bad.  That does sound like it might be a significant issue\nfor me.  Do they not offer research assistantships, or work programs,\nor something similar?\n\n&gt; They also don&#39;t require an application fee nor do they look at your GRE\n&gt; scores (which was a good thing for me :)\n\nNo application fee is nice.  Though I&#39;d probably prefer they looked at\nmy GRE scores, rather than my undergrad grades. :)\n\n&gt; Feel free to email me privately or on the list if you have any more\n&gt; specific questions.\n\nSo are you finishing up your degree program this summer?  Are you\nworking on a thesis right now?\n\nThanks for the info.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
