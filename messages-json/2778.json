The byproduct would be the \nevolution of a supe=\r\nrvisor genome.\n\n   My current thoughts regarding inputs to the supervisor a=\r\nre as \nfollows:\n\n1) normalized log of UNT generation #,\n2) last UNT generat=\r\nion highest fitness (HF),\n3) last UNT generation HF accum,\n4) # of generati=\r\nons since last change of HF of UNT,\n5) average of UNT generation HF,\n6) slo=\r\npe of average of UNT generation HF (last 2 points),\n7) slope of HF accum (l=\r\nast 2 points).\n\n   Does anyone have any thoughts regarding the contemplated=\r\n inputs, \nand/or suggestions for possible other candidate inputs?\n\n   Thoug=\r\nhtful suggestions are always appreciated!\n\nThanks,\n   Andy\n\n\n\n"}}
