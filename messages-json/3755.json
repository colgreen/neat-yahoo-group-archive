Some hypothesize that the first\nreplicators were something like free-floating strands of RNA that\noperated like templates for molecules exactly like themselves.\n\n&gt;  Besides, there is something that can even break the evolution theory.\n&gt;  An example is the bacteria&#39;s propeller tail. It is a very complex\n&gt;  mechanism composed of many parts depending on each other. How did\n&gt;  this evolve? What was that gene appearance? This just cannot evolve\n&gt;  gradually, it is a &quot;jump&quot; in evolution. I know that the populations\n&gt;  get separated into species within their own niches but the quiestion\n&gt;  of how this evolved is not answered yet.\n\nThe evolution of the bacterial flagellum is a favorite chestnut of the\ncreationist (intelligent design) movement, especially Michael Behe.\nBut explaining its gradual evolution is not problematic.
