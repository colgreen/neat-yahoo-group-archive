The second multiplier rewards \nindividuals \n&gt; that tend to wal=\r\nk around instead of staying still. I know it is \nmaybe \n&gt; wrong to assign 0=\r\n.000 fitness, but I usually hope that in early \n&gt; generations at least some=\r\n individuals will get a score above zero, \n&gt; and therefore survive. Is this=\r\n a right thing to do or I should \n&gt; translate all fitnesses above 0.000 ? L=\r\nike Total_Fitness +=3D 1.0; ? \n&gt; The Number_of_FootSteps_Taken is actually =\r\nan integer and it makes \nthe \n&gt; fitness landscape look like stairs... This =\r\nis not good, but I can&#39;t \n&gt; think of another way to encourage walking aroun=\r\nd.. Rewarding cyclic \n&gt; activity in the output neurons didn&#39;t help me much.=\r\n. It is the same \n&gt; thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am experimenting with a lot of fitness f=\r\nunctions every day. The \n&gt; best individual I got for the balancing task was=\r\n actually the same \nas \n&gt; the one found using regular NEAT - just standing.=\r\n A way to prevent \n&gt; this is may be to choose random initial positions for =\r\nthe model.. \nOr \n&gt; the ground plane can be made moving randomly.. \n&gt; Anyway=\r\n, it seems that the fitness function is wrong, since this way \n&gt; of achievi=\r\nng the goal is too easy for the evolution to find.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently tryi=\r\nng out how good are they to walk. I replaced the \n&gt; Average_Head_Height wit=\r\nh Total_Distance_Travelled in the fitness \n&gt; function. \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that=\r\n HyperNEAT is able to handle such complex dynamic \n&gt; control tasks, given t=\r\nhe right substrate geometry. Results so far \ndo \n&gt; not show a big progress.=\r\n But there are a lot of parameters to tweak \n&gt; and play with. Substrate con=\r\nfigurations also. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, what about the source code, can you compile it=\r\n?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanle=\r\ny@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is your fitness function in this do=\r\nmain?
