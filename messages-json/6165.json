It can model up to a billion neurons and a tril=\r\nlion\nsynapses in biological real time. The basic building block is the\nSpiN=\r\nNaker Chip Multiprocessor (CMP), which is a custom-designed\nglobally asynch=\r\nronous locally synchronous (GALS) system\nwith 18 ARM968 processor nodes res=\r\niding in synchronous islands,\nsurrounded by a lightweight, packet-switched =\r\nasynchronous\ncommunications infrastructure. In this paper, we review the\nde=\r\nsign requirements for its very demanding target application,\nthe SpiNNaker =\r\nmicro-architecture and its implementation issues.\nWe also evaluate the SpiN=\r\nNaker CMP, which contains 100 million\ntransistors in a 102-mm die, provides=\r\n a peak performance of\n3.96 GIPS, and has a peak power consumption of 1 W w=\r\nhen all\nprocessor cores operate at the nominal frequency of 180 MHz.\nSpiNNa=\r\nker chips are fully operational and meet their power and\nperformance requir=\r\nements.\n\n"}}
