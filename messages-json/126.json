Now there are three\n&gt; ways\n&gt; of doing this! :)\n\nRight...these are basically very similar approaches,\ndiffering primarily in the amount of information input\ninto the net each step.\n \n&gt; Originally, I had only considered looking at the\n&gt; whole\n&gt; table, meaning that the ANN has inputs for the state\n&gt; of every position.\n\nYeah, in this case, the network is getting complete\ninformation about the entire table every single step. \nWhich, again, isn&#39;t a big deal with six cards, but it\nwon&#39;t scale to very large numbers of cards well.\n\n&gt; A second way of doing it, based on my\n&gt; misinterpretation of what you said, is to give to\n&gt; the\n&gt; ANN all of the CHANGES to the table.  Since the\n&gt; starting information is &quot;all cards face down&quot;, the\n&gt; theoreticall, if you know all the changes, that&#39;s\n&gt; equivalent to knowing the exact state of the table.\n\nYeah, this is interesting.  Here you&#39;re inputting the\nsmallest amount of information necessary for the\nnetwork to play the game successfully.  I&#39;m not sure\nexactly how this would work in practice.\n\nIf, for example, the network outputs two positions,\nand both are empty, there is no state change to the\ntable, right?  So you have no input to the network (I\nsuppose you could input all zeros).\n\nSo do you activate the network again, and take those\noutputs?  Or do you just take the next highest outputs\nthat correspond to spaces occupied with cards? \n\n&gt; Now I see what you have been talking about, which is\n&gt; to let the ANN have a small scanning window and let\n&gt; it\n&gt; spend several computational steps looking over the\n&gt; table.  At least, that&#39;s what Darren&#39;s method is\n&gt; when applied to this game.\n\nSomething like that, though as I said in my reply to\nKen, I don&#39;t really see much use in a &quot;looking around&quot;\nphase (if all the cards were face up, that would be\ndifferent, but that would be a variation on the\nrules).  But the basic idea is the same.  The network\nbasically has two viewports, each the size of one\ncard-space.  So it is only looking at two spots on the\ntableau each turn, and either getting input for the\nvalue of the card or input indicating there is no card\nthere, and then it outputs the next two spots to\ncheck.\n\nSo no looking around before it makes its next\nchoices...but again, a similar idea.\n\n&gt; All of those may be worth trying.\n\nSure. :)\n \n&gt; There is another large architectural decision here,\n&gt; which I might get some opinions on.  I have been\n&gt; planning to start with a sharp threshold function\n&gt; for\n&gt; the activation function, rather than a sigmoidal\n&gt; function.  My reasoning is that, since the inputs\n&gt; and\n&gt; final outputs are binary, why not use binary\n&gt; neurons? \n\nAgain, an interesting opportunity for experiment. :)\n\nThere&#39;s obviously no need for your input and output\nlayer to be anything but binary, but I&#39;m not sure that\nyou want all your hidden units to be binary as well.\n\n&gt; The weight & thresholds will be the only floating\n&gt; point numbers in the ANN.  Everything else will be\n&gt; 0&#39;s\n&gt; and 1&#39;s, and integers to boot.  I think this will\n&gt; allow me to code a faster calculating ANN, which in\n&gt; turn speeds up the number of generations per hour.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t think efficiency would be an overriding\nconcern, at least until you scale the domain up to\nlarge numbers of cards.  I think the most interesting\naspect of experimenting in this domain is seeing how\nthe topology of the net evolves to handle memory, not\nreally the computational efficiency of the solutions.\n\nAnd you shouldn&#39;t have a problem doing fairly large\nruns in short periods of times, no matter which\nactivation function you use on your hidden nodes, as\nlong as the population size isn&#39;t huge and you keep\nyour domain fairly scaled down.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
