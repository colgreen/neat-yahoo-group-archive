In the last decade or so, we have seen a large number of\napplicati=\r\nons of neuroevolution in games. Evolved neural networks have been\nused to p=\r\nlay games, model players, generate content and even enable\ncompletely new g=\r\name genres. To some extent, games seem to be replacing the\nsmall mobile rob=\r\nots ubiquitous in evolutionary robotics and simple\nbenchmarks used in reinf=\r\norcement learning research.\n\nJulian Togelius and myself have written a surv=\r\ney on neuroevolution in\ngames, including a discussion of future research ch=\r\nallenges. The main\nreason is that there was no survey of neuroevolution in =\r\ngames in existence;\nthe other reason was that we wanted a tutorial overview=\r\n to hand out to the\nstudents in our Modern AI for Games course.\n\nThe prepri=\r\nnt is available here on arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7326\nPDF: http://a=\r\nrxiv.org/pdf/1410.7326v1.pdf\n\nNow we would like your input on this. We have=\r\n not submitted the paper yet,\nbut we plan to submit to TCIAIG once we&#39;re re=\r\nasonably sure that we have\nincluded all major work on neuroevolution and ga=\r\nmes and that we are not\nmisrepresenting any of it.\n\nSo please feel free to =\r\nsend us your comments, either as a reply in this\nmail thread or directly to=\r\n the authors (sebr@... and julian@...).\nAll kind of comments ar=\r\ne welcome. We are particularly looking for\nsuggestions for important work w=\r\ne might have overlooked. It is completely\nOK to suggest that we cite you, o=\r\nr even that we cite you more than we\nalready have. But whatever you suggest=\r\n, please try to explain how the work\nwould fit into the current structure o=\r\nf the paper, and provide full\nbibliographic info (preferable in BIBTEX form=\r\nat).\n\nPlease note the scope of the paper, which is neuroevolution being app=\r\nlied\nin some way to a game problem. By games, we refer to games that people=\r\n\ncommonly play as games (e.g. board games, card games, arcade games, racing=\r\n\ngames, strategy games) but not purely abstract games such as prisoner=E2=\r\n=80=99s\ndilemma, robotics tasks or non-game benchmarks for reinforcement le=\r\narning,\nsuch as pole balancing.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback.\n\nCheers,=\r\n\n\nSebastian & Julian\n-- \nDr. Sebastian Risi\nAssistant Professor\nIT Universi=\r\nty of Copenhagen, Room 5D08\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark=\r\n\nemail: sebastian.risi@..., web: www.sebastianrisi.com\nmobile: +45-50=\r\n250355, office: +45-7218-5127\n\r\n--001a113483aecb430b05067a57b0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Neuroevolution - the evolution of weights and/or topo=\r\nlogy for neural networks - is a common and powerful method in evolutionary =\r\nrobotics and machine learning.
