I have a few ideas I would like to try out, but I\n&gt;  =\r\n | would like to be able to compare them to the original research to\n&gt;   | =\r\nsee if I can get any improvement.\n&gt; \n&gt;   | I have two questions to ask of t=\r\nhose of you who have tried\n&gt;   | recreating this:\n&gt; \n&gt;   I have recreated i=\r\nt in a slightly different setup (the change were\n&gt;   made to simplify the i=\r\nmplementation in my framework and the potential\n&gt;   implementation on a rea=\r\nl robot). In my experience, the results were\n&gt;   easy to reproduce and does=\r\n not depends much on the details.\n&gt; \n&gt;   For details about my implementatio=\r\nn, you can check the paper that I\n&gt;   will present at the IROS workshop (&quot;E=\r\nxploring new horizons of\n&gt;   Evolutionary Design of Robots&quot;, see the next m=\r\nessage):\n&gt;   http://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/papers/novelty_based_multi=\r\nobjectivization.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt;   | 1. How big is the area? I have got all of the =\r\ninternal &quot;walls&quot; in\n&gt;   | place in scale to the total size of the map, howe=\r\nver I would like to\n&gt;   | get a rough idea of the width/height of the &quot;map&quot;=\r\n. I understand that\n&gt;   | this should all be relative, but without some sor=\r\nt of &quot;scale factor&quot;\n&gt;   | for my map from the original I don&#39;t know what is=\r\n a reasonable\n&gt;   | amount of space for the agent to move etc. Currently my=\r\n world is 120\n&gt;   | x 115 units big, and the agent can move anywhere up to =\r\n2.5 units per\n&gt;   | time period.\n&gt; \n&gt;   My hard map is 500x500 px, that are=\r\n transformed into a 600x600 units\n&gt;   maze. The radius of my robot is 20 un=\r\nits. Each wheel can make up 2\n&gt;   units per time step and I used 1500 time-=\r\nsteps for the whole\n&gt;   simulation.\n&gt; \n&gt;   | 2. I also am interested in how=\r\n the outputs of the neural network are\n&gt;   | interpreted. I know from the p=\r\napers that there are two output\n&gt;   | neurons, one for forward/backward and=\r\n one for left/right. Currently\n&gt;   | I am interpreting these as output &lt; 0.=\r\n5 =3D turn left, output &gt; 0.5 =3D\n&gt;   | turn right and the same for forward=\r\n/backward. This is leading to a\n&gt;   | pretty constant behaviour of moving i=\r\nn circles around the map,\n&gt;   | always turning left - so I am wondering how=\r\n other people have\n&gt;   | interpreted the output result to get a more intell=\r\nigent movement\n&gt;   | pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I used a different robot than in the o=\r\nriginal paper. The main reason\n&gt;   was to have outputs similar to the ones =\r\nyou could use on a small\n&gt;   mobile robot. I have two outputs: \n&gt;   - speed=\r\n of the right wheel\n&gt;   - speed of the left wheel\n&gt; \n&gt;   I can send you my =\r\nsource code in you think it can be useful. \n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   -- \n&gt; =\r\n  Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt;   http://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt;   te=\r\nl : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   No virus found =\r\nin this incoming message.\n&gt;   Checked by AVG - www.avg.com \n&gt;   Version: 8.=\r\n5.409 / Virus Database: 270.13.111/2386 - Release Date: 09/21/09 05:51:00\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
