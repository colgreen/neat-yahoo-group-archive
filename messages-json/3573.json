This \nwould =\r\nbe a combination of hardware and software that accelerates the \nprocess of =\r\nevolving a population of networks for a particular NEAT \napplication.\n\nWe a=\r\nnticipate a 20 fold reduction in training time compared to a \nsystem runnin=\r\ng on a single CPU Dual Core Pentium system. But this \nwould of course depen=\r\nd greatly upon the problem at hand.\n\nThe product will consist of an API wri=\r\ntten in C that will interface \nwith a hardware system and accelerate the co=\r\nre functionality of the \nNEAT algorithm.\n\nA feature set and pricing model h=\r\nas not been finalized.  Though to \nmake the product financially viable a te=\r\nntative price of $10K USD has \nbeen estimated.\n\nThe reason I am posting is =\r\nto gauge interest. If you or your company \nwould be interested in this prod=\r\nuct please send me an e-mail to: \nShaneR at RyanCapital dot EU. Additionall=\r\ny if you have any questions \nor concerns please e-mail me or post on this f=\r\norum and will try and \nanswer them as quickly as possible.\n\nThank you,\n\nSha=\r\nne \n\n\n\n"}}
