In fact\n&gt;with co-evolution the networks will normally (I think) end up playing\n&gt;within a very narrow range of game strategies - which means they perform\n&gt;poorly when played against humans or even simple algorithmic strategies\n&gt;they have never encountered before. Although I&#39;m happy to be proved\n&gt;wrong on this, that partly my experience so in some limited Tic-Tac-Toe\n&gt;co-evolution experiments I&#39;ve been working on (more on those another time).\n\nI was talking to somebody on a newsgroup about just this point (it wasn&#39;t \nyou, was it?)\n\nAnyway, this is what I said.  I&#39;m just posting it really because it&#39;s the \nlongest URL I&#39;ve ever seen :)\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.ai.neural-nets/browse_frm/thread/68a1a0ebd5fc7a27/a901d35657afdd35?tvc=1&q=%22Ian+Badcoe%22#a901d35657afdd35\n\nIt&#39;s probably well within the standard level of discussions we already had \nin the group...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
