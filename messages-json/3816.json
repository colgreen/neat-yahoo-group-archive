While there can be some small \nchanges in=\r\n the fitness (essentially noise). The average slope over the \nlast N genera=\r\ntions will be very flat. I am trying to identify these \nfitness plateaus.\n\n=\r\nI am using an exponential moving average of the first differences of \nthe f=\r\nitness to quantify whether or not I am in a fitness plateau. In \nother word=\r\ns each generation I am calculating the difference in fitness \nfrom the last=\r\n generation. Then I am calculating a moving average of the \nlast N generati=\r\nons; but giving more weight to the most recent values.\n\nHas anyone else wor=\r\nked on a similar problem? How did they approach it?\n\nRegards,\n\nShane\n\n\n\n"}}
