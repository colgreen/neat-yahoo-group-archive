I do not evolve 3D shapes \nyet. Just 2D. I am ac=\r\ntually working on a new project that does much \nbetter than the previous on=\r\ne. Imagine the CPPN picture as a vector \nfield, where you query the CPPN fo=\r\nr the velocity of a vertex in a \nspace. It is like you inflate a balloon in=\r\n space. This way whole 3D \nmeshes can be built with CPPNs. It is actually v=\r\nery similar to the \nwork of Erin Hastings, where he uses CPPNs to control p=\r\narticle \nsystems. I need some more time before I release that thing. But I =\r\n\nappreciate your interest. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune=\r\n &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Petar-\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot get this to run on the two wi=\r\nndows machines I have tried it \non.
