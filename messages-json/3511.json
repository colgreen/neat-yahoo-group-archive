How do these individuals get \ntheir e=\r\nnergy? Do they complexify and speciate? \nThere is another point. It is not =\r\nnecessary to crossover. \nWell, I wasn&#39;t thinking about NNs in particular, b=\r\nut CPPNs. The \nneural networks do share many things with CPPNs, but I consi=\r\nder them \nas brains in organisms with fixed topology. This is still the sam=\r\ne \nthing! The environment is limited and they cannot go out of the box. \nFo=\r\nr example, consider the evolution of autonomous cars. No matter how \nsmart =\r\nthey are getting, they are still cars, but in the case of \nnatural evolutio=\r\nn they can turn into planes! \nWhat about changing the entire concept? What =\r\nif CPPN-based \nindividuals exist in a virtual environment where their survi=\r\nval \n(selection) is depending on nothing but themselves? Picbreeder is a \np=\r\nerfect example for this. In order to understand what I mean, please \nthink =\r\nof those images as they were selected without human \ninteraction. Assume th=\r\nat the environment is not the artist&#39;s \nperception, but some kind of.. real=\r\n environment.. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G.

This is a\n&gt; &gt;  very complex problem. Th=\r\ne problem is not that every GA is \nevolving to\n&gt; &gt;  a predefined target and=\r\n easily skips promising genomes. The \nproblem\n&gt; &gt;  is the difference betwee=\r\nn the GAs and nature. In nature, there \nis no\n&gt; &gt;  somebody like God who sa=\r\nys &quot;You&#39;re good and you deserve to mate, \nand\n&gt; &gt;  you will die&quot;. The organ=\r\nisms are choosing their mates. So, a very\n&gt; &gt;  good genome will not survive=\r\n just because its phenotype can eat \na lot\n&gt; &gt;  or live longer.. In fact, t=\r\nhe phenotypes themselves tell which is\n&gt; &gt;  good, very indirectly. This kin=\r\nd of indirection need to be\n&gt; &gt;  abstracted. If we want to achieve a lot of=\r\n complexity that was \nnever\n&gt; &gt;  discovered by humans, we have to give the =\r\nindividuals the power \nof...\n&gt; &gt;  Say, it&#39;s like democracy in human society=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  What I see in Picbreeder and IEC at all, is that the human takes \nth=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;  role of each indivudual, when he sees one. As I run my view \nthrough=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  these 15 images, for each one I am thinking of the image as it \nwas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  me. I say &quot;I&#39;m looking fine!&quot;, or &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so ugly!&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;  So, the way =\r\nto automate this kind of process is to find a way to \nlet\n&gt; &gt;  the individu=\r\nals express themselves. The human designer sets up \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  environment, o=\r\nf course, but everything else should happen\n&gt; &gt;  automatically. The selecti=\r\non method must be very very different \nthan\n&gt; &gt;  the usual, I guess.\n&gt; &gt;  H=\r\now we can put this into something practical? I have some\n&gt; &gt;  suggestions, =\r\nbut it turns out to be a kind of Alife stuff. Well, \nI\n&gt; &gt;  cannot even exp=\r\nress myself! :)\n&gt; &gt;  Does somebody have any ideas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
