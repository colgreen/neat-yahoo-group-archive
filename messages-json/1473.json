If a complex of genes has formed that are all\n&gt;&gt;&gt;interdependent, that could be a bad move.  Maybe safer would be to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;just make adding *all* the excess and disjoint genes probabilistic.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Good point.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Or, does that imply that the two individuals are too different to breed \n&gt;successfully anyway?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suppose It&#39;s true to say that that most pairs of genomes selected for \ncrossover will be in the same species and will therefore be very \nsimilar, so in actual fact you might not encounter very many disjoint an \nexcess genes. Two exceptions to this, (1) A small proportion of \ninter-species mating is sometimes used in NEAT (say 1%). (2) If you use \na dynamic speciation threshold then the difference between genomes in a \ngiven species increases as complexity of the population rises, this is \nin order to keep the number of species down.  This second point may be \nless of an issuse with phased searching, but complexity can still rise \nif that is where the good solutions are to be found.\n\n&gt;If you had a set of genes which were all in one parent, mutually \n&gt;interdependent, and beneficial, could that be a definition of a &quot;module&quot;?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, I would say so.\n\n&gt;I guess nature gets around this as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;- when new genes first appear they are exchanged between individuals so \n&gt;similar that they tend to get the same support framework from both parents.\n&gt;\n&gt;- as mutual interdependence between genes grows (over very long periods) \n&gt;the genes tend to get shuffled close together so that they do crossover as \n&gt;a single unit\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nhmm, so genes that are close together tend to be functionaly dependent. \nGenotype proximity indicates phenotype proximity. Whereas in NEAT the \ngenes always remain in the order they were added to the genome (this \nmakes comparison nice and fast), but perhaps we are loosing some \nimportant properties by doing this - namely, crossover could be allowed \nto re-arrange genes into functionaly dependent groups. Hey I like this \nidea a lot Ian.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
