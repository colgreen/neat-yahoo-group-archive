We\nalready tried most of the problems supplied with HyperNEAT, but most of them\nproved to be either too simple (near-optimal fitness within a few\ngenerations) or too expensive to run (one run can take hours). In this\ncontext a run is a complete run of HyperNEAT with n generations, not the\nevaluation of 1 generation. We cut back on the number of generations\n(default is 300), so problems that take 30-45 minutes for a whole run are\nalso ok.\n\nOur interest lies only in using our tool to tune the parameters, so we won&#39;t\nuse the source code of the experiments for anything other than parameter\ntuning and we will hand our results (e.g. parameters and best performance)\nback to you in exchange for letting us use your work (provided we got to\ntuning your problem). As a result of this work, we hope to be able to\nrelease validated tuning software for use with HyperNEAT.\n\nRegards,\nJan van der Lugt\n\r\n--0016e6db2d7bfdac100495663dbe\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;meta charset=3D&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;border-co=\r\nllapse: collapse; &quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;arial, helveti=\r\nca, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are working on =\r\ntuning the 30-something parameters for HyperNEAT (2.6 in our case) and we a=\r\nre looking for hard problems that do not take too much computational effort=\r\n, which means a run can take about 15 minutes.
