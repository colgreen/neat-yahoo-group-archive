We may try some very\n&gt;large resolution eyes, though, to see if there&#39;s a measurable increase\n&gt;in performance.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t quite follow how this exponential increase in complexity comes \nabout. I suppose it depends on how you set up the roving eye, I was \nthinking that the network would have something like two (x and y) \noutputs for the coordinates the eye should be looking at, the experiment \ncode then supplies the appropriate image to the eye&#39;s sensor inputs. I \nactually think it would be better to decompose the problem so that one \nnetwork guides the roving eye to scan, home in on a shape and frame in \nappropriately. A second network then is trained to actually recognise \nshapes independently of the first network.\n\nAnyway I&#39;m probably covering known issues so I&#39;ll leave it there and try \nand find time to read the paper you refered to.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
