I=92m glad you like it. Please see below for answers to your qu=\r\nestions. \n\n&gt; Hi Jeff, congrats on the Creative Thinking Approach (CTA) publ=\r\nication!  It&#39;s a great idea that expands elegantly on novelty search and ra=\r\nises all kinds of interesting questions and possibilities.  It also appears=\r\n to offer real practical benefits in the difficult tasks you tried, so I&#39;m =\r\nimagine people will be trying it out in their difficult tasks as well.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \nAs people try it, please let us know how it works. I=92m eager to hear ho=\r\nw it works in other setups.\n\n&gt; The paper does a good job addressing some of=\r\n the more immediate questions in its discussion.  I like how you explained =\r\nhow it could be extended naturally to NEAT because of the historical markin=\r\ngs.  But going beyond that discussion, I&#39;m curious whether there could be a=\r\n downside to the fact that adding hidden neurons gives you almost a guarant=\r\need novelty bump because of the fact that they would be paired with zeros i=\r\nn any behavior comparison with other networks?  Do you worry that the idea =\r\nmight then be a sort of mild bloat amplifier when paired with neuroevolutio=\r\nn algorithms that complexify?  That is, if I can&#39;t find something novel to =\r\ndo, the cheap way out might be just to get bigger?  Of course, while that&#39;s=\r\n an interesting question to think about, I&#39;m guess it probably doesn&#39;t matt=\r\ner much in practice since there is so much other relevant information in th=\r\ne behavior vector anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThat=92s an interesting observation that ha=\r\ndn=92t occurred to me. You=92re right that it could cause bloat: it=92ll be=\r\n interesting to see if that occurs and to what extent. That said, I=92m not=\r\n too worried about it, because our other research (as you know) is really s=\r\nhowing the benefit of a connection cost in terms of boosting performance an=\r\nd modularity (http://youtu.be/Rgq7Jzsw8vw). If you add a connection cost al=\r\nong with the Creative Thinking Approach, that should override any pressure =\r\nto bloat up just to get a creative thinking bump. \n\nMy guess is that both o=\r\nf these techniques will independently help on most problems, but now you=92=\r\nve brought up a reason why they especially could work well together. :-)\n\n&gt;=\r\n At a more fundamental level, I am wondering about the implications of beha=\r\nvior being characterized by inputs and outputs.  But that idea I realize is=\r\n more related to earlier work of JBM and Stef, so perhaps it really doesn&#39;t=\r\n impact the CTA idea,  That is, I imagine CTA can still work even if the be=\r\nhavior characterization is not directly constructed from inputs and outputs=\r\n.  For example, you could still combine a behavior characterization taken f=\r\nrom the absolute trajectory of the robot with the hidden nodes activation l=\r\nevels over time.  It&#39;s mixing different types of information, but if you no=\r\nrmalize appropriately I don&#39;t think that matters.  What do you think?  Is t=\r\nhere something about CTA that somehow needs you to characterize behaviors d=\r\nirectly off of inputs and outputs?  (For example, did you do it that way be=\r\ncause other ways didn&#39;t work with it?)\n&gt; \nThe Creative Thinking Approach co=\r\nuld definitely be mixed withy any behavioral metric, as you point out and y=\r\nour example shows. We did not try that, but I can=92t think of a reason it =\r\nwouldn=92t work. You=92re right that you=92d have to get the relative weigh=\r\nting right, but that shouldn=92t be hard. We chose to extend  Jean-Baptiste=\r\n and St=E9phane=92s input-output neural firing metric because the CTA is a =\r\nnatural extension of their idea and code base, and because I really like ho=\r\nw general their behavioral metric is. In other words, if it works, I=92d ra=\r\nther use their behavioral metric first because of how general it is. I=92d =\r\nonly want to switch to a human-designed metric if their general, off-the-sh=\r\nelf behavioral metric was not working for some reason. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Going back to=\r\n the implications of characterizing behavior based on inputs and outputs, I=\r\n understand it has been shown effective, but I worry about whether it might=\r\n somehow limit possibilities in the future.  For example, the kinds of beha=\r\nviors you get likely depend upon the behavior characterization (that seems =\r\ncommon sense), so in the future we may discover that different domain-speci=\r\nfic characterizations tend to collect different sets of diverse behaviors. =\r\n That may not have mattered or proven true so far, but it could matter in t=\r\nhe future.  Again I realize this issue likely doesn&#39;t matter for CTA anyway=\r\n since it can use whatever behavior characterization it wants.  So it&#39;s mor=\r\ne of a general question.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nI agree that different metrics will likely p=\r\nrovide different results. As mentioned above, I like this one because it do=\r\nesn=92t inject an experimenter=92s bias and it doesn=92t take an experiment=\r\ner=92s time, but I=92d naturally start trying different metrics if their of=\r\nf-the-shelf idea didn=92t work. And, as you mentioned, the Creative Thinkin=\r\ng Approach blends nicely with either. \n\n&gt; Overall it&#39;s a clever idea that w=\r\norked out very well.  And it&#39;s nice how you showed it becomes more helpful =\r\nin the more difficult problems. \n&gt; \nThanks. My guess is that it will defini=\r\ntely work better on harder problems, especially cognitive problems that req=\r\nuire memory, and I look forward to seeing how research into this idea unfol=\r\nds in the coming years. \n\n&gt; By the way, is first author Jingyu Li actually =\r\na high school student?  Is there a story behind that?\n&gt; \nShe is a high-scho=\r\nol student! She=92s precocious and is taking many upper-level undergraduate=\r\n courses, many of which are cross-listed as graduate courses. That means th=\r\nat she=92s frequently learning alongside Ph.D. students. Moreover, she has =\r\nbeen one of the top students in both of the classes of mine that she has ta=\r\nken, including those Ph.D. students! She=92s also very hard working and put=\r\n a lot of effort into this paper. In fact, I frequently forget that she=92s=\r\n in high-school and instead consider her as simply one of the Ph.D. student=\r\ns in my lab. What=92s also great is that her hard work and talents are not =\r\ngoing unnoticed. In addition to publishing this GECCO paper, she also recen=\r\ntly won an ACM-Womens scholarship, and received a full ride to MIT, Caltech=\r\n, Cornell, and many other top schools. She=92ll be attending MIT in the fal=\r\nl. \n\nShe=92ll be presenting this paper at GECCO so you=92ll have the chance=\r\n to meet her in person. She also recently joined this list, so she=92ll pro=\r\nbably really embarrassed by all the praise I=92m heaping on her, but it=92s=\r\n very well deserved. :-)\n\nCongrats Jingyu!!!!!\n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\r\n--Apple-Mail=_E4F7AD4B-E09C-4DBC-BC2A-E3B55BB6E75F\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=windows-1252\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html charset=\r\n=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-=\r\nmode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-fa=\r\nmily: Times-Roman;&quot;&gt;Hello Ken,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Times-Roman=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Times-Roman;&quot;&gt;Thanks for the really=\r\n kind words regarding the Creative Thinking Approach.

And, as you mentioned, the Crea=\r\ntive Thinking Approach blends nicely with either.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquot=\r\ne type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); positio=\r\nn: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position: relati=\r\nve;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ov=\r\nerall it&#39;s a clever idea that worked out very well.&nbsp; And it&#39;s nice how=\r\n you showed it becomes more helpful in the more difficult problems.&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks.

She=92s precocious and is taking many upper-leve=\r\nl undergraduate courses, many of which are cross-listed as graduate courses=\r\n. That means that she=92s frequently learning alongside Ph.D. students. Mor=\r\neover, she has been one of the top students in both of the classes of mine =\r\nthat she has taken, including those Ph.D. students! She=92s also very hard =\r\nworking and put a lot of effort into this paper. In fact, I frequently forg=\r\net that she=92s in high-school and instead consider her as simply one of th=\r\ne Ph.D. students in my lab. What=92s also great is that her hard work and t=\r\nalents are not going unnoticed. In addition to publishing this GECCO paper,=\r\n she also recently won an ACM-Womens scholarship, and received a full ride =\r\nto MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and many other top schools. She=92ll be attending=\r\n MIT in the fall.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She=92ll be presenting thi=\r\ns paper at GECCO so you=92ll have the chance to meet her in person.
