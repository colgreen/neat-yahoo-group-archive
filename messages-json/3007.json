I&#39;m not certain from the posts so far\n&gt; if these are meant to be public or private efforts. Sounds very\n&gt; interesting in any case.\n\nThe reason mine&#39;s still considered incomplete, IMO, is because it comes \nnowhere near the performance you report in your original paper.\n\nI don&#39;t think I can have it ready in time for your upcoming conference.\n\nI also started an article on Implementing NEAT.  And by &quot;started&quot;, I \nmean I wrote a few paragraphs, and some of the headings.  :)\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
