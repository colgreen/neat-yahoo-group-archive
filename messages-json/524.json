I feel like you do all of the work and speak for self advocates in NH group. I feel that self advocates should be speaking for them selfs it is all about us. I am a strong self advocate here in VT.  We really support our slogan NONTHING ABOUT US WITH OUT US.  Is there any reason why you are doing basically all the talking from your NH group?  about what is going on with the group. My feeling is that you should let your self advocates, advocate for them self.  And if they have not found there own voice yet maybe you could help them find it.  It is really worth it. Your e-mails do have good things in them to say, and i think advocates should be involved in every thing that they are able to do,  And i feel that the ADVISORS should\n encourage them to do so  That is what SELF ADVOCATE MEANS speaking for our self. And we all have good and important things to say.\nThanks for Listening\nI AM ALWAYS OPEN FOR FEED BACK AND SUGGESTIONS.\nPATTY D&gt; AND I SPEAK FOR MY SELF\n\n\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
