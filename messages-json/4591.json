Any weight above 1.0 will make the \nsignal stronger and any weight below 1.0 will make it weaker. Weights \nclose to 0.0 will make the signal disappear. This is the way ANNs \nignore information. Suppose you have an ANN with all weights set to 0. \nThe output you will get may be static all the time, but the lack of \nsignal doesn&#39;t mean there is lack of *information*, since the NN is\nessentially trained to ignore everything. \nThe mathematical model that is used to represent artificial neural \nnetworks doesn&#39;t cover conservation of energy or anything like that. \nIn fact, why you would need such a thing at all? Is there a merit in \nthe approach? I am interested.\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, Eric\nMohlenhoff &lt;eric.mohlenhoff@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From my (probably limited) understanding of neurobiology, such a\n&gt; conservation of energy principle would not be applicable to the \nmodel\n&gt; of neurons firing. At least not in the sense that I believe you are\n&gt; describing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Energy&#39; as it were, is not really &#39;transferred&#39; between any given\n&gt; neurons in such a system. Neurons only interact via \nneurotransmitters\n&gt; being released into and absorbed from the synaptic cleft between \nsaid\n&gt; neurons. Electrical energy (which I gather is to what you are\n&gt; referring) is confined to within a particular neuron itself. In a\n&gt; properly functioning neuron, this energy is neither received nor\n&gt; transmitted. In fact, (and I may be mistaken here, so somebody \ncorrect\n&gt; me if I am) I beleive that the effects of such neurological diseases\n&gt; as multiple sclerosis are actually precipitated by this electrical\n&gt; energy escaping the cell due to a degeneration of the myelin sheath\n&gt; that would normally cover the axon of the cell, along which the\n&gt; electrical signals within the cell travel from dendrite to axon\n&gt; terminal.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it were the case that a conservation of energy principle was\n&gt; applied to such a model, and the electrical signals *were* being\n&gt; transmitted cell-to-cell, this would impose a ceiling on the number \nof\n&gt; layers possible in the network, degree of recursion in feedback\n&gt; networks, etc. due to what would be inevitable signal degradation to\n&gt; the point of no longer being usable. That is unless there was also \nthe\n&gt; provision for &#39;repeater&#39; cells/nodes in the network (a concept that \nI\n&gt; have personally not encountered as of yet).\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, the energy that is &#39;distributed&#39; across connecting \nneurons\n&gt; actually comes from within the cell (insert complex/detailed\n&gt; discussion about mitochondria, phosphorylation, etc. here... haha),\n&gt; itself being a function of the type, amount, and possibly other\n&gt; yet-to-be-discovered properties of the neurotransmitters (and \npossibly\n&gt; other chemicals as well) that are within the synaptic cleft at the\n&gt; time that the firing was initiated.\n&gt; \n&gt; A better analogy (I believe) would be the one proposed by a large \nbody\n&gt; of the literature: a single neuron is a black-box function. It takes \na\n&gt; given input (absorbing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft) \nand\n&gt; produces an output (releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic\n&gt; cleft). Any conservation of energy principle is resetricted to being\n&gt; applied to the processes occurring within the cell itself, because \nin\n&gt; this (limited) sense the cell is acting as a closed system for that\n&gt; electrical energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; PS Anyone, feel free to correct me if any of this is off-base or \njust\n&gt; plain wrong too.
