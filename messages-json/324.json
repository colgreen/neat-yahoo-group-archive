I let\nNEAT \n&gt; see a picture (7 x 14 pixels) of a letter and let it choose which\nletter \n&gt; it thinks it is (out of 26 letters). Thus, I have 7*14=98 inputs +\n1 \n&gt; bias. And I have 26 outputs. Creating a connection from every input\nto \n&gt; every output leads to 99*26 = 2574 connections per network. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I&#39;ve tried a method where I add X random connections instead of\nthe \n&gt; full 2574 connections, but so far, the results are depressing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have an idea for a better method?\n&gt; \n\n\nWhile I agree that modular or developmental systems will help tackle\nhigh-dimensional problems like this, I also think that roving eyes\nlike Darren&#39;s shape-recognizer are the right way to go with visual\ntypes of systems.  Humans don&#39;t process images all at once, they scan\nimages with their eyes, and the size of our eyes doesn&#39;t change to fit\nthe problem.  Rather, we use our memory as we process large input\nspaces.  A recurrent neural network can be evolved to do the same\nthing.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
