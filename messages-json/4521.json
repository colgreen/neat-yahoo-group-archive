But how exactly the excess/disjoint factors will fit in? \nI=\r\n didn&#39;t completely understand it. So if the current distance metric \nis &quot;ex=\r\ncess*c1 + disjoint*c2 + weight_distance*c3&quot;, then perhaps the \naverage weig=\r\nht distance of matching genes (which is like normalized \nManhattan distance=\r\n) can be replaced with Euclidian distance? Sounds \neasy to implement and I =\r\nwill try this out. \nBut it is hard for me to picture how disjoint and exces=\r\ns genes will be \nhandled.. Suppose that 2 genomes have many disjoint genes =\r\nwith respect \nto each other, if they are both represented as zeroes, this w=\r\nould mean \nthey are closer in space?\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nColin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, thanks for=\r\n your contributions.  You&#39;ve been a great help in\n&gt; &gt; developing my underst=\r\nandings of NEAT.  (I hope that is a \ncompliment).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. ego boosts a=\r\nlways welcome :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Are you saying (in effect) that Lp Norms are a good=\r\n collection of \n&quot;distance&quot;\n&gt; &gt; metrics for genomes?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m saying that th=\r\ne current compatibility scheme in NEAT is\n&gt; effectively using the L1 norm (=\r\nManhattan distance), and I&#39;m now\n&gt; hypothesising that this is better than t=\r\nhe L2 norm (Euclidean\n&gt; distance). I don&#39;t recall this ever coming up so ma=\r\nybe Ken S went\n&gt; through this thought process right back in the beginning o=\r\nf NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; I must admit to not having much of a maths background so I had=\r\n to \nlook\n&gt; up Lp norms - maybe there is a case for some other value of P? =\r\nSuch \nas\n&gt; &lt;1 or the number of genes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think these may have valu=\r\ne in roulette wheel application to \nallele pattern probabilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; So y=\r\nou think there is some research into biological genetics that\n&gt; could give =\r\nus some answers?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
