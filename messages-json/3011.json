I think it is also quite fast and I have some plans tha=\r\nt I will\nelucidate on in my next message that could significantly speed it =\r\nup.\n\nI&#39;ve also built a little tool to run the saved result network and\ngene=\r\nrate a CSV file. So you can load the times series as a graph in\nexcel and v=\r\nisualize the results of your networks prediction compared\nto the original t=\r\nime series.\n\nIt has plenty of work that needs done on it. But I figured I m=\r\night\ncreate a Sourceforge page and post it if anyone is interested?\n\nThanks=\r\n,\n\nShane\n\n\n\n\n"}}
