I will be trying =\r\nto benchmark NEAT \nagainst GE over the next few weeks. I will try and post =\r\nmy methodology but I am not a \nresearcher (I am a professional developer) s=\r\no bear with me.\n\nReally why I am interested in either NEAT or GE is that I =\r\nwant to use it for creating a library \nof behaviours that games developers =\r\ncan use in their games. The idea is to develop a set \nof behaviours such as=\r\n seek, hide, tag, etc. using either NEAT or GE. Then give these to \ndevelop=\r\ners so that they can use them in conjunction with their own decision tree l=\r\nogic.\n\nHopefully this will give developers a palette of behaviours to choos=\r\ne from thus simplifying \ntheir decision trees and shortening the developmen=\r\nt process. I see this as a middle road \nbetween completely evolving an AI a=\r\nnd crafting one by hand.\n\nMy first choice is to use NEAT as I am most famil=\r\niar with it. But if the grammar produced \nby GE isn&#39;t extremely large then =\r\nGE might be superior, as I like the idea of evolving a \ngrammar then allowi=\r\nng the developers to calibrate the constants in the grammar using \nanother =\r\nalgorithm (probably GA) to refine it for new proprietary 3d environments. M=\r\neaning \nthey don&#39;t have to be exposed to the evolutionary algorithm itself.=\r\n\n\nShane\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; On Sat, Oct 11, 2008 at 3:14 PM, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I understand that &quot;hierarchical, modular, and formalized&quot; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; someti=\r\nmes viewed as advantages for Grammatical Encoding (a similar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argument=\r\n is also made for L-systems, which is also grammatical).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; While these =\r\nare clearly properties you want in a programming language,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are these =\r\nreally good things for a genetic encoding? The challenge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with encodin=\r\ngs is not only for them to theoretically express all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible procedu=\r\nres, but also to induce a nicely coupled (smooth)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search space. It se=\r\nems that the space induced by a strictly modular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and hierarchical enc=\r\nodings is unlikely to be smooth, leading to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brittleness. You can have=\r\n things like a massive new module being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doubled in one shot (which wo=\r\nuld usually be a mess, like being born\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with two heads) or a change at=\r\n one level of the hierarchy breaking the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of it entirely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; And yet if evolution stumbles upon a module whose usefulness stems\n&gt; &gt; fr=\r\nom multiple occurrences, how else would this be accomplished? If we\n&gt; &gt; wan=\r\nt artificial encodings to be able to produce something like a\n&gt; &gt; mammalian=\r\n brain, aren&#39;t they necessarily going to incorporate\n&gt; &gt; hierarchy and modu=\r\nlarity?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Derek, you probably know some of my thoughts on hierarchy=\r\n and\n&gt; modularity from discussions we&#39;ve had in person, but to summarize\n&gt; =\r\nbriefly, while I agree wholeheartedly that both are important\n&gt; properties =\r\nobserved in phenotypes, the question is how did they get\n&gt; there?  \n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n some people probably recall me pointing out before, nature does not\n&gt; disc=\r\nover one leg, realize it&#39;s a good idea, and then duplicate it\n&gt; somewhere e=\r\nlse.  Both legs are discovered simultaneously as an\n&gt; elaboration of a pree=\r\nxisting bilaterally symmetric convention.  In\n&gt; general, I believe that mos=\r\nt modules and hierarchy are the result of\n&gt; such elaboration on previously =\r\nestablished conventions, rather than\n&gt; from the duplication of already-exis=\r\nting modules.\n&gt; \n&gt; If an evolutionary algorithm could take a phenotypic mod=\r\nule and\n&gt; duplicate it easily, much of its offspring would be monstrous\n&gt; a=\r\nmalgamations.  Nature does not generally tinker by simply duplicating\n&gt; mod=\r\nules willy-nilly.   \n&gt; \n&gt; Joe Reisinger and I wrote a position paper on thi=\r\ns argument back in\n&gt; 2004 called &quot;Exploiting Morphological Conventions for =\r\nGenetic Reuse.&quot;\n&gt;  It&#39;s still available here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/=\r\npub-view.php?PubID=3D152\n&gt; \n&gt; I can tell you that when I presented the idea=\r\ns in this paper at the\n&gt; GECCO workshop in which it appeared, I recall the =\r\naudience found it\n&gt; controversial.  A number of people in the audience seem=\r\ned to react\n&gt; especially strongly to my claim that &quot;nature is not an engine=\r\ner.&quot; \n&gt; Admittedly, I knew this assertion would draw a reaction, but then\n&gt;=\r\n again, it&#39;s perfectly true.  If we try to bend evolution to act like a\n&gt; g=\r\nood computer scientist, it may be akin to forcing an artist to think\n&gt; like=\r\n an engineer.  While the concepts of engineering and computer\n&gt; science suc=\r\nh as modularity and hierarchy are naturally appealing to us\n&gt; as computer s=\r\ncientists and engineers, their traditional engineering\n&gt; conception is not =\r\nnecessarily the right perspective for harnessing\n&gt; evolution (even if they =\r\nare byproducts of it).  Evolution is more a\n&gt; tinkerer than top-down (or ev=\r\nen bottom-up) designer and its modules\n&gt; most often result from elaboration=\r\ns of regularities that already exist. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
