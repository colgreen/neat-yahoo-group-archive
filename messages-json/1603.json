So I\n&gt;&gt; really think this blurs the lines between GP and TWEANs somewhat.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that&#39;s a good way to go, just blurring the line a very little \n&gt;because NEAT works _much_ better than the average GP...\n&gt;\n&gt;(Just to inspire you and not as any sort of demand :) wish list of \n&gt;activation functions:\n&gt;\n&gt;Sum\n&gt;Sigmoid\n&gt;Multiply\n&gt;Difference (higher output the more variety in the inputs)\n&gt;Similarity (1/difference)\n&gt;Mode (copies the middle input)\n&gt;Max\n&gt;Min\n&gt;Sum of squares\n&gt;Step\n&gt;\n&gt;(and all of these might come in 0 to 1 and -1 to +1 varieties, or is that a \n&gt;red-herring?)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ll make a note and we&#39;ll have to see what santa has in his sack this \nyear :)\n\n&gt;Also, how about types of connection, e.g:\n&gt;\n&gt;Simple Weight\n&gt;Weight and Clamp to Max\n&gt;Weight and Clamp to Min\n&gt;Abs\n&gt;Weight and square\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHmm, but does this give any advantage over the extra neuron functions? \nIf you want the output from a neuron to have different functions applied \nto it then just define some new neurons and apply the function there. \nThus I think this would expand the search space without actually \nimproving the possibility of finding good solutions.\n\n&gt;Not that I&#39;m trying to make it insanely complex :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m a great believer in keeping things simple, it&#39;s all food for thought \nthough - not that I&#39;m short on that at the moment, there are far more \nideas floating around this list than I could possibly find time to \ninvestigate :(\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
