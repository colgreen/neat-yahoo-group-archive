I never expected a \npotential integer based neural approach to be developed - let alone \ntested - when I raised the double vs single float question.\n\nWhat code base would you recommend starting with to performance \nprofile a NEAT engine on a Blackfin?  Note the Blackfin supports a 32 \nbit multiply instruction but no divide.  The 32 bit mulitply is a \nmulti-clock instruction.  Preliminary testing yields little \ndifference in timing between 16 bit and 32 bit multiples for simple \noperations.\n\nSteve\n\n\n"}}
