Here is a current visual representation of one of my evolved poker strategies.\n\nThe hand rating increases from left to right. From top to bottom for each of the four stages the percentage of folds (blue), calls/checks (green) and raises/bets (red) is plotted. The stages themselves are split into 8 columns, the top of these being on a 2-player table and the bottom an 8 player table.\n\nThe top image is in a situation where it is possible to check, the bottom where the player is expected to make a call.\n\nthe networks don&#39;t incorporate any form of opponent modeling yet so the strategy will be fairly weak.\n\nI hope this is not all too confusing. I can elaborate if anyone is interested.\n\nThomas\n\n-------- Original-Nachricht --------\nDatum: Sat, 17 Feb 2007 20:31:49 +0100\nVon: &quot;Thomas Haferlach&quot; &lt;thomas-haferlach@...&gt;\nAn: neat@yahoogroups.com\nCC: \nBetreff: Re: [neat] Re: Questions about NEAT for poker\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I mean to use this hand rating as the only input about the actual cards\n&gt; the player is holding, of course there are others to do with the odds, \n&gt; betting history, position, number of opponents, etc..\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea is that the betting strategy of others can also be framed in\n&gt; terms of this probability.

It&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt; popular\n&gt; &gt; joke amongst some of my peers that someone so atrocious at poker is\n&gt; &gt; attempting to write a program that can play it.  At any rate, it&#39;s not\n&gt; &gt; clear\n&gt; &gt; to me that the odds of winning are the sum and whole of the game.  If\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; no\n&gt; &gt; other reason then that there are many assumptions that go along with\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; probability.  Perhaps if we had the odds of winning at every stage in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; game given the actions of others.  The problem is that those odds\n&gt; &gt; disregard\n&gt; &gt; the betting strategy of other players which, I believe it could be\n&gt; argued\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; really what poker is all about.  If you simply take the case of a flush\n&gt; &gt; draw\n&gt; &gt; for example, I think it is easy to see that it is not only the odds of\n&gt; &gt; winning but how those odds are distributed over the course of the game\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; matters in terms of betting strategy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 2/17/07, Thomas Haferlach &lt;thomas-haferlach@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Intuitively it seems to me that one should be able to abstract from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actual raw hand data. If one has the probability of winning in a\n&gt; &gt; showdown\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against an average hand for the hand one is holding what more\n&gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can the actual hand provide?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thomas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------- Original-Nachricht --------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Datum: Fri, 16 Feb 2007 20:58:35 -0500\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Von: &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;feedyurhed@... &lt;feedyurhed%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An: neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CC:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Betreff: Re: [neat] Re: Questions about NEAT for poker\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not quite sure though if just the probability of winning vs a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; random opponent is enough information about the hand.
