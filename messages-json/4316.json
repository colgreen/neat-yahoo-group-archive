I think ideas\nlike yours=\r\n are indeed important to explore to potentially address the\nissue, and I fo=\r\nund your shape-evolving novelty search program along\nthose lines very inter=\r\nesting.  Since you have most experience with the\nidea, I am curious, do you=\r\n get the sense after playing with it a lot\nthat the patterns that come out =\r\nare indeed sufficiently diverse and\nregular to potentially represent animal=\r\n morphologies?  Or does there\nseem to be anything lacking from the output o=\r\nf such systems?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;peta=\r\nr_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like to point out that CPPNs can be combin=\r\ned effectively with \n&gt; cellular growth models. Because the cells need the a=\r\nnswer to the \n&gt; question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, the CPPN can provide that info withou=\r\nt any \n&gt; interaction between cells. It can also provide instructions about,=\r\n for \n&gt; example &quot;Should I divide or not? Should I change my type?&quot;. \n&gt; Whil=\r\ne it seems like an overkill, because CPPNs already abstract this \n&gt; away wi=\r\nthout having to introduce time for development, the patterns \n&gt; generated a=\r\nre hard to interpret as distinct physical objects. \n&gt; Especially in cases o=\r\nf repeating patterns. But objects generated with \n&gt; cellular growth instruc=\r\nted by CPPNs produce only a single object, all \n&gt; with its distinct parts a=\r\nnd regularities. And not ripped apart with \n&gt; artifacts as it would be afte=\r\nr converting it from a CPPN snapshot \n&gt; image. One might say that such obje=\r\ncts can still be infinte in size, \n&gt; but it is easy to put a limitation on =\r\nthe number of cells or cell \n&gt; divisions. It is also possible to make the l=\r\nimit dynamic, more complex \n&gt; CPPNs producing phenotypes with more cells.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alexandre, thank you for bringing up reaction-diffusion syste=\r\nms.  \n&gt; You\n&gt; &gt; make a good point- my statement was too broad, in part beca=\r\nuse\n&gt; &gt; &quot;cellular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\n&gt; &gt; pot=\r\nentially refer to many types of systems.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just to clarify my stat=\r\nement, I was responding the line of \n&gt; discussion\n&gt; &gt; with Peter about enco=\r\ndings that actually create distinct bodily \n&gt; shapes\n&gt; &gt; that are self-cont=\r\nained and have clear structural boundaries (which\n&gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion sy=\r\nstems tend not to produce; rather they produce\n&gt; &gt; wallpaper-like patterns)=\r\n.  Often when growth-based models are used \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; define actual bodies w=\r\nith distinct borders, they are studied in the\n&gt; &gt; context of blobs with a p=\r\narticular focus on how the blob knows when \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; stop growing so that a=\r\n border shape can be created.  That kind of\n&gt; &gt; systems goes along with the=\r\n &quot;skin&quot; issue that we were discussing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, the field is =\r\nquite broad and there are many possible\n&gt; &gt; interesting examples of such sy=\r\nstems.  If I could revisit my\n&gt; &gt; statement, I would reword it such as to a=\r\nvoid implying any sweeping\n&gt; &gt; generalization.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Alexandre Devert &lt;marmakoide@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Hello\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Along these lines, I have rarely seen a cellular gro=\r\nwth model\n&gt; &gt; produce anything more than a blob or an amorphous shape witho=\r\nut \n&gt; clear\n&gt; &gt; parts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you consider reaction-diffusion sys=\r\ntems as a cellular growth\n&gt; &gt; model, then you might consider the following =\r\npublications :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Interactive Evolution of Dynamical Systems, Karl Sims=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Advanced Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture Synthesis, Allen \n&gt;=\r\n R.\n&gt; &gt; Sanderson et al.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Those patterns are a bit above the a=\r\nverage blob and features very\n&gt; &gt; compact description.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alexandre Devert\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
