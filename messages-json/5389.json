You can lo=\r\nad a fixed-topology genome from file (see\n&gt; NeatGenomeXmlIO) and then pass =\r\nit to that method as a seed. Then just change\n&gt; the reference in your INeat=\r\nExperiment implementation to use your new\n&gt; CreateEvolutionAlgorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYou&#39;ll also want to edit your NeatGenomeParameters to set\n&gt; AddNodeMutation=\r\nProbability, AddConnectionMutationProbability,\n&gt; DeleteConnectionMutationPr=\r\nobability, and\n&gt; DeleteSimpleNeuronMutationProbability equal to 0.\n&gt; \n&gt; If =\r\nyou&#39;re using SharpNEAT v1, I&#39;d recommend switching to version 2. It&#39;s a\n&gt; l=\r\not more elegantly designed and offers more room for customization and\n&gt; ext=\r\nensibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; SharpNEAT 2: https://sites.google.com/site/sharpneat/\n&gt; Co=\r\nde is available at the bottom.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote a couple tutorials on SN2 as we=\r\nll:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/07/17/tutorial-evolving-neural-netw=\r\norks-with-sharpneat-2-part-1/\n&gt; http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/07/24/tutori=\r\nal-%e2%80%93-evolving-neural-networks-with-sharpneat-2-part-2/\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope th=\r\nat helps!\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Oct 29, 2010 at 1:22 AM, chris2005hi =\r\n&lt;chrismnu2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Forgive me if this is a silly ques=\r\ntion, I just started experimenting with\n&gt; &gt; NEAT.
