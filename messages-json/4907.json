Yeah, I agree that the paralle=\r\nl extensions\n&gt; are a good alternative.  I am definitely not more comfortabl=\r\ne in declarative\n&gt; languages (I&#39;m impressed by anyone who is).  I was sitti=\r\nng in a session on\n&gt; F# at PDC at the time so I guess I was amped up on F# =\r\n:).  We&#39;re still\n&gt; trying to figure out the performance trade-offs between =\r\nthe different\n&gt; languages (taken in combination with the kernel and archite=\r\ncture changes\n&gt; we&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s not clear).  There was a time when I would=\r\n have said (did\n&gt; say) that C++ was the only language for NEAT.  However, t=\r\nhe advances are\n&gt; impressive.  At any rate, hope you can get back to this a=\r\nt some point!\n&gt; Always thought NEAT was our best chance for success.\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Nov 19, 2009 at 3:29 PM, Ken Lloyd &lt;kalloy=\r\nd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; F#  tends to be declarative, =\r\nwhich is fine if that paradigm is more\n&gt; &gt; comfortable for you.  There are =\r\n.NET Extensions for Parallel Processing if\n&gt; &gt; you wish to stay with .NET a=\r\nnd object-oriented approaches, say for\n&gt; &gt; SharpNEAT.

I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea in my head for\n&gt; &gt; some time of d=\r\noing an implementation of NEAT in F#.  For the uninitiated, F#\n&gt; &gt; is MS&#39;s =\r\nfunctional .NET solution to the manycore system.  It is completely\n&gt; &gt; inte=\r\nroperable with C#/VB and can use the .NET framework.  I&#39;m still getting\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n completely ramped up on it but it seems like it might be very well suited =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; NEAT.  I was wondering what people think about this.  Waste of time?=\r\n  Maybe\n&gt; &gt; NEAT would be better suited to hadoop or something like that.  =\r\nMaybe\n&gt; &gt; something like this has already been done.
