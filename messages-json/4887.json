It i=\r\ns fairly well commented, the class headers have descriptions and the most i=\r\nmportant functions are narrated. It has a few simple examples to show you h=\r\now a basic experiment can work. The &#39;rt&#39; is for &quot;real-time&quot; experiments, yo=\r\nu can just ignore the rt code and it behaves like regular NEAT. I think you=\r\n can download it either from the archives of this group, or from Dr. Stanle=\r\ny&#39;s web page.\n\nI think the HyperNEAT implementation you are speaking of is =\r\nJason Gauci&#39;s implementation. It is the only HyperNEAT c++ code that I am a=\r\nware of. It has very few comments, and it utilizes more advanced c++ concep=\r\nts like linking to external libraries, boost, templates, and inheritance. W=\r\nhen I was new to c++ and to NEAT, hyperNEAT 2.6 was a bit overwhelming. It =\r\nwill make more sense after you have a better understanding of regular NEAT.=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Andrei Rusu &lt;andrei.rusu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I s=\r\nhould have specified that I was talking exclusively  about the HyperNEAT 2.=\r\n6 C++ implementation. I read some of the publications and the ideas are con=\r\nceptually clear, also read the website, but the implementation is very conf=\r\nusing to me. Maybe it&#39;s because I am new to evolving CPPNs and also to NEAT=\r\n. Anyway, I tried to get some insight out of the code in &quot;HyperNEAT/Hypercu=\r\nbe_NEAT/src/Experiments&quot;, but I find it hard to get a clear picture of how =\r\nthe library is supposed to be used correctly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe this is because I=\r\n am not an experienced NEAT user. Shoud I start with that? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Many t=\r\nhanks?\n&gt;     Andrei.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; Fr=\r\nom: Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Sat, November 7, =\r\n2009 3:47:29 PM\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HyperNEAT Tutorial?\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nndrei, which version of HyperNEAT are you interested in and what references=\r\n have you looked at so far?  We can potentially improve the documentation b=\r\nased on your comments (and a tutorial is a good idea), but first I want to =\r\nunderstand which &quot;comment-less examples&quot; you are referring to.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note th=\r\nat several experiments with complete source code are available in two exist=\r\ning HyperNEAT releases of which I am aware.  These and a variety of publica=\r\ntions from several groups are linked from the HyperNEAT Users Page, which a=\r\nlso provides a brief introduction:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex. cs.ucf.edu/ hyperNEAT=\r\npage/ HyperNEAT. html\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand you may have already been through t=\r\nhis site and its associated software and papers, but I wanted to point it o=\r\nut in case you had not been aware of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to make the algorithm=\r\n as accessible as possible so your comments are appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ca=\r\nn anyone please recommend some HyperNEAT documentation, a tutorial, diagram=\r\n, some clue, or anything that does not mean reverse engineering the comment=\r\n-less examples ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!
