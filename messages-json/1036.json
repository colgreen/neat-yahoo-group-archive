However, I&#39;m having trouble with \n&gt; the ANJI download.  I can&#39;t unzip it.  It returns the message, &quot;The \n&gt; compressed (zipper) folder is invalid or corrupted.&quot;  Let me know \n&gt; when you get a chance to check it because I want to test it before \n&gt; adding all the links.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\n\n\n"}}
