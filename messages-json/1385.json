Hmmm....  I like it!  The fitness must be 10 \n&gt;times more accurate in order to get an error report of half as much.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, you reward very close results more than before and then the reward \ndrops of quickly.\n\n&gt;&gt;The error rises faster than the difference and maxes out when the\n&gt;&gt;difference reaches 1.  An difference at or beyond 1 gets the maximum\n&gt;&gt;possible error.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;So I take it you would cap the error at 1?  Any particular reason?  Just \n&gt;predictability?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe maxing out is actually the most significant factor. You could \nactually just use the direct mapping between difference and error that \nyou were using, scale it a bit and cap it. e.g.\n\n error = min(1.0, abs(o-e)*3)\n\nThis maxing out means that you only reward for nearby results, anything \nmore than 0.33 out will get no reward, therefore an output of zero will \nnot get a good fitness score most of the time. I&#39;m not sure if the \ncurvature of  x^0.3  is as significant.\n\n&gt;Thanks!  Appreciate the suggestion...cross your fingers! :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo worries. Good luck,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
