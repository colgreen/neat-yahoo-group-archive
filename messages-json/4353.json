Perhaps on the standard problems pole-balancing, xor.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems quite promising and I can post my results when they are done=\r\n.\n&gt; But I wanted to see if anyone else has looked into it before I do.\n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nve invested quite a bit of enery in NE but GE looks very promising,\n&gt; and I=\r\n like the fact that it produces actual code rather than a black\n&gt; box.
