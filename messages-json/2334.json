That is \nsomething to be aware=\r\n of since it will look really bad if you \nknowingly got into a conference w=\r\nith no intention of showing up.  If \nthat causes problems for you, you may =\r\nwant to consider the journal \noption.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ia=\r\nn Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; At 20:09 11/10/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;At=\r\n most journals and conferences, anyone should be able to \npublish.\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d s=\r\nuggest starting with conferences, such as GECCO (Genetic and\n&gt; &gt;Evolutionar=\r\ny Computation Conference).  A good journal is a loooong\n&gt; &gt;process that can=\r\n take more than a year or even  years before the\n&gt; &gt;paper ever sees print. =\r\n For conferences you need to check the\n&gt; &gt;deadlines for submission and prep=\r\nare accordingly.  For journals\n&gt; &gt;there is no deadline.\n&gt; \n&gt; And, of course=\r\n, if I submit it to IEEE CIG symposium then the \nchances \n&gt; are _I&#39;ll_ be a=\r\nsked to review it ;-)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Conferences like GECCO are double-blind, which =\r\nmeans reviewers \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;get to see the author&#39;s name or affiliation, and =\r\nthe author \ndoesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;get to know who the reviewer was.  So your lack of a=\r\nffiliation\n&gt; &gt;should have no impact.  However, you may want to give yoursel=\r\nf \nsome\n&gt; &gt;kind of &quot;made up&quot; affiliation, like a company or laboratory name=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;for when it goes into print.  Derek and Philip on this group both\n&gt; &gt;d=\r\nid that and have published late breaking papers at GECCO.  They\n&gt; &gt;have exp=\r\nerience in trying to publish without academic affiliation,\n&gt; &gt;so they may b=\r\ne able to give you some perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.  I usually only associate =\r\nthe idea of submitting a paper to \na \n&gt; conference with also attending the =\r\nconference, which is not so \neasy \n&gt; for me...  But I guess that&#39;s just bec=\r\nause in the past I \nencountered \n&gt; things the other way around.  First gett=\r\ning sent to a conference \nand \n&gt; then rushing together a paper or poster.  =\r\nI guess there&#39;s no \nactual \n&gt; requirement to be attending if you submit a p=\r\naper?  I mean for a \n&gt; poster there&#39;s kind-of no point unless you are there=\r\n to stand by \nit \n&gt; and field questions, but...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Note that the main ba=\r\nrrier to independent publishing in research \nis\n&gt; &gt;not lack of affiliation.=\r\n  In my opinion, it is style.  It took me\n&gt; &gt;years to learn the acceptable =\r\nmanner of speech, sectional \ndivisions,\n&gt; &gt;order of exposition, etc., for t=\r\nhis community.  And I had the\n&gt; &gt;benefit of a veteran (Risto) constantly co=\r\nrrecting and rewording\n&gt; &gt;everything I wrote.  Without that, you may end up=\r\n sounding like \nyou\n&gt; &gt;are an outsider.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.  What is &quot;this communit=\r\ny&quot;?  i.e. how wide does the style \n&gt; spread.  I have written papers in the =\r\npast, but they were for \n&gt; biochemistry and you are quite right, when I rea=\r\nd CS papers these \n&gt; days the style always does subtly jar with me.  But ar=\r\ne all CS \npapers \n&gt; the same, or does the GA/NN/EC etc etc community have i=\r\nts own sub-\nstyle?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;And that&#39;s a subtle problem, because being able to=\r\n write good \nprose\n&gt; &gt;is not the same as knowing the customs and convention=\r\ns of a\n&gt; &gt;particular research community.  Researchers can tell when non-\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;researchers submit papers because they break all the conventions\n&gt; &gt;unwitt=\r\ningly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Being me, I would probably break some of them sarcastically :)\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;So the conclusion is that you need to be really careful about\n&gt; &gt;foll=\r\nowing the conventions of your predecessors.  It is not\n&gt; &gt;impossible to do,=\r\n but it is a point most people outside academic\n&gt; &gt;communities don&#39;t apprec=\r\niate since they don&#39;t necessarily realize\n&gt; &gt;that there is such a strong se=\r\nt of conventions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Ken, this is most encouraging.  The hint abou=\r\nt conferences \nis \n&gt; a good one and well taken, because I always used to ha=\r\nte the great \n&gt; long delays that any communication with journals seemed to =\r\n\n&gt; require.  GECCO is clearly a prime conference to choose.  And IEEE \n&gt; CI=\r\nG I like because I know the organisers (although really I would \n&gt; excuse m=\r\nyself from reviewing my own paper, obviously).  Are there \nany \n&gt; other con=\r\nferences that leap to mind as obvious choices?\n&gt; \n&gt; The other nice thing ab=\r\nout conference papers is often they are \n&gt; required to be very short.  I do=\r\n like terse, even if I can&#39;t \nalways do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; What would a good made up =\r\naffiliation look like?  Is doing that \nquite \n&gt; legit?  I mean, err, well i=\r\nt seems a bit dodgy in some sense I \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; put my finger on....\n&gt; \n&gt; ((O=\r\nK, so it&#39;s late at night and I&#39;m blithering now, I&#39;ll sign off))\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
