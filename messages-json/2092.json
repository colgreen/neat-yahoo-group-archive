Now if we could exploit the \n&gt;translation and rotation of _parts_ of the Go board...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suppose you could use this technique (does it have a concise \nmathematical term?) to the input from a roving eye, thus removing the \nneed for an ANN to drive the rotation of the eye itself. This does then \nmean that the eye is must analyse what it sees in isolation of what it \njust saw - e.g. normally it might detect patterns larger than the eye \nitself by sweeping over an area, but if we rotate the inputs then we \nbreak this kind of approach... unless we inform the eye of what rotation \nit is currently in. Has any of the people doing roving eye experiments \nused this approach of factoring out rotational invariance?\n\n&gt;\n&gt;OK, lets look at a 2x2 board.  There are four cells, which we can label \n&gt;with letters:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk yeh, thanks for explanation. This definitely sounds familair, perhaps \nyou mentioned this in previous discussions. I definitely sounds like a \nsuperior approach to mine - that of playing opponents at all rotations - \nand I suspect it will definitely produce better players if I just switch \nmy dominace chain experiment to this. The network&#39;s don&#39;t have to cover \nthe same strategies from different rotations (which they see as \ndifferent strategies) so the networks can perform better with less \ncomplexity, which in turn makes for faster evolution. And far fewer \ngames are requried per evaluation, which speeds things up again. We are \nartificially helping NEAT along here a little, ideally NEAT would evolve \na sub-network to do this work itself, but it still makes for an \ninteresting experiment and the technique is potentially applicable to \nmany other domains. It&#39;s certainly one to keep in teh ole tool belt :)\n\n&gt;It doesn&#39;t matter how you select the canonical board, any consistent \n&gt;approach will do.  Obviously there may be some benefit to the networks if \n&gt;the boards are chosen with some sort of systematic approach and for that \n&gt;this way is quite good, because it is equivalent to attempting to place as \n&gt;the filled squares first at the top, and then on the right.  You can even \n&gt;tweak the encoding to give even more geometric choices, as long as no \n&gt;ambiguities (boards with the same code) are introduced.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suppose it&#39;s possible to have all kinds of really complex encodings, \nsome of which may include knowledge of particular board games and what \npatterns are important to that game. Or perhaps we could devise a \nparameterised encoding that could be controlled by an ANN - I&#39;ll leave \nthat for someone with more IQ points than me to think about, I think \nI&#39;ve reached my limit :)\n\n&gt;In practise, you might want to encode using 0 (empty), 1 (me), 2 (him) and \n&gt;-1 might be better for the last case so that enemy pieces tend to get \n&gt;sorted to the opposite corner.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, this is what I&#39;m doing in my current experiments, I think I use \n-1,0,1 though. Same thing.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I bet I can get there before you... 2mins :)\n&gt;\n&gt;The milestone for delivery of the future has been put back again.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nhmm, I think you missed it. It&#39;s been and gone already.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
