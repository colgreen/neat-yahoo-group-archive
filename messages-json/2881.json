No transfer function. Effect is just =\r\nto \ndelay a\n&gt; node update by one firing cycle.\n&gt; Does that feel like a reas=\r\nonable approach to implementing\n&gt; an evolvable time delay?\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a few pointers:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Debug every function as soon as you cr=\r\neate it.  For exampe, \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; you write mutate_add_node, apply it to som=\r\ne dummy genomes and \nmake \n&gt; &gt; sure it really works.  Doing this will save =\r\nyou a lot of \ndebugging \n&gt; &gt; time at the end, because if you only start deb=\r\nugging after the \nwhole \n&gt; &gt; thing is created it will be very difficult to =\r\ntease apart all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; interlocking parts to find what&#39;s causing a bug.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Memory leaks can happen in C++ with all the dynamic memory \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nllocation (and cleanup) that NEAT requires so be careful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -To test=\r\n yout system when it&#39;s complete, use XOR.  It&#39;s not a \nvery \n&gt; &gt; interestin=\r\ng experiment, but it usually catches major problems, \nlike \n&gt; &gt; way off par=\r\nameterizations and things like that.

I&#39;m thinking of writing my own NE=\r\nAT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation from scratch, rather than modify one of the \nexisti=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; releases. The main reasons are fisrtly, to improve my \nunderstandi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and secondly to give me the flexibility to add any extra bits \nI \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might be interesting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Based on some suggestions posted=\r\n here, I hope to include some \nform \n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time delay as well as the=\r\n ability to use a range of different \n&gt; &gt; transfer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; functions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s probably going to be written in C++ under MS windows. My \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\nterest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the moment is oriented to applying NEAT to analysis of \nnoi=\r\nsy \n&gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; series data.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would appreciate any suggestio=\r\nns, pitfalls, feature-wishes, \nlessons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learnt etc, that may be useful=\r\n for me to know in advance in \nthis. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
