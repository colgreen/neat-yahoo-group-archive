Note that randomChoice has \nto =\r\nbe random every time you refer to it. If it is not random (i.e. \noutside th=\r\ne big loop) then you choose links from either parent. But if \nit is inside =\r\nthe loop, then you choose a gene randomly from either \nparent. Check this o=\r\nut and you will have a clearer picture if there is \na bug or not. \nBut the =\r\ncloning issue is a deeper one.

In\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT the crossover is different, there you=\r\n actually do a \nregular\n&gt; &gt; NEAT evolution of networks that build other net=\r\nworks based on the\n&gt; &gt; substrate configuration. That is, you only mate and =\r\nmutate the \nCPPNs.\n&gt; &gt; But in the case you get lots of individuals with equ=\r\nal fitness, I\n&gt; &gt; guess these individuals are clones. Perhaps the code freq=\r\nuently\n&gt; &gt; chooses the same individuals for mating? You can try to avoid th=\r\nis \nby\n&gt; &gt; introducing a loop in which you try candidates for a &quot;father&quot; th=\r\nat \nare\n&gt; &gt; not compatible with the mother, that is, when their compatibili=\r\nty\n&gt; &gt; distance is 0.00, try again. There is another possibility, simply\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; every mutation disturbs the CPPN and therefore the produced \nnetwork is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; changed in such a magnitude that is has no chance for survival and \nis\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; discarded. Even though there is speciation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello =\r\nall-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does crossover do anything in PNEAT and HyperNEAT?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; PNEAT:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If I am reading the code correctly, during crossover, if the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; substrates are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same (i.e. all links have the same ID), which =\r\nis always the \ncase\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; P-NEAT, *all* of the link values are taken =\r\nfrom either parent1 or\n&gt; &gt; parent2.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t it more normal when crossing=\r\n over to take some from parent1\n&gt; &gt; and some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from parent2? Why grab al=\r\nl from just one?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This means that in PNEAT crossover does nothing=\r\n, right? It will\n&gt; &gt; always grab\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the substrate of parent1 or the subst=\r\nrate of parent2.  If I track\n&gt; &gt; parent and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; offspring fitness, 100% of=\r\n the time the child has the exact same\n&gt; &gt; fitness as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one of the two p=\r\narents.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; On to HyperNEAT:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I tracked the fitness of eac=\r\nh parent and the resulting offspring.\n&gt; &gt; The odd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing is that the or=\r\nganisms that are crossed only (i.e. they are\n&gt; &gt; never\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mutated) have t=\r\nhe *exact* same fitness of one of their parents\n&gt; &gt; 98.88% of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time=\r\n. In 20 runs, that was only 136 orgs out of 12257 that were\n&gt; &gt; crossed ove=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and not mutated. That seems wrong, doesn&#39;t it? Why would these \nnew\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; links\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have such a small impact? It turns out that this is because =\r\n\nnearly\n&gt; &gt; every\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time that there is an extra link that gets placed in=\r\n the child, \nthe\n&gt; &gt; parent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that donated that link is also the parent =\r\nwhose weights are being\n&gt; &gt; grabbed,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; meaning that the crossover is onl=\r\ny copying the parent (hence the\n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fitness). It seems to me that=\r\n crossover should be much more\n&gt; &gt; disruptive, no?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; As a fi=\r\nnal test, I did a set of hyperneat and pneat runs with the\n&gt; &gt; default\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &#39;MutateOnlyProbability&#39; parameter set to .25, so 25% of orgs \nnever\n&gt; &gt; ar=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; candidates for crossover. I then ran experimental treatments\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hy=\r\nperneat-noCross and pneat-noCross where the \nMutateOnlyProbability\n&gt; &gt;&gt; par=\r\nameter was set to 1, so no orgs were crossed over. Despite my\n&gt; &gt; comments\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; above, Hyperneat (with cross) did beat HyperNEAT-noCross, however\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; difference was not tremendous (although it does seem to be\n&gt; &gt; sta=\r\ntistically\n&gt; &gt;&gt; significant). For p-neat, the reverse was true. Nevertheles=\r\ns, \nthis\n&gt; &gt; is not a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perfect test of whether crossover pays dividends=\r\n, because if\n&gt; &gt; crossover does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing most of the time, and I increa=\r\nse MutateOnlyProbability \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; .25 to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1, I have effectively raised=\r\n the mutation rate (only 80% of \ncrossed\n&gt; &gt; orgs are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; also mutated).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Are these the intended consequences of crossover, or am I missing=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; something?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolu=\r\ntion Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
