Since\ngenes in NEAT are traditionally monoploid (having only one set of\ngenes), but we thought about doing a diploid representation (two sets\nof genes, one from each parent). You could then use dominant/recessive\nmarkers for genes to determine which ones are expressed. You could\nalso experiment with blending, for example in connection weights,\nwhere there is neither a recessive nor dominant expression, but some\nblended function of the two (e.g. an average of the two). And if you\nwanted to get really weird, you could implement polyploidy, where each\nindividual has any number of sets of genes (e.g. each individual could\nhave 10 parents).\n\nI&#39;d be interested to see some data from a direct comparison of an\nimplementation with and without recessive genes, so if you&#39;re going to\ndo it, let us know.\n\n--Derek\n\nOn Nov 14, 2007 10:11 AM, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Has there been any work to date on implementing recessive genes in a\n&gt;  NEAT genome?
