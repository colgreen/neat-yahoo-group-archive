It is about how it all started. \n\nWell, we all assume that ever=\r\nything started with single-cell \norganisms like the amoeba and the bacteria=\r\n. So, these cells were \nliving a nice life but suddenly colonies appeared. =\r\nMany single-cell \norganisms living together. We also assume that the multi-=\r\ncell \norganisms (like us) have evolved from such colonies. \n\nBut how this h=\r\nappened? Some bacteria mutated and added a new gene \nthat guided it to form=\r\n groups with the other ones? It is really \ninteresting. In order to underst=\r\nand the underlying mechanisms of \ncomplexification in nature, we should kno=\r\nw how this happened. \n\nI don&#39;t think that just a single new gene can tell t=\r\nhe cell to form \ncomplex relationships with others. Perhaps I am wrong, but=\r\n since we \nknow that the organisms at present time evolved via complexifica=\r\ntion, \nthe answer to the question of &quot;what was the genetic change that \ntur=\r\nned single-cell organisms into multi-cell organisms&quot; is essential. \n\nBeside=\r\ns, there is something that can even break the evolution theory. \nAn example=\r\n is the bacteria&#39;s propeller tail. It is a very complex \nmechanism composed=\r\n of many parts depending on each other. How did \nthis evolve? What was that=\r\n gene appearance? This just cannot evolve \ngradually, it is a &quot;jump&quot; in evo=\r\nlution. I know that the populations \nget separated into species within thei=\r\nr own niches but the quiestion \nof how this evolved is not answered yet.\n\nP=\r\neter\n\n\n"}}
