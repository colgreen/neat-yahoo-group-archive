BTW I think you mean /Geoffrey/ Hinton, I was going suggest you\nlook at his RBM work. You&#39;re right that RBMs don&#39;t grow, not unless\nthere&#39;s some later work I&#39;m unaware of. Makes me wonder if another\ninteresting approach would be to evolve simple rules for modifying\nnetworks (including structure changes) in an attempt to find such a\nsystem. Sort of like a set of co-evolved Genetic Programs that operate\non networks and change their structure and weights.\n\nIf we look at human brains then babies start out with pretty big\nbrains so it would seem there&#39;s some degree of &#39;blank canvas&#39; to that\nstrategy - trim away unused connections and strengthen used ones, as\noppsed to starting minimally and building up. But then I&#39;m assuming\nthat the sensory input in the womb isn&#39;t enough to /start/ building a\nmodel of the world - which is almost certainly wrong, to some extent\nanyway.\n\nBut yeh, it&#39;s an interesting question.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
