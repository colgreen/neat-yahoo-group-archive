Set this to =\r\n2.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can also make the WindowRadius smaller.  It is currently 6 - \nt=\r\nry \n&gt; 4 or 5.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another option would be to set Replicates to 1, and Numb=\r\nerOfGhosts \n&gt; to 0.  This will have PacMan roaming around eating dots and \n=\r\nPowerUps \n&gt; with no ghotst like the example WMV I have.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it still cr=\r\nashes with these, I obviously have much more work to \n&gt; do.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kirk\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; n=\r\newtwist2000 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is some brief explanation of the inpu=\r\nts used in that \nfile. \n&gt; As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it stands, the inputs are based on a win=\r\ndow centered around \n&gt; PacMan\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; re: Inputs..  I wonder if some globa=\r\nl information in addition to \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; local observations may be useful?=\r\n  For example, you may divide \nthe \n&gt; grid \n&gt; &gt; up into 2x2 (quadrants), or=\r\n even 3x3 (nonants?), and make \n&gt; observations \n&gt; &gt; thusly.  You may even m=\r\nake these observations linear (rather than \n&gt; &gt; binary), for example based =\r\non number of ghosts/food/etc in a \n&gt; section, or \n&gt; &gt; the weighted distance=\r\n of all ghosts/food/etc from the center of a \n&gt; &gt; section.  With such added=\r\n global information, you&#39;d also need to \n&gt; provide \n&gt; &gt; input as to where P=\r\nacMan currently resides (so he might know \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; section is most relev=\r\nant).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And of course, this problem is screaming for HyperNEAT.  :)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW - mine did crash after I hit B and waited a few generations.  =\r\n\n&gt; I got \n&gt; &gt; no exception dialog though, it just disappeared.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sti=\r\nll, good work!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Steve\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
