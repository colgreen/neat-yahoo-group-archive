I did submit a solution prior to the \ndeadline but it was quite a poor one, visiting only 10 of the 30 \ncoordinates.\n\nAnyway here is the league table that shows my entries from today:\n\nhttp://algoval.essex.ac.uk:8080/ptsp/League.jsp?mapName=Map-30-g5\n\nThe SharpNEAT entries are some way off the best solutions, however the \nANN controller is only half of the problem,  the actual route followed \nby the controller is actually the shortest route (optimum TSP solution) \nand there is therefore potential for using the evolved controller in a \nconventional evolutionary search to find a better route.\n\nAlso note the &#39;Bob/PerlGP/anymap&#39; entries which I understand to be using \na similar approach using an evolved controller - and judging by the \nnumbers Bob is generating I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s probably using the same \nroute as me.\n\nI&#39;ll probably post more details of this next week. It&#39;s also likely \nthere will be a general discussion on the GP group after the PTSP GECCO \nsession on Tuesday.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
