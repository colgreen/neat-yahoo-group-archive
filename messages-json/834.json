My ultimate\ngoal is to explore NEAT and co-evolution as applied to\nTexas Hold&#39;em.  No dreams of a super player but it\ncombines two interests of mine.\n\nIt basically boils down to learning enough c++/c# to\nimplement a poker simulation or implementing NEAT in\npython since I already have the poker sim done.\n\nI&#39;ll keep the list posted as to any progress I make. \nI have a few more implementation questions that I&#39;ll\ntry and put down in an orderly fashion soon.\n\nKarl\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Karl,\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, are you making your own implementation\n&gt; of NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
