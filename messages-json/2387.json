But when I set it a bit lower, I end up with 100\n&gt;species of 1 chromosome after some 100 generations. I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt;find the golden middle. On his FAQ\n&gt;(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html), Kenneth Stanley\n&gt;himself presents a method to automatically set the speciation\n&gt;threshold by descreasing or increasing it with, say, 0.3, whenever the\n&gt;number of species becomes more or less than a preset target amount of,\n&gt;say, 10.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, when I apply this method (with population size 100 and target\n&gt;species count 10), then after some 100 generations I end up with 20 to\n&gt;25 species and a speciation threshold of 40 and rising. Of the\n&gt;resulting species, one specie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\n&gt;contain 5 chromosomes or less and 10 species contain just one chromosome.\n&gt;\n&gt;Has anyone else encountered such problems before, or have some idea to\n&gt;what might be causing this? How do you keep a &#39;normal&#39; amount of more\n&gt;or less equally sized species?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
