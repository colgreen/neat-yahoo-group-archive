I mean, the game told me that I should evolve a\nbrain to follow and=\r\n a brain to flee, but during training I got little\nfeedback on if I was doi=\r\nng things right or not. Maybe it would help if you\ncould select a target be=\r\nhavior during training such that the game could\ngive you better feedback on=\r\n your progress.\n\nAlso, despite the tooltips, some of the objectives weren&#39;t=\r\n very clear to\nme. For example, I am not sure what the exact difference is =\r\nbetween keeping\na certain distance and reaching a certain distance, nor how=\r\n exactly this\ninteracts with the &#39;- Distance&#39; slider. For example, I assume=\r\nd that keeping\na distance of 1 meter would cause the robots to drive toward=\r\ns the target\nand stop at 1 meter distance, but looking at the results and n=\r\numbers during\nevolution I am really not sure if that is true. Another examp=\r\nle is the\n&#39;move around&#39; objective. When I tried to evolve a brain that woul=\r\nd stand\nstill and do nothing I set the &#39;move around&#39; slider to -100. When I=\r\n ran\nevolution, rather than standing still the robots would instead start t=\r\no\nmove towards the center of the arena. That said, the weapon based\nobjecti=\r\nves were clear to me, and seemed to work as expected.\n\nLastly, I think that=\r\n the numbers shown during evolution are a bit\nconfusing. For example, at so=\r\nme point I had something like a &#39;Best Fitness&#39;\nof 1049, an &#39;Evolution&#39; of +=\r\n623 and a &#39;Keep distance&#39; of 5115, and I had no\nclue how those numbers were=\r\n supposed to relate to each other. I mean, my\nfitness wasn&#39;t improving by +=\r\n623 because my previous fitness was also\naround 1000, and I didn&#39;t know how=\r\n a &#39;Keep distance&#39; of 5115 would\ntranslate to a fitness of 1049. I wonder i=\r\nf there are ways to make these\nnumbers more intuitive.\n\nThat said, I did ha=\r\nve some fun with game (I managed to beat the final\nboss), and I am looking =\r\nforward to any updates and expansions, if they are\nplanned. Making a compel=\r\nling game based on evolutionary algorithms is a\ndifficult but interesting c=\r\nhallenge, and this game provides a great start.\n\nBest regards,\nJoost Huizin=\r\nga\n\n\nOn Sun, Aug 10, 2014 at 6:03 PM, Sebastian Risi sebastian.risi@gmail.c=\r\nom\n[neat] &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m happy to ann=\r\nounce our new game Evolve, made by Daniel Jallov, a master\n&gt; student at ITU=\r\n supervised by myself and Julian Togelius.\n&gt;\n&gt; The game consists of two maj=\r\nor parts: an evolution part where neural\n&gt; networks are evolved using NEAT,=\r\n and a battle part where players use the\n&gt; evolved networks to control thei=\r\nr robots.
