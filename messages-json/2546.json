I suggested this to allow the archives to be searched via the \nlikes of google, e.g. someone out there could be thinking about some of \nthe same stuff as us - but they won&#39;t find our discussions via google if \nthe archive is closed. So hopefully opening up the archive will attract \nsome people it might not have done otherwise. As others have said, I \nsuspect the drop-off in posting frequency and new members is a seasonal \nthing + maybe a bit of a statistical abberation.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
