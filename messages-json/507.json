However I do think\n&gt; that if the overall \n&gt; problem is broken down into smaller problems then\n&gt; each in turn is doable \n&gt; - some moreso than others. You say that your model\n&gt; is a greatly \n&gt; simplified version of a real world task, which is\n&gt; true but I think that \n&gt; if you removed the simulation of motors and motor\n&gt; control signals from \n&gt; your model you would have something which matches\n&gt; what I described in my \n&gt; email as the high-level control. With a few\n&gt; modifications this could \n&gt; then be pluged-in to a larger system (each part\n&gt; developed/evolved \n&gt; largely indepently of the others) to form part of a\n&gt; real world solution.\n\nI agree that I would be simulating the highest level\ncontrol task related to steering and power usage.  The\nmethods I use, if succesful, could theoretically be\napplied to a real robot, but it would be difficult,\nbecause a fairly accurate simulation of the entire\nreal situation is required in order to perform\nneuroevolution.  Developing this simulation is the\ndifficult part.  We cannot perform neuroevolution in\nthe actual vehicle, but only in a computer simulation.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
