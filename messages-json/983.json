Bloat is a term from\n&gt;&gt;Genetic Programming that referred to the accumulation of extraneous\n&gt;&gt;structure over the *entire population* that didn&#39;t help improve\n&gt;&gt;fitness.  In general they were looking at a situaton where everyone\n&gt;&gt;was getting bigger for no good reason.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, this is something we&#39;ve discussed before, and I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re\n&gt;going to come to a consensus on the issue.  But I&#39;d argue that &quot;bloat&quot;\n&gt;is an appropriate term to use if the *average* complexity of the\n&gt;population is increasing unnecessarily.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree with that, but we disagree about what structures are unnecessary.\n\n&gt;You say that I was only describing a situation where the mutation\n&gt;rates are too high.  Well, wouldn&#39;t you term that bloat?  If you take\n&gt;a simple problem and apply NEAT to it, and have two runs, one where\n&gt;the mutation rates are double the other, NEAT will still solve the\n&gt;problem.  By the end of both runs, there will be a range of\n&gt;complexity, as you describe.  There will be complex networks and\n&gt;simple networks.  But in the run with doubled mutation rates, both the\n&gt;*average* complexity and the complexity of the champion will be\n&gt;unnecessarily higher.\n&gt;\n&gt;You would consider this bloat, wouldn&#39;t you? \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nConsider the problem from the other direction then. If all of of these \nuseless structures aren&#39;t participating positively in a search (on the \nwhole) then every single improvement seen in a population must come from \nimmediately beneficial single mutations. So if at the end of a run I \ntake the champion and trace back through its ancestors I will see a \nsteady line of single improvements, each of which *immediately* improved \nthe fitness and ultimately resulted in the champion. And *every* neuron \nthat was added in this ancestoral line was immediately beneficial by way \nof the non-linearity it introduced. I just can&#39;t see that this would be \nthe case...\n\n[quote from previous post]\n\n&gt;But again, if we&#39;re just talking about a single neuron, why not just\n&gt;allow for a single mutation to bring about that new functionality,\n&gt;instead of keeping redundant features around, waiting for them to be\n&gt;connected?  The former is much more efficient than the latter.\n&gt;\nOk but this is what happens now. What I&#39;m saying is that that neuron \nwon&#39;t always become immediately beneficial. As connection mutations \noccur in later generations we then try connecting that neuron to other \n(already existing/functional) neurons, this searching through possible \nconnections could then result in an improvement in fitness that \ncapitalises on the non-linearity of the new neuron. As you&#39;re going \nabout this search you&#39;re going to create some junk and spin off new, \nmore complex species with junk in them, but I see that as a necessary \npart of the search process - if you don&#39;t try these structures you&#39;ll \njust get stuck because there may not be any one mutation that can get \nyou out of the local optimum. This is why I was refering to jumps in \nevolution and the importance of smooth fitness functions instead of \nlarge steps, a nice smooth function allows you to make small incremental \nmutations towards building a champion genome, but if there are steps, \neven small ones, then you need some degree of &#39;blind-faith&#39; in your \nsearch strategy in order to get out of the local optimum.\n\nI&#39;m reminded of past arguments that creationists have used against \nevolution,  it goes something like - &quot;I can&#39;t see how some biological \nstructures came about because they seem like too much of a jump, there \ndoesn&#39;t seem to be any possible gradual evolutionary steps that produced \ncertain structures. therefore they were designed.&quot;  I think this is \nbecause sometimes jumps are made, so e.g. a piece of  DNA that codes for \na single protein might get accidentally copied into part of the genome \nthat describes high-level morphology and instead of describing a protein \nit now describes, say, a vibration sensitive hair. It&#39;s not at all very \nsensitive, but better than nothing since it allows you to detect your \nnoisy predators! Now, gradual incremental mutations can improve on that \nhair and over time produce a cochlea and with the help of a few other \nlittle jumps - a complete ear.\n\nSo anyway, what I was proposing was a method of getting the best of both \nworlds. If excess structure is important then keep it, but if the search \nhas stagnated for a period of time then I would say that the excess \nstructures have now had plenty of time to prove themselves - and failed. \nThey have crossed the line from being possible useful structures into \nbeing useless junk (bloat). So I propose switching the search into trim \nmode, once this has settled down (genomes no longer getting smaller) we \nresume the normal search, building up excess structures once again.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
