A node receives inputs that \nare fed i=\r\nnto an activation function.  The activation function &quot;fires&quot; \nan output som=\r\newhat comparable to a synapse firing.  As implemented in \nANN&#39;s, the same o=\r\nutput value (its &quot;energy&quot; as it were) from the node is \nfed through weighte=\r\nd links to other nodes.  What would be the effect of \nimposing a sort of &quot;c=\r\nonservation of energy&quot; principal on the ANN?  \n\nIsn&#39;t it the case that in a=\r\nn actual neural net, when a neuron fires its \ntotal energy is distributed s=\r\nomehow to its connecting neurons.  The \ntotal energy received by the connec=\r\nted neurons can not be more than the \nenergy generated by the sending neuro=\r\nn.  What if in an ANN, the value \ncoming from a node was split evenly betwe=\r\nen the outgoing links?  And \nfor the receiving nodes, the sum of the weight=\r\ned inputs could not \nexceed the total energy generated by the sending nodes=\r\n.  Would there be \nany benefit to forcing this restriction on an ANN?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
