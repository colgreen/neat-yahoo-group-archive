In this \ncase, the dimensionality of the clone node=\r\n may reasonably carry with \nit the dimensionality of the original.\n\nA true =\r\nsubstrate hidden (i.e. not a computational dupe), would not \nhave a clear d=\r\nimensionality associated with it. So the question is, \nis there a meaningfu=\r\nl way to present a true substrate hidden node to \na hypercube network, or s=\r\nimply have the hypercube network ignore the \ntrue substrate hidden nodes, a=\r\nnd evolve the true substrate hidden \nnodes and associated connections to wh=\r\natever, in the substrate \nnetwork separate from the hypercube network (i.e.=\r\n hypercube network \nonly operates on &quot;b&quot; & &quot;c&quot; for PSIs and PSOs, and their=\r\n clones).\n\nOther thoughts and/or comments are appreciated!\nThanks,\n   Andy =\r\nCarl\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Give=\r\nn an arbitrary point &quot;P&quot; in design space, comprised of the \n&gt; following:\n&gt; =\r\n(a) problem specific inputs (PSIs);\n&gt; (b) auxiliary additional parameters a=\r\nssociated w/ PSIs;\n&gt; (c) problem specific outputs (PSOs);\n&gt; (d) auxiliary a=\r\ndditional parameters associated w/ PSOs;\n&gt; \n&gt; An instance of a struct of it=\r\nems identified in (a) through (d) \nabove, \n&gt; which taken together comprise =\r\na design point P[i], a vector of \nwhich \n&gt; comprises the current substrate =\r\nresolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Substrate Inputs: comprised of PSIs, &quot;a&quot; above;\n&gt; Substrat=\r\ne Outputs: comprised of PSOs, &quot;c&quot; above;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hypercube Inputs: comprised o=\r\nf auxiliary additional parameters \n&gt; associated w/ PSIs & PSOs, &quot;b&quot; & &quot;d&quot; a=\r\nbove;\n&gt; Hypercube Output: weight between current pair of nodes\n&gt; \n&gt; Questio=\r\nns:\n&gt; (1) When the dimensionality of &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; differ, how is the \n&gt; hype=\r\nrcube input topology reconciled?\n&gt; (2) Are there different hypercube networ=\r\nks depending on if the \n&gt; current node (input or output), is a substrate in=\r\nput, hidden or \n&gt; output node?\n&gt; (3) How are substrate hidden nodes handled=\r\n when the hypercube is \n&gt; focused on the associated connecting substrate we=\r\night?
