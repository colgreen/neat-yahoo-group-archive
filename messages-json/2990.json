I realize you haven&#39;t worked on the code\nin a=\r\n long time, so I&#39;ll try to keep my questions as conceptual as\npossible.\n\nTo=\r\n that end, I have one more question.  The mutate_add_node method\ntries to f=\r\nind an eligible link to insert a new node into.  To\ndetermine eligibility, =\r\nit looks at 2 criteria:\n1. Is the link enabled\n2. Is the input node of the =\r\nlink a bias node\n\nWhy does criteria #2 exclude the link from having a node =\r\ninserted into it?\n\nThanks,\nWesley\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth St=\r\nanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hmm let me try to recall the reasoning I h=\r\nad several years ago when \n&gt; I wrote that function :) \n&gt; \n&gt; First, I should=\r\n note that I rarely ever use mutate_toggle_enable \n&gt; (its probability is us=\r\nually set to zero in my runs).  I have found \n&gt; it to be mainly just disrup=\r\ntive.  However, others here have \n&gt; developed more principled ways of pruni=\r\nng networks which probably \n&gt; work better than my random toggler.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a=\r\nny case, I believe that you are correct- if you really want to \n&gt; keep ever=\r\nything together in the network then it would be necessary \n&gt; to check both =\r\nthe in-node and out-node.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tan=\r\nsey4&quot; &lt;tansey4@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m working on my own impl=\r\nementation of NEAT using the rtNEAT code \n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; a starting point.  I am =\r\non the mutation operators and had a \n&gt; question\n&gt; &gt; about  Genome::mutate_t=\r\noggle_enable(int times).  When the method \n&gt; finds\n&gt; &gt; a gene to disable (i=\r\nf the gene is enabled), it does a check to see \n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; it can do this wit=\r\nhout fragmenting the network.  The comment says:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We need to make=\r\n sure that another gene connects out of the in-\n&gt; node\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because if not=\r\n a section of network will break off and become \n&gt; isolated\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My que=\r\nstion is does it only check the in_nodes and not the \n&gt; out_nodes?\n&gt; &gt;  If =\r\nwe don&#39;t check out_nodes, wouldn&#39;t it be possible for the \n&gt; outputs\n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n become disconnected from the network?  If you have a network of \n&gt; 1\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nnput and 2 output nodes, where the input is connected to both\n&gt; &gt; outputs, =\r\nwouldn&#39;t this method consider it valid to disable one of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; connect=\r\nions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
