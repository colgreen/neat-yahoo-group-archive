Indeed I think thi=\r\ns issue has come up from time to time.  I agree with your sentiment about t=\r\nhe second equation being better and it is the one we used and that is imple=\r\nmented in my version of NEAT.  However, we included the normalization terms=\r\n in our publications (noting that they don&#39;t need to be used) because we we=\r\nre not certain that the time whether normalization might turn out important=\r\n at large network sizes.  So we wanted to at least raise the possibility.  =\r\nUnfortunately it resulted in some confusion over what was the &quot;standard&quot; wa=\r\ny to do it.  In any case, I do generally endorse the second way but I think=\r\n both can be calibrated to work, as shown in ANJI, which does do the normal=\r\nization.\n\nI also believe there are likely more principled speciation approa=\r\nches than the kind of simplistic way it is done in my oriignal implementati=\r\non, as you have been exploring.  I&#39;m looking forward to seeing SharpNEAT 2.=\r\n0!\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alienseedpod&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier in the year I kicked off a discussion about =\r\ngenome compatibility metrics (AKA distance or similarity metrics). SharpNea=\r\nt 2 (SN2) is nearing release and allows metrics to be plugged and thus comp=\r\nared, there&#39;s a bit more to it than that and I&#39;m currently writing some doc=\r\numentation to explain how this will work along with some issues to keep in =\r\nmind, pros and cons, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway in writing up this stuff I ended up d=\r\nocumenting how the original metric works, as described in the original NEAT=\r\n paper in 2002. Now I&#39;ve got a suspicion that this came up long ago but in =\r\nthat paper the distance is given as:\n&gt; \n&gt;    d =3D c1*E/N + c2*D/N + c3*W\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; (E,D are the # of excess and disjoint genes. W is the total weight diff=\r\n).\n&gt; \n&gt; N is the number of genes in the longest genome. So the contribution=\r\n of excess/disjoint genes to d is normalized. In Ken&#39;s original code this e=\r\nquation is commented out and replaced with the equivalent of:\n&gt; \n&gt;    d =3D=\r\n c1*E + c2*D + c3*W\n&gt; \n&gt; This makes more sense to me, it puts far more emph=\r\nasis on the difference in topology than the first version and is sort of re=\r\nlated to edit distance and manhattan distance. \n&gt; \n&gt; For the record SN1 als=\r\no uses the latter equation and the other implementation I checked just now =\r\nwas ANJI2 which uses the former. Not sure what the implications of this are=\r\n but I suspect it would have a significant effect on speciation with second=\r\nary effects from there. Others may wish to review the metric in their imple=\r\nmentations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
