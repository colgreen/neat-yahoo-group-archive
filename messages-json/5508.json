However, I have some concerns abo=\r\nut the\nexperimental design in this paper:\n\n(1) You appear to be manipulatin=\r\ng two variables at once.  (a) whether the EA\nhas an objective and (b) wheth=\r\ner there is a human in the loop.  Surely you\nhave to pick only one at a tim=\r\ne and control for everything else, right?\n\n(2) Furthermore, if it&#39;s IGA v. =\r\nGA and &#39;interestingness&#39; is the evaluation\ncriteria, that ain&#39;t a fair figh=\r\nt.  Why should I believe there is more to it\nthan that?\n\n(3) How do we know=\r\n that intermediate objectives are in any way significant\nto discovering int=\r\neresting pictures in Picbreeder?  I have a sneaking\nsuspicion that totally =\r\nrandom search, followed by focused objective based\nsearch when something &#39;p=\r\nops&#39; might be just as effective, and that the\n&#39;intermediate objectives&#39;, wh=\r\nile certainly necessary to find a\n*particular*image, are not very helpful i=\r\nn general to finding\ninteresting images.  If\nso, this is no chink in the ar=\r\nmor of objective based search.  I suppose\nwithout intermediate objectives t=\r\nhere can be no exaptation, but does that\nmatter?  What percentage of evolve=\r\nd features in biological organisms have\nany exaptation at all in their hist=\r\nory?\n\n(4) Finally - and this is the big one - one of the deadly sins of Sci=\r\nence is\nclaiming a result as the objective a posteriori, a point which elud=\r\nes even\nsome very famous scientists.  It&#39;s what allows publications like\nth=\r\nis&lt;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/feeling-the-future-is-precogni=\r\ntion-possible/&gt;,\nwhich\n&#39;prove&#39; psychic phenomena by mining data for &#39;statis=\r\ntically significant&#39;\nresults.  The problem is, a result isn&#39;t significant u=\r\nnless you were\nspecifically attempting to confirm it when the experiment wa=\r\ns designed (i.e.\nalways follow up exploratory experiment with a confirmator=\r\ny experiment!).  I\nheartily endorse exploring for/marvelling at results you=\r\n weren&#39;t initially\nlooking for, but one should never use such results as th=\r\ne basis for any sort\nof comparison.  In the case of the eye experiment, who=\r\n cares if the GA\ncouldn&#39;t evolve the eye?  The IGA can&#39;t either, and the fa=\r\nct that it already\ndid is immaterial!  I could be persuaded that the IGA is=\r\n better at evolving\ninteresting images, but I do not believe it&#39;s any bette=\r\nr at evolving the\n&#39;eye&#39; (or &#39;dolphin&#39;, or &#39;apple&#39;).  In fact, I would bet t=\r\nhat&#39;s it&#39;s\n*worse*at evolving those specific images, intermediate objective=\r\ns\nnotwithstanding.\n\nAnyway, though I have a lot of doubts about this partic=\r\nular paper, I really\nappreciate these sorts of research directions.
