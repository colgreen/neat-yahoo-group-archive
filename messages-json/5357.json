The first bank is the binary e=\r\nncoding (01001 for node #9 for instance) for one node and the second bank i=\r\ns the same for the second node.\n\nI think it all depends on what kinds of pa=\r\ntterns you think might exist with respect to the node IDs I guess.  I mean,=\r\n if you think that all nodes whose IDs are divisible by 3 evenly are connec=\r\nted to those whose IDs are divisible by 3 with a modulus of 1, then doing a=\r\n different encoding scheme taking that into effect might work better.\n\nAgai=\r\nn, I&#39;m a NN novice and just starting to learn NEAT myself!\n\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p_mridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I a=\r\nm working on a bioinformatics problem, but it&#39;s easier to talk about it in =\r\ngraph theory terms....\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a graph with a large number of nodes (~9=\r\n000), and about 3000 edges between the nodes...
