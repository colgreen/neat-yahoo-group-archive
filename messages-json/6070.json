The paper can be viewed at: \n\nhttp://dx.plo=\r\ns.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062186\n\nThe article applies both abstract simul=\r\nations and neuroevolution to explore a non-adaptive explanation for increas=\r\ning evolvability in nature. Interestingy, understanding evolvability (the c=\r\napacity to further evolve) might lead not only to better understanding how =\r\ncomplex organisms evolve in nature, but may also provide insight into how t=\r\no design evolutionary algorithms that are better able to evolve complex art=\r\nifacts.\n\nMost existing theories for evolvability increase depend upon parti=\r\ncular selective scenarios, such as a species surviving through constantly c=\r\nhanging environments. However, the insight in the article is that evolvabil=\r\nity can instead arise spontaneously without natural selection acting at all=\r\n. The main idea is that if evolvability is heritable, then evolvable organi=\r\nsms separate themselves naturally from less evolvable organisms over time s=\r\nimply by their children becoming increasingly diverse and thereby spreading=\r\n further through the space of possible phenotypes. That is, the space of ph=\r\nenotypes itself can act like a filter that distinguishes evolvability.\n\nIn =\r\nthis way, when novel phenotypes appear in the future, they are most likely =\r\ndescendents of those that were evolvable in the past. The result is that ev=\r\nolvable species accumulate over time even without selective pressure. This =\r\nidea is supported by a variety of simulations where evolvability increases =\r\nwithout any pressure for organisms to out-compete each other.\n\nThose famili=\r\nar with novelty search will notice some conceptual parallels with Ken&#39;s and=\r\n my previous work on searching without objectives. Like novelty search, the=\r\n proposed non-adaptive hypothesis for evolvability may invite some controve=\r\nrsy because adaptive explanations for evolvability are intuitive and widely=\r\n-held. For example, researchers often worry about what kind of selective pr=\r\nessure will lead to evolvability, even in discussions in this group. One im=\r\nplication of this work could be that such worrying is unwarranted because t=\r\nhe best way to get evolvability may sometimes be to stop trying to select f=\r\nor it. In any case, despite any potential controversy, we hope that this al=\r\nternate perspective leads to constructive discussion and demonstrates the n=\r\need to question the assumption that evolvability requires particular select=\r\nive scenarios for it to increase.\n\nJoel\n\n\n"}}
