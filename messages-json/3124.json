If the decision is to receiv=\r\ne \nall inputs simultaneously, then you might as well just update the \nwhole=\r\n network for some set number of iterations rather than try to \nmodel the fl=\r\now in a way that might be hard for the network to train \non.\n\n--- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 11, 2007, at=\r\n 9:48 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to mention that Jason put a =\r\nlot of effort in to make this\n&gt; &gt; package user-friendly, both from the exec=\r\nutable and source code\n&gt; &gt; standpoint.\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn&#39;t run it (I&#39;d love an OS=\r\n X binary), but I took at look at  \n&gt; Jason&#39;s code for a few minutes last n=\r\night.

Network  \n&gt; order is easily dete=\r\nrmined via BFS.
