Also calculate average \ndistance to output.  Add the two together to get a &#39;total&#39; and then position \nthe node vertically based on the distance to the input as a percentage of \nthe total.  Then, if it has an average distance of 3 to the input, and an \naverage distance of 3 to the output, it will end up right in the middle.  If \nanother has an average distance of 2 to input and 2 to output, it ends up in \nthe same spot (vertically).\n\nBy the way, I&#39;d like to try my &#39;attraction/repulsion&#39; technique and see what \ncomes of it.  Would someone be willing to send me their most complicated / \ndifficult to render network and let me see what the technique comes up with?\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLimited-time offer: Fast, reliable MSN 9 Dial-up Internet access FREE for 2 \nmonths! \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=dept/dialup&pgmarket=en-us&ST=1/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"}}
