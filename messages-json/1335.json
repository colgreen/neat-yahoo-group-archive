So I made a minor \n&gt;modification that lets me first train it to do  2x.  Once it appears to be \n&gt;able to do 2x, I can up the expected amount of enlargement to 3x, 4x, 5x, \n&gt;and so on, until I max out forward progress.  That should make things \n&gt;progress much faster.  But we&#39;ll have to wait and see if theory meets \n&gt;reality. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi John,\n\nI suppose if you take the logic that we applied to Chad&#39;s cross product \nproblem then it would make more sense to test against a spread of \nenlargement/reduction factors on each evaluation. Otherwise you might \nsee overfitting at the enlargement end of the scale similar to the \nsignal averaging you observed with reduction.  I guess that would slow \nyour experiment down quite a lot though huh :(\n\nColin\n\n"}}
