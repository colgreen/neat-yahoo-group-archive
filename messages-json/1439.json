If the parents are of equal fitness then matching genes \nare selected from randomly (50% chance of getting gene from either \nparent), and ALL of the excess and disjoint genes from both parents are \nincluded.\n\nSo now I&#39;m trying to sort this out by going back to Ken&#39;s NEAT papers \nfor an explanation on the crossover technique, but I&#39;m having \ndifficulty. From &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary \nComplexification&quot;, section 3.2, paragraph 4:\n\n-----------------\n&quot;Through innovation numbers, the system now knows exactly which genes \nmatch up with which (Figure 4). Genes that do not match are either \n/disjoint/ or /excess/, depending on whether they occur within or \noutside the range of the other parent&#39;s innovation numbers. When \ncrossing over, the genes with the same innovation numbers are lined up \nand are randomly chosen for the offspring genome. Genes that do not \nmatch are inherited from the more fit parent, or if they are equally \nfit, from both parents randomly. Disabled genes have a 25% chance of \nbeing reenabled during crossover, allowing networks to make use of older \ngenes once again.&quot;\n-----------------\n\nSo I&#39;m doing a couple of things wrong:\n\n1) When genes match I take the gene from the fittest parent. Whereas I \nshould be randomly selecting from both parents. Right? Currently I only \nto this if both parent are equally fit.\n2) I am always including *all* excess and disjoint genes from the least \nfit parent.\n\n\nHowever I am not 100% sure how original NEAT works w.r.t this second \npoint...\n\n&quot;Genes that do not match are inherited from the more fit parent, or if \nthey are equally fit, from both parents randomly.&quot;\n\nSo just to be clear on this, this is saying that excess and disjoint \ngenes from the least fit parent are not used, right? and if both parents \nare equal, should I take all of the excess and disjoint genes from both \nparents or just some percentage of them? I think the term &#39;randomly&#39; in \nthis senetence is confusing me, does it mean that I should only be \nselecting a sub-set of the excess and disjoint genes from both parents, \nor is it merely alluding to the fact that the excess and disjoint genes \nare distributed acrosss the two parents, and that therefore we are \nselecting them from whichever parent they happen to be on, but it&#39;s not \nactually a random selection as such.\n\n\nSomething about this doesn&#39;t seem right to me. It means that the \ncrossover almost always only combines weight values, not topolgies. e.g. \nin my OCR experiment, if two different genomes have each discovered a \ndistinct beneficial input-output connection then the only way we can \ncombine the two genomes to get the benefit of both connections is if \nthey happen to have the same fitness, right?\n\nIf this is the case then I would have thought it would be better to use \nexcess and disjoint genes from the least fit parent more often, like \nwhen the parent are unequal.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
