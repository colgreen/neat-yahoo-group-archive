I have been trying to do much the same thing, exce=\r\npt\nrather than value prediction, I have been creating a trader that\nessenti=\r\nally decides to go short, long or take the 5th ;).  I&#39;ve had\nmixed success,=\r\n and not had the confidence to actually lay any money\nout yet.  It would be=\r\n interesting to know what input data sets have\nyou been using for the Forex=\r\n part of your paper, as I have tried all\nsorts of things including technica=\r\nl indicators etc.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Sidhant Dash =\r\n&lt;sidhantdash@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As part of an undergraduate research project, =\r\nI did implement\nsomething on those lines. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I worked on a NEAT bas=\r\ned approach to predicting a noisy financial\ntime series (Yen-USD exchange r=\r\nate). The original NEAT algorithm was\nmodified to start with an initial pop=\r\nulation of 3 different neural\nnetwork architectures, which included Elman n=\r\networks and MLPs apart\nfrom the normal recurrent networks that NEAT begins =\r\nwith. The networks\n(winners) produced by NEAT were then put through a conju=\r\ngate gradient\nbased optimization process, and finally the optimized network=\r\ns were\ncombined using an ensembling technique to produce the final results.=\r\n \n&gt;    \n&gt;   I personally think the local optimization is necessary when we =\r\nare\nusing NEAT to produce networks to accomplish tasks that require a high\n=\r\ndegree of precision. It kind of fine tunes the performance of the\nnetworks.=\r\n Ensembling then is one of the standard tools in the ML\nrepertoire to produ=\r\nce results that none of NEAT&#39;s &#39;winner&#39; networks\ncould individually produce=\r\n. \n&gt;    \n&gt;   A detailed project report is posted in the Files section.\n&gt;   =\r\n \n&gt;   regards\n&gt;   Sidhant\n&gt; \n&gt; aklein07 &lt;a.klein@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           Al=\r\nl,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken&#39;s papers mention (at least I think that they do) that (dynamic)=\r\n \n&gt; annealing of mutation rates might be advantageous in order to confine \n=\r\n&gt; global searching after a while to a promising region in search space. \n&gt; =\r\nHaving read some papers, I also found indications that a hybrid \n&gt; weight t=\r\nraining algorithm (global search by means of genetic \n&gt; algorithms and loca=\r\nl search using some gradient descent algorithm) \n&gt; might be able to produce=\r\n better results than genetic algorithm search \n&gt; alone. The reason is, that=\r\n each type of algorithm performs well \n&gt; mostly only in its specific field.=\r\n Has anyone further insights into \n&gt; this topic ? Has anyone tried to imple=\r\nment any of the approaches \n&gt; mentioned ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Also time delay network con=\r\nnections might provide improvements for \n&gt; some model estimation tasks. Has=\r\n anyone tested / implemented yet any \n&gt; of these ideas ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for an=\r\ny comments,\n&gt; Achim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fear is only as deep as th=\r\ne mind allows. \n&gt; --Japanese proverb \n&gt; \n&gt; My blog   \n&gt; \n&gt;  \t\t\n&gt; ----------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; Groups are talking.
