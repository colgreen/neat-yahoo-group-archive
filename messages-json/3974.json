Thanks for posting it.\n\nA question: how did HyperNEAT perform when you did not provide it with the\nrepeating coordinate frame for each agent? As you mention in the paper, this\nis something that HyperNEAT could learn on its own. I assume from the fact\nthat you added it that HyperNEAT was not doing a good job of learning this.\n\nIf that assumption is right, how bad was it at learning this problem\ndecomposition? One of the touted benefits of HyperNEAT, and generative\nencodings in general, is the ability to evolve a module and reuse it many\ntimes (potentially with variation).  Here the modularity of the problem was\ncleanly divided, and should have been relatively easy for HyperNEAT to\ndiscover. Do you find it disconcerting that it couldn&#39;t do so?\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed, 16 Apr 2008 22:48:44 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Another New Paper:  Multiagent HyperNEAT\n&gt; \n&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio and I discuss the potential for HyperNEAT\n&gt; controlling multiple heterogeneous agents in this new\n&gt; paper, &quot;Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning,&quot; to appear at\n&gt; GECCO 2008:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\n&gt; option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=28#dambrosio.gecco08\n&gt; \n&gt; Direct Link:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_gecco08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; We also have a nice sample of videos that depict various evolved\n&gt; teams in action:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/multiagenthyperneat\n&gt; \n&gt; The interesting idea in this paper is that just as a single\n&gt; connective CPPN can encode how a single network varies over space,\n&gt; it can also encode how a *set* of networks (each representing the\n&gt; policy of one agent on the team) varies over space.  In this way,\n&gt; HyperNEAT can learn an expression that encodes how policies vary\n&gt; over the team geometry.  For example, in a soccer team agents vary\n&gt; from defensive to offensive as you move away from the goal.  Part of\n&gt; the power of this approach is that it means basic skills can be\n&gt; learned and shared among the whole team, since the CPPN encodes how\n&gt; those skills vary across the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
