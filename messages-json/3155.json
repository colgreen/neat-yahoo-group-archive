An organism&#39;s fitness is then just  \ncalculated as the total fitness derived from playing against the  \nteachers. When some organism&#39;s MaxSolve fitness exceeds the  \npreviously inserted teacher&#39;s MaxSolve fitness, then that organism is  \ninserted into the teacher set. This approach implements the same  \nsolution concept (maximization of expected fitness), but its  \nconceptually much simpler than the true MaxSolve algorithm.  \nSpecifically we don&#39;t deal with the case where the teacher set gets  \nvery large, and thus evaluation time may grow linearly at each  \ngeneration. In practice though, at least for nothello, this never  \nturned out to be a problem computationally since we limit ourselves  \nto 200 evals.\n\nWe actually tried NEAT both with speciation on and off and it didn&#39;t  \nmake a significant difference in the final fitness v. random. I  \nsuppose you might construe that as evidence of bad interactions with  \nfitness sharing, but the coevolutionary version does outperform  \nstandard NEAT evolved against a random player, so I&#39;m not entirely sure.\n\n-- Joe\n\nOn Apr 14, 2007, at 12:00 AM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt; Joe, how did you program MaxSolve coevolution?

This research has some of the same goals as Ken&#39;s\n&gt; CPPN\n&gt;&gt; work, but the approach is quite different. Using a very simple\n&gt;&gt; &quot;indirect&quot; encoding of neural network weights that has some of the\n&gt;&gt; features found in GRNs in biology, we show (empirically) that both\n&gt;&gt; the final performance and sample complexity of NeuroEvolution can\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; improved in a coevolutionary setting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But the story gets even better: Making random mutations to the\n&gt;&gt; champions that result from the GRN-like encoding, we find that\n&gt;&gt; performance degrades much more slowly than when the same number of\n&gt;&gt; mutations are made to NEAT-encoded networks. Furthermore, if we\n&gt; plot\n&gt;&gt; this fitness degradation against network distance instead of\n&gt; mutation\n&gt;&gt; distance, we find that each mutation is having a vastly larger\n&gt;&gt; phenotypic effect on the GRN-encoded neural nets. In other words\n&gt;&gt; performance is decreasing /less/ even when we make /larger/\n&gt; changes\n&gt;&gt; to the network topology and weights. This kind of artifact is\n&gt; exactly\n&gt;&gt; what we&#39;d like to see in so-called &quot;evolvable&quot; encodings: The\n&gt;&gt; representation has learned to bias the effects of mutation towards\n&gt;&gt; better networks\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, this work is definitely still only a first step, but I\n&gt; find\n&gt;&gt; it very exciting. My paper is even going up against Ken&#39;s CPPN\n&gt; paper\n&gt;&gt; for the best paper award in the GDS track at GECCO.
