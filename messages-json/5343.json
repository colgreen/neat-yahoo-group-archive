Specifically, I plan on using=\r\n the candidate networks as neural network controllers for robots within Sta=\r\nge (sans Player).  I&#39;m totally new to HyperNEAT, so I&#39;m still figuring out =\r\njust how to 1) manage the populations and 2) how to distribute the candidat=\r\nes.  I&#39;m hoping to use the existing Experiment and ExperimentRun classes as=\r\n examples for 1).  For 2), I&#39;m thinking that I need to somehow take a Genet=\r\nicIndividual, serialize it for transmission to the client simulation and so=\r\nmehow turn it into the network on the client side.  Can I get a few newbie =\r\npointers on how the process should work?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
