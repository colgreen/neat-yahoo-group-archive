Has anybody else been\n&gt; down that p=\r\nath using NEAT, taking e.g. the weights evolved using NEAT\n&gt; & feeding them=\r\n into some standard BP software?\n&gt; 2) Has NEAT been used in any &#39;real world=\r\n&#39;/industrial applications yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; and a &#39;how long is a piece of string qu=\r\nestion&#39;...\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)  As yet  have no feel for how long the evolution might t=\r\nake. I&#39;ve\n&gt; ran a few of the downloaded sample executables they seem to tak=\r\ne quite\n&gt; a while to run. My neural net has 8 inputs, one output and if we =\r\nguess\n&gt; at a final neural net of 2 hidden layers with 8 nodes per layer. If=\r\n we\n&gt; used say a 2GHz PC doing nothing else - could we guess at 7 hours\n&gt; (=\r\ni.e. an overnight run) to evolve or is it more likely to be several\n&gt; days?=\r\n Would appreciate any best guesses or experience on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in ad=\r\nvance\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
