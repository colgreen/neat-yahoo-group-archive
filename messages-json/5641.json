This includes:\n\n   * Development of NeatGenome and associated classes to support efficient\n     evolution of acyclic networks.\n\n   * Development of neural network classes to efficiently execute neural\n     networks.\n\n   * Development of network visualization to layout nodes by layer. This also\n     affects how cylcic networks are laid out because the algorithm that\n     determines which layer a node is in for acylcic nets was extended to also\n     calculate a sensible layer number for cyclic networks, This greatly\n     improves how the networks are laid out with respect to gaining\n     understanding of the network architecture from its visual rendering.\n\n   * Modified all function regression and binary logic themed experiments to\n     use acyclic networks.\n\n\n\n * Added support for Box2D (2D physics engine) based problem domains and\n   visualisation of Box2D worlds with OpenGL.\n\n   * New experiment - Single pole balancing using Box2D, including\n     visualization.\n\n   * New experiment - Inverted double pendulum using Box2D, including\n     visualization.\n\n\n\n\nOther Developments\n------------------\n\n * Improved assertions when running in debug mode. This improves code quailty\n   by reducing the number of undetected defects in released code.\n\n * New ZigguratGaussianSampler class for generating Gaussian noise for\n   mutations and simulations (where required). This approach has a much reduced\n   requirement for calls to expensive floating point operations such as\n   Math.Sqr() and Math.Log(). Typically this is about 2x faster than sampling\n   by using the previously used and simpler Box-Muller method.\n\n * FastRandom now seeds using random numbers from a global FastRandom. This\n   prevents multiple instances from obtaining the same seed from the system\n   tick count when initialising within the same clock tick.\n\n * Log(n) function regression experiment.\n\n * XOR and binary multiplexer experiments modified to use fitness score based\n   on squared error. This change improves search efficiency.\n\n * Function regression experiments changed to have peaks and troughs at y = 0.9\n   and 0.1 respectively. This avoids requiring activation functions to output\n   values at the extremes of their ranges.\n\n * CPPNs modified to use a Gaussian activation function instead of\n   BipolarGaussian. My opinion is that BipolarGaussian isn&#39;t directly useful\n   and the equivalent functionality can be achieved if necessary by combining\n   Gaussian with Linear.\n\n * Refactoring of mutation type selection logic/code.\n\n\nFixes\n-----\n\n * Fix to crossover logic whereby connection genes where not copied and thus\n   shared between parent and child genomes.\n\n * RelaxingCyclicNetwork and FastRelaxingCyclicNetwork: IsStateValid property\n   return value was defined the wrong way around for relaxed networks. It\n   returned false when the networks were relaxed (which is the valid state).\n   Note - none of the current experiments shipped with SharpNEAT use relaxing\n   networks.\n\n * XML I/O was not culture neutral. RBF-NEAT uses comma separated numbers\n   within genome XML which conflicted with use of commas as the numeric decimal\n   separator in come cultures.\n\n * Fix to genome loading. Now uses genome factory from the current experiment;\n   previously it was hard coded to NeatGenomeFactory which was incorrect when\n   using sub-classes such as CppnGenomeFactory.\n\n * Genetic crossover of CPPN genomes randomly regenerated the node activation\n   functions on each node of a child genome instead of taking the activation\n   functions from the parent genome.\n\n"}}
