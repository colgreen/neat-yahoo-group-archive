How do you see that working?  Would=\r\n it be a place for the general public to post advice and information?  \n\nI =\r\nam talking to my group now about tutorial ideas and hopefully we will be ab=\r\nle to provide something along those lines.  Of course there are a lot of pu=\r\nblication pressures for us at the same time, but we do recognize how helpfu=\r\nl it would be to users and we want to make using HyperNEAT easy.  I hope we=\r\n will be able to provide something along these lines in the near future.\n\nk=\r\nen  \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel_kuppitz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Hello Evert,\n&gt; \n&gt; great idea. A wiki won&#39;t cover all the things a HOL can =\r\ncover, but I agree that it would be the best choice for any detailed parame=\r\nter explanation. My only concern is, that a wiki will also become very tech=\r\nnical over time and consequently scare away most of the new interested user=\r\ns (I always refer to people like me, who consider neural networks only as a=\r\n spare-time activity).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Evert Haasdijk &lt;evert@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Maybe a wiki=\r\n would be just the ticket here?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evert\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; On 23 Nov 2009, at 00:07, dkuppitz wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Ken,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; here&#39;s just another vote for a tutorial, with the difference that I  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; would prefer it for HyperSharpNEAT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It would be great to s=\r\nee something like a HOL (Hands on Labs) where  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a new experiment is c=\r\nreated from the scratch. Parameters should be  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; explained in detail, =\r\nfor example: Which impact has the parameter  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Treshold, which impact =\r\nhas WeightRange, etc.? How are the values for  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; each parameter determ=\r\nined, what is taken into account when you set  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the values?

So any tutorial should target  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginners and explain =\r\nthings that have become self-evident for  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; intermediates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I think one such &quot;official&quot; tutorial that explains every step in  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\netail should be enough, more will surely follow from the growing  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nmmunity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Daniel\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Andrei, wh=\r\nich version of HyperNEAT are you interested in and what  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; references =\r\nhave you looked at so far?
