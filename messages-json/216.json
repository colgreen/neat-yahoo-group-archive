So consider \ntwo chromosomes A & B in the following scenarios..\n\nScenario 1) A.length=3, B.Length=4.\nlengthDelta = 4-3 = 1;\nproportional difference in size = 1/4 = 0.25\n\n\nScenario 2) A.length=300, B.Length=400.\nlengthDelta = 400-300 = 100;\nproportional difference in size = 100/400 = 0.25\n\nThe problem with this of course is that we allow large chromomses to \nhave large differences and still be within the same species. So perhaps \nwe should reduce this proportional difference figure as the chromosme \nlength increases. E.g.  diff=(largeLength-smallLength)/largeLength^2  - \nor some variation on this.\n\nIs this what you mean by &#39;normalizing the chromosome length&#39;? Sorry, I&#39;m \nfeeling a bit slow today.\n\n&gt;So how have you guys handled these issues?  Have you\n&gt;normalized for chromosome size in your\n&gt;implementations?  If not, do you have an explosion of\n&gt;species in your populations of large chromosomes?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOn one of my better (more alert) days I did indeed implement a \nspeciation system (within my own EANN project) similar to the one in \nNEAT . I used something akin to the proportion difference calculation I \ndescribe but I what I found frustrating was the constant having to reset \nthe experiment and tweak the co-efficients and the threshhold figure to \nfind good values - I guess I need a GA to search for the best parameters :)\n\nI think it was Ken who suggested that perhaps it would be better to turn \nthe whole technique on its head. Perhaps we should specify an optimal \nnumber of species we would like (based on population size), calculate a \n&#39;compatibility&#39; number for each member of the population and then divide \nthem up into that number of species. Maybe this could be refined by \nadding adding special cases when the compatibility number is very small \nand very large.\n\n&gt;How many of you have done so?  And if you have, what\n&gt;kinds of values did you use for the compatibility\n&gt;threshold?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSince I am not currently using NEAT the figures I use are useless to \nyou. But what I did find was that small variations in the threshold \ncaused either species explosions or very few species. I&#39; m afraid I \nhaven&#39;t had time to experiment further due to work commitments.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
