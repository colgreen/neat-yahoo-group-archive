However, this set of inputs seems like it might be a\nlittle redundant.  The cat is also receiving input on its absolute\nposition each time step as well, right?  Do the other papers use these\nsorts of inputs?\n \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure this behavior would require a recurrent connections.\n&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, the only significant difference in behavior\n&gt; &gt; desired is &quot;go in the direction the mouse *was*&quot; as opposed to &quot;go\n&gt; &gt; in the direction the mouse *is*&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, personally, that is how I would define memory.  Semantics aside,\n&gt; my understanding of NNs says that if all the information necessary to\n&gt; achieve best fitness is not available to the agent in the current\n&gt; state (i.e. it is non-Markovian) then recurrent conections are required.\n\nHmm...well, this might be an interesting discusssion to open up.  That\nsounds like a pretty reasonable assessment.  However, if you added one\nchange to your domain, where the cat is always in motion, then the\nintitial sight of the mouse would send him in the direction, and no\nfurther positive feedback would be required to keep him going in that\ndirection, right?  Then once he attains LOS on the mouse again, he\ncould achieve best fitness.\n\nOf course, if you&#39;re in a domain where the agent is completely driven\nby the output of the neural network, then yes, I can see how\nrecurrency is going to be needed to create a loop to compel it to go\nin that direction without continued positive input.\n\n&gt; As mentioned, it works great with a hand-coded fully connected\n&gt; recurrent network.  Even from distances across the entire map\n&gt; (1,1)-(23,1), it works perfectly (mentioned again at the end).\n\nYeah, well that would indicate that there&#39;s a problem with the NEAT\nimplementation you&#39;re working with, or that as Colin mentioned, you\ngot extremely lucky in hitting upon an architecture to solve this\nparticular problem, or for some reason NEAT is simply not well-suited\nto this task.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be interested to see how a couple of variations might perform:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Clamp movement for both agents (cat and mouse) for something like\n&gt; &gt; 10 time steps, so that the cat is receiving direction and distance\n&gt; &gt; input for the mouse for more than 1 time step.  Then &quot;let them go&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this.  Could you explain in a little\n&gt; more detail?\n\nMy thinking was basically that the cat just might not be getting\nenough useful information as input upon which to act.  Biologically,\nthe longer an agent is exposed to stimuli, the stronger the impact,\ncorrect?  If I flash a card at you for 1 second, it might be more\ndifficult to identify or memorize the content than if I let you study\nit for 10 seconds.\n\nI was wondering if you basically disabled movement of both agents for\nthe first 10 or so time steps, letting the cat see the mouse all that\ntime before letting them move and letting the mouse move out of sight,\nthat it might make a difference.  I don&#39;t know.\n\n&gt; -- Further update on my fully recurrent tests.  As mentioned they\n&gt; passed the simple scenario above (scenario D) with flying colours.  I\n&gt; increased the glimpse distance to the entire map and they were able to\n&gt; produce 40 different solutions (not carbon copies) by G1896 (first\n&gt; found at G869).  For these experiments, my NEAT populations have not\n&gt; come anywhere close to the fully recurrent population.\n\nYeah, that&#39;s odd all right.  So much for my suggestions. :)\n\nThis would certainly seem to indicate either a problem with the\nimplementation or a shortcoming of NEAT&#39;s.\n\nKeep us updated, and I&#39;d be interested to see what others&#39; thoughts are on this.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
