Of course the code\n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bit complicate=\r\nd and figuring out what it does is difficult to do\n&gt; quickly. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part=\r\nicular here are corrections for b and c:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) Species are not ki=\r\nlled off if their average fitness falls below a\n&gt; certain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level. Rath=\r\ner, there is a rule that, if turned on, would kill off a\n&gt; species\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if=\r\n its maximum fitness has not improved in some number of generations.\n&gt; That=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to dump stagnant species.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (c) &quot;Stolen babies&quot; i=\r\ns almost never used in any experiment that I have\n&gt; seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; published or=\r\n published myself, so it isn&#39;t really an important\n&gt; mechanism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, it is a way to increase greediness. As Daniel rightly infers,\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; doesn&#39;t steal actual genetic code from one species, but rather it\n&gt; steal=\r\ns the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *right* to reproduce from the worse species and redistributes t=\r\nhat\n&gt; right to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the better ones. So sort of Robin Hood in reverse (ste=\r\nal from the poor\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help the rich).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of &quot;weight=\r\ning the number of offspring produced towards the\n&gt; stronger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; species,&quot;=\r\n that is correct, but that is just a property of fitness\n&gt; sharing,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhich NEAT uses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In general, the most important selection mechan=\r\nism in NEAT is in fact\n&gt; fitness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sharing, which makes it difficult fo=\r\nr good species to take over the\n&gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; population because individua=\r\nls must share the fitness of their species.\n&gt; So as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a species gets bi=\r\ngger, the fitness of everyone within it drops. I would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider fitne=\r\nss sharing essential to NEAT&#39;s &quot;identity.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, all fitness=\r\n sharing does is adjust the fitnesses of everyone\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; population=\r\n. So after that, there is still a need to decide how many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; offpspring =\r\nindividuals get. It is at this point that versions of NEAT\n&gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dive=\r\nrge and I do not have a strong opinion because I do not consider\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; choice essential to NEAT&#39;s identity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my own implementation=\r\ns, first, offspring numbers are assigned on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; per-species basis (prop=\r\nortionally to *adjusted* fitness after fitness\n&gt; sharing)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and then th=\r\ney are assigned within to species to individuals. My version\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NEA=\r\nT usually uses truncation selection within species. So it just cuts\n&gt; out\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the bottom n% of the species from being eligible to reproduce and the\n=\r\n&gt; rest get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to reproduce. (rtNEAT is different of course since it only=\r\n produces one\n&gt; at a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time - it probabilistic). The remaining individu=\r\nals are selected as\n&gt; parents\n&gt; &gt; &gt; randomly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps most appe=\r\naling for me about this approach is the idea that each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; species can be=\r\n treated as its own little mini-population in which\n&gt; whatever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; select=\r\nion scheme you choose is implemented. I think it makes conceptual\n&gt; sense\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; to think of a species as a population because *within* a species one\n&gt;=\r\n wants the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same kind of healthy phenomena to happen that one wants in=\r\n a regular GA\n&gt; with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, you co=\r\nuld alternatively choose roulette wheel selection\n&gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; species (a=\r\nfter adjusting fitness for fitness sharing) or something\n&gt; else. That\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n choice is not that important, and I have tried a number of schemes and\n&gt; f=\r\nound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, at least with NEAT, it makes limited difference which one =\r\nis\n&gt; chosen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But the fitness sharing is still key.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So Jef=\r\nf, there is no simple to answer to &quot;what kind of selection scheme\n&gt; does\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; NEAT use&quot; because it is a multi-level scheme that first acts at the\n&gt; l=\r\nevel of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speciation and then at the level of individuals within specie=\r\ns. So no\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blanket terms really covers the whole thing. To distil=\r\nl it to a short\n&gt; phrase,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps we could say it uses &quot;fitness shari=\r\nng and any other scheme\n&gt; after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness-sharing.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt;, Daniel Tuohy\n&gt; &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m helping with the=\r\n overhaul of JNeat.

In that case, speciation won&#39;t really distinguish mu=\r\nch between better and worse species.  However, if the average fitnesses wer=\r\ne instead between 1 and 5, then the allocations would vary a lot, with many=\r\n more offspring going to the 5 species than the 1 (because 5 is 5 times 1).=\r\n  This example shows that the range of fitnesses is not the only important =\r\nconsideration.  It is also important how big the range is compared to the a=\r\nbsolute magnitude.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/a&gt;, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for t=\r\nhis answer Ken, and I apologize for the belated reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nf you don&#39;t mind, I would still like to try to determine whether it hel=\r\nps&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to make fitness functions exponential.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For e=\r\nxample, if you had an evaluation that produced a score, would the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nfollowing two fitness functions be equivalent?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Fitness =\r\n=3D 2^score&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Fitness =3D score&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Or would it be be=\r\ntter to use the former? In many EAs (at least those with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fitness p=\r\nroportional selection or something similar), people use the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; expone=\r\nntial version to magnify the difference in fitness and ensure that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n similar increases in fitness are always just as important, even as the bas=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fitness increases. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It seems that within a sp=\r\necies, if truncation selection is used, it will not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; make a differe=\r\nnce. How about at the higher level allocation of how many&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; organism=\r\ns each species will get (i.e., between-species competition)?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I know it is hard for you to give a general answer, since different NE=\r\nAT&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; implementations may differ in their selection schemes (at both =\r\nlevels?), but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; how about for the original NEAT?

Of course the code is a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bit co=\r\nmplicated and figuring out what it does is difficult to do quickly.  In&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; particular here are corrections for b and c:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; (b) Species are not killed off if their average fitness falls bel=\r\now a certain&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; level.  Rather, there is a rule that, if turned =\r\non, would kill off a species&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; if its maximum fitness has not i=\r\nmproved in some number of generations.  That&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is a way to dump=\r\n stagnant species.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (c) &quot;Stolen babies&quo=\r\nt; is almost never used in any experiment that I have seen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pu=\r\nblished or published myself, so it isn&#39;t really an important mechanism.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, it is a way to increase greediness.  As Daniel righ=\r\ntly infers, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t steal actual genetic code from one=\r\n species, but rather it steals the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *right* to reproduce from =\r\nthe worse species and redistributes that right to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the better =\r\nones.  So sort of Robin Hood in reverse (steal from the poor to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; help the rich).  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In terms of &quot;weighti=\r\nng the number of offspring produced towards the stronger&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; spec=\r\nies,&quot; that is correct, but that is just a property of fitness sharing,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; which NEAT uses. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In general, t=\r\nhe most important selection mechanism in NEAT is in fact fitness&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; sharing, which makes it difficult for good species to take over the ent=\r\nire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; population because individuals must share the fitness of =\r\ntheir species.  So as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a species gets bigger, the fitness of e=\r\nveryone within it drops.  I would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; consider fitness sharing es=\r\nsential to NEAT&#39;s &quot;identity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever, all fitness sharing does is adjust the fitnesses of everyone in the&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; population.  So after that, there is still a need to decide h=\r\now many&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; offpspring individuals get.  It is at this point that=\r\n versions of NEAT may&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; diverge and I do not have a strong opin=\r\nion because I do not consider the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; choice essential to NEAT&#3=\r\n9;s identity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my own implementations, first=\r\n, offspring numbers are assigned on a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; per-species basis (prop=\r\nortionally to *adjusted* fitness after fitness sharing)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and t=\r\nhen they are assigned within to species to individuals.  My version of&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; NEAT usually uses truncation selection within species.  So it jus=\r\nt cuts out&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the bottom n% of the species from being eligible t=\r\no reproduce and the rest get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to reproduce.  (rtNEAT is differ=\r\nent of course since it only produces one at a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; time - it proba=\r\nbilistic).  The remaining individuals are selected as parents&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n randomly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps most appealing for me about=\r\n this approach is the idea that each&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; species can be treated a=\r\ns its own little mini-population in which whatever&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; selection =\r\nscheme you choose is implemented.  I think it makes conceptual sense&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; to think of a species as a population because *within* a species on=\r\ne wants the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; same kind of healthy phenomena to happen that one=\r\n wants in a regular GA with a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; full population.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, you could alternatively choose roulette wheel sel=\r\nection within&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; species (after adjusting fitness for fitness sh=\r\naring) or something else.  That&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; choice is not that important,=\r\n and I have tried a number of schemes and found&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that, at leas=\r\nt with NEAT, it makes limited difference which one is chosen.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n But the fitness sharing is still key.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So Jeff=\r\n, there is no simple to answer to &quot;what kind of selection scheme does&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; NEAT use&quot; because it is a multi-level scheme that first =\r\nacts at the level of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; speciation and then at the level of indi=\r\nviduals within species.  So no one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; blanket terms really cover=\r\ns the whole thing.  To distill it to a short phrase,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; perhaps =\r\nwe could say it uses &quot;fitness sharing and any other scheme after&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; fitness-sharing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m helping with the overhaul of JNeat.
