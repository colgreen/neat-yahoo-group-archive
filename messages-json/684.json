Of \ncourse if we leave a species for longer it might still improve later so \nI guess it comes down to how long you want to leave your search running \nfor, if you are going to leave it for days then you can afford a higher \ndropoff_age.\n\nAnother way viewing species culling is as a method of walking the search \nspace. When we cull a species we are giving up on a local maxima that \nhas been found and moving on to another point (or points) in the problem \nspace,  a higher droppoff_age allows NEAT to make a more thorough search \nof the problem space around the species before we give up on it and move on.\n\n&gt;parameter in my version of NEAT).  Also, if the population size chages\n&gt;that&#39;s definitely a major problem that needs to be fixed.  It probably\n&gt;indicates something wrong with the way offspring are being assigned.  \n&gt;Anyway, looks like you already fixed it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe underlying maths was OK, I use the alternative method for \ndetermining the species size as described in the faq -  \n((AverageSpeciesFitness / TotalOfAllSpeciesAverageFitness) * \nbaselinePopulationSize).\n\nOnce this number was calculated I called the CreateOffspring_Asexual() \nand CreateOffspring_Sexual() routines the relevant number of times - the \nproblem was that the sexual reproduction function tries a maximum of 3 \ntimes to find a mating pair and then gives up - and I wasn&#39;t \ncompensating for these failed attempts at generating offspring. Now if \nsexual repro fails I call the asexual offspring routine as a last resort.\n\nI think that this defect was a major hindrance for searches since \nCreateOffspring_Sexual() was most likely to fail with a new species \nwith, say, one or two good genomes in it, thus causing a selection \npressure against good genomes!\n\nAnyway I reverted to the original (pseudo-)randomized prey capture \ntrials, but now with deterministic starting positions and prey initial \nmoves, one run obtained a 92/100 score on the most difficult test within \n50,000 evals - which is really impressive. To perfect the results \nfurther I&#39;m now going to try and award a higher fitness for networks \nthat can catch the prey in as few timesteps as possible, this hopefully \nwill guide the search towards finding prey that chase the prey rather \nthan using mechanical strategies. This is something that begins to creep \nin with more difficult trials where the prey is allowed to move and \nwhere I therefore have to allow the agent many more timesteps than may \nbe strictly necessary. You see the prey movement is unpredictable so it \nmay take 10 moves or 20 to catch it even with a perfect strategy, so I \nhave to assume the worst case and give the agent at least 20 moves. The \ntrouble is that if the prey did some stupid moves then the agent should \nhave caught the prey within 10 moves, but it gets the same fitness if it \nused up all 20 moves to carry out a mechanical strategy.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
