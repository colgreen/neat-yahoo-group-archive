I quote him here:\n\n------begin quote-----\nOne thing to keep in mind about robots and robot simulators is that\ntheir inputs and outputs are not necessarily in a format that is\nnatural or useful to an NN.  In many cases, it is worth converting\nfrom the coordinate system of the robot to an alternative coordinate\nsystem that is better for an NN.\n\nFor example, we have found that having two outputs for two wheel\npowers is not the best format for a neural network to express\nmovements.  Rather, the best seems to be a single outputs for\nforward/back, and another for left/right.  So like this:\n\nOutput 1:\n-1            0                1\nBackward   Don&#39;t Move          Forward\n\nOutput 2:\n-1            0                1\nLeft          Forward          Right\n\nSo the move is a combination of the 2: move forward or backward\nand turn the requested angle.\n\nThis coordinate frame can easily be converted into the left\nmotor/right motor frame, so the right signals can be given to the\nrobot.\n\nSimilarly, cartesian coordinates are not necessarily the best.\n(Although you should try them to see if they do work)  But an\nalernative is to set up several radar sensors surrounding the\nrobot and let the radars light up if e.g. the ball is within\ntheir arc of sensitivity (the closer the higher the activation).\nThis may be more natural for the NN than cartesian coordinates.  If\nthe simulator gives you cartesian coordinates, they can easily be\nconverted in the more natural radar sensor format.\n\nThese suggestions are not guaranteed to work best, but my main point\nis that you should try a variety of sensor/motor configurations and\nnot assume that just because the simulator offers a particular\nconfiguration that that is necessarily the best for the NN.\n\nken\n------end quote------\n\nI would like to hear your comments about this topic (if that in not much to\nask ;-)\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nGerman Viscuso\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 10:12 PM\nSubject: Re: [neat] Soccerbots\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps in the future we&#39;ll be able to see evolved monolithic\ncontrollers\n&gt; &gt; for soccer players, have you tried this before?\n&gt;\n&gt; In both the GECCO and the journal papers we try monolithic approaches and\n&gt; they fail abysmally.  These experiments were done on keepaway, an\nimportant\n&gt; subtask of robot soccer.  In a full soccer domain, I think a monolithic\n&gt; approach would do even worse.  Of course, NEAT might do much better than\nESP\n&gt; but I think it would still have a lot of trouble learning a monolithic\n&gt; controller.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am optimistic that yet-to-be-developed learning algorithms will reduce\nthe\n&gt; need for manual decomposition.  However, even humans, the best learning\n&gt; systems in the world, do not learn soccer by simply playing games\n&gt; repeatedly.  They do drills, practice basic skills, and decide on\n&gt; higher-level strategies in a fashion that is relatively independent of how\n&gt; they carry out lower-level actions.  Hence, they benefit from the &quot;task\n&gt; decomposition&quot; that their coaches, based on domain expertise, know will\nhelp\n&gt; them learn.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it is an important goal to develop learning systems that do not\n&gt; require human designers to have a lot of domain expertise.  But I think it\n&gt; is even more important to find algorithms that can easily and reliably\n&gt; exploit the domain expertise that we *do* have.  No matter how difficult a\n&gt; problem your algorithm can master from a tabula rasa approach, I think you\n&gt; will always be able to go even further if you exploit human expertise too.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Shimon\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Nate Kohl&quot; &lt;nate@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 8:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My name is Shimon Whiteson.  I&#39;m a PhD student at UT (Ken is one of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; officemates). Nate Kohl and I have done a lot of research applying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuroevolution to the SoccerBots domain over the past couple years.\nIf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone is planning to work in this domain, they might be interested in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; checking out our papers on the subject:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/shimon/school.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We also have a journal paper (not yet published) that discusses some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coevolutionary approaches, which I&#39;d be happy to send to anyone who&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interested.  All this work was done with ESP and not NEAT so obviously\n&gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevance in somewhat limited.  But it does describe the input and\n&gt; output\n&gt; &gt; &gt; representations that we found useful.  It focuses primarily on the\nissue\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; task decomposition: how to break a hard task like robot soccer into\n&gt; &gt; smaller\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pieces that our learning algorithms can tackle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From doing this research I have become convinced that trying to learn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; monolithic controllers for soccer players is completely infeasible\nusing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current methods.  I would strongly recommend that anyone who works in\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; domain consider using some of the decomposition approaches we describe\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the papers or even developing your own.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t hesitate to drop me a line if you want to discuss any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soccerbots-related issues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shimon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, February 27, 2004 9:31 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My name is German Viscuso and I would like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce myself to the group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi German...welcome to the group. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a degree in Computer Science and I &#39;m now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researching neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques for application in the robotic soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; domain. I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hardware?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forward).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interest in this domain.  Anybody else have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences or thoughts on robot control domains?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robot soccer?
