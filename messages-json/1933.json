If so, then the only difference, of course, would be\n&gt; that the outputs are all fully connected.  I don&#39;t know if this is\n&gt; considered recurrent, so I wanted to clarify.\n&gt; \n\nYes, that&#39;s right, that is reccurent and it&#39;s what I&#39;m suggesting.  \nMy idea is this:  If the task is so memory-dependant that the \ninitial feedforward population has no possibility of making any \nprogress at all, it may cause initial stagnation.  But if you start \nit off with some memory capabilities (i.e. fully recurrent) it can \nstart building on that capability right away, but also complexify as \nis normal in NEAT.\n\n&gt; 2) Would you suggest that I bump up the % chance of a recurrent \nlink\n&gt; being added?  At the moment I have:\n&gt; \n&gt; New link: 10% (once inside: recurrent link: 20%, forward/lateral: \n80%).\n&gt; New node: 1%\n&gt; \n\nI think that should be ok, but bumping it up a bit probably won&#39;t \nhurt.  I am not really sure since if you start off fully recurrent \nyou aren&#39;t going to be in dire need of adding recurrent connections \nso the rate doesn&#39;t need to be too high.\n\nLet me know how it goes...\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
