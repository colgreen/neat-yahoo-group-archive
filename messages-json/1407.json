If a species hasn&#39;t improved for\n&gt;some time then that can be taken as an indication that the species\n&gt;represents a local optimum and therefore should be abandoned. If you\n&gt;want to give the species more of a chance then it&#39;s probbaly more valid\n&gt;to increase the time to species death.\n\nThat depends on your definition of &#39;species&#39;.  For everybody but me, a \nspecies can represent more than one network topology.  Thus, it can continue \nto improve through the addition of more topology.  I don&#39;t do that.  I treat \neach distinct topology as a separate species.  Improvement within a topology \ncan come only through weight mutation.  Once a topology reaches its optima, \ntime to move on, time to add (or remove) topology.  But how you move on can \nmake a lot of difference.\n\nBasically, I didn&#39;t want to mess with &#39;speciation&#39; which is why I opted for \ntreating each topology as a distinct species.\n\n\n\n"}}
