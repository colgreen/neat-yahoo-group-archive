Has she actually run any\nsimple simulations using this implementation? My advisor is a big fan\nof Izhikevich, so I&#39;m interested to hear how those are working out.\n\nThe thing is, I&#39;ve actually implemented the networks with LIF neurons\nand STDP in Java. I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;m putting the things\ntogether in simple networks, tuning parameters, and actually trying to\nfigure out how they behave. And I was wondering if anyone else here\nhad worked with them much.\n\nOne issue is how to handle the input of a post-synaptic neuron. In the\nmodels I&#39;ve looked at, the membrane potential of a given neuron is\nrepresented separately from the action potential it generates upon\nspiking. So the neuron has a state (the membrane potential) that is\nupdated based on input, and once it reaches threshold it fires,\ngenerating output (the action potential), which conforms to an alpha\nfunction. I&#39;m particularly interested in the issue of how to handle\nmultiple presynaptic action potentials. I believe the alpha functions\nare normally multiplied by the connection weights and then summed. But\nif a given pre-synaptic neuron&#39;s output has not settled to zero by the\ntime it spikes again, you can get very large outputs that stack up,\neven from a single presynaptic neuron, driving the post-synaptic\nfiring rate very high, which tends to screw up the STDP.\n\nDon&#39;t know if any of that made any sense, but these are the sorts of\nissues I&#39;m dealing with and wanted someone with some experience to\nchat about.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 10:20 AM, Cesar G.

The code is a mix of Python and C++, but there is\n&gt; a &quot;pure python&quot; version of the InF and some C++ bindings.
