There \nthey are discussing modifying the fitness function to punish bloat - \n&#39;parsimony pressure&#39; as someone termed it. E.g. if using tournament \nselection then if two genomes have the same fitness on the task at hand \nthen the shortest genome wins, a sort of secondary objective if you \nlike. I think there is a risk with that approach of restricting a search \nfrom exploring areas of the search space with additional complexity with \nno immediate gain. We want /some/ exploration of complexity, just not \ntoo much. The use of a secondary objective like this makes for a very \ndefinite limit or barrier to the complexity of genomes being searched in \ntimes of fitness stagnation - only selection based on the primary \nobjective can choose more complex genomes.\n\nThe techniques discussed on here of using &#39;softer&#39; controls for bloat \nmake more sense to me, e.g. Ian&#39;s equlibrium idea or my technqiue of \nallowing complexity to rise up to a point N points above the previous \nlow [following a pruning phase]. These techniques don&#39;t define a hard \n&#39;complexity barrier&#39; and therefore give a possible path out of fitness \nstagnation where there may not be a path that consists of a single step \n(mutation/crossover).\n\nActually my technqiue does sort of define a hard barrier, but it is \nabove the averge complexity of the population following a pruning, hence \nit does give some leeway for exploration where a secondary fitness \nobjective wouldn&#39;t.\n\nBoth techniques (of soft control) control population complexity by \nadjusting the balance of additive and destructive mutations. In my case \nI use extremes of no additive mutations + a high deletion rate (and no \ncrossover BTW) versus normal operation where the equlibrium point is at \ninfinity (actually Ian that does /sort of/ make sense). So the actual \ncomplexity of genomes will (should!) be distributed around the \nequilibrium point (normal distribution?), with the bulk of genomes near \nthe eq point and the odd few much further out - which seems ideal, right?\n\nIan, as you said the way we handle recombination - e.g. disjoint and \nexcess genes - is important because this is another means by which \ncomplexity can be affected. One solution is to ensure that the all of \nthe offspring from a recombination round have the same total complexity \nas all of the parents, a sort of zero-sum game scenario. That way only \nthe mutation operators have an affect on complexity and we are happy \nthat they are balanced. Alternatively we allow non-zero-sum \nrecombnation, but set up a balance similar to the one used with \nadditive/deletive mutations, so that once again the overall system will \nfind an equilibrium point.\n\nHaving said all that it just occured to me that a secondary &#39;parsimony \npressure&#39; could be applied in a similarly &#39;soft&#39; manner, e.g. don&#39;t \napply the secondary function until complexity has risen beyond some \nlevel and then only gradually increase its weighting. With this approach \nthough we assume that the underlying pressure is upwards and that we are \ndefining a soft upper limit to control it, therefore once again \n[possibly] setting up an equilibrium point where the genomes are \ndistributed around that point, although possibly in an unevenly shaped \ndistribution because the upward and downward pressures are applied by \ndifferent processes.\n\nIn summation then I think both approaches equate (or could be made to \nequate) to the same thing, and it&#39;s just a matter of which we we think \nis simplest and easiest to implement.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
