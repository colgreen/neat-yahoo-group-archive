She&#39;s very helpful, especially since I&#39;m \n&gt;the only one in our research group that&#39;s doing any EA or ANN stuff.  Where \n&gt;do you know her from?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ve not talked to her but I saw some of her work at GECCO this past \nJune. Also, I&#39;m looking to apply to graduate schools this winter and the \nlab at MIT came up on the (very) short list of schools doing \nbiologically inspired computation. I thought most of her work was with \ngenetic programming though. In general is the lab there very supportive \nof neural networks, indirect encoding research?\n\nThanks,\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n\n"}}
