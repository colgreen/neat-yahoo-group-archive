Like I said, there are pros and cons both ways so \nthere&#39;s no knockdown=\r\n argument one way or another, just things to \nconsider:\n\n-The order-indepen=\r\ndent method of activation can utilize a kind \nof &quot;delay chain memory&quot; while=\r\n in-order activation cannot.  A delay \nchain is a long chain of nodes that =\r\nprevents activation from arriving \nfrom the inputs at the outputs until a f=\r\new timesteps (equal to the \nlength of the chain) in the future.  Some trans=\r\nformations may happen \nalong the way as well.  But what it means is that th=\r\ne network can \nreact to past events even without recurrent connections.  Th=\r\nis kind \nof &quot;memory&quot; is less sophisticated than recurrent memory, but it \na=\r\nctually can work.  I forget who it was, but a couple years ago \nsomeone sen=\r\nt me an example where they forgot to enable recurrence in \nNEAT, and still =\r\nsolved a problem that was supposed to be impossible \nwithout it.  The solut=\r\nion networks were full of long chains of nodes.\n\n-A big advantage of order-=\r\nindependent activation is that you don&#39;t \nneed to know which connections ar=\r\ne recurrent and which are not in \norder to activate properly.  In fact, you=\r\n treat all connections \nexactly the same: every connection moves activation=\r\n from its source \nat time t to its destination at t+1.  Thus there is no ne=\r\ned to \ndistinguish.  NEAT tries to distinguish mostly just for the user&#39;s \n=\r\nconceptual convenience, but the reason NEAT is able to do that is \nthat con=\r\nnections are added one at a time so it can check for each new \nconnection w=\r\nhether it introduces a loop.  But in practice if I gave \nyou a giant random=\r\n mesh of nodes (i.e. a brain), figuring out which \nconnections are recurren=\r\nt is not trivial.  With order-independent \nactivation it doesn&#39;t matter and=\r\n everything will work right \nautomatically.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
