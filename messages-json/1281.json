Admittedly, I\n&gt;know nothing about it otherwise, but from your description it sounds\n&gt;like simple hill climbing, i.e. make a tweak, see if you improved,\n&gt;and if not go back to where you were.  Is there any real\n&gt;difference?  Hill climbing is known to get stuck on local\n&gt;optima...well that&#39;s an understatenent...it *does* get stuck on\n&gt;local optima.  That&#39;s one reason having a population is helpful.\n&gt;So I am just wondering how Thaler&#39;s thing differs from hill climbing?\n\nAs far as I have gathered, it isn&#39;t.  But because he is climbing the CURRENT \nhill, he may avoid some of those pitfalls.  Instead of taking a look at the \nlandscape of 100 input samples and then walking in the &#39;average&#39; uphill, it \nwalks up the hill of the current situation.  For a real-world situation, the \nfitness landscape would tend to move fairly smoothly, shifting the peak (for \nexample) left and right, and so the hill climber is constantly following \nthat peak.  Yes, it could get caught in a local optima...until it finds a \nsituation in which that optima is far from optimal, which could jolt it out \nof that optima with enough force to let it find a better optima somewhere \nelse.  That is how his robotic controller works, anyway.\n\nThe self-training network is nothing more than a network that implements \nback-propagation on itself.  Not really that earth-shattering.\n\nThe creativity machine is nothing more than an exploration of the space \naround the error-minimized solution.  The base network represents a \nmathematical model of a problem space.  For a given input, it has a given \noutput.  But making minor tweaks to the model lets you explore the \nsurrounding environment.  You get things that are closely related to the \noriginal model, with the mathematical shape of the tweak being almost the \nsame, but just enough different that you get a &#39;novel&#39; output that is often \nrelevant and appropriate.\n\nI think having a random input node would be an improvement even to Thaler&#39;s \nwork.  The connection weight will encapsulate the width of the &#39;relevance&#39; \nrange that is viable to explore.  Then, the network will always tend to give \n&#39;creative&#39; but relevant output.\n\n&gt;I agree with what Derek later said...that site is so full of hype\n&gt;and hyperbole that I can hardly believe this guy is really on the\n&gt;ball and not just a nut.  But then again, they say genius is\n&gt;difficult recognize...\n\nSomeone that is dependant on and trying to attract investors is left with \nlittle choice.  They have to make a good impression on people with the cash. \n  And what works on them doesn&#39;t always work on the people with the \nknowledge and understanding of the work being done.  That, and what he is \ndoing is easily reproduced, which he would prefer not to have happen.  So he \ndoesn&#39;t spell out the details, for fear of being copied.  Can&#39;t blame the \nguy for that. :)\n\n\n\n"}}
