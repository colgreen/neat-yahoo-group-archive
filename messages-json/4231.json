Central pattern generators for locomotion=\r\n control in\n&gt; animals and robots: a review. /Neural Networks/, 21(4):642-65=\r\n3, 2008.\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem of controlling locomotion is an ar=\r\nea in which neuroscience\n&gt; and robotics can fruitfully interact. In this ar=\r\nticle, I will review\n&gt; research carried out on locomotor central pattern ge=\r\nnerators (CPGs),\n&gt; i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated pa=\r\ntterns of\n&gt; high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only s=\r\nimple,\n&gt; low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover\n&gt; neur=\r\nobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their\n&gt; numerical mo=\r\ndelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then\n&gt; cover how CPG =\r\nmodels implemented as neural networks or systems of\n&gt; coupled oscillators c=\r\nan be used in robotics for controlling the\n&gt; locomotion of articulated robo=\r\nts. The review also presents how robots\n&gt; can be used as scientific tools t=\r\no obtain a better understanding of the\n&gt; functioning of biological CPGs. Fi=\r\nnally, various methods for designing\n&gt; CPGs to control specific modes of lo=\r\ncomotion will be briefly reviewed.\n&gt; In this process, I will discuss differ=\r\nent types of CPG models, the pros\n&gt; and cons of using CPGs with robots, and=\r\n the pros and cons of using\n&gt; robots as scientific tools. Open research top=\r\nics both in biology and in\n&gt; robotics will also be discussed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Preprint=\r\n: http://birg2.epfl.ch/publications/fulltext/ajIjspeert08a.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Officia=\r\nl paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2008.03.014\n&gt; \n&gt; --------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Prof Auke Jan Ijspeer=\r\nt\n&gt; SNF (Swiss National Science Foundation) Assistant Professor\n&gt; School of=\r\n Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL\n&gt; \n&gt; EPFL-IC-ISIM-GRIJ\n&gt; EPFL, E=\r\ncole Polytechnique F=E9d=E9rale de Lausanne\n&gt; Station 14\n&gt; CH 1015 Lausanne=\r\n, Switzerland\n&gt; Office: INN 237     Tel: +41 21 693 2658,    Fax: +41 21 69=\r\n3 3705\n&gt; www: http://birg.epfl.ch             Email: Auke.Ijspeert@...\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Adjunct Assistant Professor,\n&gt; Department of Computer Science, Univers=\r\nity of Southern California\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; \n\n------ End of Forwarded Message\n\n\n\n"}}
