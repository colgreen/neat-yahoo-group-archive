If a complex of genes has formed that are all\n&gt; &gt;interdependent, that could be a bad move.  Maybe safer would be to\n&gt; &gt;just make adding *all* the excess and disjoint genes probabilistic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Good point.\n\nOr, does that imply that the two individuals are too different to breed \nsuccessfully anyway?\n\nIf you had a set of genes which were all in one parent, mutually \ninterdependent, and beneficial, could that be a definition of a &quot;module&quot;?\n\nI guess nature gets around this as follows:\n\n- when new genes first appear they are exchanged between individuals so \nsimilar that they tend to get the same support framework from both parents.\n\n- as mutual interdependence between genes grows (over very long periods) \nthe genes tend to get shuffled close together so that they do crossover as \na single unit\n\ne.g. nature would have the same problem, except that it uses a lot more \nresources and proceeds far slower\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
