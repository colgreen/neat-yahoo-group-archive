By \nthis I mean, I perform several experiments using design of \nexp=\r\neriments. Using the results I build a neural network model, most \nof the ti=\r\nmes guessing what the appropriate size and parameters of \nthe network shoul=\r\nd be. \n\nI do not build the models incrementally, rather I build them as an =\r\n\none-time affair. The problems I face are the following:\n\nGiven the number =\r\nof inputs (x) and the number of outputs (y) and the \nsize of the training s=\r\net,I have trouble estimating what is the \nappropriate parameters for buildi=\r\nng the network? (like learning \nrate, size of network, what kind of algorit=\r\nhm etc.)\n\nDo the experts feel that NEAT will be able to answer such queries=\r\n \nfor me ? or can I use NEAT to build models without having to worry \nabout=\r\n the network parameters? or Do I have it completely wrong about \nNEAT?\n\nTha=\r\nnks for your suggestions.\n\nSathya\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
