Is it\n&gt; that you want to \n&gt; whittle away all but the best species?  Are the\n&gt; genes in the first run \n&gt; treated differently in the second run somehow?\n\nAt first I didn&#39;t restart the population when\nswitching the support off, but the guys that did the\nbest with the support died off when it disappeared. \nI&#39;m still changing a lot of things, though, so this\nmight change back.\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
