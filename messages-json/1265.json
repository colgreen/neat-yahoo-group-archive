So\n&gt; there is no need for an activati=\r\non function at an input node.  And \ninput node is treated as just\n&gt; an unbo=\r\nunded data point.  It was my understanding that if there \nwas to be feedbac=\r\nk to the &quot;input&quot;,\n&gt; it would occur as new nodes and connections around the =\r\n\nhidden/output nodes from which the\n&gt; particular input node was connected.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, that sort of took much longer to present than I initially \nthoug=\r\nht.  Hmmm=85\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for any clarification(s) you can offer on this.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\nHey Jim,  \n\nI will try to respond more thoroughly now that I&#39;ve su=\r\nbmitted my \ndissertation, although it looks like people on the list have al=\r\nready \nworked through these issues.  But as I said before, my \nimplementati=\r\non of NEAT does not run inputs through any kind of \nactivation function, so=\r\n in fact I agree with you on everything here.\n\nOn the other hand, running i=\r\nnputs through an activation can be seen \nas just one of many possible ways =\r\nof scaling or normalizing inputs \nto get them in the best form for an ANN. =\r\n In that sense, maybe in \nsome cases there is a good intuition behind doing=\r\n it, but on the \nface of it, it does seem ad hoc to me, i.e. why use a sigm=\r\noid of all \npossible methods for normalization?  \n\nStill, normalization in =\r\nthe broader sense is a good idea. (This sort \nof answers part C of your que=\r\nstion.)  So in other words, if there is \nan input that naturtally varies fr=\r\nom 0 to 1,000,000, you proabably \nwant to compress that range a lot sending=\r\n it into the net.  So \nthe &quot;activation function&quot; would be the function that=\r\n compresses the \nrange.  But that really shouldn&#39;t be called an &quot;activation=\r\n \nfunction,&quot; since it&#39;s really just data preprocessing, and also \nbecause d=\r\nifferent inputs in the same net probably should be \nnormalized in different=\r\n ways.\n\nAnyway, I have probably been redundant with some of the stuff in \nt=\r\nhis long thread, but I wanted to try to answer since I said I would \nbefore=\r\n when I was too swamped.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
