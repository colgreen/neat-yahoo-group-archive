What do you mean by &quot;leaves some \nconvent=\r\nions unspecified?&quot;  As long as you know the node(s) being \nconnected and ke=\r\nep track of them as NEAT normally does anyway, why \nis this issue specific =\r\nto recurrent connections?  Or maybe I just \ndon&#39;t know what&#39;s meant by an &quot;=\r\nunspecified convention?&quot;  I think \nmaybe what you&#39;re saying is that what is=\r\n considered recurrent in \nsome individuals may not deserve that designation=\r\n in others, but I&#39;m \nnot certain.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Ba=\r\ndcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; At 15:23 14/11/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;I thin=\r\nk I solved this the following trivial way;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Input nodes are labeled d=\r\nepth=3D0, outputnodes are labeled depth=3D1. \nWhen a\n&gt; &gt;connection is split=\r\n, it&#39;s labeled depth=3D\n(parent1.depth+parent2.depth)/2.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Since split=\r\nting connections is the only way to introduce new \nnodes, all\n&gt; &gt;nodes shou=\r\nld be labeled by the depth they were created at.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;to prevent recurren=\r\nt connecitons, don&#39;t connect a node to a node \nwith a\n&gt; &gt;lower depth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Seems to work for me and executes in linear time?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Am I missing som=\r\nething really complicated here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Mattias,\n&gt; \n&gt;          I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk you are missing anything.  I think \nbasically \n&gt; we reached the conclusio=\r\nn that there are two families of algorithm \nfor this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) some sort of =\r\narbitrary, or average (as you do) or incremental \n(as \n&gt; I do) parameter is=\r\n assigned to each node, and all connections \nformed \n&gt; must obey the direct=\r\nion of this parameter (say lower to higher).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) analyse the network to=\r\n see if recurrence is being formed and \n&gt; forbid the connection if it is no=\r\nt\n&gt; \n&gt; The pros and cons are:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) is faster than (2)\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) will not=\r\n connect some valid topologies - I believe it can make \n&gt; any topology, but=\r\n some of them in can not assemble from every \nvalid precursor\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) leav=\r\nes some &quot;conventions&quot; undefined, e.g. nodes which are \nneither \n&gt; up- nor d=\r\nown-stream of each other, these conventions can then get \nset \n&gt; incompatib=\r\nly in different strains\n&gt; \n&gt; These last two points define the difference be=\r\ntween the two \n&gt; approaches.  (1) defines all conventions in advance, which=\r\n means \nthey \n&gt; will always remain compatible, but limits some directions o=\r\nf \n&gt; growth.  (2) leaves some conventions unspecified, which allows any \n&gt; =\r\nvalid direction of growth, but allows competing conventions to \narise \n&gt; in=\r\n different parts of the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; A third approach, might be to leav=\r\ne conventions undefined at \nfirst, \n&gt; but then as soon as one individual de=\r\nfines one, copy that \nrestriction \n&gt; across the whole population...\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n       Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ___________________________________________________________ \n&gt; Ya=\r\nhoo!
