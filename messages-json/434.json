I&#39;m planning to\napply NEAT to evolve a full team of players [*](using a robot soccer\nsimulator). I&#39;ll probably be using Kenneth&#39;s implementation, the VC++\nimplementation and perhaps I will need  to port NEAT to Smalltalk.\nI&#39;m familiar with the theory of neural networks and neuroevolution but I&#39;ve\nnever played with neuroevolution applications, so I have no idea how long\nit&#39;ll take me.\nNot too long I hope!\n\nRegards and thanks for your comments.\n\nGerman\n\n[*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully evolve a team that can\nplay the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks) but I seriously think\ncomplexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not sure if I should evolve the\nteam from sensors to actuators or use some of my predefined movement\nprimitives to accelerate the task.\n\n\n\n"}}
