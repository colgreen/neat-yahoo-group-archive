So the core of the\n  code is from that, although =\r\nit&#39;s been much expanded and\n  changed.  I think it&#39;s definitely a good idea=\r\n to take \n  advantage of available robot simulators, and NEAT should\n  do q=\r\nuite well with most any realistic robot simulator.\n  The one concern is tha=\r\nt some simulators are not built for\n  training, which means that they may n=\r\not let you turn off\n  the graphics or run in &quot;fast forward&quot; mode.  If you\n =\r\n can&#39;t do that, evolution will take forever because each\n  trial has to tak=\r\ne place in slow real-world physical time.\n  So you should make sure for any=\r\n simulator that it allows\n  you to run the simulator without the graphics, =\r\nor at least\n  with the graphics in extreme fast forward.\n\n  To answer your =\r\nsecond question, if NEAT is trained on a\n  realistic simulation of a real p=\r\nhysical robot (e.g. Khepera)\n  then the results should be transferable.  In=\r\n practice, the\n  transfer will not be a perfect and a few extra generations=\r\n\n  of refinement evolution in the real world may be necessary.\n  Nolfi and =\r\nFloreano&#39;s book, &quot;Evolutionary Robotics,&quot; addresses\n  the issues of crossov=\r\ner to the real world in detail.  The\n  main problem is that once you enter =\r\nthe real-world, everything\n  is constrained by real-world time and so evolu=\r\ntion must\n  be necessity proceed at a much slower rate.\n\n  I think trying y=\r\nour ANJI NEAT (hmm...how to say it?) with\n  robot simulators would be great=\r\n.  NEAT is known to be good\n  in that kind of domain.\n\n  ken\n\n  --- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; --- Kenneth Stanle=\r\ny &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; Some of you may have read our previous Tech =\r\nReport,\n  &gt; &gt; &quot;Competitive\n  &gt; &gt; Coevolution through Evolutionary Complexif=\r\nication.&quot; \n  &gt; &gt; That paper has\n  &gt; &gt; now been replaced with a much-updated=\r\n journal paper\n  &gt; &gt; in the Journal of\n  &gt; &gt; Artificial Intelligence Resear=\r\nch (JAIR), by the same\n  &gt; &gt; title.
