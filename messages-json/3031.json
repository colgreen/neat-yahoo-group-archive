I really meant to say something before, way \nback when you posted the &quot;Patterns without development&quot; work that \npreceded this.\n\n\tWhat I am getting at, is the difference between a function mapping, \nhowever complex, and an iterative system.  This difference seems to \nme to be a fairly crucial factor in the nature of developmental biology.\n\n\tThe reason this difference matters is something I touched on before:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/message/1818\n\n\talbeit only &quot;touched&quot; on it.\n\n\tI am having some difficulty justifying this position, partly because \nI haven&#39;t been near the literature on any of this for over a year, \npartly because it is quite a deep point about evolvability, and \npartly because it is by no means proven, intuitive and a quantitative \ndifference rather than a qualitative one, however:\n\n\tFIRST let me illustrate the sort of iterative system that I \nmean.  What I am referring to is (say) something like your 4D \nconnection density function (substrate configuration, I think you \ncalled it).  Some sort of field, probably discretised into cells for \nconvenience of computation, with some value(s) stored on each cell.\n\n\tNOW, the difference in the two approaches is that using CPPNs, all \nwe will do is evaluate one function (possibly very complex) once, for \neach cell in the field.\n\n\tBUT for an iterative approach, we will probably fill the field in \nthat manner as a start state, but after that we will then iterate \nover it N times applying some sort of rule to update the field on \neach pass.  It is the fact that the rules act on the output of \nprevious stages that gives the system its power.  Rules could be \ntargeted in various ways and have various effects, but we can imagine \nthe general case of recognizing some pattern (either of values in a \nsingle cell, or else relative values in a locality of cells) and \nchanging some values in a cell as a result.\n\n\tIn BIOLOGY, this equates to real cells.  Every cell contains the \nsame genes but not all genes are activated.  The embryo starts with a \nsimple polarity (up-down) defined by a chemical gradient.  Genes are \nactivated at certain places based on the amount of chemical and the \ngene-products produce other chemicals.  Some chemicals also leak from \ncell to cell.  Thus simple patterns of chemicals become more complex \nbecause genes essentially &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain areas in the \norganism, and start producing other chemicals in response.\n\n\tThe power of a system like this is, if (say) the number of legs \nchanges (by changing the number of repeats of a pattern at an early \nstage in the process), then the later stages still have a reasonable \nchance of doing something sane even though the basic plan has \nchanged.  The process that would wire nerves and blood to N legs, \nworks (almost) as happily with N+2 legs.  This is why two headed \nsnakes are alive (if unfit) but two nosed Boeing 747&#39;s are scrap.\n\n\t[[I have spoken about this before, and in fact I wrote (most of) a \ncomplex philosophical web-page (called &quot;the Manifesto for Evolving \nAgents&quot;) which went into this in some depth.  Maybe I&#39;ll see if I can \nget that up on the web somewhere, even unfinished, and the community \nmight give me some useful feedback on it and get me working again.\n\n\tAnyway, as you can imagine, an iterative development system is an \norder of magnitude more complex than HyperNEAT, and strays into all \nout usual areas of interest/difficulty such as modularity etc.  Which \nis why HyperNEAT is so clever as an intermediate step.  Nice one Ken!\n\n\tIan\n\n\t\n\n\n"}}
