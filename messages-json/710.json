I believe Darren Izzard did.\n Also Tyler must have, since his autonomous human demo runs in\nWindows.  Hopefully someone who has compiled my version of NEAT in\nWindows can post their project files in a compilable form.  Also, you\nprobably know there are other releases of NEAT available, including\nMat Buckland&#39;s Windows NEAT package, which is not based on my code.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Everybody calls me Bull in real life&quot;\n&lt;robert_winkel@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hiyas,\n&gt; \n&gt;   Yes, I&#39;m having troubles compiling NEAT.  I am on a windows \n&gt; system, and would like some help in getting all the correct\npackages \n&gt; and version etc. in order to compile and run the NEAT experiments.\n&gt;   I would prefer to use cygwin g++.  Can anybody who has \n&gt; successfully compiled NEAT under cygwin tell me the exact versions \n&gt; of what I need?  Links to any necessary packages would be good too.\n&gt;   I think the main problem I am having is incompatible versions of \n&gt; libraries and the like.\n&gt;   I am not fussed about whether or not I use GTK-- or Guile, but I \n&gt; would need help in modifying the source code.\n&gt;   I would like to experiment with NEAT, but after several days of \n&gt; compiling problems and reading the archives of this list for help,\nI \n&gt; am nearly ready to give up.\n&gt;   Something that would be great is a zip file, or similar, where\nall \n&gt; I have to do is uncompress it and then run &quot;make&quot;.  Once I can run \n&gt; the XOR experiment or similar, then I can focus my attention on \n&gt; writing new code for my own experiments rather than spending most\nof \n&gt; the time just trying to get the existing code to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Robert.\n\n\n"}}
