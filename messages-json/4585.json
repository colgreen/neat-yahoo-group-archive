What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for\n&gt; something to be considered a coupled non-linear oscillators?\n\nHi Ken!  The coupling here means that the oscillators influence each\nother&#39;s behavior.  Let me use the term &quot;coupled cell system&quot; to be\nmore precise.  A coupled cell system is a collection of cells, where\neach cell i is a dynamical system with state x_i.  If cell i is\ncoupled to another cell j, then it means that the state of cell i\ndepends on the state of cell j.  Such a system is represented by a\nsystem of ODEs.  For example, the ODEs for a system with two cells\nthat are coupled to each other can be written as follows:\n\n   .\n   x_1 = F_1(x_1, x_2)   ........ cell 1\n   .\n   x_2 = F_2(x_2, x_1)   ........ cell 2\n\nThe LHS of the above ODEs represent the time derivatives of the state\nvariables, and the functions F_1 and F_2 represent the internal\ndynamics of the cells.  The linearity or non-linearity of the system\nis determined by the nature of F_1 and F_2.\n\nThe term &quot;cell&quot; is used instead of &quot;oscillator&quot; in the above\nterminology because it is not necessary for individual cells to be\ncapable of producing oscillations.  However, the coupled cell system\nas a whole can display oscillatory behaviors.  More importantly,\nmaking some of the cells and couplings identical can constrain the\ncells to oscillate synchronously or with constant phase relations with\neach other, a property that is useful for modeling gaits.  For\nexample, making the cells and couplings identical in the above\ntwo-cell system results in F_1 = F_2 = F.  It is then possible to show\nthat functions F exist for which solutions x_1 and x_2 of the system\nare periodic and half a period out of phase with each other (see [1]\nbelow for details).\n\nGaits are produced by assigning these cells to control the legs of a\nrobot.  But how do we find an appropriate function F?  In my GECCO\npaper, I found F by representing it as a neural network module and\nthen evolving it.  That is, the coupled cell system is implemented as\na neural network controller, where each network module represents one\nODE of the system.  The state variables x_i are the leg joint angles.\nThus the network takes joint angles as input and produces desired\njoint angular velocities as output.  This formalism has the following\nadvantages:\n\n  1. Theoretical understanding of the possible gaits.  Coupled cell\n     systems can be designed that model central pattern generators in\n     animals, producing symmetric, animal-like gaits.\n\n  2. Modularity: The coupled cell system I used for quadrupeds has\n     four identical cells/modules that differ only in the permutation\n     of inputs they receive.\n\n  3. Simple feed-forward neural network implementation, i.e. no need\n     for leaky integrators or recurrency.  Notice that the sigmoid\n     activation function of the neurons in the network provides any\n     necessary non-linearity.\n\nHowever, I had to manually specify the modules and the permutation of\ninputs to each module. It would be cool if HyperNEAT can evolve that\nspecification automatically.\n\n\n&gt;  For\n&gt; example, I am assuming that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\n&gt; part of a coupled non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\n&gt; appropriate for the neurons to be non-leaky?  I guess I am curious why\n&gt; having a non-leaky neuron would be the most favorable choice in such a\n&gt; model, or whether it is somehow a matter of definition.  \n\nNotice that my description above did not make any assumptions about\nleaky or non-leaky neurons.  Either type should be OK.  I used\nnon-leaky neurons because they are simpler and sufficient.  I did not\nexperiment with leaky neurons.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, what are the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n&gt; that would create this kind of system?\n\nEssentially, the substrate needs to implement the ODEs of the coupled\ncell system, i.e. substrate outputs must be the time derivatives of\nits inputs.  This condition is satisfied if inputs are joint angles\nand outputs are desired angular velocities.  The minor adjustment to\nJeff&#39;s substrate that I mentioned was to interpret outputs as desired\nangular velocities instead of desired angles.  In principle, inputs\nbesides joint angles are also not necessary for generating gaits.\nHowever, the other inputs he used (roll, pitch, yaw, and touch) may be\nuseful for more complex behaviors that require such additional sensory\ninputs.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce oscillations\n&gt; reliably, but I am not sure if that is actually anything different\n&gt; from what you are describing or just another instance of the same\n&gt; phenomenon.\n&gt; \n\nAs I mentioned above, a coupled cell system is a dynamical system.\nSince networks of leaky neurons can approximate any dynamical system,\nyou are right that it is another instance of the same phenomenon.\nHowever, the coupled cell system framework allows us to reason about\nthe high level properties of the system such as synchronicity and\nphase relations that are useful for gait generation, producing the\nadvantages I listed above.  As a result, evolutionary search can be\nbiased to discover robust and effective gaits more easily.\n\nReferences:\n\nThere are several papers by Stewart, Golubitsky and others on the\ntheory of coupled cell systems and how they can be used to model\nanimal gaits.

Valsalam&quot; &lt;vkv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interesting work!  I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; &gt; perform on this domain.  The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; &gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\n&gt; &gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With regard to the discussion about generating oscillations, I used\n&gt; &gt; neither sine wave as input nor leaky integrators.  Instead, neural\n&gt; &gt; network controllers with standard sigmoid neurons were modularized to\n&gt; &gt; behave as coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems).  As\n&gt; &gt; explained in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; &gt; post, such oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\n&gt; &gt; periodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits.  They are easy to\n&gt; &gt; evolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\n&gt; &gt; and trot for quadrupeds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With only minor adjustments to your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; &gt; substrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillators.  In fact,\n&gt; &gt; you would get a configuration similar to my modular controllers by\n&gt; &gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint angles and producing\n&gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs.  HyperNEAT would then\n&gt; &gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand.  I think that\n&gt; &gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if successful would\n&gt; &gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.  BTW, did you find that\n&gt; &gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary to\n&gt; &gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vinod\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
