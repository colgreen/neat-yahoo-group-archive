In the one run I&#39;ve performed so far the chain grew to \nlength 19 in about 6 hrs. Over a further 4 hrs max fitness increased 9 \ntimes, but no new dominant genome was found. Actually I didn&#39;t have time \nto get back to this run so it&#39;s been running for 2 days now and there \nhave been no further improvements to date.\n\nCompared against a random player the best genome found rates as follows:\n\n                         Win       Draw   Lose\nplaying 1st         89.6%   5.2%   5.2%\nplaying 2nd        81.0%   8.1%   10.9%\n------------\noverall               85.3%   6.65%  16.1%\n\nAs a baseline two random players give the following win/draw/loose rates \n(showing that playing first is an advantage):\n\n  Win       Draw       Lose\n  58.3%   12.64%   29.0%\n\nPerformance against a random player isn;t a brilliant metric but it&#39;s \nthe best I have to hand. I&#39;m thinking of trying a combination of random \nand Derek & Philips &#39;best&#39; player strategy - alternating between the two \nstrategies for each move. That way the player isn&#39;t unbeatable, isn&#39;t \ndeterministic (always plays the same game!) but plays a better game than \npure randomness.\n\nAnyway the figures above are the best I&#39;ve seen so far from any of my \nrecent TTT experiments. Also note that Derek & Philip reported these \nrates against a random player in their TTT paper:\n\n                         Win           Draw       Lose\noverall               75.88%     16.44%    7.68%\n\nThis is more like the kind of figures I was seeing before, though \nperhaps not quite as good as this - maybe if you swap their draw and \nlose figrues around you&#39;ll something like my previous best. Playing the \nbest network directly is not particularly impressive, often our champ \ndoesn&#39;t take the opportunity to complete a winning line.\n\nSo unless I&#39;ve overlooked some bug it seems to me that my TT search has \ngot stuck in a rut. This isn&#39;t surprising really since I evaluate \nagainat a dominance chain that represents just 19 strategies, all or \nmost of which are probably what Ken termed alien strategies, as far as \nit&#39;s possible to have an alien strategy in TTT! After all it is a pretty \nsimple game.\n\nDirections then are to try more traditional co-ev techniques, I only \nused a dominance chain because it seemed like a nice solution and was \neasy to implement. oh and maybe implementing dead spots in the fitnes \nspace as discussed recently.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
