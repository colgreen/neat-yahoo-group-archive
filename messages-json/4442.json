Jason plans to\n&gt; release a revised version of HyperNEAT C++ with the fix in the next\n&gt; few days after some more careful checking to make sure it&#39;s working as\n&gt; it should.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff, thanks very much for bringing the crossover bug to our\n&gt; attention. The good news is it should not significantly affect major\n&gt; conclusions from prior experimental results.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
