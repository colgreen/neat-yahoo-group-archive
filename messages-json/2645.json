Is\n&gt; &gt; there any particular reason for wan=\r\nting to do so?

Could you elaborate \nplease?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\nI could be wrong but I&#39;m g=\r\nuessing like Brian that the question is \nabout how long to keep around the =\r\nlist of innovations.  I think \nBrian did a good job answering that question=\r\n and pointing to the \nFAQ.  As far as the question of whether it is only do=\r\nne in Matlab \nNEAT, assuming I&#39;m understanding the question correctly, I be=\r\nlieve \nthe answer is that it is not particular to Matlab NEAT.   However, \n=\r\nlike Brian said, it probably won&#39;t have a huge impact on performance \nhowev=\r\ner long you keep the innovations list.  If anyone has produced \nevidence to=\r\n the contrary I&#39;d be interested in learning about it.  \n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
