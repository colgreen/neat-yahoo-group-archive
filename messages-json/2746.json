Either way, Yahoo is usually good with dividends (at least when I try to look those up).  I don&#39;t see dividend as the reason, especially because market usually subtracts the price of the dividend on the ex date.  You may try to figure whom Yahoo uses (Esignal, INet etc etc) and if they recently switched.  Each island may report the last price that went through on that island and if Yahoo is accessing that data, it could attribute for the change in your input data.\n\nAleks\n\nJohn Peberdy &lt;john@...&gt; wrote:                                  Hi Aleks,\nWell the strange thing is that I got the data from yahoo in the first place also.
