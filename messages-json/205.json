I am trying to alter the windows version\n=\r\n&gt;to do some color recognition.  Primarily, my goal is to be able to use the=\r\n\n&gt;algorithm.  After I feel comfortable with the code, I will apply it to\nbo=\r\nard\n&gt;games.  I am hoping to create a neural network that will act as a heur=\r\nistic\n&gt;function.\n\nSpeaking from my own experience, I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s=\r\n much easier to use\nKen&#39;s NEAT code under Cygwin than it is to adapt the Wi=\r\nndows NEAT code.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email=\r\n to:\nneat-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
