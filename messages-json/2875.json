I&#39;m thinking of writing my own NEAT\nimplementati=\r\non from scratch, rather than modify one of the existing\nreleases. The main =\r\nreasons are fisrtly, to improve my understanding\nand secondly to give me th=\r\ne flexibility to add any extra bits I feel\nmight be interesting.\nBased on s=\r\nome suggestions posted here, I hope to include some form of\ntime delay as w=\r\nell as the ability to use a range of different transfer\nfunctions.\n\nIt&#39;s pr=\r\nobably going to be written in C++ under MS windows. My interest\nat the mome=\r\nnt is oriented to applying NEAT to analysis of noisy time\nseries data.\n\nWou=\r\nld appreciate any suggestions, pitfalls, feature-wishes, lessons\nlearnt etc=\r\n, that may be useful for me to know in advance in this. \n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
