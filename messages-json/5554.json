I decided to use NetworkX for the genomes, because this modu=\r\nle has lots of useful algorithms and allows any python object to be a node =\r\nand edges can be associated with anything. This makes the evolution of neur=\r\nal networks a tiny part of what&#39;s really possible. Any graph can be evolved=\r\n, including undirected graphs and nodes/edges containing discrete one-of-N =\r\nvalues (integers, lists of python objects, etc). So given that an evaluatio=\r\nn function exists for any kind of graph, you can quickly setup evolution. N=\r\neural networks are a particular kind of graphs and the package will have bu=\r\nilt in code necessary to evolve neural networks - the initialization functi=\r\nons, mutators, and a C++ interface to a class that represents the phenotype=\r\ns. CPPNs support is trivial to make, and given that python functions themse=\r\nlves can be attached to nodes, it&#39;s possible to have algorithmic nodes work=\r\ning with more than one variable and .. well, infinite stuff. OK, I gotta go=\r\n. Wish me luck debugging. Talk to you soon. :) \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Jan van der Lugt &lt;janlugt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sound li=\r\nke an ambitious and noble plan.
