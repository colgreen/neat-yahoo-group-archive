Although I&#39;m actually a bit shocked it took  \nme as long to find NEAT as it did, as it&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;ve  \nbeen quite interested in for years.\n\nRather, it took until I came to write a proposal for an honours year  \nproject, when a potential supervisor pointed me towards NEAT after I  \nspent a few minutes ranting at them about the kind of things I was  \ninterested in.\n\nAnyway, now I&#39;m hopefully going to be able to spend my year doing  \nNEAT related things.\n\nAt the moment, I&#39;ve yet to get the original NEAT package to  \ncompile... Because I&#39;m trying to do so under OS X... Since while it  \nwould be possible to use Linux all year, I&#39;d *vastly* prefer to sit  \nin front of a mac.\n\nSo far, I think I&#39;ve got everything I need via fink and I&#39;ve changed  \npaths in the Makefile appropriately, but just compilation of  \nnetworks.cpp throws the to-be-expected screens and screens of errors...\n\nSearching the list archive suggests I&#39;m out of luck as far as finding  \nan empathetic ear is concerned, but I just thought before I spend  \nhours trying to get this thing to work, I&#39;d see if anyone else has  \nhad any luck? =)\n\nThanks,\n\n--\n  Adam Wright  &lt;zeno@...&gt;\n  University Website Office, The University of Western Australia\n\n\n\n"}}
