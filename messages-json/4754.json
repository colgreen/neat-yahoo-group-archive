I already have zlib-devel packages installed, so I try=\r\n and build tinyxmldll and thats where things blow up.  \n\nI create the follo=\r\nwing directories:\nmkdir tinyxmldll/build/debug\nmkdir tinyxmldll/build/relea=\r\nse\n\nbut when I try running cmake -i on those directories, I get the error:\n=\r\nCMake Error: The source directory &quot;/home/user/hyperneat/tinyxmldll/build/de=\r\nbug&quot; does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.\n\nSo then I try running cmak=\r\ne -i in the tinyxmldll directory itself, and it seems to run; however, when=\r\n I run make, I get the following error:\n\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lzlib\nco=\r\nllect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nbut I&#39;ve already set the zlib include pa=\r\nth to /usr/include and the zlib_lib path to /usr/lib64, but it still cannot=\r\n find the files.  Even when I try to build the included zlib and point the =\r\npath to those header and lib files, I get the same error.  Has anyone built=\r\n it on Linux?  Can anyone point to a step my step procedure for building hy=\r\nperneat and its dependencies?\n\nThank You\n\n\n\n"}}
