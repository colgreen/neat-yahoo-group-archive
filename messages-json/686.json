The \nstuff being discussed on this group about fitness functions and the type \nof senses needed is all good stuff and represents a significant problem \nand interesting piece of research in itself. By adding the extra factors \nof ray tracing and image analysis you are dramatically increasing the \ncomplexity of the problem. Image analysis by itself is a long-standing \nbranch of research AKAIK and I&#39;m just thinking about detecting lines and \nobjects in 2D images, in order to build a 3D model in your head you have \nto combine two 2D images (stereoscopic), you could do this with code \nrather than in the NN&#39;s but it is CPU intensive work especially if you \ninclude the ray tracing!\n\nScope creep is the death of many a project. My advice would be to keep \nyour scope focused and you can move on to the other stuff with a new \nproject later.\n\nHope I didn&#39;t come across as *too* much like a nay-sayer there :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
