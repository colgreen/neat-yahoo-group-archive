These experiments were done on keepaway, an important\nsubtask of robot soccer.  In a full soccer domain, I think a monolithic\napproach would do even worse.  Of course, NEAT might do much better than ESP\nbut I think it would still have a lot of trouble learning a monolithic\ncontroller.\n\nI am optimistic that yet-to-be-developed learning algorithms will reduce the\nneed for manual decomposition.  However, even humans, the best learning\nsystems in the world, do not learn soccer by simply playing games\nrepeatedly.  They do drills, practice basic skills, and decide on\nhigher-level strategies in a fashion that is relatively independent of how\nthey carry out lower-level actions.  Hence, they benefit from the &quot;task\ndecomposition&quot; that their coaches, based on domain expertise, know will help\nthem learn.\n\nI think it is an important goal to develop learning systems that do not\nrequire human designers to have a lot of domain expertise.  But I think it\nis even more important to find algorithms that can easily and reliably\nexploit the domain expertise that we *do* have.  No matter how difficult a\nproblem your algorithm can master from a tabula rasa approach, I think you\nwill always be able to go even further if you exploit human expertise too.\n\n-Shimon\n\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Cc: &quot;Nate Kohl&quot; &lt;nate@...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 29, 2004 8:51 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My name is Shimon Whiteson.  I&#39;m a PhD student at UT (Ken is one of my\n&gt; &gt; officemates). Nate Kohl and I have done a lot of research applying\n&gt; &gt; neuroevolution to the SoccerBots domain over the past couple years.  If\n&gt; &gt; anyone is planning to work in this domain, they might be interested in\n&gt; &gt; checking out our papers on the subject:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/shimon/school.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We also have a journal paper (not yet published) that discusses some\n&gt; &gt; coevolutionary approaches, which I&#39;d be happy to send to anyone who&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; interested.  All this work was done with ESP and not NEAT so obviously\nits\n&gt; &gt; relevance in somewhat limited.  But it does describe the input and\noutput\n&gt; &gt; representations that we found useful.  It focuses primarily on the issue\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; task decomposition: how to break a hard task like robot soccer into\n&gt; smaller\n&gt; &gt; pieces that our learning algorithms can tackle.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From doing this research I have become convinced that trying to learn\n&gt; &gt; monolithic controllers for soccer players is completely infeasible using\n&gt; &gt; current methods.  I would strongly recommend that anyone who works in\nthis\n&gt; &gt; domain consider using some of the decomposition approaches we describe\nin\n&gt; &gt; the papers or even developing your own.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please don&#39;t hesitate to drop me a line if you want to discuss any\n&gt; &gt; Soccerbots-related issues.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Shimon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, February 27, 2004 9:31 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My name is German Viscuso and I would like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce myself to the group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; members.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi German...welcome to the group. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a degree in Computer Science and I &#39;m now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researching neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques for application in the robotic soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; domain. I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hardware?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; &gt; &gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forward).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interest in this domain.  Anybody else have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences or thoughts on robot control domains?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Robot soccer?
