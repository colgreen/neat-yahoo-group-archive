It raises the question of h=\r\now bilateral symmetry arose in biological organisms.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no=\r\n link to literature or any kind of evidence, but with regard to this paper =\r\nI was wondering what kind of creatures would emerge if you would start with=\r\n an organism that has spherical symmetry (as far as you can represent spher=\r\nical symmetry with voxels ;)) encoded through a CPPN. This ancestor organis=\r\nm would be something like a unicellular organism in nature. Starting with a=\r\n CPPN of such an organism would mean that radial and bilateral symmetry is =\r\nin actual fact a departure from spherical symmetry. And I suspect that from=\r\n this starting position bilateral symmetry should be easier to reach (and i=\r\nt is maybe biologically more plausible!?).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; @Jeff: can you try =\r\nthat for us? :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From this perspective, complexification (or d=\r\niversification) would mean breaking the symmetry rather than approaching it=\r\n, which seems to me more natural. But as I said, I am not familiar with the=\r\n literature in this area.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Martin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
