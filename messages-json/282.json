I&#39;m afraid it isn&#39;t\n&gt; commented well, but it was\n&gt; just meant as a test to satisfy my own curiosity.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;do you think I could take a look at your\n&gt; &gt;source code and maybe extend it to signature\n&gt; &gt;recognition?\n&gt; \n&gt; You could try: all you&#39;d need to do would be change\n&gt; gridcirc[],\n&gt; griddiamond[] and gridsquare[] to contain your\n&gt; signatures, and modify the\n&gt; coordinate limits for the new image sizes... Of\n&gt; course, in the real world\n&gt; you&#39;d want to load them from bitmaps, which wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; necessarily be hard,\n&gt; it&#39;d just need a bit more work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, the shapes I chose are reasonably simple.\n&gt; I can&#39;t say how well\n&gt; NEAT would handle more complex shapes.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Darren\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
