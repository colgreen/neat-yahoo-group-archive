It&#39;s the key thing that distinguishes us from the\ngradient descent &#39;world&#39;.\n\nOK let&#39;s back up. RMSProp works because it uses a recent history of\ngradients alongside the current gradient in order to choose a better\nstep size. By step size I mean how far we should move and in what\ndirection, i.e. should we increase or decrease this connection weight,\nand by how much?\n\nSide note: RMSProp doesn&#39;t store an actual history of gradient for\neach variable, that would take up too much RAM. Instead each variable\nhas it&#39;s own &#39;moving average&#39;, that works a bit like this:\n\n   moving_average(t) = (moving_average(t-1) + gradient(t)) / 2\n\n(That&#39;s not the actual expression in RMSProp, but hopefully it gives\nyou the general idea.)\n\nIgnoring for the moment what RMSProp actually does with this moving\naverage, could we use something similar in NEAT? How would that work?\n\nOne possible scheme works like this. When we mutate a connection\nweight, instead of the delta being random (whether that be uniform or\ngaussian), maybe it could be a biased random delta, where the bias is\nbased on a recent history of deltas for that weight.\n\nThe recent history in this case would be the delta applied to this\nweight in it&#39;s ancestors, that is, it&#39;s parent, grandparent, etc. (I&#39;m\nassuming asexual repro right now to keep it simple and make this\nwork).\n\nSay the If the last N weight changes were all positive (increasing\nweight); that implies the offspring from those N previous spawnings\nwere good enough to still be in the population, which in turn implies\nthat increasing the weight by about the same amount again might be a\ngood idea. We don&#39;t want to use the average delta directly because we\nstill wan&#39;t randomness, but we could bias that randomness such that a\nweight increase is more likely (e.g. change the mode/mean of a\nGaussian RNG, or skew it so it&#39;s asymmetrical, whatever).\n\nProblem: In sexual repro we have two histories (one per parent). But\nmaybe we just take the average over the combined histories, so long as\nwe can match up the weights (which of course we can in NEAT).\n\nIn summary; In NEAT we don&#39;t ever calc a gradient or have any idea of\nthe gradients we are following via random walk, but gradients are\nthere, and the path described by a random walk gives us some\ninformation about the landscape and the likely gradient at the current\nlocation, so maybe we can use that information to inform the random\nwalk about better directions to explore.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
