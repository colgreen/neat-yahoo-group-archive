I did not use NEAT, but there are messages in the paper that relate to so=\r\nme of the conversations we&#39;ve had on this list.\n\nClune J, Pennock RT, Ofria=\r\n C, Lenski RE\nOntogeny tends to recapitulate phylogeny in digital organisms=\r\n. \nThe American Naturalist.  2012. 180: E54=96E63.\nPDF: http://jeffclune.co=\r\nm/publications/2012-CluneEtAl-OntegenyRecapitulatesPhylogeny-AmNat.pdf\nPopu=\r\nlar press writeup of the paper: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/0=\r\n8/120810133155.htm\n\nThe first relevant subject regards evolving good repres=\r\nentations. The work of Joel, Ken, and colleagues has shown some interesting=\r\n things regarding when we can expect bad representations, such as in target=\r\n-based search, where evolution keeps hacking in/bolting on new things that =\r\nhappen to work, and never takes the time to redesign from the ground up (or=\r\n even at middle levels). Nature, however, does something similar (though pe=\r\nrhaps to a much lesser degree): vestigial organs and developmental stages h=\r\nang around, including intermediate developmental forms that are built and t=\r\nhen dissolve entirely. In this paper we looked into whether we could see ev=\r\nidence of that &quot;bolting on&quot; in Avida, a digital evolution platform that is =\r\nnot target-based in that it does not have an explicit fitness function. We =\r\nfound evidence for bolting on, just as we would expect from the existence o=\r\nf vestigial developmental stages in biological organisms: new functionality=\r\n tended to appear later in the development of an organism, because mutation=\r\ns that changed things more fundamentally/deeper in the representation were =\r\nmore likely to be deleterious and were more quickly weeded out by selection=\r\n. I think the lesson is that this bolting on process is largely inevitable,=\r\n though I think it is a fascinating question whether it is less of an issue=\r\n in divergent search vs. convergent search. \n\nA second issue related to thi=\r\ns list is that, because evolution tends to quickly select away mutations th=\r\nat deeply change representations, it is likely a good idea to have somethin=\r\ng like the genomic diversity protection in NEAT. Because recent work has sh=\r\nown that phenotypic/behavioral diversity is more effective than genotypic d=\r\niversity, many people may be switching to phenotypic diversity and abandoni=\r\nng genomic diversity: this work suggests that both may be important. For ex=\r\nample, mutations that affect a representation deeply may initially hurt the=\r\n organism&#39;s ability to do something behaviorally different/interesting, for=\r\n the same reason that such mutations hurts fitness (e.g. they cripple the o=\r\nrganism). Protecting that innovation for a while may thus pay off.  In othe=\r\nr words, because selection will quickly work to eliminate deep changes, we =\r\nshould probably protect them for a while if we want to see better represent=\r\nations emerge.  \n\nIn the paper, we focus on an interesting consequence of b=\r\nolting on: if new functionality is added to the end of an organism&#39;s life, =\r\nthen the order that an organism develops will tend to contain information a=\r\nbout the order that traits evolved in its lineage, and vice-versa. That hel=\r\nps settle an age old debate by showing that &quot;ontogeny tends to recapitulate=\r\n phylogeny&quot;. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments. \n\n=\r\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nVisiting Scientist\nCornell University\njeffclune@c=\r\nornell.edu\njeffclune.com\n\n\n"}}
