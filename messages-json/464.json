This\n&gt; fitness function seems to produce slightly better\n&gt; defensive players, but I have yet to evolve a team\n&gt; that exhibits scoring behavior.\n\nThis sounds very similar to the results we got before we started using task\ndecompositions.  I think the problem is that soccer is a task with *very*\nsparse reinforcement.  The only time you ever get positive or negative\nfeedback is when a goal is scored.  Even if there is only one agent on the\nfield and there are no opponents, scoring a goal is a *very* complicated\ncontrol problem.  The agent has to locate the ball, approach it, kick it in\nthe right direction repeatedly, and then kick it into the goal.  It&#39;s very\nunlikely that any network in your initial population will be able to execute\nthe right sequence of actions to score a goal.  Hence, there is no\nreinforcement at all, the whole population gets a fitness of zero, and\nselective pressure is nonexistent.\n\nWith opponents who already know how to play, you can expect at least\nnegative reinforcement (i.e. they will get scored on).  Hence, it is easier\nto learn simple defensive strategies.  We found that it is not hard for a\nteam of agents to learn to crowd in front of their own goal to prevent\nscoring, but this is not exactly a step towards a promising soccer strategy.\nTask decomposition can help enormously because you can set tangible subgoals\n(e.g. learn to shoot on goal, learn to pass to a teammate, etc.) and then\nyou can artificially supply much more immediate reinforcement (e.g. award\npoints for how close the ball gets to the goal or how quickly a pass is\nreceived by another player).  The details of how we did this in our ESP\nproject are explained in the papers I mentioned before.\n\nCheers,\nShimon\n\n\n"}}
