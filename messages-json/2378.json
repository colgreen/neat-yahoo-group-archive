Each node has an\nidentity number and an activation priority.  Both are required to be unique within a graph.  Then,\nI traverse the graph one time pulling all the nodes back and putting them into a List in\nactivation order.  Then, when I go to add a connection between two nodes, I can compare the\nactivation order numbers to detect whether it is a recusive connection or not.\n\nHonestly, though, in the scope of running a whole bunch of generations with NEAT techniques\ncurrently discussed here, optimizing insertion of connections seems like it ought to be a very low\npriority.  The generation of a phenotype network seems like it would be very small compared to all\nthe fitness evaluations that are then done during the remainder of the generation.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At 00:01 02/11/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Philip Tucker wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In ANJI we have an option to enable/disable recurrent \n&gt; connections.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The way we determine if a connection is &quot;backward&quot; is by \n&gt; checking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a loop every time we add a new connection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m pretty sure this is the way Ken&#39;s code does it, too.  If \n&gt; you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;connecting nodes A & B, then start with B and traverse the net \n&gt; to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;if you connect to A.  If you do, disallow the connection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks, this is an option I&#39;ll keep in mind if I decide to \n&gt; attempt the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Othello comp. Of course this approach will probably start eating \n&gt; CPU\n&gt; &gt; &gt;cycles as the genomes become more complex so it&#39;s something I&#39;d \n&gt; prefer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to leave out of the code base in the long term - being somewhat \n&gt; obsessed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with optimisations as I am :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One possible optimisation is to keep a list of a genome&#39;s neurons \n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;order that they are connected, so that again we can safely assume \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;making a connection between some neurons with some index to some \n&gt; higher\n&gt; &gt; &gt;index in the list is OK. Elsewhere though I have code that assumes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;neurons are in innovation ID order, as this allows finding of \n&gt; neurons\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with a binary search over the list - so probably the solution is \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;maintain two lists.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;          You might already be thinking this, but one cheap way to \n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; this is to keep a &quot;depth parameter&quot; in each neuron.  Depth is \n&gt; defined \n&gt; &gt; as zero in the input layer, and for any other neurone is the \n&gt; highest \n&gt; &gt; depth amongst its inputs plus one.  All you need do then is (i) \n&gt; never \n&gt; &gt; connect from higher to lower depth (equal is OK) and (ii) scan the \n&gt; &gt; neurones recalculating the depth after any connection change.  \n&gt; This \n&gt; &gt; is a simple form of dynamic programming....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;          Ian\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe the depth-parameter way is the most efficient way to do \n&gt; it, althougn my code (like Derek and Philip&#39;s) uses loop-checking.  \n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure Mat Buckland&#39;s version of NEAT keeps track of depth \n&gt; and does things that way so you might refer to his code, or even his \n&gt; book, which explains how he did it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
