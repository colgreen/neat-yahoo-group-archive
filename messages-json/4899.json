You sa=\r\ny that the sensor is set to &quot;200-d.&quot;  Is that literally the value that is i=\r\nnput, or is it normalized to a number between 0 and 1?  Note that for a neu=\r\nral network with regular sigmoid functions, an input with a magnitude over =\r\n2 or so will simply lead to saturation, making it hard for the network to m=\r\nake any useful distinctions.  Therefore, normalization is very important be=\r\nfore inputting sensor values. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, M=\r\nark Ahlstrom &lt;lists@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The food foraging experiment is the =\r\ndangerous food foraging example  \n&gt;&gt; from &quot;Evolving Adaptive Neural Network=\r\ns with and without Adaptive  \n&gt;&gt; Synapses&quot;.    The sensors have been tried =\r\na few different ways.  They  \n&gt;&gt; are arranged around the robot as described=\r\n in the paper.  If there is  \n&gt;&gt; no food item in the arc of the sensor, it =\r\nis input to the network as  \n&gt;&gt; 0.  Otherwise, since I have a 100x100 grid =\r\nconstraining the space of  \n&gt;&gt; the objects, the sensor is set to 200-d wher=\r\ne d is the distance to the  \n&gt;&gt; nearest food item in that sensor arc. Other=\r\n was that sensors was  \n&gt;&gt; implemented was as a count of the number of food=\r\n items that the sensor  \n&gt;&gt; could detect. The outputs are rate of left turn=\r\n, rate of right turn (I  \n&gt;&gt; just take the difference to determine which wa=\r\ny to turn) and the  \n&gt;&gt; forward speed of the robot.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is related =\r\nto a larger experiment I have been running over the  \n&gt;&gt; last couple years =\r\n(at 1.5 months time per run, it took a while,  \n&gt;&gt; particularly to debug a =\r\nlate run memory corruption).  That involved  \n&gt;&gt; trying to fly airplanes al=\r\nong a random course.  My hunch there was  \n&gt;&gt; that the complexity of the en=\r\nvironment and controlled entity left a  \n&gt;&gt; relatively naive (in the sense =\r\nthat it just took position and attitude  \n&gt;&gt; as input, and generated contro=\r\nl settings as output) neat approach  \n&gt;&gt; unable to discover a suitably comp=\r\nlex control function.

My  control  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; experi=\r\nment (i.e. the one I think should definitely give a solution)  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a r=\r\ne-implementation of the food foraging problem.  The fitness  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; function=\r\n is the same.  So doing nothing nets a fitness of 32, and  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; max fitnes=\r\ns is 60.
