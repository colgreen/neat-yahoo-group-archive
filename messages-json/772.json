Is the question:\n\n\t\tCan one evolve a network using one input (say intensity) and then \nsubsequently add further inputs (say &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, redefining the \noriginal input as &quot;red&quot;) and take advantage of the fact that red, green and \nblue are all &quot;intensities&quot; and thus candidates for processing by at least \nsome sub-nets of the existing network?\n\n\tIf that is right then it&#39;s a complex subject and, so I have had a few \nthoughts on it, but I&#39;ll save them until I&#39;m sure I understood you correctly.\n\n\tIan B\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
