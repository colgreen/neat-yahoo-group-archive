Or scaling?\n\nGood catch.  The output neuron is a summation node, not a sigmoid.\n\n&gt;Also, do you have bias on your nodes, I expect you do, but I thought I&#39;d\n&gt;check because this definitely needs it.\n\nYep!\n\n&gt;If you are interested (and it may be getting a bit off base).  Does\n&gt;inputting the coords as row and column selectors help?\n\nIt might, but it won&#39;t help with where I want to get to.  For enlargement, I \nwant to be able to select an area the is smaller than one of the input \npixels, and that is not centered in one of those pixels.\n\n+----+----+----+\n|   .|    |    |\n+----+----+----+\n|    |    |    |\n+----+----+----+\n|    |    |    |\n+----+----+----+\n\nFor example, in the above illustration, the area occupied by the little \nblack dot is much smaller than the whole square it sits in, and it is \noff-center of that square.  Specifying the inputs as columns or rows being \neither active or inactive wouldn&#39;t allow me that flexibility.  For \nenlargement, I *need* to be able to specify any area of any size at any \nlocation, both larger and smaller than the original pixels, and have it \nreturn the average intensity of the &#39;function&#39; of which the inputs are a \nsampling.  The job of the network is to interpolate the function and then \nallow me to query that graph as a continuous function.\n\nThere is a way of doing that already.  They do it with something called \n&#39;splines&#39;.  And it works, it&#39;s just very computationally intensive.  And \nit&#39;s not quite as good as I have seen a neural net be.  But the neural net \nalso could only do a fixed enlargement, not a smooth and unlimited scaling, \nlike splines.  I&#39;m trying to get the best of both worlds...if it can be \ndone.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
