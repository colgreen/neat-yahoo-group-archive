Fo=\r\nr exampe, when \nyou write mutate_add_node, apply it to some dummy genomes a=\r\nnd make \nsure it really works.  Doing this will save you a lot of debugging=\r\n \ntime at the end, because if you only start debugging after the whole \nthi=\r\nng is created it will be very difficult to tease apart all the \ninterlockin=\r\ng parts to find what&#39;s causing a bug.\n\n-Memory leaks can happen in C++ with=\r\n all the dynamic memory \nallocation (and cleanup) that NEAT requires so be =\r\ncareful.\n\n-To test yout system when it&#39;s complete, use XOR.  It&#39;s not a ver=\r\ny \ninteresting experiment, but it usually catches major problems, like \nway=\r\n off parameterizations and things like that.  And it ensures that \nyou can =\r\nevolve structure since it requires a single hidden node to \nevolve.\n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi I&#39;m f=\r\nairly new to NEAT.
