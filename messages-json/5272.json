SharpNEAT has been a great resource and=\r\n I am sure \n&gt; &gt; version 2 will be appreciated. I was wondering how you feel=\r\n about \n&gt; &gt; the HyperNEAT component of SharpNEAT 2.0. Do you consider a ful=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; release of HyperNEAT? That is, is it an alternative to the two \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncurrent releases that we have out?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Ken, thanks. Yes as of this r=\r\nelease I&#39;m happy to declare it a full\n&gt; implementation of HyperNEAT; That p=\r\nart of the code in particular has\n&gt; been through a few changes over the las=\r\nt few weeks and months - e.g.\n&gt; initially the substrate was limited to 2D w=\r\nhereas now the\n&gt; dimensionality is not actually limited. Implementing the &#39;=\r\nboxes&#39;\n&gt; visualization task highlighted that issue and a few other defects =\r\nand\n&gt; design niggles that have been ironed out.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main question I fo=\r\nresee is the speciation by k-means which I want\n&gt; to do a bit of investigat=\r\nion on - some kind of visualization of the\n&gt; species/clusters to confirm it=\r\n works as expected and maybe identify\n&gt; some improvements. However the NEAT=\r\n code (which the HyperNEAT code is\n&gt; of course built on) is performing at l=\r\neast as well as in SharpNEAT 1.x\n&gt; so I don&#39;t foresee any problems there.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; And of course if anyone here would like to see a particular HyperNEAT\n&gt;=\r\n task implemented to help prove/test the codebase then I&#39;d be happy to\n&gt; ha=\r\nve a look (depending on how much work is involved :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
