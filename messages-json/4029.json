When I think about evolving the substrate, I usually think\nof a distri=\r\nbution of varying densities rather than strict layers or\npreconceived archi=\r\ntectures, which is closest to Jeff&#39;s option (c). \nOne reference for me is t=\r\nhe human brain:  It has dense masses that\nlook different from each other ar=\r\nchitecturally and do not exist in\nlayers with respect to each other (e.g. t=\r\nhe cerebellum vs. the basal\nganglia).  However, *within* particular masses =\r\nthere is some layering,\nsuch as in the neocortex, which is perhaps the most=\r\n important for\nhigh-level intelligence.  It would be nice if all that could=\r\n just\narise on its own to suit the task.\n\nWhat you said about CPPN complexi=\r\nty and substrate complexity\nincreasing together is something I never though=\r\nt of.  It&#39;s an\ninteresting idea to correlate the two.  You are right that i=\r\nn general\nthere is a problem with letting the nodes evolve in the substrate=\r\n\nbecause it is so easy to express a massive number of nodes, which\nwould no=\r\nt always be needed.\n\nOne problem I see is that we are talking about astrono=\r\nmical ranges, so\nthe range in density may not really make sense to vary on =\r\na continuum.\n For example, if you have a number between 0 and 1 that repres=\r\nents a\ndensity somehow, then that density may range from several dozen\nneur=\r\nons to several billion (if we are talking about natural scales). \nDoes this=\r\n range really make sense on a continuum between 0 and 1? \nMaybe we need to =\r\nscale it exponentially or something like that, but\nstill, then you end up w=\r\nith a tiny mutation potentially increasing the\nnumber of neurons by billion=\r\ns.  That seems odd.  In a way, we&#39;d like\nto not even be in a circumscribed =\r\nrange and just let increases keep\nhappening indefinitely, but not too much =\r\nat a time.\n\nFinally, the inputs and outputs may be a special case.  We may =\r\nwant to\npreserve the current human control of the geometry there and only l=\r\net\nevolution increase density or something like that.  \n\nAnyway, this is a =\r\ngreat topic and a completely untouched area of\nresearch with plenty of thin=\r\ngs left to try.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Jeff, \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t think that such as=\r\nsumptions about layered topology are the \n&gt; way to achieve this. There are =\r\ntwo fundamental things associated with \n&gt; any substrate in 2D/3D. These are=\r\n node presence and node density. In \n&gt; fact, skip the first, it just.. it c=\r\nan be thought of as spatial CPPN \n&gt; output where the output means the overa=\r\nll node density at that place. \n&gt; And if the output there is less than 0.2,=\r\n there are no nodes (sounds \n&gt; familiar? :)). \n&gt; \n&gt; So the same connective =\r\nCPPN is actually capable of representing its \n&gt; own substrate. But this app=\r\nroach would generate too big substrates. \n&gt; Even the most simple CPPNs are =\r\nable to generate a substrate with \n&gt; 1000s of nodes and now imagine how man=\r\ny connections there could be. \n&gt; And this is for the simplest (!) CPPN. Tha=\r\nt sounds like a huge waste \n&gt; of computational effort, doesn&#39;t it? ;) \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n So what is needed is a way to restrict the substrate complexity for \n&gt; sma=\r\nll CPPNs. Of course more complex CPPNs can be allowed to generate \n&gt; more c=\r\nomplex/dense substrates. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually just like complexification.=\r\n First the major concepts \n&gt; are established on a substrate with very low r=\r\nesolution and as the \n&gt; CPPNs complexify, the substrate becomes more comple=\r\nx. In fact each \n&gt; CPPN will generate a substrate based on its complexity (=\r\nsay, \n&gt; num_nodes+num_links). Oh I think I mentioned that. \n&gt; \n&gt; What I am =\r\nthinking is, if we actually allow substrates to evolve, \n&gt; does this mean t=\r\nhat humans cannot inject that priory geometric \n&gt; knowledge any more? Or on=\r\nly for the inputs/outputs? \n&gt; \n&gt; It essentialy becomes like.. like just a g=\r\nood indirect encoding. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff C=\r\nlune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many of you have said that it=\r\n would be nice if the substrate \n&gt; configuration\n&gt; &gt; of HyperNEAT was not p=\r\nre-defined.
