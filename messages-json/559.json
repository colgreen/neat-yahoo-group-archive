I hope either Ken or\nJoseph don&#39;t mind clarifying.\n\nAn artificial solitaire board game is used, and it is\ndescribed this way:\n\n&quot;The board is a square with n x n positions initially\nwith n/2 black stones placed about randomly on the\nleft half of the board, and n/2 white stones on\nthe right half. The neural network then proceeds to\nplay n stones the board.  Stones played on the left\nhalf appear white, and stones played on the right half\nappear black. Play occurs iteratively, with each\nsubsequent board state fed as a three-state (-1, 0,\nand 1) vector to the neural network, and location of\nthe highest output value taken as the network&#39;s next\nmove. To score a game, the neural network is given a\npoint for each of the stones that it places next to\none of the initial stones (i.e. &quot;checks&quot; it). Scoring\noccurs after a fixed number of moves, 5 stones for the\n5 x 5 case, and 10 stones for the 7 x 7 case.&quot;\n\nSo if I&#39;m understanding this correctly, in the case of\nthe 7x7 board, 7/2, or 3.5, black stones are randomly\nplaced on one half of the board, and 3.5 whites stones\nare placed on the other.  Do you round up the number\nof stones?  So are there 8 initial stones (4 white and\n4 black) on a 7x7 board?\n\nAnd it sounds as if the color of the stones being\nplaced is irrelevant, correct?  The ANN could be\nplacing red stones, or blue ones.  All that matters is\nthat it places its stones adjacent to either a black\nor white stone.  It gets a point for each of these\nmoves, but if a stone already has a stone placed next\nto it, no points are awarded, correct?  And the ANN\ngets 10 moves on a 7x7 board, right?\n\nSo if this is all correct, the most an ANN can score\nin a given 7x7 game is 8, correct?\n\nAnd on a 5x5 board, are there six initial stones?  3\nblack and 3 white?  And what are you considering &quot;the\nleft half&quot; and &quot;the right half&quot; if there are an odd\nnumber of rows and columns?  \n\nFor example, if the grid is 5x5, and empty board looks\nlike this:\n\n0  0  0  0  0\n0  0  0  0  0\n0  0  0  0  0\n0  0  0  0  0\n0  0  0  0  0\n\nRight?  If we place three black stones randomly on the\nleft and three white stones on the right, we get\nsomething like this (where black is -1 and white is\n1):\n\n-1  0  0  1  0\n 0 -1  0  0  0\n 0  0  0  0  1\n 0 -1  0  0  0\n 0  0  0  1  0\n\nYou say that the ANN is given a point if it places a\nstone next to an existing stone.  Does &quot;next to&quot;\ninclude diagonally?  If so, in the typical board\nconfiguration above, there is no intial move that the\nANN could make that *wouldn&#39;t* give it a point.  By\n&quot;next to&quot;, do you mean along a horizontal or vertical\naxis?  Even so, in the above example, there&#39;s only one\nfirst move that wouldn&#39;t score a point.\n\nWhat I&#39;m wondering is, how well does a random mover\nperform?  How often does a random mover on a 5x5 or\n7x7 score perfectly?\n\nWithout any sort of baseline, since its an artifical\ngame domain, it&#39;s difficult to get a handle on how\nhard the task is for the ANN to learn, and to get a\nsense of what it&#39;s really learned.  How much better\nthan random does an ANN have to be to play an optimal\ngame?\n\nThat said, the setup does make sense.  You&#39;ve got a\nrandom element, which ensures that the ANNs aren&#39;t\njust memorizing a static pattern, and the use of two\ncolors for a solitaire game makes sense to test the\nreusability of logic for both negative and positive\ninputs.  \n\nBut I do think the paper would benefit from a\ngraphical representation of a sample starting board\nstate and an example of a scored move and an unscored\nmove, plus relative sense of the difficulty of the\ntask.\n\nDerek\n \n\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;d also like to announce a paper of which I am a\n&gt; co-author along with\n&gt; its primary author Joseph Reisinger.
