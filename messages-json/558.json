However I\n&gt; &gt; understand it may be a pain to do complex logic in\n&gt; &gt; XSLT and as such I\n&gt; &gt; think it&#39;s reasonable to define, say, an attribute\n&gt; &gt; on neuron tags such\n&gt; &gt; as hintLayer=&quot;1&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is probably what we&#39;ll do then.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the next few days I&#39;ll upload a sample network (or\n&gt; phenotype) XML file and the XSL style sheet that\n&gt; parses it into an SVG graphic (into the NEAT XML\n&gt; folder of the &quot;Files&quot; section of the Yahoo Group\n&gt; page).  We can then hash out preferences/changes, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Derek\n\nI like that idea.  Except, instead of &quot;hintLayer&quot;, how about if we make it\nsomething more explicit like &quot;distance-from-input&quot;; i.e., the shortest path\nbetween that neuron and in the input layer?\n\nDerek and I also talked about doing something more complex than shortest\npath.  Every neuron is going to have (potentially) many many paths of\ndifferent lengths between it and the input and output layers, even with\nrecurrent connections disregarded.  If you use shortest distance, all it\ntakes is one connection to the input layer to &quot;yank&quot; that neuron back to the\nfirst hidden layer, even though it may have many more connections with\nlonger paths that, overall, would more logically place it in a layer closer\nto the output.\n\nAlso, if what we really want is something readable, even if the network\nlogically lays out as a 3 layer network with 2000 nodes in the hidden layer,\na layout that breaks that layer into multiple layers probably would be more\nreadable.\n\nWhat if we calculated a ratio of average distance to the output and input\nlayers from each neuron?  For example, let&#39;s say a neuron has:\n\n- several paths between it and the input layer whose average distance is 3\nconnections\n- several paths between it and the output layer whose average distance is 2\nconnections\n\nIt&#39;s &quot;layer-placement-factor&quot; (or whatever we want to call it) would be 0.6;\ni.e., it should be placed in a layer about 3/5 of the way between the input\nand output layers.  Then, whatever&#39;s doing the graphical layout can sort all\nthe neurons in ascending order of this factor and place them in layers\naccordingly.\n\nMaybe that&#39;s all overkill, but it seems like it would give whatever utility\nis doing the layout the information it needs to determine layers without\nforcing neurons into a specific layer.\n\n- Philip\n\n\n"}}
