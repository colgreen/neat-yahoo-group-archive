That&#39;s\n&gt;probably a Dilbert cartoon I expect.\n\nProbably there is, but the one I remember is an SF novel, possibly Sirens \nof Titan by PKD?\n\n&gt; &gt;[...] When trimming dead wood, I try trimming each\n&gt; &gt;feature the first two times it comes up (using its birth-date, the current\n&gt; &gt;cycle and the known frequency of trimming phases) and if it survives both\n&gt; &gt;of those, I assume it is important and I do not try to trim it again until\n&gt; &gt;the 10th trim-cycle after its birth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Yeh I like it, oh was this the bit that was my idea?\n\nDon&#39;t you know?  Actually no, you said:\n\n         &quot;It is a simple task to systematically test networks with\n          various sub-structures removed, if a structure&#39;s removal\n          causes a network&#39;s fitness to drop then it is useful,\n          otherwise it is functionally redundant.&quot;\n\n- in your phased searching write up.\n\n&gt;  Actually\n&gt;SharpNEAT&#39;s GUI has an &#39;Enable weight fixing&#39; check box, which basically\n&gt;means fix any connection that survived a pruning phase, permanently.\n&gt;Subsequently both the pruning algorithm and the weight mutation routines\n&gt;avoid these fixed connections. Dropping the fixed state after a few gens\n&gt;sounds like a good idea, although I was thinking about a more thorough\n&gt;revision of how this system worked, perhaps using connection &#39;hardness&#39;\n&gt;values that change over time and which tell us how often we should\n&gt;perturb a weight or consider it for pruning. This I think is something\n&gt;else that has been discussed before, anyway more on that another day.\n\n&quot;hardness&quot; I am also considering, as well as EC-like &quot;variance&quot;...\n\n&gt; &gt;       Anyway, this seems to keep the bload right down and also, I often \n&gt; seem to\n&gt; &gt;get fitness bursts just after trimming, which I attribute to cross-over\n&gt; &gt;become far more effective between individuals with no wasted genes...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes that is a common observation of mine also. It may be crossover, in\n&gt;my write-up I think I attributed this phenomenon to the deletion of\n&gt;&#39;deleterious structures&#39; or something like that, basically connections\n&gt;that feed useless noise into networks.\n\nOr the concentration of new mutations into genes that definitely \nmatter...  If that were the case, then both +ve and -ve mutations with be \nincreased and the proportion of neutral mutations would drop.\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
