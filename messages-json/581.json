I got round\n&gt; to outputting \n&gt; network XML from my own code just recently so I&#39;d be\n&gt; interested in \n&gt; giving it a go when it&#39;s ready.\n\nHi Colin...sorry &#39;bout that.\n\nPhilip and I got sidetracked on other issues this\nweekend...we didn&#39;t hash out changes to the network\nXML.\n\nI have uploaded what I&#39;ve currently got though. \nThere&#39;s a zip file in the Files section of our group\ncalled &quot;drawNetwork.zip&quot;.  It contains 4 files:\n\n--network33.xml (a sample XML file)\n--network33.svg (the SVG drawing of this network)\n--draw.xsl (the style sheet that process the XML)\n--draw.bat (a .bat file that contains the Xalan\nprocessor command for converting the XML --&gt; SVG)\n\nHere&#39;s what to do:\n1) Unzip these files into the same directory\n2) Make sure you have Xalan installed\n(http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/xalan-j)\n3) From a command line, type &quot;draw network33&quot;\n4) Make sure you have an SVG viewer installed in your\nbrowser\n(http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html)\n5) Open network33.svg with your browser and there you\ngo!\n\nForward connections are in black, recurrent in red. \nPositive connection values are in black; negative are\nin blue.  Notice that because this is *scalable*\nvector graphics, you can right click on the image in\nyour browser and zoom in and out without loss of\nresolution.\n\nNow, this is the old form of XML, so we were still\nexplicitly placing neurons between layer tags, and\ntheir position was determined by their order in the\nXML.  And connections are always placed inside the\nneuron tag for the neuron they are going *to*.  Here&#39;s\nnetwork33.xml:\n\n&lt;network&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;\nTranscriber: Chromosome: 35&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;layer id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;11&quot; from_layer=&quot;3&quot; from_position=&quot;1&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;true&quot; weight=&quot;-0.59418487635498&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/neuron&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/neuron&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/neuron&gt;\n&lt;/layer&gt;\n&lt;layer id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;6&quot; from_layer=&quot;1&quot; from_position=&quot;1&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;-0.22477551644798832&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;7&quot; from_layer=&quot;1&quot; from_position=&quot;2&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;-0.22477551644798832&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;8&quot; from_layer=&quot;1&quot; from_position=&quot;3&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;-0.22477551644798832&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/neuron&gt;\n&lt;/layer&gt;\n&lt;layer id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;9&quot; from_layer=&quot;1&quot; from_position=&quot;2&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;0.9746127803523796&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;10&quot; from_layer=&quot;3&quot; from_position=&quot;1&quot;\nrecurrent=&quot;true&quot; weight=&quot;0.9746127803523796&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/neuron&gt;\n&lt;/layer&gt;\n&lt;/network&gt;\n\n\nSo if you want to use the style sheet as is, you&#39;ll\nneed to either generate your XML in this format or\nwrite a style sheet to convert it into this format\n(sorry!)...or, if you&#39;re skilled in XSL, you can try\nto edit my style sheet (it&#39;s pretty ugly...I&#39;m no\nexpert in the technology).\n\nAlternatively, you can send me or post a simple sample\nof your XML and I can try to edit the XSL style sheet\nbased on your format.  If you do so, make sure the\nnetwork handles all possible types of connections\n(forward, recurrent, and self).\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
