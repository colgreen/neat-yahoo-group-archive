The \n&gt;data is not bounded\n&gt;(other than the actual limits of a float or double).  And the input node \n&gt;does *not* have an\n&gt;activation function.  The unbounded data present in the input node is then \n&gt;used in the activation\n&gt;of the hidden nodes (simple 3 layer feed forward network).  Any sort of \n&gt;altering the input data is\n&gt;then handled by the weight attached to that input node.  The GA process \n&gt;will then drift the\n&gt;weights around such that inputs which are not so valuable are muted with \n&gt;smaller weight values.\n&gt;And inputs which are important are magnified with higher weight values.  \n&gt;And all of these weights\n&gt;will eventually form a function over which the input data is �normalized� \n&gt;based on each input�s\n&gt;relative importance, a sort of first approximation of the input data�s \n&gt;inter-relatedness.\n\nThis is what I have seen, as well.  And it is how my Perl version of NEAT is \nimplemented.  Obviously, I didn&#39;t port Ken&#39;s C++ code to Perl, I took the \nideas from the papers and re-implemented them.\n\n&gt;In contrast, Philip and Derek indicated an input data point entering their \n&gt;ANN implementation is\n&gt;actually being pushed through the input node&#39;s activation function.  Then \n&gt;the &quot;modified&quot; data\n&gt;point is now placed into the input node.  It is then used in the activation \n&gt;of the &quot;hidden&quot; nodes.\n\nI&#39;m inclined to think that for a controller, which is what NEAT is most \noften applied to, that the practice of running the input values through the \nactivation function doesn&#39;t hurt it much.  But I can easily imagine domains \nwhere the practice could render it nearly impossible for NEAT to evolve a \nsolution.\n\n&gt;Sidenote: In SEMIANN, I do not allow a connection to have a destination of \n&gt;an input node.  So\n&gt;there is no need for an activation function at an input node.  And input \n&gt;node is treated as just\n&gt;an unbounded data point.\n\nDitto for Perl NEAT.\n\n\n\n"}}
