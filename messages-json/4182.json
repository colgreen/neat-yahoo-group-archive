You \nsw=\r\nitched to\n&gt; zero-G and you switched to looking for oscillations. Do I have =\r\nthat \nright?\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of curiosity, did you try just searching for oscillat=\r\nions but \nnot\n&gt; switching to zero-G? Alternately, did you try taking some o=\r\nf your \nwalkers\n&gt; from zero-G and then turning gravity on?\n&gt; \n&gt; This raises=\r\n an interesting question in novelty search research: how \ncan you\n&gt; use a g=\r\nood seed organism to kick-start a process? If you have a \nwalker that\n&gt; mov=\r\nes a few steps away and then falls, it seems that the beginning \nof\n&gt; novel=\r\nty search will simply reward the easy discovery of all the \npoints\n&gt; around=\r\n center. So, instead of working on the walker&#39;s genome and \nmoving\n&gt; farthe=\r\nr out, it will revert to producing all the &#39;fall left&#39;, &#39;fall \nright&#39;,\n&gt; et=\r\nc since that is the low hanging fruit. Once all that low hanging \nfruit is\n=\r\n&gt; gone, the genome of the walker is probably lost. There would be a \nchance=\r\n of\n&gt; recovering it, I guess, if you periodically resurrected archive \nindi=\r\nviduals\n&gt; when the population is stagnating. It may even be interesting to =\r\n\ntry to\n&gt; resurrect those individuals whose end-point is furthest from thos=\r\ne \npoints\n&gt; currently being visited by the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just thinking o=\r\nut loud...\n&gt; \n&gt; Very cool stuff.

I can later mix it with fitness\n&gt; &gt; search once a=\r\n good population has evolved, on objectives\n&gt; &gt; like &quot;swimming&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nLet me mention about one interesting experiment I made with the NS\n&gt; &gt; NEVH=\r\n. I restricted the substrate connectivity so that output-\n&gt;output\n&gt; &gt; conne=\r\nctions are not queried. Then I made the environment to 0 \ngravity\n&gt; &gt; and r=\r\nemoved the ground plane. The behavior characterization was\n&gt; &gt; changed like=\r\n this. The behavior data is a vector of 15 doubles\n&gt; &gt; representing the out=\r\nputs. Each time an output oscillates (going to\n&gt; &gt; +treshold and then -tres=\r\nhold, or vice versa), its corresponding \nplace\n&gt; &gt; in the vector is increme=\r\nnted.\n&gt; &gt; So the vector is actually counting how many oscillations the \nout=\r\nputs\n&gt; &gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate oscillating with high \nfreque=\r\nncy\n&gt; &gt; is very far in the behavior space. Different outputs oscillating \na=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; counted too. The behavior distance metric is the eucledian \ndistance=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; between these 15-D vectors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So novelty search now has to find=\r\n new ways to oscillate the entire\n&gt; &gt; body, to do repeating movements. In a=\r\nll the runs, Novelty Search \nwith\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT finds walking gaits 100% of=\r\n the time, in the first 1000\n&gt; &gt; evaluations. There are also swimming gaits=\r\n and all kind of stuff \n(I\n&gt; &gt; saw one individual actually dancing :))\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; So what was stopping it from walking before, is the gravity. \nKeeping\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; balance on one leg and trying to walk at the same time turns out \nto\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; be very hard task. One environmental constraint that would be \nuseful\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to make it walk is, when only one foot has stepped on the ground,\n&gt; &gt; stic=\r\nk that foot to the ground. So the chance the humanoid to fall \nis\n&gt; &gt; minim=\r\nized. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for the novelty search stagnation, where getting new beh=\r\naviors\n&gt; &gt; becomes hard, the population begins to do something like a rando=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; probing anything that is not the same stuff. Then it begins to \nrely\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; entirely on mutation to get out somehow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I finally bor=\r\nrowed a windows machine from someone and looked at\n&gt; &gt; this.

The visualization I just =\r\nproposed\n&gt; &gt; might help\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on this front. Do the points added in the arch=\r\nive tend to be\n&gt; &gt; further and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; further away from 0,0....or is it just =\r\nfilling in the spaces in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; nearby\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vicinity? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Despite=\r\n these concerns/suggestions, it is very fun stuff to look\n&gt; &gt; at...and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n its exciting that you are hybridizing these ideas so quickly and\n&gt; &gt; testi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital =\r\nEvolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: David D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:46:57=\r\n -0000\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [neat] Re: New file uploaded to neat\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, this looks really=\r\n cool Petar.
