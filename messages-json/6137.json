Given the utility of having multiple objecti=\r\nves, it is indeed an important question.  It&#39;s true that the main problem i=\r\ns that it is not clear how speciation should interact with the non-dominate=\r\nd fronts.  \n\nOur group recently has tried simply replacing NEAT-style speci=\r\nation with a &quot;genetic diversity objective.&quot;  The benefit of that approach i=\r\ns that you don&#39;t have to worry about the interaction between speciation and=\r\n the pareto front while you still get some protection for genetic diversity=\r\n; the downside of course is it&#39;s not certain that the dynamics will be exac=\r\ntly like fitness sharing.  But you can see an example of this approach in t=\r\nhis paper:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_ab13.pdf\n\nThe genetic div=\r\nersity objective is defined there as: &quot;In particular, the genomic diversity=\r\n of a given genome is quantifi=0Ced as the average distance to its k-neares=\r\nt neighbors in genotype space as measured by NEAT&#39;s genomic distance measur=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nOf course, the approach you are suggesting is different and would pres=\r\nerve fitness sharing.  I actually was co-author on a paper that tried to do=\r\n something like that a while ago, and you can see it here:\n\nhttp://www.scie=\r\nncedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197610001442\n\nIn this paper (if I ca=\r\nn remember correctly) I believe the pareto-ranking is computed within each =\r\nNEAT species and a single fitness score (that can then be modified by fitne=\r\nss sharing) is assigned to each individual based on pareto-rank. \n\nI think =\r\nthat differs a bit from the options you are considering, but at least it pr=\r\novides some context and seemed also to work okay.  I need to think more on =\r\nwhat is actually the best way to combine these methods because right now I&#39;=\r\nm not sure what is really best, but it seems there are multiple ways you co=\r\nuld go that are at least viable.  The main thing is to make sure that no ma=\r\ntter what you do, you don&#39;t lose the ability to protect genetic diversity.\n=\r\n\nJoel might have more comment since he&#39;s played with the genetic diversity =\r\nobjective (the first approach I mentoined) himself.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I have another implementation kind of question (I was hoping I would\n&gt; =\r\nrealise the answer once I wrote it out, but that didn&#39;t happen!):\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m =\r\nimplementing the NSGA-II multi-objective EA method in my (Hyper)NEAT\n&gt; soft=\r\nware (https://github.com/OliverColeman/ahni). I&#39;d like to continue\n&gt; using =\r\nspeciation and fitness sharing (according to species). It seems I\n&gt; need to=\r\n try and merge the NEAT algorithm and the NSGA-II algorithm, which\n&gt; comes =\r\ndown to something like:\n&gt; \n&gt; Evaluate fitness of entire population\n&gt; Specia=\r\nte\n&gt; Foreach generation\n&gt; Create offspring from existing population\n&gt; Selec=\r\nt parents (using speciated fitness)\n&gt; Reproduce\n&gt; Apply mutation operators\n=\r\n&gt; Add offspring to population (NOTE: the population size is now temporarily=\r\n\n&gt; bigger than the desired size)\n&gt; Evaluate fitness of entire population (s=\r\nome fitness values would need to be\n&gt; recalculated (eg novelty) but not oth=\r\ners)\n&gt; Speciate\n&gt; Rank and sort population by non-dominance *(**separately =\r\nwithin each\n&gt; species? If not then **using original fitness OR shared fitne=\r\nss as\n&gt; determined by speciation?)*\n&gt; Cull population by successively remov=\r\ning lowest ranked sets (within each\n&gt; species) until the desired pop size i=\r\ns reached (is slightly more\n&gt; complicated than this)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m wondering fir=\r\nst whether it would be best to do the ranking and sorting\n&gt; separately with=\r\nin each species, and if not then is it a good idea to use\n&gt; speciated fitne=\r\nss (as determined by NEAT) when ranking and sorting.\n&gt; \n&gt; If not ranking an=\r\nd sorting separately within each species, then a reason\n&gt; for using speciat=\r\ned fitness when ranking and sorting is that speciated\n&gt; fitness sharing hel=\r\nps protect innovation and the ranking and sorting\n&gt; determines which member=\r\ns of the population (which at this point includes\n&gt; the previous population=\r\n and the new offspring) will remain for the next\n&gt; generation. A possible r=\r\neason against is that it might &quot;skew&quot; the results\n&gt; of the ranking and sort=\r\ning procedure (which is intended to find the &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; Pareto fronts/sets). =\r\nPerhaps as long as the elites (according to each\n&gt; objective) are maintaine=\r\nd in a species then it doesn&#39;t matter much one way\n&gt; or the other.\n&gt; \n&gt; (No=\r\nte that there are two selection stages being employed: the one to select\n&gt; =\r\nparents to produce offspring (which I think should be the same as that for\n=\r\n&gt; NEAT: mating within species, etc), and the one to reduce the population,\n=\r\n&gt; after adding offspring to it, to the desired population size).\n&gt; \n&gt; I hop=\r\ne the above makes sense, let me know if anything is ambiguous, etc.\n&gt; Thank=\r\ns in advance for any advice!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; \n&gt; T: 0421 972 953 | E=\r\n: oliver.coleman@... | W: http://ojcoleman.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
