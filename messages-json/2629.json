Before your match you do\nnot know what game you will be play=\r\ning, and for the competition they\nwill add new games that haven&#39;t been rele=\r\nase so people can&#39;t just\nprogram for all the different games.  During the w=\r\neeks of the\ncompetition you are allows( and encouraged) to make changes to =\r\nyour\napplication for the next week&#39;s matches.  The play clock can vary from=\r\n\nbetween 10 seconds and an hour.  This year they plan to have a pretty\nlarg=\r\ne range of the clocks.  If you don&#39;t make a move the GameMaster\nwill for yo=\r\nu, if you make an illegal move, the GameMaster will make a\nmove for you and=\r\n you get a score of 0 for the match.\n\nSo the short answer I believe is &quot;Yes=\r\n, it is plug and play.&quot;. :-)\n\nCharles Tarun\n\nOn 4/20/06, Kenneth Stanley &lt;k=\r\nstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reising=\r\ner &lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Per NEAT, is there any training/evolution=\r\n that occurs prior to\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; competition, or do you basically start ev=\r\nolving the population\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scratch during the competition, once you=\r\n receive the rule set?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After the spec is received, there is some am=\r\nount of time for\n&gt; initial\n&gt; &gt; learning before the match commences. For now=\r\n we&#39;re just starting\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; scratch. I&#39;m not convinced that we can do a=\r\nny meaningful neural\n&gt; &gt; network &quot;pre-patterning&quot; given our current archite=\r\ncture. Eventually\n&gt; &gt; we&#39;d like to explore using SOMs for the input layer, =\r\nand at that\n&gt; &gt; point it definitely becomes an option though.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sound=\r\ns like this can be interesting but I&#39;m also wondering a few\n&gt; details.  So =\r\nlet&#39;s say you get a spec, what exactly do you do next?\n&gt; Do you get to chan=\r\nge some code around or add a new fitness function or\n&gt; perhaps sensor/outpu=\r\nt combos appropriate to that spec?  Or is it\n&gt; completley plug and play and=\r\n you have a totally generic architecture?\n&gt; Then you just sit and wait a fe=\r\nw hundred generations for evolution to\n&gt; pop out with something?  It would =\r\nbe cool if it was totally plug and\n&gt; play, such that your platform could be=\r\n used by anyone to evolve any\n&gt; game spec right away with no further coding=\r\n, but I&#39;m not sure from\n&gt; what you say how it works exactly.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
