From this we can see that the non-linearity\n&gt; introduced by the \n&gt; feedback on the output node plays a crucial part. So\n&gt; although there are \n&gt; no hidden nodes, for practical purposes the output\n&gt; node is performing \n&gt; the role of a hidden node.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just though i&#39;d mention it as a nice small example\n&gt; of how an evolution \n&gt; based search has found an unexpected (to me anyway!)\n&gt; architecture.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
