Of course I am not meaning to demand something, =\r\nbut just to give you something that may or may not inspire you in the futur=\r\ne:  In our group and others multiobjective optimization is increasingly bei=\r\nng used in combination with NEAT and neuroevolution.  As mentioned in prior=\r\n discussions in this group, if you wrap NEAT with NSGA II (the multiobjecti=\r\nve evolutionary algorithm) then you can pretty much get away with substitut=\r\ning a &quot;genetic diversity&quot; objective (which uses historical markings to comp=\r\nute distances as in regular NEAT) for traditional NEAT-style speciation and=\r\n get similar results to original NEAT.  But the main motivation for having =\r\na multiobjective framework is you can combine different reward schemes.  Fo=\r\nr example, the novelty search+local competition (NSLC) algorithm from Joel =\r\nLehman and myself makes novelty one objective and local competition another=\r\n (and genetic diversity a third).  Of course many people on this group have=\r\n done other great stuff with multiple objectives.  Anyway, having that abil=\r\nity opens up a lot of room to play with ideas, so it would be cool if some =\r\nfuture SharpNEAT came with a user-friendly framework for specifying a set o=\r\nf multiple objectives.  Just daydreaming for the future :)\n\nI fully agree w=\r\nith Ken on this point.\n\nMoving the genetic diversity of NEAT to an objectiv=\r\ne and implementing a classic MOEA (like NSGA-II) would allow people to easi=\r\nly experiment with many recent ideas like novelty search & objective [1], b=\r\nehavioral diversity & objective [2], connection costs & objectives [3], beh=\r\navioral diversity & objective & transferability [4,5], diversity & objectiv=\r\ne & reactivity, objective & generalization [6],, etc. And, of course all th=\r\ne papers that Ken just cited.\n\nIn short, implementing a multi-objective ver=\r\nsion of NEAT would make a lot easier to experiment with different selective=\r\n pressures, which is a promising avenue of research. We did this in our own=\r\n EC framework (http://sferes2.isir.upmc.fr but NEAT is not fully released y=\r\net) but our NEAT implementation is not very mature.\n\n1. Mouret, J.-B.
