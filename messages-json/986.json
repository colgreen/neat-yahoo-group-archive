The former is much more efficient than the latter.\n&gt;\n&gt;If you&#39;re talking about just connecting a single neuron into the\n&gt;network that was just hanging around unconnected beforehand, that&#39;s\n&gt;logically equivalent to mutating a new neuron and two connections\n&gt;between two existing neurons, right?  Why not add this type of\n&gt;mutation to your GA, rather than have a whole bunch of neurons that\n&gt;don&#39;t do *anything* until a connection mutates to link them up with\n&gt;the rest of the functioning network?\n\nI would think that, because you are splitting an existing connection, you \ndon&#39;t have things that are just &#39;hanging out there&#39; unless you happen to \nsupport deleting connections.  Since Ken&#39;s NEAT doesn&#39;t do that, it&#39;s a moot \npoint.  With the current way that things are designed in NEAT, *every* node \nis ultimately connected to both the input and the output, so every node DOES \ncontribute at least a little to the overall fitness.  If the weights are \nsuch that their impact is minimal, future mutations and crossovers could \nchange that at any time.\n\nIf you do support deleting connections, that changes the dynamic a lot.  For \none thing, you may have to deal with orphaned nodes.  If you have a low \nmutation rate and you spend a lot of time evaluating lots of different \npossibilities, then deleting most likely takes you back to somewhere you&#39;ve \nalready been once upon a time.  If your mutation rate is higher, then that \n&#39;going back&#39; might actually take you back somewhere that you haven&#39;t been \nyet.  Somewhere that you wouldn&#39;t have been able to get to, because you had \nalready passed it.  But then again, since simple genomes are preserved, you \nmight well have found it eventually.\n\n\n\n"}}
