I am running\nthe \n&gt; c++ implementation and the only thing I thought needed changing was\nthe \n&gt; evaluation function more specifically how the errorsum was\ncalculated\n&gt; i.e.\n&gt; for &quot;or&quot;\n&gt;    \nerrorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\n&gt; and for &quot;and&quot;\n&gt;    \nerrorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that when I run the program for OR and AND it rarely \n&gt; finds a solution and if it does the final network seems overly\ncomplex \n&gt; and usually takes many more generations than XOR despite being a \n&gt; &quot;simpler&quot; function.  My question is whether there should be more to \n&gt; change in the program or if neat is just better with XOR than AND\nor \n&gt; OR(I don&#39;t see why that would be...).  I figured since they were\nall \n&gt; binary logic functions the parameters could stay the same and the \n&gt; starting genome seemed as simple as it got so that didn&#39;t look like\na \n&gt; problem.  I&#39;m not too familiar with neat yet; maybe I&#39;m overlooking \n&gt; something simple so any tips would help.   Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; irvin h.\n\nHi Irvin, actually NEAT is finding a solution, it just doesn&#39;t realize\nit&#39;s found it because it thinks you are still doing XOR.  The way it\nchecks to see whether it&#39;s done in the XOR experiment is separate from\nthe fitness funcion.  Look at the lines:\n\n   if ((out[0]&lt;0.5)&&(out[1]&gt;=0.5)&&(out[2]&gt;=0.5)&&(out[3]&lt;0.5)) {\n    org-&gt;winner=true;\n    return true;\n  }\n  else {\n    org-&gt;winner=false;\n    return false;\n  }\n\nThese lines are the ones that check if you have a winner.  Note they\nare not the same line where fitness is computed that you mention\nabove.  So you have to change *both*.  In other words, for example,\nfor OR it would be:\n\n if ((out[0]&lt;0.5)&&(out[1]&gt;=0.5)&&(out[2]&gt;=0.5)&&(out[3]&gt;=0.5)) {\n\nAfter that &quot;winner check&quot; is fixed, it should work.  I notice NEAT\nfinding a solution almost immediately (i.e. reaching a fitness of 16)\non the OR test.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
