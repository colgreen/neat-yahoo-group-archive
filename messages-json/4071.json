However, I think creating\nthe =\r\nsubstrate for a single agent will prove to be quite challenging. \nI know fa=\r\nr less about stock trading than I probably should, but from\nwhat I do know,=\r\n it seems as though there aren&#39;t that many regularities\nyou could build int=\r\no the substrate, which somewhat defeats the point\nin using HyperNEAT.  Neve=\r\nrtheless, I would be interested in hearing\nhow you planned to lay out the s=\r\nubstrate, as you probably know more\nabout the regularities in the domain th=\r\nan me.\n\nAs for the questions in your initial post:\n\n1.  Again, I&#39;m no stock=\r\n expert, but I think if you are using HyperNEAT\nand there is a regularity a=\r\nmongst the outputs it might be a good idea\nto use multiple outputs.  If you=\r\n put the sell node at -1, the buy node\na +1, and nothing at 0, do the other=\r\n nodes logically fit in anywhere?\n Of course, this is just me thinking, so =\r\nmy ultimate answer is &quot;try\nboth.&quot;  As far as forcing binary output, can&#39;t y=\r\nou just do something\nlike &quot;if (output&gt;.5) return 1; else return 0;&quot;?\n\n2.  I=\r\nf you know a priori that 3% is a good threshold for activity, you\nmay want =\r\nto try that, but I&#39;m not sure that it is easier to predict\npercent change o=\r\nr to make a classification, intuitively it seems like\nthe latter would be e=\r\nasier, but I&#39;d still recommend trying both or\nasking someone with more expe=\r\nrience in the stock trading domain.\n\n3.  Recurrence can look back as many t=\r\nimesteps as necessary.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Petar,\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the fact HyperNEAT uses nodes with diff=\r\nering activation\n&gt; functions (sine, abs, etc.) instead of just sigmoid.  My=\r\n understanding\n&gt; is NEAT only uses sigmoid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, my eventual goal is =\r\nto evolve an agent in a single time frame,\n&gt; say daily, then create a role =\r\nwhich uses weekly, daily, and hourly\n&gt; agents in much the same way as the r=\r\necent multi-agent paper discussed.  \n&gt; \n&gt; You are correct the geometric reg=\r\nularity is not as strong as the\n&gt; typical robotic examples, but I was intri=\r\ngued by HN&#39;s ability to\n&gt; scale.  I will look into NEAT by itself though.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; --Todd\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_cher=\r\nvenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well I don&#39;t understand what does HyperNEAT to do=\r\n with it. Unless you \n&gt; &gt; believe there is some geometric regularities in t=\r\nhose time series \n&gt; &gt; there is no point to use HyperNEAT. Try regular NEAT =\r\nfirst.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
