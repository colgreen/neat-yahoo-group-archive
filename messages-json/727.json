I experimented with a tree based genome structure last \nyear and was intending to take a fresh look at that work once I had a \nworking NEAT implementation. The way my code is organized I should be \nable to switch one genome represenation for another with relative ease. \nI might still do this but I can see that the tree structure which allows \ncopying of sub-branches and also nodes that refer to sub-branches is a \ndivide-and-conquer approach - it doesn&#39;t fully allow for specialization \nof already evolved structures although I did allow for extra nodes on \nthe tree after a reference-node. This allowed for expressing a sub-part \nof the tree genome in the phenotype and then attaching further neurons \nand connections to it, but it didnt allow for overriding existing \nstructure, e.g. re-use of a structure but with some different \nconnections weights. Yeh, so from this I would draw a distinction \nbetween specialization by extension and specialization by modification.\n\nI still see that sort of approach as being brittle when compared to a \ngenome representation that specifies rules for growing structures rather \nthan encoding the structures directly. I suppose it&#39;s a half-way-house \nof sorts.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
