(note that many of these are actually\n&gt; irrelevant since\n&gt; they already represent winning positions, so ignore\n&gt; those)\n\nYes, and symmetries can also be ignored.  This makes\nsense.  It wouldn&#39;t be that difficult to sit down and\nfigure out all the possible legal moves for all\npossible legal board states, excluding symmetry, and\ndetermine what the best moves are for each.\n\n--- Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Mainly this was for consistency of evaluation. If a\n&gt; network recieved a\n&gt; score of 90% once, it should score 90% again on the\n&gt; next trial. I forget\n&gt; exactly why this was important (something to do with\n&gt; the data collection).\n\nI understand that evaluation against a random opponent\nis noisy, since there is of course a random element. \nThis can be normalized by playing more games...which\nthen takes more computer resources, which you say you\nwere trying to conserve.\n\n&gt; &quot;Solves&quot; is used very loosely here. It solves\n&gt; tic-tac-toe in the sense\n&gt; that it cannot get much better playing against the\n&gt; strict opponent. \n\nPerhaps I&#39;m being nitpicky here, but it would probably\nhave been more accurate to say that the networks\nlearned how to block threats, or how to tie, or how\nnot to lose.  Presumably your networks performed very\npoorly against a random opponent (this has been my\nexperience in evolving directly against BEST).\n\n&gt; It depends on what your goal is. Mine was to\n&gt; demonstrate that Modular NEAT\n&gt; actually evolved things. \n\nSince evolution is essentially defined as a change in\ngene frequencies in a population over time, I don&#39;t\nthink you&#39;d even really need a fitness function to\nsimply evolve a population.\n\nSomebody correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but evolution would\noccur even in a randomly-selected, randomly-mated\npopulation due to simple genetic drift, which would be\neven more pronounced in smaller populations.\n\nI would think the goal of using a neuroevolutionary\ntechnique such as NEAT would be to optimize the\nperformance of a particular entity in a particular\ndomain.\n\nThat is, evolution per se is not inherently\ndirectional, but when we apply genetic algorithms, we\nare trying to be directional, to solve a particular\nproblem.\n\nAgain, forgive me if I&#39;m being pedantic and overly\nliteral, but there&#39;s enough conceptual and linguistic\nfuzziness that I&#39;ve noticed in the literature, and I\ntry to keep things clear in my head.\n\n&gt; Truly solving tic-tac-toe I\n&gt; think would require\n&gt; always tying the perfect player (in all of the\n&gt; perfect game trees), and\n&gt; always playing to win against non-perfect players.\n\nYeah, I agree.  What I&#39;ll probably do is use the\nAngeline/Pollack method of benchmarking players, and\nif manage to evolve individuals that always tie BEST\nand nearly always win against RAND, I&#39;ll analyze their\nmove behavior my explicitly comparing its behavior to\nBEST with every board configuration.\n\nI&#39;ve already also done a bit of planning for the next\ndomain we&#39;d like to tackle, which is Gomoku\n(five-in-a-row on a 15x15 board).  It&#39;s a high\ninput/output domain, with 225 possible moves on the\nfirst turn and a very large branching factor, so\nexplicitly determining optimal moves as in Tic-Tac-Toe\nisn&#39;t going to be feasible, I don&#39;t think.  \n\nSo I plan on evaluating our evolved Gomoku players\nagainst hard-coded players or available freeware\nplayers.  And there&#39;s a similar problem with Go, which\nis our goal beyond Gomoku.  The strength of an evolved\nplayer is probably going to have to be evaluated based\non its performance against either other available AIs\nor, as Fogel did which Checkers, against humans.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
