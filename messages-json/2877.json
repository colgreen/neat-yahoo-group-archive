No transfer function. Effect is just to delay a\nnod=\r\ne update by one firing cycle.\nDoes that feel like a reasonable approach to =\r\nimplementing\nan evolvable time delay?\n\nMike\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s a few pointers:\n&gt; \n&gt; -D=\r\nebug every function as soon as you create it.  For exampe, when \n&gt; you writ=\r\ne mutate_add_node, apply it to some dummy genomes and make \n&gt; sure it reall=\r\ny works.  Doing this will save you a lot of debugging \n&gt; time at the end, b=\r\necause if you only start debugging after the whole \n&gt; thing is created it w=\r\nill be very difficult to tease apart all the \n&gt; interlocking parts to find =\r\nwhat&#39;s causing a bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Memory leaks can happen in C++ with all the dyn=\r\namic memory \n&gt; allocation (and cleanup) that NEAT requires so be careful.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -To test yout system when it&#39;s complete, use XOR.  It&#39;s not a very \n&gt; i=\r\nnteresting experiment, but it usually catches major problems, like \n&gt; way o=\r\nff parameterizations and things like that.  And it ensures that \n&gt; you can =\r\nevolve structure since it requires a single hidden node to \n&gt; evolve.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi I&#39;m fairly new to NEAT.
