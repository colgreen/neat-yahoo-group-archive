For example, take\n&gt; some regulatory pathway &#39;A&#39; that is very short but highly conserved\n&gt; across several different modules. A mutation on &#39;A&#39; will then affect\n&gt; all of those modules. Whereas a mutation in as less-conserved process,\n&gt; say &#39;B,&#39; would have a smaller phenotypic effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus not only the mechanism of crossover and DNA transcription, but\n&gt; also development itself affects what we think of as phenotypic\n&gt; mutation.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Joe\n\nUm. So perhaps mutation rate could be applied at a level below the\nwhole individual but above each weight? Perhaps each node might have a\ncharacteristic that controls the mutation rate of its connections -\nperhaps just the in- or out-bound ones, to avoid resolving the\ndifferent levels at each end.\n\nThat way we might see the development of more volatile sections, where\nthe search space is being traversed more aggressively.\n\nOr not. Although I find the idea attractive to a degree, I think this\nmay be a technique that might be more beneficial to, say, SANE, where\nthe node is the individual.\n\nMike\n\n"}}
