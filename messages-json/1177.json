Still no where near a &#39;solution&#39;, but\n&gt;proceeding.\n&gt;\n&gt;I found that if I installed cygwin (http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/)\n&gt;on my windows box, I&#39;m able to use it as a client for the project, too.  \n&gt;So,\n&gt;for all those out there that wanted to help, but didn&#39;t have a linux box,\n&gt;there you go!\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, Collin, there was a bug in the client that broke the auto-update\n&gt;feature.  I fixed it, but you need to manually update your machine in order\n&gt;to pick it up.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve added some nice graphs to the status page.  First graph is maximum\n&gt;fitness per generation.  It fluctuates a lot, because of the slightly \n&gt;random\n&gt;nature of the fitness evaluation process.  But I&#39;ve also plotted the \n&gt;running\n&gt;average, which definitely shows an upward trend.\n&gt;\n&gt;The second graph replaces the old HTML-based population fitness graph.  It\n&gt;is a bar graph, one bar per network, with the scale of the graph\n&gt;representing the range of fitness within the population.  A zero in this\n&gt;graph represents the minimum fitness, not a zero fitness.  Likewise, a max\n&gt;value does not represent a solution, only the top performer.  The graph \n&gt;only\n&gt;shows the relative fitness between networks, not an overall fitness value.\n&gt;The graph shows the networks in the order in which they were created, so \n&gt;all\n&gt;the elites from the previous generation appear first, followed by the\n&gt;offspring for each topology.\n&gt;\n&gt;The next graph is harder to understand.  It is a measure of how stable, or\n&gt;reliable, the fitness value described above is for each network.  If the\n&gt;fitness of a network is still wildly fluctuating, then it is not very\n&gt;stable.  If the fitness hasn&#39;t changed appreciably in some time (where time\n&gt;is number of samples processed), then it will have a high stability.  The\n&gt;idea is, if we reach a point where all the networks have a stable fitness,\n&gt;we are done for that generation (we can finish up early).  Unfortunately, \n&gt;at\n&gt;this point there is one topology whose fitness values still fluctuate\n&gt;wildly, so it has low stability, so the mechanism that was intended to help\n&gt;the experiment get through generations faster isn&#39;t yet able to do so.\n&gt;\n&gt;The final graph is a fitness histogram.  The bars at the extreme left\n&gt;represent the lowest fitness within the population, the bars at the right\n&gt;represent highest fitness, and the height of the bar represent how many\n&gt;networks are in that range of fitness.\n&gt;\n&gt;The next graph I intend to add is a pie chart, which shows the relative\n&gt;investment in each topology (offspring allocation number, not necessarily\n&gt;the same thing as actual offspring, since there is an offspring limit).\n&gt;I&#39;ll try to add that today or tomorrow.\n&gt;\n&gt;Any comments or suggestions for the status page?
