However I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand it may be a pain to do complex logic in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; XSLT and as such I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it&#39;s reasonable to define, say, an attribute\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on neuron tags such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as hintLayer=&quot;1&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is probably what we&#39;ll do then.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the next few days I&#39;ll upload a sample network (or\n&gt; &gt; phenotype) XML file and the XSL style sheet that\n&gt; &gt; parses it into an SVG graphic (into the NEAT XML\n&gt; &gt; folder of the &quot;Files&quot; section of the Yahoo Group\n&gt; &gt; page).  We can then hash out preferences/changes, etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; I like that idea.  Except, instead of &quot;hintLayer&quot;, how about if we\nmake it\n&gt; something more explicit like &quot;distance-from-input&quot;; i.e., the\nshortest path\n&gt; between that neuron and in the input layer?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek and I also talked about doing something more complex than\nshortest\n&gt; path.  Every neuron is going to have (potentially) many many paths\nof\n&gt; different lengths between it and the input and output layers, even\nwith\n&gt; recurrent connections disregarded.  If you use shortest distance,\nall it\n&gt; takes is one connection to the input layer to &quot;yank&quot; that neuron\nback to the\n&gt; first hidden layer, even though it may have many more connections\nwith\n&gt; longer paths that, overall, would more logically place it in a layer\ncloser\n&gt; to the output.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if what we really want is something readable, even if the\nnetwork\n&gt; logically lays out as a 3 layer network with 2000 nodes in the\nhidden layer,\n&gt; a layout that breaks that layer into multiple layers probably would\nbe more\n&gt; readable.\n&gt; \n&gt; What if we calculated a ratio of average distance to the output and\ninput\n&gt; layers from each neuron?  For example, let&#39;s say a neuron has:\n&gt; \n&gt; - several paths between it and the input layer whose average\ndistance is 3\n&gt; connections\n&gt; - several paths between it and the output layer whose average\ndistance is 2\n&gt; connections\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s &quot;layer-placement-factor&quot; (or whatever we want to call it) would\nbe 0.6;\n&gt; i.e., it should be placed in a layer about 3/5 of the way between\nthe input\n&gt; and output layers.  Then, whatever&#39;s doing the graphical layout can\nsort all\n&gt; the neurons in ascending order of this factor and place them in\nlayers\n&gt; accordingly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe that&#39;s all overkill, but it seems like it would give whatever\nutility\n&gt; is doing the layout the information it needs to determine layers\nwithout\n&gt; forcing neurons into a specific layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n\nThis is about the way I programmed my network graphing program.  You\nalso need to add a little bit a random noise to the horizontal\nplacements or else everything aligns and connections land on top of\neach other.  But I think there might be better ways to do this...note\nthat that what you are proposing is very computationally intensive and\nmay not be tractable for large networks (although fine and neat\nlooking with small ones).\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
