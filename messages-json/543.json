I guess \n&gt; &gt; you could calculate the shortest number of &#39;hops&#39;\n&gt; for each hidden \n&gt; &gt; neuron to an input neuron? Trouble is you might\n&gt; end up with all of \n&gt; &gt; the neurons in layer 1 !!\n\n\nYeah...we&#39;ve thought about placing nodes based on\nshortest distance to either the input layer or output\nlayer.  We&#39;ve also thought of simply evenly\ndistributing the nodes into a set number of hidden\nlayers (e.g. 10) to facilitate easier viewability.  We\nhave also considered a slightly more complicated\nalgorithm that would compute the nodes&#39; distance from\nboth the input and output layers, and place it\naccordingly.\n\nThe placement of nodes in layers is somewhat\narbitrary, since they really aren&#39;t in a layer.  My\ninclination would be to favor placing them in layers\nbased on ease of readability when graphically\nrepresented, since that&#39;s the primary reason for\nputting them in layers in the first place.\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; This is basically how I did it in my network display\n&gt; routine.  (See\n&gt; for example the network picture at\n&gt; www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html) I\n&gt; typically don&#39;t find\n&gt; them all in one layer at all...it usually works out\n&gt; pretty well.  The\n&gt; one thing to make sure of is not to count a\n&gt; recurrent connection as a\n&gt; hop-  otherwise you can go in circles- but that\n&gt; requires also knowing\n&gt; which connections are recurrent, which may also be\n&gt; difficult depending\n&gt; how you keep track of things.  \n\nYep...good point.  We&#39;ve got logic that determines\nwhether a connection is recurrent at the time we\ngenerate the XML, so we add a boolean &quot;recurrent&quot; tag\nto each connection as well.\n\n&gt; The problem is that\n&gt; this method is very\n&gt; computationally expensive, and also requires always\n&gt; knowing which\n&gt; connections are recurrent.  Once you get thousands\n&gt; of nodes I find it\n&gt; starts lagging out a lot before drawing anything.\n\nWell, our XSL style sheet is going to be able to parse\na network of thousands of nodes (and therefore\nprobably tens or hundreds of thousands of\nconnections), but I&#39;m not sure any such graphical\nrepresentation is going to be very human-readable, no\nmatter how it&#39;s laid out, at least if it draws every\nsingle structure.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
