The growing disruptive impact of construction operators as the size =\r\nof the construction plan increases, seemly undercuts the benefit of compact=\r\n nature of the approach, and also illustrates a fundamental strength and we=\r\nakness of NEAT. NEAT, starting from minimal size, mitigates the disruptive =\r\nnature of various operators at the beginning allowing for more effective us=\r\ne of computational resources for growing of the organism in a profitable po=\r\nrtion of the design space. But as organism size increases, the growing disr=\r\nuptive impact of some operators, and where they are applied, increasingly b=\r\nog down further progress.\n     In the context of BlindBuilder, two examples=\r\n are useful:\n1) Bridge: The concept of a bridge is simple and straight forw=\r\nard. From a construction perspective, could be achieved with a single eleme=\r\nnt of appropriate size and orientation. While the size of the construction =\r\nplan is vastly different based upon the characteristics of the formative el=\r\nements, though the concept is still simple, the disruptive impact of variou=\r\ns operators on form, fit, function and convergence is also vastly different=\r\n.\n2) Wall: Also, the concept of a wall is simple and straight forward. And =\r\nagain from a construction perspective, could be achieved with a single elem=\r\nent of appropriate size and orientation. The same comments also apply regar=\r\nding construction plan size and associated disruptive impact of constructio=\r\nn operators.\n     The point being, that the sensitivity of the concept shou=\r\nld not be subject to the scale of the formative elements, but rather the su=\r\nitability of the formulation to the objectives of the concept. In the const=\r\nruction context, this is more straight forward. The overall objective is co=\r\nmposed of a relatively few well known concepts taken together in some relat=\r\nive orientations WRT each other (i.e. a house can be composed of four ortho=\r\ngonal walls and a roof). The construction operators should be confined to r=\r\nefinement of suitability of the formative elements and their orientations t=\r\naken together WRT the individual concept, guided by concept specific operat=\r\nor selection criteria (i.e. semi-separable multi-subobjectives).\n    Of cou=\r\nrse, in the general case, the identification of concepts is not as straight=\r\n forward. But efforts to identify reusable genetic material snippets would =\r\nmost likely qualify as identification of concepts, and would thus likely be=\r\nnefit from: a) partitioning of the genome for application of operators, and=\r\n b) application of concept specific operator selection WRT concept suitabil=\r\nity for the current overall objective.\n\nAndy\n\n\n"}}
