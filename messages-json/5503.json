As you\n&gt;&gt; say, it can&#39;t &quot;get there from here&quot;=\r\n. It can&#39;t build enough structure and optimize it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; performance to find =\r\na better solution before that species dies out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually &quot;fractured dom=\r\nains&quot; wasn&#39;t a term I was aware of, however I\n&gt; just read this:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Evo=\r\nlving Neural Networks for Fractured Domains (2008), Nate Kohl\n&gt; and Risto M=\r\niikkulainen.\n&gt; =A0 http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/kohl.gecco08.pd=\r\nf\n&gt;\n&gt; So fractured domains =3D discontinuity. And yes I would say that&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\ndefinitely a major problem with NEAT (not sure about HyperNEAT). I&#39;m\n&gt; inte=\r\nrested in their use of radial basis functions, which is something\n&gt; that ha=\r\ns been mentioned before on this group but not something that\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked =\r\ninto deeply.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is this the problem you&#39;re looking to address here? Or ju=\r\nst a method of escaping a local\n&gt;&gt; maxima in fitness by allowing more radic=\r\nal adjustments/growth to network topologies in\n&gt;&gt; general?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it&#39;s es=\r\nsentially the same thing if discontinuity is the reason\n&gt; you&#39;re stuck - wh=\r\nich is very often the case I would say. Complex\n&gt; fitness lanscapes are alm=\r\nsot by definition &#39;fractured&#39; (As an exercise\n&gt; try and think up a complex =\r\nlandscape/domain that isnlt fractured).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One thing I was wondering abou=\r\nt, and I haven&#39;t poked around to see if anyone has done\n&gt;&gt; some research in=\r\nto, is fiddling with the species die-off parameter. I was thinking it might=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; be worth trying (if someone hasn&#39;t done it yet), is to remove the speci=\r\nes die off if-hasn&#39;t-\n&gt;&gt; improved-in X generations bit if no species fitnes=\r\ns has improved in some specified\n&gt;&gt; amount of generations.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t e=\r\nxpect this to be a major issue where we are right now. If\n&gt; a species hasn&#39;=\r\nt improved in a long time then it&#39;s probability of\n&gt; improving in a further=\r\n equally long time is low. Evolutionary\n&gt; techniques constarined by computi=\r\nng resources are always a\n&gt; probabilities game - you try and spend your lim=\r\nited CPU time searching\n&gt; the areas of the space that have the highest prob=\r\nabilities of yielding\n&gt; good solutions. This same argument sort of applies =\r\nto the idea of\n&gt; increasing populations - from one perspective the size of =\r\nthe\n&gt; population is irrelevant as you can only evaluate some fixed number o=\r\nf\n&gt; genomes per unit of time. The main effect of pop size is thus to\n&gt; prov=\r\nide a broader genetic base to drive genetic crossover and to keep\n&gt; an as d=\r\niverse as possible population of search points across the\n&gt; fitness landsca=\r\npe.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think if you&#39;ve sat with the same &quot;champion&quot; for a large numbe=\r\nr of generations, it could\n&gt;&gt; be worthwhile to do something radical, like g=\r\nreatly increase mutations,\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. Just generally - if a search is stuc=\r\nk then &#39;do something else&#39;\n&gt; would seem to be good advice :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sur=\r\ne someone has toyed with this at some point. I can always use another coupl=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; hundred of pages of papers/dissertations to add to my &quot;to-be-read&quot; pil=\r\ne going into my\n&gt;&gt; thesis :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think others have played with dynamic =\r\nmutation rate. The problem I\n&gt; think is that there may not be any easy rout=\r\nes out of a local maxima,\n&gt; increasing mutations will sample points a littl=\r\ne further out than\n&gt; before but it&#39;s potentially clutching at straws in man=\r\ny cases. The\n&gt; other way of looking at it is that the encoding space or the=\r\n fitness\n&gt; landscape (sort of teh same thing) could be changed such that th=\r\nere\n&gt; are easier routes to the good solutions - that&#39;s essentially what the=\r\n\n&gt; radial basis function paper above is doing - your nets can;&#39; get there\n&gt;=\r\n from here, so use a different type of net.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n"}}
