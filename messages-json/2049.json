It is in both Ken and Colin&#39;s co=\r\nde.  Shouldn&#39;t one\ndegree be 0.017?  If it is radians, that works out to be=\r\n around 4\ndegrees.  Some of the more commonly used constants are declared a=\r\ns\nshortcuts earlier in the code, e.g.:\n\n   double one_degree=3D 0.0174532;\t=\r\n/* 2pi/360 */\n\nWe just replaced 0.07 with the variable &quot;one_degree&quot;.  Is th=\r\nis right?\n\n2) When the environmental state values are normalized for input =\r\ninto\nthe network, they are handled differently in single and double pole\nba=\r\nlancing.  For single:\n\n\t// Provide state info to the network (normalised to=\r\n 0 to 1.0).\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(0, (cart_pos_x + trackLength/2.0) / tra=\r\nckLength);\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(1, (cart_velocity_x + 0.75) /1.5);\n\tnetw=\r\nork.setInputSignal(2, (pole_angle + twelve_degrees) / twentyfour_degrees);\n=\r\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(3, (pole_angular_velocity + 1.0) / 2.0);\n\n\nFor doub=\r\nle:\n\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(0, state[0] / trackLength);\n\tnetwork.setInputS=\r\nignal(1, state[1] / 2.0);\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(2, state[2] / 0.52);\n\tnet=\r\nwork.setInputSignal(3, state[3] / 2.0);\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(4, state[4]=\r\n / 0.52);\n\tnetwork.setInputSignal(5, state[5] / 2.0);\n\nWhy are these differ=\r\nent?\n\nFor double it seems like you don&#39;t actually get values scaled between=\r\n\n0 and 1 or -1 and 1.\n\n3) Are 100,000 time steps necessary?  It seems to us=\r\n that all networks\nwe&#39;ve looked at so far either fail or succeed very early=\r\n in each\ntrial, (e.g., &lt;10,000 timesteps).  This would greatly increase\neff=\r\niciency to truncate the amount of timesteps.\n\nThat&#39;s it for now...thanks in=\r\n advance for any answers...\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
