Go=\r\nod luck \n&gt; creating a training set for a mobile robot. So, I developed a fe=\r\nw \n&gt; methods to emulate a training set, effectively evolve the network \n&gt; d=\r\nynamically. But, this had several obvious deficiencies. I soon \nfound \n&gt; NE=\r\nAT, rtNEAT, and hyperNEAT. \n&gt; \n&gt; From what I understand after reading sever=\r\nal publications and \n&gt; experimenting with some established demonstrations, =\r\nI found the the \n&gt; NEAT model is quite useful, but also presents several ob=\r\nstacles of \n&gt; its own. In a physical robot, evolving networks is not very \n=\r\n&gt; practical. So, after some careful consideration, I came up with a \n&gt; solu=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n&gt; The solution was to have two environments. One drives the robot =\r\n\nwith \n&gt; a basic hyperNEAT neural network, while a second environment runs =\r\n\nin \n&gt; a simulated environment. The NEAT in the simulation will be allowed =\r\n\n&gt; to evolve until a threshold is met for a Fitness improvement. When \n&gt; th=\r\nis threshold is achieved, that neural network is transitioned to \n&gt; the liv=\r\ne robot, and the simulation is given fresh environment data \n&gt; from the sen=\r\nsors, and the cycle begins again. This will allow the \n&gt; NEAT to evolve, an=\r\nd still allow for good operation of the robot. \n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of this is going=\r\n to be done in MRDS to minimise computation \nin \n&gt; the robot, and also take=\r\n advantage of the physics and other \n&gt; components of the simulation environ=\r\nment.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the model I am going to try to implement, which then lea=\r\nds \nme \n&gt; to my question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Question 1:\n&gt; I have been able to find quite=\r\n a bit of documentation on the \nvarious \n&gt; forms of NEAT. But, I have been =\r\nable to find no information on how \nto \n&gt; actually use NEAT in code. Perhap=\r\ns I am not looking in the right \n&gt; places. Hopefully you can point me in th=\r\ne right direction. \n&gt; \n&gt; Question 2:\n&gt; Has anybody done any work along this=\r\n line? I see many projects that \n&gt; use NEAT for various organism simulation=\r\ns and such, but not really \n&gt; anything to drive a physical robot. I would a=\r\nppreciate any help on \n&gt; this.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
