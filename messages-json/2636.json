I don&#39;t \nknow =\r\nwhat all the variables mean so I&#39;ll wait for you explanation, \nbut one thin=\r\ng I noticed that was surprising is a graph showing that \nnot keeping champi=\r\nons climbed faster than keeping champtions.  That \nseems strange, but it&#39;s =\r\npossible it has something to do with SLEAT \nbeing steady state?  In a stead=\r\ny state GA of course there is no need \nfor explicit elitism, and it may eve=\r\nn hurt.  In any case, I&#39;m not \ncertain that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.\n\nken\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\nI&#39;ve uploaded a zip file of my first results to\n&gt; the SLEAT folder in the f=\r\nile area.
