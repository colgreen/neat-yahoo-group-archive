Coming to the red dot simply \ntriggers =\r\n&quot;You found the solution!&quot; thing, nothing more. It is \ninteresting that, whe=\r\nn I remove random walls from the maze during the \nnever-ending loop of disp=\r\nlaying the solution, although it doesn&#39;t \nreach the goal every time, it sti=\r\nll avoids the walls, it almost never \ncrashes (colliding with a wall means =\r\ndeath in this version). So NEAT \nbased Novelty Search actually finds a poli=\r\ncy of behavior that leads \nthe individual to the goal as a consequence of i=\r\nt, i.e. it doesn&#39;t \nlearn every piece of the maze. But sometimes individual=\r\ns do get \nconfused when some walls are gone, which implies that it is the \n=\r\nparticular genotype that is important. Many can navigate that maze, \neven w=\r\nithout hidden nodes. Some of them are general solutions capable \nof navigat=\r\ning any kind of maze, but others are dependant on the \nconfiguration of thi=\r\ns particular maze. \n\nPeter C\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, kelly parker &lt;bi=\r\ngblockfw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; very interesting.\n&gt; thanks for sharing.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; IMO a better experiment would be to eliminate the goal(red dot) \nwhile =\r\ntraining the bot.\n&gt; Naturally, you need some sort of intermediate goal to d=\r\no anything \nuseful.\n&gt; set the goal as mapping the maze instead of finding t=\r\nhe red dot.\n&gt; Now, you have another very acceptable &quot;gimmee&quot; behavior to ad=\r\nd to \nthe bot.\n&gt; pick a wall(right or left) and follow it until you get bac=\r\nk to \nwhere you started.\n&gt; then do the same thing with the other wall.\n&gt; no=\r\nw put the red dot back in anywhere you want.\n&gt; \n&gt; the bot now sees the fore=\r\nst in spite of the trees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 5/25/08, petar_chervens=\r\nki petar_chervenski@... wrote:\n&gt; From: petar_chervenski petar_chervenski@..=\r\n.\n&gt; Subject: [neat] The NS 2D maze demo\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: =\r\nSunday, May 25, 2008, 6:41 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       =\r\n      Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re welcome, I really enjoy contributing to thi=\r\ns ongoing \nresearch, \n&gt; \n&gt; as this idea is so new and inspiring. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well=\r\n I have several versions of this program, and I currently don&#39;t \n&gt; \n&gt; draw =\r\nthe archive of behaviors as it gets quite slow when the \narchive \n&gt; \n&gt; beco=\r\nmes too large. I am currently experimenting with my NEVH \nproject \n&gt; \n&gt; com=\r\nbined with novelty search. It is actually a typical example of \nan \n&gt; \n&gt; in=\r\ndirect encoding combined with novelty search but that didn&#39;t make \n&gt; \n&gt; it =\r\nwalk yet. It is a very ambitious goal, though. I just like to \nsee \n&gt; \n&gt; th=\r\ne ragdoll do new moves every time. Once I get something \nsatisfying \n&gt; \n&gt; e=\r\nnough (I am tweaking the behavior characterization/ distance a \nlot) I \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; will upload this too. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns. com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; kstanley@ .&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter=\r\n C, great upload!
