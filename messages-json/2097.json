I should say that my version is not a\n&gt;&gt; carbon copy of the original in implementation and is in fact\n&gt; different\n&gt;&gt; in a few areas by quite a bit (although I think functionally\n&gt; mostly\n&gt;&gt; equivalent).  The three biggest differences that I can think of\n&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; that speciation is done continuously without distinct species\n&gt;&gt; (individuals get fitness modifications depending on how new and\n&gt; how\n&gt;&gt; rare their innovations are, and probablistically mated based on\n&gt;&gt; similarity), there is no genotype - crossover and mutation is just\n&gt;&gt; done directly, and links don&#39;t have their own innovation ids\n&gt; (instead\n&gt;&gt; its a tuple of the innovation ids that they connect).   I can\n&gt; describe\n&gt;&gt; these in more detail, but I don&#39;t think they are very interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Suffice it to say that I can&#39;t guarantee that this will work\n&gt;&gt; identically to original NEAT on every problem, although it has\n&gt; done\n&gt;&gt; well thus far.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The continuous speciation idea is interesting.  People have\n&gt; speculated on doing something like that for a long time actually,\n&gt; but I don&#39;t know of anyone who actually did it before.  It would be\n&gt; an interesting study in its own right to see if doing that improves\n&gt; the algorithm.  One thing it makes me wonder about is that when you\n&gt; have discrete species you can set a target # of species and\n&gt; use &quot;dynamic thresholding&quot; to hold that number stable.  Since you\n&gt; don&#39;t have an actual # in your implementation, you can&#39;t set a\n&gt; target in the same way.  This brings up what the benefit of setting\n&gt; targets is.  One benefit is that it allows you to make sure you\n&gt; don&#39;t get explosions in the # of species, which would lead to a lack\n&gt; of diversity within each species.  In other words, the whole\n&gt; population could end up separated from each other.  Another nice\n&gt; thing is it allows several themes to totally diverge from each other\n&gt; over long periods of time.  In your scheme, it seems possible that\n&gt; because there is no particular guard in place keeping any two\n&gt; individuals from mating, over time you might get more uniformity and\n&gt; convergence.  Not sure about this though, of course it depends on\n&gt; your parameters...but I wonder how things compare.\n\n\nI described this in more detail in the other post, so I won&#39;t be redundant, but essentially a network gets a bonus for having innovation ids that are newer and/or rarer than average.\n\nI think that actually the dynamic thresholding is built in to the system: if we start to get too much diversity then all of the innovation ids will be &#39;rare&#39; and then the networks with the best fitness start to dominate again, and so on, with the right constants it should fall into a good balance.  I think..\n\nI don&#39;t think that the crossover and uniformity should be an issue, right now I&#39;m using an exponential probability cutoff, so its pretty rare (although it does happen) for very different networks to mate.\nIn fact I think if there is an advantage to using the continuous speciation its that it makes it slightly easier to give a longer leash to really weird networks without over-speciating.  But I have not really put it to the test yet I don&#39;t think.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tAlso, I have implemented a module to save and retrieve\n&gt; networks and\n&gt;&gt; evolutionary runs to and from a mySQL database, a module to\n&gt; visualize\n&gt;&gt; arbitrary parameters from the database, a 3d network visualizer,\n&gt; and a\n&gt;&gt; soccer domain with a monitor.  I ported the network evaluation\n&gt; code to\n&gt;&gt; Pyrex (C) to speed up the simulations some as well.  If Tom or\n&gt; anyone\n&gt;&gt; else is interested in any this the code it is relatively simple\n&gt; (the\n&gt;&gt; part that implements NEAT is ~500 lines), it will be here soon\n&gt; (once\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m finished cleaning it):\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neat\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \t(at the moment you can see a screenshot and some videos of\n&gt; evolved\n&gt;&gt; behaviour)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know when you are done with this and I will link it off my\n&gt; sites.  I really like the 3D visualization of the network.  I\n&gt; thought about doing something like that a long time ago but never\n&gt; got around to it.  It&#39;s pretty fun to see the network being\n&gt; manipulated.\n\nSure.  It&#39;s done actually, but I should clean it up and comment it before I am not embarassed to show it.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m curious though, what is the meaning of the &quot;species&quot; sizes if\n&gt; there are no discrete species in the system?  Do you do a post-hoc\n&gt; speciation just for graphing purposes?\n\nYup, its not used in the algorithm.  I wanted to actually plot the smooth species landscape, but this was more trouble than it was worth I decided.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tJoe (or anyone really) - I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at\n&gt; your code\n&gt;&gt; yet, but I am curious to know how you kept the GA and the network\n&gt;&gt; seperate and still had innovation numbers?  I found that this was\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; most difficult thing to deal with and essentially made any sort of\n&gt;&gt; strict meaningful OO seperation difficult to impossible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m actually not sure why this is difficult...I will leave it to OO\n&gt; experts to consider...\n\nThe innovation id&#39;s make it difficult to completely abstract the individual from the GA.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \tAlso, when I was first looking over Ken&#39;s code as a\n&gt; reference I\n&gt;&gt; massaged his comments into Natural Docs format, in case someone\n&gt; finds\n&gt;&gt; this useful it is here:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neatdoc\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow...it&#39;s cool to see it so well laid out.  Let me know if I can\n&gt; link this from the NEAT pages and I will do so...it would be helpful\n&gt; to people I have a feeling.\n\nsure, no problem.\n\n\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
