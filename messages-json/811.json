Possibly the original work to which\nthey refer might have some applications for us.  OTOH,\nwhatever their topology was NEAT might be able to\nevolve it, without knowing what they did.  I have no\ndoubt that NEAT can evolve nets with short term\nmemory.  What is not clear is how much memory, i.e.\ngiven a reasonable amount of time for evolution, how\nmuch data can be stored and retrieved.  It would also\ndepend on the manner of retrieval.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
