I don&#39;t recall the specific discussion.  In any case,\nther=\r\ne was a time when I thought evolution could be good at things like\nthat, bu=\r\nt my mind has been changing in recent years, so I appreciate\nwhat your pape=\r\nr is saying.  \n\nI think what caused me to become a skeptic about these kind=\r\ns of\nmeta-evolutionary approaches is speaking to people who advocate the\nid=\r\nea that evolution should &quot;evolve its own encoding.&quot;  That idea is\nconnected=\r\n to evolvability, which suggests that evolution can figure\nout its own best=\r\n parametrizations to become most effective at evolving\nin a particular type=\r\n of domain.  Working on encodings started to make\nme think that the search =\r\nspace of encodings is simply too vast to\nexpect evolution itself to optimiz=\r\ne the encoding.  It is basically a\nvast meta-search, far vaster than the pr=\r\noblem domain itself (which is\nalready vast to begin with in ambitious cases=\r\n), and the actual problem\ndomain would seem to locally obfuscate the landsc=\r\nape of\nmeta-parameters (just as your results show).  \n\nOverall, I started t=\r\no feel like human intuition is a better bet for\nsolving these meta-question=\r\ns, or at least for addressing them\neffectively.  Also, as we started to thi=\r\nnk about novelty search, I\nstarted to realize that evolution often innovate=\r\ns *despite* selection\nrather than because of it, which is even more complic=\r\nating at the\nmeta-level.  That is, at a meta-level like encodings, if somet=\r\nhing\ngood came about, it might actually be because selection pressure was\nl=\r\now for a time.  In other words, if selection pressure has been high,\nthe st=\r\neps towards whatever optimal meta-parameter was found would\nnever have been=\r\n taken because the stepping stones are meta-suboptimal.\n Just talking about=\r\n this issue with all these &quot;metas&quot; reminds me why\nit seems like wishful thi=\r\nnking to rely on evolution to determine\neverything.  Luck and happenstance =\r\nhave to be accepted as factors.\n\nIn another sense, evolving meta-parameters=\r\n optimally sounds\ndangerously close to a free lunch.   If there is an algor=\r\nithm that can\nevolve the right meta-parameters reliably, which in turn caus=\r\nes it to\nalways find the right solution, when would that algorithm fail?\n\nT=\r\nhe conclusion in my view is to trust our instincts.  We (humans)\nstill have=\r\n a role to play in setting the parameters of our algorithms\n, and in design=\r\ning our encodings, by thinking about the problems they\nare intended to solv=\r\ne.  We are probably not going to get away with\noffloading all the responsib=\r\nility on evolution itself, at least not if\nyou want to see it succeed in re=\r\nasonable time.\n\nBy the way, Jeff (here I go contradicting myself), there ar=\r\ne\nreportedly evolutionary algorithms that seem to show that they benefit\nfr=\r\nom mutating mutation parameters.  Evolution Strategies come to mind.\n ES ha=\r\ns done this kind of thing for years.  CMA-ES now uses\nstatistical technique=\r\ns to predict optimal mutation distributions. \nWhat do your results suggest =\r\nabout such approaches?  Are they just\nworking on &quot;toy problems&quot; or is there=\r\n some explanation for why they\nclaim to derive benefit from evolving the pa=\r\nrameters?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; A while back we had a discussion about whether natural=\r\n selection is\ngood at\n&gt; choosing its own parameters. Many people assume tha=\r\nt it would be\nbeneficial\n&gt; to evolve the parameters of a run (e.g. mutation=\r\n rate, crossover rate,\n&gt; etc.). After having done some research in the area=\r\n I have concluded\nthat it\n&gt; does not work well.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I expressed this =\r\nview previously, some of you were very\nskeptical. At\n&gt; that point, I promis=\r\ned to share a manuscript that investigates the issue\n&gt; once it was publishe=\r\nd.\n&gt; \n&gt; That manuscript finally came out yesterday in the journal PLoS\nComp=\r\nutational\n&gt; Biology. I am rather excited because they chose it for the cove=\r\nr of the\n&gt; September issue. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can see it here:\n&gt; www.ploscompbiol.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; \n&gt; Clune, et. al. =B3Natural Selection Fails to Optimize Mutation Rate=\r\ns for\n&gt; Long-Term Adaptation on Rugged Fitness Landscapes.=B2\n&gt; \n&gt; I am int=\r\nerested to see what you think. In particular, I would like\nto hear\n&gt; from t=\r\nhose of you that were skeptical of my claim. Do you still feel\nthat\n&gt; evolu=\r\ntion can manage itself in light of this work? Note: I recognize\nthat\n&gt; this=\r\n paper only covers mutation rates. However, the mutation rate is\none of\n&gt; t=\r\nhe most important parameters. Furthermore, I think similar issues will\n&gt; ar=\r\nise with other parameters that result in the perturbation of\ngenomes (e.g.\n=\r\n&gt; crossover type and rate).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; PS. PLoS allows readers to rate article=\r\ns. If you enjoyed the\narticle, and\n&gt; have a second, please rate it highly. =\r\nI would really appreciate it!\n&gt; \n&gt; PPS.
