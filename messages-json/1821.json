That is a problem in all Recurr=\r\nent Networks,\n&gt; values are difficult to store more than 10-50 iterations in=\r\n the\n&gt; network (see LSTM Link for references). \n&gt; \n&gt; \tI put LSTM inside a N=\r\nEAT. The evolution make NEAT to use \nLSTM cells\n&gt; in a productive way stori=\r\nng key values, recovering that values when\n&gt; they are useful a forgetting t=\r\nhem  if it is useful (The 3 LSTM cell\n&gt; functions).\n&gt; \n&gt; \tMy analysis of so=\r\nme of the solve problems suggest that LSTM \nhelps to\n&gt; NEAT in some problem=\r\ns to reduce greatly the searching space \nhelping to\n&gt; memorize (some times =\r\nto accumulate) some important key events that \nare\n&gt; used after to get out =\r\nthe right outputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tAn intuitional example about reduction of searchin=\r\ng space is \nserial\n&gt; XOR, if you solve serial XOR with NEAT you can see tha=\r\nt the \nsolution\n&gt; net use recurrent connection to store the first value and=\r\n later it\n&gt; compares with second value in the serial sequence. In my comput=\r\ner \n(P4\n&gt; 2,4Ghz) it last around  2 minutes to find a solution with NEAT \na=\r\nlone.\n&gt; However, when I use one LSTM cell in the NEAT-LSTM it last ONLY 5\n&gt;=\r\n SECONDS!!!!!.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)  Improving Work Methods in Real Automation Problems:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;       Motivation: Evolution systems have been achieving great \nresult=\r\ns\n&gt; in last years. In my daily work in automation projects business, I\n&gt; ha=\r\nve to face another problem: cost. That is the reason that most of\n&gt; the tim=\r\nes the industry try to avoid complex systems. Complex \nsystems\n&gt; are diffic=\r\nult to develop, difficult to modify and difficult to\n&gt; maintenance. Most of=\r\n the times, it is the last choosen resource. \n&gt; \n&gt; \tOther problems to use e=\r\nvolution systems are the \nuncertainty.  Always,\n&gt; there is some likelihood =\r\nthat a problem will converge to a \nsolution in\n&gt; a reasonable time. Some ti=\r\nme we can evaluate it, sizing the \nsearching\n&gt; space. Other times it very d=\r\nifficult to size such space. \nUncertainty\n&gt; is a variable related to, what =\r\nis known in business as, risk. \n&gt; \n&gt; \tSome recent experiment as in \n&gt; http:=\r\n//nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/whiteson.gecco03.pdf \nsuggest\n&gt; that a =\r\nway to reduce searching space is to &quot;draw&quot; the guide\n&gt; where the\n&gt; solution=\r\n will be searched. Some of my research has gone in that\n&gt; direction. In mos=\r\nt of the systems we have deal with, we have some\n&gt; previous knowledge about=\r\n them. My work is focusing in how organize\n&gt; such previous knowledge in: de=\r\ncision trees, tasks, abstraction \nlevels\n&gt; and interdependences among them =\r\nto reduce as much as possible the\n&gt; searching space. So the final goal is t=\r\no find feasibility work \nmethods\n&gt; and tools to use evolution systems in re=\r\nal automation Industry\n&gt; problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Germ=E1n.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
