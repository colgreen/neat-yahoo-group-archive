I only wrote the toribash-esque \nexperiment\n&gt; and a few changes a=\r\nnd features added to python-neat. The actual\n&gt; python-neat backend is writt=\r\nen by Cesar Gomez and is really \nterrific,\n&gt; as python has a certain elegan=\r\nce about it that makes it seem easier \nto\n&gt; grasp. \n&gt; \n&gt; In order to get it=\r\n to work you need to download the linux version of\n&gt; Command Line Breve:\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://www.spiderland.org/download.php\n&gt; Then unzip this in the breve_2.7.2=\r\n/ directory:\n&gt; http://peter.berrington.googlepages.com/tori.7z\n&gt; \n&gt; To evol=\r\nve, open a shell and navigate to the breve directory, then \ncall\n&gt; the Tori=\r\nExp with python, like this:\n&gt; python tori/toriExp.py\n&gt; To view the last bes=\r\nt individual, instead type this:\n&gt; ./bin/breve tori/viewlastbest.py\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\neres a HUGE amount of parameters for which I have no idea what the\n&gt; good v=\r\nalues are. The creator of Toribash is giving me a description \nof\n&gt; how his=\r\n game works but is not at all forthcoming with the specific\n&gt; implementatio=\r\nn details; I suppose he is reluctant to give away code\n&gt; for something he m=\r\nakes money on, but it&#39;s frustrating as his game is\n&gt; actually very well bal=\r\nanced, allowing some very nimble and natural\n&gt; looking acrobatics. Trial an=\r\nd error is probably the only solution at\n&gt; this stage.\n&gt; \n&gt; I encourage peo=\r\nple to fool around with this; I&#39;m a complete beginner\n&gt; to programming this=\r\n kind of stuff and I&#39;ve got a lot of really\n&gt; terrible code I&#39;m sure, so pl=\r\nease submit any changes that you think\n&gt; would make sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Peter,=\r\n that&#39;s a good question and of course learning to \ncontrol a \n&gt; &gt; virtual c=\r\nreature with novelty search is a complicated issue (and \nan \n&gt; &gt; appealing =\r\nidea as well). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, you have to deal with all the representatio=\r\nnal and \nphysical \n&gt; &gt; issues outside of novelty search, like how many inpu=\r\nts, how many \n&gt; &gt; outputs, and whether the body itself is not physically fl=\r\nawed in \n&gt; &gt; some way (which is possible).  As you are experiencing, the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feature \n&gt; &gt; selection=\r\n.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be useful \n&gt; &gt; because it does =\r\nnot care about the # inputs or outputs (and can \n&gt; &gt; potentially exploit ge=\r\nometric regularities), but configuring the \n&gt; &gt; substrate then becomes the =\r\nchallenge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assuming all of that stuff is set up well with whatever=\r\n system, \nthen \n&gt; &gt; novelty search is a potentially winning approach.  Yet =\r\nas you \npoint \n&gt; &gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In fact=\r\n, we are \n&gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to these questio=\r\nns \nin \n&gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general principles might help for no=\r\nw: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not not need to cont=\r\nain \n&gt; &gt; every point ever visited.  Therefore, it tends to grow much \nslowe=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations.  However, if it is indeed getting too \nbig=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; then it is not unreasonable to collapse some of the archive \npoints,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; although there is no standard method yet for how that should be \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndone.  But we have reason to believe there will be effective and \n&gt; &gt; simpl=\r\ne ways to do that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Second, the issue of one individual looking dif=\r\nferent just \nbecause \n&gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same beh=\r\navior is \n&gt; &gt; complicated.  For certain phase disaparities, the two individ=\r\nuals \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but it is true that at some \n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nisparity, they may look very different.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; &gt; whether t=\r\nhat fact is actually problematic to the novelty search \nor \n&gt; &gt; not, becaus=\r\ne it would simply reward both types of behavior.  It \nis \n&gt; &gt; possible that=\r\n the phase difference is a result of some useful \n&gt; &gt; genotypic change, whi=\r\nch could make it a stepping stone to \nsomething \n&gt; &gt; better.  Or, it is pos=\r\nsible that it is superfluous information \nand \n&gt; &gt; simply takes some extra =\r\ntime exploring the area around the phase-\n&gt; &gt; shifted individual.  So it is=\r\n hard to say a priori whether it is \na \n&gt; &gt; major concern.  We will have be=\r\ntter answers to such questions as \nthe \n&gt; &gt; technique is further explored.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I agree that it would be nice to be able to say the two \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; phase-shifted individuals are largely the same if that is indeed \n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nhat you want to say.  And for that, you would need a pattern-\n&gt; &gt; matching =\r\nmetric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. something \nmore \n&gt; &gt; sophisitic=\r\nated than simple Cartesian distance.  There are \ncertainly \n&gt; &gt; such metric=\r\ns available.  However, it&#39;s important to recognize \nthat \n&gt; &gt; it is not evi=\r\ndent at this point that ignoring the phase shift is \n&gt; &gt; actually better th=\r\nan taking it into consideration, because taking \nit \n&gt; &gt; into consideration=\r\n just means adding more information to the \nnovelty \n&gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; So overall I think novelty search is a very promising direction \nto \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ngo for such problems, but it is still in the realm of research \n(i.e. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthere is no existing precedent), so it will involve considerable \n&gt; &gt; trial=\r\n and error to get it right until all these issues are \nfleshed \n&gt; &gt; out mor=\r\ne clearly.  Ultimately, though, if our hypothesis about \n&gt; &gt; novelty vs. fi=\r\ntness is correct, novelty search may turn out to be \n&gt; &gt; the *only* way to =\r\nget certain highly complex types of behavior to \n&gt; &gt; evolve in some domains=\r\n, which is a sobering thought.  But if it \nis \n&gt; &gt; true, then there is not =\r\nmuch to do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve rea=\r\nd Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; fascinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new=\r\n approach. For the past couple of months I&#39;ve been working on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; virtual=\r\n creature controllers; specifically I have a ragdoll rig \n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n&#39;ve set up in Breve Simulation Environment (available at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://spide=\r\nrland.org )\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This ragdoll is modelled after the one in Toribash, a fre=\r\ne game \n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uses the open dynamics engine for physics, like bre=\r\nve. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So far a lot of the results I&#39;ve been having discouraging=\r\n; as \nKen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; points out early on in his latest paper, trying to make a \n=\r\nwalking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biped usually results in it falling over perpetually. You can=\r\n \nsee \n&gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WIP videos at my youtube page here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.=\r\nyoutube.com/user/thehaircrow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ultimately, I would like to packa=\r\nge AI&#39;s with the Toribash game \nso\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that they are fun to play against =\r\nin single player- I think \nthis \n&gt; &gt; goal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is attainable despite being=\r\n difficult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deception is a BIG problem here; if my fitness criteria i=\r\ns time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integrated distance from a goal, it encourages the behaviour o=\r\nf \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Tori&quot; balancing in a stable configuration forever, rather tha=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; walking, which is what I&#39;m trying to encourage. As there is 20 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n joints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in this rig, I am providing joint position and velocity \ninfo=\r\nrmation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for each joint, as well as a bias, a sine-wave, the x, y, and=\r\n z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; components linear velocity in the reference frame of the Tori&#39;s \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and finally 3 variables which correspond to the vertical, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and forward orientation of the tori&#39;s head with respect=\r\n to world\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The current experimental configuration=\r\n I am started out as \na &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll control where neural net outpu=\r\nts correspond directly \njoint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; velocity; a tanh activation function is=\r\n used to allow positive \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; negative joint movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I then re=\r\nmodeled the experiment to perform as in the Toribash \ngame;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the net w=\r\nill receive inputs (and effect joint movements) only \n&gt; &gt; every 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ti=\r\nme steps. More importantly, I increased the amount of outputs \n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40, in order to accomodate the 4 possible \njoint\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; actions which can occur on a turn: holding, relaxing, \nextending, \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flexing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that g=\r\nives a staggeringly \nhuge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Du=\r\ne to the \nimplementation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large nets=\r\n as the starting net \ncan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram on the heap. Real=\r\nizing this was a bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature selection and =\r\nphased pruning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, even with this, deception seems to prevent a=\r\nny useful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour; the Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am using a python implementation of neat developed by Cesar \n=\r\nGomez\n&gt; &gt; &gt; under the GPL, which is available at \nhttp://code.google.com/p/=\r\nneat-\n&gt; &gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This implementation is a WIP and I&#39;ve alread=\r\ny done a lot of \ntests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to incorporate the linear genome encodi=\r\nng taken from the \n&gt; &gt; EANT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; method. I&#39;ve also been trying to incorpor=\r\nate CMA-ES in order to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; optimize weights but I haven&#39;t had much succes=\r\ns meshing this \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Late=\r\nr today when I am home I will post my source files for \nanyone \n&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; FINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; represented\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amo=\r\nunt of \ntime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search meth=\r\nod \nproposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a=\r\n new \nending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of discove=\r\nred behaviours. This \nworks \n&gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I imagine) because a point isn=\r\n&#39;t a lot of information to hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I =\r\ncan compare the behaviour of 2 \nragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; is t=\r\nhere any compact encoding that \nwould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work? Since it often takes 25 0=\r\n00 seperate evaluations to get \nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this righ=\r\nt now, theres going to have to \nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate beh=\r\naviours in some way that is \nfast \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a=\r\n Tori has identical behaviour to \nanother \n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does things a coup=\r\nle of time steps later instead? Just \ncomparing \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviou=\r\nrs it would appear that they were 100% unique, yet \na \n&gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obse=\r\nrver would instantly notice the similarity in how they act.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; An=\r\ny ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
