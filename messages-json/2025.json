I realize that\n&gt; you probably won&#39;t be adding a lot of stuff at this time, but I thought\n&gt; I&#39;d raise this issue for possible discussion;\n&gt; \n&gt; I miss intern-agent communication methods. One popular method seems\nto be\n&gt; simulated pheromones, where agents can selectively drop pheromones which\n&gt; other agents can &quot;smell&quot;, perhaps using two nostril-vectors at the\n&quot;front&quot;\n&gt; of the agent. That way, one agent can follow the trail of another agent\n&gt; without being confused by pheromones behind it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pheromones slowly bleed off. What the pheromones represent is undefined,\n&gt; for evolution to use or not use as it sees fit. Ants perform some\namazing\n&gt; feats using pheromones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even cooler, give the agents two different pheromone types, so that the\n&gt; can represent different things f.i. &quot;danger this way&quot; and &quot;coolnes this\n&gt; way&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias\n\n\n\n"}}
