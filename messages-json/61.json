I completed my BS in Computer Systems \nEngineering from GIK Institute, Pakistan this May. During my last two \nsemesters, I worked on &quot;Developing Collective Intelligent Behavior&quot; \nas my Senior Design Project. The technique we (me and 3 other guyz) \nused, was NEAT. We worked in Visual C++, with OpenGL for our \nSimulation displays. \n\nWe made environments with obstacles and lights and many robots (going \nfrom 2 to hundreds). The robots had simple IR transmitters and \nreceivers, bump sensors, light detectors. \n\nWe tried to evolve simple behaviors like, gathering, flocking, \nfollowing the leader, finding light, predator-prey. In gathering, \nflocking, and finding light all the robots had the same neural nets \nto make decisions (Inputs from IR sensors, light, bump senors.. \noutputs to motors, and IR transmitter). Whereas, in the case of \nfollowing the leader and predator-prey, we had two classes of neural \nnets. \n\nAs you might have guessed, working with hundreds of robots for many \ngenerations is computationally very expensive. So, we made a \ndistributed version of NEAT. The simulations were carried out on \ndifferent client machines (mostly pIIs and pIIIs in our AI Lab), \nwhile there was one master server that carried out &quot;epoch&quot;s of NEAT \nand gave new chromosomes to every new coming client. \n\nSome of the results we came up with were very interesting. Especially \nin flocking, we could see robots behave like birds. they formed small \ngroups, sometimes even spirals (with slower robots on the inner side \nof the spiral and faster ones towards the outer edges). We evolved \nsome neural nets with 3-4 robots, and tried the same net for 50-60 \nrobots and found that the neural nets didn&#39;t work all that bad for \ngreater number of robots.\n\nIn the &quot;finding light&quot; behavior, the robots usually tended to follow \nthe walls of the room in which they were kept to come to the light \n(which was normally placed at a corner). But when we placed the \nlights somewhere in the middle of the room, then due to the physical \nlimitations of the robot, it could not find out where the lights \nwere. But once it got in the range of the light, it managed to sit \nunder it. \n\nThe results of following the leader and predator-prey were not \nsatisfactory. The predators tended to catch each other, the followers \ntended to get stuck with each other. But, I think that was due to the \nlimitations of the robots. Since, they could not distinguish between \npredator, prey etc.\n\nI will write more about my work later. \n\nAlthough, now I dont get anytime to work on NEAT. Since, I&#39;m working \nwith a software house these days, and am preparing for my GRE. I hope \nto get into a Phd program where I can continue my work with NEAT. \n\nIf anyone of you is interested in my work, feel free to ask :)\n\nI will probably be just a reader of this group unless I get time to \nrestart my work. :)\n\nRegards,\n- Umer\n\n\n\n"}}
