That\n&gt;does sound hard.\n&gt;I was thinking you would use the two image comparison to create a\n&gt;fitness gradient yourself, then the networks would just output a single\n&gt;fitness value from a single input picture after they were trained on\n&gt;that input. It would essentially grade the picture from the data\n&gt;collected from you using the comparsion, not actually make a comparison\n&gt;itself. Doing a comparison with a network does at least double your\n&gt;search dimension...\n\nTrue.  But it would be more accurate.  There isn&#39;t an absolute &#39;value&#39; of an \nimage.  Some are better because they make better use of color.  Others are \nbetter because of the visual balance.  Or the intense crispness of the \nfocus.\n\nIn this case, A could be better than B, and B be better than C, but when \ncompared, C is better than A.  For example, A has good image composition, B \nhas good contrast, C has good color.  I might prefer A over B because when \ncomparing them, the image composition makes it seem better.  B might have \nmore drama in its contrast, and therefore be preferable over C.  But C&#39;s \ngood composition isn&#39;t quite as good as A&#39;s, but it more than makes up for \nit in color saturation, so it wins over A.\n\nSo, comparing two photos to one another is the only way to really capture \nthe essence of what I want to do.\n\n\n\n"}}
