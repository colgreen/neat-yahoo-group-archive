I think it occurrs, for example, in the human\nretina, or was that in the visual system of the crab in James Anderson&#39;s work?  Whichever!\n\nI just remember the effect was to vastly reduce the input surface complexity when passing a signal\nback to the ANN processing the sensory input.  It worked by having a single neuron within a\ncluster of neurons &quot;win&quot; the activation and with its activation, inhibiting the adjacent neurons\non the cluster.  This facilitated edge detection, if I recall correctly.\n\nI guess one possible additional distinction to make would be whether to disallow anything but\ninput neurons connecting to other input neurons as it seems this would be sufficient to implement\nLI.\n\nPerhaps you know of a mathmatical explanation identifying why connecting to input nodes is not\nnecessary within the NEAT framework.  Perhaps the desired effect(s) of LI are still achievable\nwithin NEAT using the standard technique.\n\n\nDerek,\n\nIs this a pretty good re-representation of the idea LI?  And am I on the same track as you here? \nIf I am not, what is your reasons for desiring connections back to the input nodes outside the\nscope of LI?\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- Derek James &lt;blue5432@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Can I assume that you do not allow connections\n&gt; &gt; back *to* input \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nodes? and that therefore the connections you\n&gt; &gt; generate during \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution ignore input nodes as possible targets?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes right, never connect into an input node.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm...why not?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good luck with your project.   Don&#39;t be discouraged\n&gt; &gt; if it&#39;s a bit of a\n&gt; &gt; learning curve starting up.  I&#39;m sure several here\n&gt; &gt; can vouch that\n&gt; &gt; after the initial framework gets put in place things\n&gt; &gt; get easier and \n&gt; &gt; more interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah. :)  Philip and I have been working on our\n&gt; implementation for quite a while now.  We&#39;ve learned a\n&gt; lot in the meantime, but it&#39;s taken quite a bit of\n&gt; effort, even though we built it on top of an existing\n&gt; opensource neural network engine and an opensource GA\n&gt; framework.\n&gt; \n&gt; We had to ask quite a few questions along the way...as\n&gt; Ken said, hopefully this list will make it easier for\n&gt; people who are undertaking their own implementations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
