However, I had very little success.\n\nThe experiment was to simulate a bee finding a flower.\n The bee would begin its life at the hive and start\nexploring until it found the flower.  If it succeeded\nin finding the flower, the bee would be replaced at\nthe hive and the hope was that it would then find the\nflower faster.\n\nI set the fitness function to be two-fold.  First the\nbee&#39;s fitness improved if it found the flower at all. \nSecond, the bee&#39;s fitness improved if it found the\nflower faster than the previous time.\n\nI tried to force the bees to use the knowledge gained\nduring their lifetime by randomly moving the flower\nafter every generation.\n\nThe bees ended up developing a good search algorithm,\nbut never learned to use what they learned during\ntheir lifetime.\n\nIt was very frustrating, and I gave up cause I really\nwant to graduate =)\n\nBy the way, is there anyone here who could help me out\non some backpropagation algorithms? \n\nThanks!\n\n-Chris\n\n--- neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

From there,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gradually gotten more specific in what I&#39;ve\n&gt; wanted to address as I\n&gt; &gt; read more papers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you referring to this paper:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=131\n&gt; \n&gt; The one with the food foraging domain?  As Ken\n&gt; points out in the\n&gt; paper, an interesting result is that networks\n&gt; without adaptive\n&gt; synapsese are able to evolve built-in adaptive\n&gt; behaviors so that they\n&gt; can react &#39;on the fly&#39; to changing conditions in the\n&gt; domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is a pretty interesting avenue to\n&gt; pursue.  As far as\n&gt; domains go, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of domains\n&gt; where it *wouldn&#39;t*\n&gt; be interesting to try to exploit plasticity during\n&gt; the lifetime of the\n&gt; network.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d disagree with Colin that game domains would be\n&gt; out.  You&#39;d\n&gt; certainly want to be able to detect and rapidly\n&gt; adapt to various\n&gt; strategies...even in very simple games such as\n&gt; Tic-Tac-Toe there is a\n&gt; significant advantage to tailoring your strategy to\n&gt; your specific\n&gt; opponent, rather than playing solid, generic\n&gt; gameplay.\n&gt; \n&gt; So rather than trying to find a domain to which\n&gt; adaptive synapses are\n&gt; applicable, I&#39;d probably take the approach of\n&gt; choosing a domain that\n&gt; particularly interests me, then just see how\n&gt; adaptive synapses\n&gt; function in that domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are you interested in?  Games?  Imaging? \n&gt; Robotics?  Speech\n&gt; recognition?
