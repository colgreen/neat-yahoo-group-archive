You will see some non-oscillating behaviors \nalong \n&gt;=\r\n the way, but it is OK as these are novel early in evolution and \nlater \n&gt; =\r\ngenetic defects lead to stabilizing substrates sometimes. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you =\r\nwill enjoy it too. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me answer your questions. Yes, I do mean th=\r\nat the individuals \n&gt; stay in the mid-air, but their behavior is no longer =\r\ndistance \n&gt; travelled or arrival point, but the internal oscillation behavi=\r\nor \nof \n&gt; the output nodes. Actually the values in the behavior \n&gt; characte=\r\nrization&#39;s vector are a measure of the frequency of \n&gt; oscillations. There =\r\nare restriction to this, too, because the \n&gt; substrate&#39;s nodes can have a t=\r\nime constant range of (2.5 .. 5) and \n&gt; the timestep of simulation is a kin=\r\nd of normal one considering \nthere \n&gt; are 8 seconds for an individual&#39;s lif=\r\netime. So cases of just \nquickly \n&gt; blinking the activations should not app=\r\near. At least not \nfrequently. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think these behaviors (like walking =\r\nor swimming) are a good \n&gt; stepping stone for further evolution (perhaps fi=\r\ntness search with \nan \n&gt; explicit objective). Once the general pattern of a=\r\n walking or \n&gt; swimming behavior has been discovered, this itself is a good=\r\n \nstepping \n&gt; stone for the harder task (NS) or a fitness search. Though I =\r\nam not \n&gt; planning to do such an experiment yet. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your kind=\r\n yours :) \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;=\r\nkstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is a fascinating experiment =\r\nwith the zero-gravity novelty \n&gt; search.\n&gt; &gt;  Would you consider uploading =\r\nit so we can see the walkers and\n&gt; &gt; swimmers evolve?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One question=\r\n I have is when you say you get walkers &quot;100% of the\n&gt; &gt; time,&quot; you mean th=\r\ney look like that are walking, but they are not\n&gt; &gt; actually walking right?=\r\n  That is, these &quot;walkers&quot; are really just\n&gt; &gt; floating in mid-air, and if =\r\nyou actually placed them on the ground\n&gt; &gt; with gravity, they would probabl=\r\ny not balance?  Similarly, the\n&gt; &gt; swimmers may or may not swim in the fric=\r\ntion of water?  In other \n&gt; words\n&gt; &gt; you are discovering the aesthetic loo=\r\nk of various activities but \nnot\n&gt; &gt; necessarily the mechanical nuances?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assuming I am understanding that correctly, there is still a \npuzzle=\r\n \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; get them to go straight to walking on hard ground through novelt=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; search.   But I think you&#39;re oscillation-detection novelty\n&gt; &gt; charac=\r\nterization is quite clever and is progress in that \ndirection.\n&gt; &gt; Very int=\r\neresting work overall! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Jeff, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am glad that you like my program and enjoy it! :) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I know it would be cool to browse the archive, or have an \n&gt; external \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; routine that queries the archive by different criteria to show \nme \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; what was achieved during the run, but this program now is \n&gt; actually a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stepping stone for another research project I have, evolving \n&gt; leak=\r\ny-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integrator substrates by HyperNEAT combined with evolving the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; substrate itself, all used in one Alife simulation of mass-\nspring \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; creatures, sensing collision and reacting by contracting the \n&gt; springs. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And all this with Novelty Search searching for new and new \n&gt; behavi=\r\nors. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that this is a pretty serious test of how far \n&gt; comp=\r\nlexity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can go in such open-ended domain. I can later mix it with \nfi=\r\ntness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; search once a good population has evolved, on objectives \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; like &quot;swimming&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention about one interesting exper=\r\niment I made with the \n&gt; NS \n&gt; &gt; &gt; NEVH. I restricted the substrate connect=\r\nivity so that output-\n&gt; &gt;output \n&gt; &gt; &gt; connections are not queried. Then I =\r\nmade the environment to 0 \n&gt; gravity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and removed the ground plane. T=\r\nhe behavior characterization was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changed like this. The behavior dat=\r\na is a vector of 15 doubles \n&gt; &gt; &gt; representing the outputs. Each time an o=\r\nutput oscillates (going \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; +treshold and then -treshold, or vice =\r\nversa), its corresponding \n&gt; place \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the vector is incremented. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; So the vector is actually counting how many oscillations the \n&gt; outputs=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate oscillating with high \n&gt; frequ=\r\nency \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is very far in the behavior space. Different outputs \noscillati=\r\nng \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; counted too. The behavior distance metric is the eucledian=\r\n \n&gt; distance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; between these 15-D vectors. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So novelty se=\r\narch now has to find new ways to oscillate the \n&gt; entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body, to do=\r\n repeating movements. In all the runs, Novelty \nSearch \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hyper=\r\nNEAT finds walking gaits 100% of the time, in the first \n1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evalua=\r\ntions. There are also swimming gaits and all kind of \nstuff \n&gt; (I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\nw one individual actually dancing :)) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So what was stopping it=\r\n from walking before, is the gravity. \n&gt; Keeping \n&gt; &gt; &gt; balance on one leg =\r\nand trying to walk at the same time turns \nout \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be very hard ta=\r\nsk. One environmental constraint that would be \n&gt; useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to make it =\r\nwalk is, when only one foot has stepped on the \nground, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stick that f=\r\noot to the ground. So the chance the humanoid to \nfall \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; minimiz=\r\ned. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As for the novelty search stagnation, where getting new \n=\r\nbehaviors \n&gt; &gt; &gt; becomes hard, the population begins to do something like a=\r\n \nrandom \n&gt; &gt; &gt; probing anything that is not the same stuff. Then it begins=\r\n to \n&gt; rely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; entirely on mutation to get out somehow. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; P=\r\neter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I finally borrowed a windows machine from someone and looke=\r\nd \nat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this.
