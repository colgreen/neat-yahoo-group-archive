I mentioned this paper before\nin t=\r\nhis group... it describes evolving networks that output what is\nessentially=\r\n a confidence level:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?bruce:gecco01\n\n(Note =\r\nI am not an author although it&#39;s from our research group)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The recent talk=\r\n on bidding prompted an idea...\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone ever trained or evolved a n=\r\network where one of the\noutputs is \n&gt; like a &#39;confidence&#39; level in that it =\r\nis an estimate of the error of\nthe rest \n&gt; of the output?\n&gt; \n&gt; In other wor=\r\nds, suppose you have 2 outputs.  Output A and B.  A is\nthe real \n&gt; output. =\r\n There is an expected output for A.    There is an error\nvalue for \n&gt; A.  T=\r\nhe expected output of B is then the error value of A.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why bother?  Wel=\r\nl, suppose that you have evolved 100 solutions to a\nproblem. \n&gt;   Some are =\r\nbetter for one kind of input, others are better at\nanother.  You \n&gt; could l=\r\net the networks themselves decide which one is best suited\nfor a \n&gt; particu=\r\nlar input, and you could use the correlation between\nestimated error \n&gt; and=\r\n output values to calculate a more precise output for the whole\nnetwork.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; For example, network 1 has an output of 5 with an error value of\n(e.g.) =\r\n2.  \n&gt; That means, for the sake of illustration, that the real output will\n=\r\nbe \n&gt; somewhere between 3 and 7.  A second network has an output of 7\nwith =\r\nan \n&gt; error of 0.5.  So the real value is between 6.5 and 7.5.  If you\ntook=\r\n the \n&gt; average of the output values, the result is 6.  But if you took the=\r\n\ncenter \n&gt; of the overlap, the output becomes 6.75.  That value might be mu=\r\nch\ncloser to \n&gt; the correct value than just the average of the two networks=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Admittedly, it forces the network to calculate a more complex\nfuncti=\r\non.  But \n&gt; it might be useful, who knows?\n&gt; \n&gt; ___________________________=\r\n______________________________________\n&gt; Get tax tips, tools and access to =\r\nIRS forms =96 all in one place\nat\nMSN Money! \n&gt; http://moneycentral.msn.com=\r\n/tax/home.asp\n\n\n"}}
