If you look closely at the fitness graph of the\nfirst image you can see that the fitness line is jumping around a lot\n(though the variation is low).\n\nIn the second plot, interestingly, the two runs that have a constant\nenvironment (which happens to be deterministic) do not see the huge increase\nin CPPN number (it levels out at a healthy level of about 30). The changing\nenvironments, however, have the runaway CPPN bloat.\n\nIs there something in NEAT that causes bloat unless you have elitism\ncounteracting it? If so, my non-deterministic environments might prevent\nelitism from fighting bloat.\n\nHave any of you ever turned off elitism and looked at the effect on genome\nsize? This may be affecting NEAT as much as HyperNEAT. Alternately, have any\nof you looked at genome size in non-deterministic environments?\n\nAlso of interest: I tend to plot the genome node number only for the\nchampion, which may be held down due to elitism (when fitness flat lines).\nHave any of you plotted the average number of genome nodes? That number may\nreally increase, especially once fitness stagnates...if what I am seeing is\nnot pathological. \n\nThanks for any thoughts anyone has.\n\nKind regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2010 17:57:48 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: CPPN node bloat\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff, one thing I don&#39;t completely understand about your graphs (e.g. graph 1)\n&gt; is that the number of nodes in the champion goes up even when fitness is not\n&gt; going up.  If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the same champion stick around\n&gt; unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new individuals occasionally come in\n&gt; with the same fitness as the champion, but it would be very surprising if that\n&gt; is happening on every single generation.  Yet that would seem to be the only\n&gt; possibility with the number of champion nodes going up so rapidly even while\n&gt; fitness is flatlined.  So what is going on during the fitness plateau?  Which\n&gt; genomes exactly are being measured to get the node counts?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently that the number\n&gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of time\n&gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory of the\n&gt;&gt; run. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt;&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second figure where the CPPN node\n&gt;&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing environment and those runs where\n&gt;&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; One problem is that it makes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt;&gt; populations with 200-node genomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt;&gt; evolution can make too much progress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt;&gt; seen fitness continue to increase even with such large genomes).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have tried dropping the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt;&gt; that definitely changes the slope of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt;&gt; increases. The good news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Any thoughts? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
