The XSL writes the connection weight out along the path of the \n&gt;connection, which has to have an id, so to associate the weight text, \n&gt;there needs to a unique identifier associated with the connection.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I think the same applies to the \n&gt;&gt;recurrent flag.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The XSL draws recurrent connections in red and forward ones in black, \n&gt;which is useful for visualization.  Any XSL style sheet is not going \n&gt;to be smart enough to determine whether a connection is recurrent or \n&gt;not (which, as has been pointed out, can be very complicated logic).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk, understood. So would you say that both the id and the &#39;recurrent&#39; \nflag can be considered optional? Sorry to seem pedantic on this one but \nI want to be 100% sure we&#39;re all undestanding each other.\n\n&gt;It is probably best to determine whether or not a given connection is \n&gt;recurrent or not, then explicitly store that information in the XML.  \n&gt;This will be necessary for anyone either drawing (if you want to \n&gt;render that information visually) the network or trying to reproduce \n&gt;its functionality.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAgreed. Right now my own code doesn&#39;t detect recurrency at all, so if I \nhave to output a flag then I&#39;ll just set it to false and get all black \nconnections. Not a problem.\n\n&gt;In our framework, when a connection is designated &quot;recurrent&quot;, all it \n&gt;really means, from an implementation standpoint, is that the output \n&gt;from the previous timestep is stored and re-input.\n&gt;\nok. I&#39;m beginning to realise that everyone&#39;s network code may not \nfunction quite as I had thought. In SharpNEAT (my pet project) ALL of  \nthe neurons store their output value, this then is the basis of \ncalculating the activation input and output for the next time step. \nRight now I actually loop through each of the neurons once per time \nslice in the order they appear in the genome, calculating the new output \nvalues for each neuron and storing it in a seperate variable on the \nneuron. A second loop then switches all of the neurons over to their \nnewly calculated output value ready for the next time step.  This \ntechnique is distinct from a routine that actually traverses the \nnetwork, calculating output values as it goes - which I guess would \nrequire a recurrency flag to prevent the traversal from following the \nloop indefinitely.  Is this network traversal what others are doing?    \nAnyway, the point being that the technique I use doesn&#39;t know and \ndoesn&#39;t need to know about recurrency, at least not during a simulation, \nhence my confusion about the recurrency flag up until now :)\n\n&gt;  And because it is \n&gt;not clear whether or not some neurons should be designated recurrent, \n&gt;it is best to explicitly include that information with the XML.  \n&gt;\nIf the recuurency flag is an integral part of the network&#39;s operation \nthen yes I agree.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
