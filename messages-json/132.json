I had good results with it for my\nNim evolver.  There I was using floating point output\nto select 1,2, or 3.  I took the nearest integer.  Any\nresult larger than 3.5 or smaller than .5 was an\nillegal move.  Also illegal was choosing more than\nremained, so if the remainder was only two, and 3 was\nchosen, that&#39;s illegal.  I was able to evolve ANNs\nthat made only legal moves, and eventually played a\nperfect game of Nim.\n\nLater, I tried tic-tac-toe, using 9 outputs and using\nthe largest one for the move.  an illegal move was\nwhen two or outputs were the same.  These were also\nfloating point, but could easily be tied at 1.0.\nEarly on, I found there were many illegal moves.  I\nwound up selecting for legal move ability,\nsuccesfully, but I never evolved any real players.\n\nYou guys may be right that a less draconian approach\nwould work better.  If I don&#39;t quickly succeed with my\nfirst approach, I will try, try again. :)\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
