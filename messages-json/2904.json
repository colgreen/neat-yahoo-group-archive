In\n=\r\nKen&#39;s interview with Tom Barbalet of biota.org, he mentioned that NEAT\nuses=\r\n competition to weed out the least performing individuals and\nspecies, but =\r\nthey are essentially independent of each other.\n\nIs it possible to have the=\r\n entities co-operate in some way to obtain\nswarm intelligence? Also, I woul=\r\nd like to expand on this using\nheterogeneous agents (some sort of symbiosis=\r\n between agents).\n\nAny suggestions/ thoughts?\n\nRegards,\nMridul.\n\nPS: I am w=\r\norking with Tom Barbalet on NobleApe (www.nobleape.com), and\nI would like t=\r\no extend this to noblewarfare (www.noblewarfare.com) too.\n\n\n"}}
