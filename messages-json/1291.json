There are two networks built \nfrom the same genome, each takes inputs of:\n\nWaist&#39;s angular velocity[3]\nWaist&#39;s height\nAnkle angle\nKnee angle\nHip angle[2] (kicking and side-lifting, no twist angle)\n\nThe outs are the same two hip angles and the knee angle.\n\nThere&#39;s a couple of papers by Torsten Reil and Phil Husbands\n(see \nhttp://pantarhei.sourceforge.net/biblio/Biologically_Inspired_Control_of_Physically_Simulated_Bipeds.pdf)\nthat describe &quot;Central Pattern Generators&quot;-- highly recurrent neural \nnets that display cyclical output (such as that responsible for \nlocomotion) in animals and his simulations of them.  Of course, one key \ndifference is that Reil didn&#39;t use proprioceptive (eg, joint angle) \ninputs.  But so far, it looks like NEAT is finding similar CPG \nstructure, but I haven&#39;t had time to really tease apart the high-fitness \nnetworks systematically.  I hope to have an answer to that soon.\n\nOne other note is that I&#39;m using an neural activation rate of about 0.02 \nseconds.  That changes the number of neurons needed to get a given \nrhythm, and so may greatly affect the cyclical behavior.  Its on my list \nto vary that and see what happens.\n\nFinally, it seems pretty standard for these robot simulations, but I&#39;m \nusing a PID controller-- the network output is the desired angle and the \nmotor computes how to attain that angle.  That can also help the \ncyclical appearance.\n\nAs for a &quot;medium-term&quot; plan (any suggestions?), I&#39;m roughly looking into \nhow to go from the current dumb &quot;function-generator&quot; to something that \ncan walk under noisy conditions, such as rough terrain, external forces, \nimperfect actuators, etc.  (and so I&#39;ve been following the recent noise \ndiscussion with a lot of interest)\n\ndex\n\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt; Dex, a few questions: \n&gt; \n&gt; What are you inputs and outputs?  I&#39;m curious whether you used some\n&gt; external input source to get oscillations, or whether you let the\n&gt; network develop its own oscillator?  I believe the best way to get\n&gt; oscillators inside neural networks is using leaky integrator\n&gt; neurons, which I take it you did not use (since they aren&#39;t part of\n&gt; the standard NEAT distribution).  Therefore, I&#39;m curious how you got\n&gt; regular periodic oscillations to evolve with NEAT. \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you plan to post any specs on your site?  It would be cool to\n&gt; know all about how this thing was set up.  And also, what&#39;s your\n&gt; medium-term plan... are you working towards behaviors beyond walking?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Dexter Allen &lt;vector@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Ken,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Fitness is measured by recording whenever there is a collision\n&gt; between\n&gt;  &gt; the ground and a foot.  Compare the last right and left\n&gt; footsteps.  The\n&gt;  &gt; fitness is the lesser y-distance (ie, how far the back foot&#39;s last\n&gt; step\n&gt;  &gt; was from starting point).  I found this to work a little better at\n&gt;  &gt; avoiding the &quot;just fall forward&quot; local minima of CoM distance (but\n&gt; it\n&gt;  &gt; does suffer from other early traps, like shuffling the feet\n&gt; forward).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Mostly I&#39;ve been using NEAT directly from your linux version, plus\n&gt; the\n&gt;  &gt; constant-species-count change and some other minor tweaks.  I\n&gt; played\n&gt;  &gt; around with different activation functions, but didn&#39;t notice any\n&gt;  &gt; improvement and am using only sigmoid now.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The phrase you quote is meant to say that my ESN approach can be\n&gt;  &gt; evaluated by comparing its performance to that of NEAT on the same\n&gt; body,\n&gt;  &gt; muscles and physics settings, ie, using NEAT as a benchmark.  NOT\n&gt; that\n&gt;  &gt; they are equivalent.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ESN&#39;s use a form of backpropagation to train the connections to\n&gt; and from\n&gt;  &gt; a big, fixed &quot;clump&quot; of (often hundreds of) neurons with some nice\n&gt;  &gt; mathematical properties that imply internal cyclical activation. \n&gt; The\n&gt;  &gt; fact that they are designed to work in cyclical domains is the\n&gt; reason I\n&gt;  &gt; wanted to try something with them for a locomotion controller.  My\n&gt;  &gt; approach so far is just to replace backpropagation with simple\n&gt; weight\n&gt;  &gt; and enabled-or-not evolution.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not applying NEAT to the ESN stuff (yet) because I&#39;m hoping to\n&gt; first\n&gt;  &gt; get a better intuitive feel (and some code) for evolving networks\n&gt; with\n&gt;  &gt; different &quot;plasticities&quot;, in this case the totally-fixed clumps\n&gt; and the\n&gt;  &gt; evolved connections to/from the I/O.  In the long run, I&#39;d like to\n&gt; be\n&gt;  &gt; able to compose together layered behaviors-- eg, balancing,\n&gt; walking and\n&gt;  &gt; jumping.  Obviously, that&#39;s a bit of the holy grail, but I&#39;m\n&gt; hoping to\n&gt;  &gt; test soon using NEAT to evolve different networks for different\n&gt; tasks,\n&gt;  &gt; and then evolve them all together-- perhaps treating each NEAT-\n&gt; evolved\n&gt;  &gt; network as just an ESN clump.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear any feedback-- I know similar ideas have\n&gt; been\n&gt;  &gt; tossed around by a lot of people, anybody want to share any war\n&gt; stories?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Also, sorry about the movies; I know almost nothing about video\n&gt; and\n&gt;  &gt; codecs, but I&#39;ll try converting them to something more common (is\n&gt;  &gt; quicktime the best?).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks,\n&gt;  &gt; Dex\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Brian (or do you go by Dexter?),\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in your methodology: what was your fitness\n&gt; function,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; and did you do anything special to change NEAT&#39;s neural model or\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; just use it as-is?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I notice you mention Echo State Networks.  I don&#39;t know much\n&gt; about\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; these, but you say in your research & theory section, &quot;The\n&gt; success\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; of the Evolved ESN approach can be compared to that of the NEAT\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; algorithm on identical morphology.&quot;  It sounds as if you will\n&gt; evolve\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; this ESN networok...so my question is, why not evolve it with\n&gt; NEAT?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; One last thing is I can&#39;t view your videos no matter what I do. \n&gt; Are\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; they available in any other format?

I use\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; training wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; center of mass moves too far) at first until they\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; learn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; remove this external help, seed a new population with\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;m curious why you restart the population rather than just\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; changing the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; fitness function in the middle of the run?  Is it that you\n&gt; want to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; whittle away all but the best species?  Are the genes in the\n&gt; first\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; run\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; treated differently in the second run somehow?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; (first oscillate legs, then worry about\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; balancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; teach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; block torso seems to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; does the ANN\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; joint (which\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; stop)?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; The ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; rotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; from the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; just the two hip joints.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; My ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; modified PID (proportional integral derivative)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; controller to calculate the torque necessary to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; achieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; higher-level control system: the brain has desired\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; angles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; much force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; the same type of controller but just have a constant\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; desired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; angle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; swing freely.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve been doing some similar stuff lately, same intent, but\n&gt; some\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; different specifics from Tyler&#39;s.
