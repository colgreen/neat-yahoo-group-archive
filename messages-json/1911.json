This is a variation on \n&gt; the prey capture experiment in the paper &quot;Incremental Evolution Of \n&gt; Complex General Behavior (1997)&quot;\n\nCheers for the input.  As a matter of fact that paper is one of the\nmain publications that I am basing my incremental learning design on.\n I pretty much raided Ken&#39;s site of research papers over the last\nseveral weeks and was very excited when I came across it.  Some great\nreading.  Although not NEAT-specific, another relevant paper on\nincremental learning, although unfortunately quite brief, is here:\nhttp://www.debonet.com/Research/Learning/PacMan/\n\nOne of my aims was/is to improve upon the existing predator/prey\nexperiments using neuroevolution by including restrictions on movement\nand sight (walls).  It has proven to be quite a dilemma.  I&#39;m working\nday and night on this thing and really haven&#39;t gotten anywhere in\nterms of scenario D (see earlier response to Derek).\n\nMike\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly I totally agree with Derek&#39;s comments regarding not getting too \n&gt; hung up on implementation specifics. If you have the core algorithm \n&gt; running then that should be enough, implemeting all of the details\nmight \n&gt; improve the efficiency of some searches(it may take less generations to \n&gt; find a solution), but generally speaking it won&#39;t greatly effect the \n&gt; ability to find a solution overall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the cat & mouse domain, again I agree with Derek&#39;s comment&#39;s \n&gt; on the fitness gradient probably being too steep. This is a\nvariation on \n&gt; the prey capture experiment in the paper &quot;Incremental Evolution Of \n&gt; Complex General Behavior (1997)&quot;, which can be found at (beware of URL \n&gt; wrapping):\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=35\n&gt; \n&gt; In that domain there is no maze, just a bounded grid space, but\nthere is \n&gt; a limited sensor range. Therefore if the prey goes out of sensor range \n&gt; then the agent must use memory in order to move in the correct \n&gt; direction. The paper describes how this was too big a problem to solve \n&gt; directly. Instead, an agent is evolved on progressively more difficult \n&gt; tasks whereby the prey is given an increasing number of &#39;head start&#39; \n&gt; moves, thus allowing it to move out of sensor range before the agent is \n&gt; allowed to move. To further increase the difficulty the prey&#39;s speed is \n&gt; increased from stationary up to a maximum of 1 move per timestep, which \n&gt; is the same as the agent&#39;s speed. The prey moves stochastically, so a \n&gt; speed of 0.5 means that it has a 50% chance of moving in a given\ntimestep.\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper in question didn&#39;t use NEAT but I have implemented it in \n&gt; SharpNEAT and it works very well, although I have never evolved a \n&gt; perfect network. Typically the best that I have achieved after some \n&gt; tweaking of the evaluation function has been a 1/1000 fail rate, which \n&gt; is pretty good really.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
