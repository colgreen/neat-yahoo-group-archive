We currently apply a strong pressure \nfor selecting fit genomes, if you weaken that pressure then you will be \nexploring more of the parameter space around each species before moving \non. So it&#39;s a slower, steadier search. Ultimately though, if you weaken \nthe pressure too much then the search will just drift. SharpNEAT has \nparameters that can be adjusted to modify the selection pressure, and \nalthough not functionally equal to Fitness Uniform Selection I would \nexpect the two techniques to have an equivalent effect on searching.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
