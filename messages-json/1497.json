At first we just took\nthe affinity output value from the last time step.  This didn&#39;t work\nextremely well.  In Floreano&#39;s work, they took the mean of the output\nvalues for all time steps (they gave their networks 100 steps, we base\nthe number of steps given on the size and efficiency of the network). \nBut that approach means that you&#39;re averaging in affinity values from\nvery early on process, before the network has really had a chance to\ndo any analysis, so the fitness is always going to be well below\noptimal, even if the network correctly identifies the pattern.  So we\nuse a weighted average, skewing the affinity output values toward the\nlater steps and minimizing the impact of the affinity values in the\nearly steps.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
