Is there anything you know that\n&gt;might be causing this?\n\nErm, no, I can&#39;t think what that might do that.  It&#39;s only the \nsimplest thing using some crude GDI graphics to display the number of \njobs it has and a simple scrolling graph of best-fitness, \naverage-fitness and average-size.\n\nAre you sure you set up the working directory correctly?  I think \nthere would be no graphics if there were no jobs at all...  You can \neasily tell because it will have created the &quot;todo&quot;, &quot;current_SS&quot; and \n&quot;done&quot; directories in it.\n\nThere is a log file (master.log or master_SS.log, depending whether \nyou took it before or after I updated it) which may reveal something...\n\nWas it using CPU?  You can tell because if you have the task-manager \n&quot;performance&quot; tab open when the screensaver starts, you can look at \nthe history graph when the screensaver closes...\n\nOtherwise, what OS are you on?\n\n--\n\nDoes this mean you are considering giving it some serious CPU?  Or \nwere you just looking.  If you are going to give it some CPU then \nI&#39;ll send you some job files ;-)\n\nI was considering better graphics, e.g. a continuous shown TTT game \nbetween the current champion and some sort of \nsemi-random/semi-perfect player, but since I only got the one \nvolunteer and he isn&#39;t using the graphical version...\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
