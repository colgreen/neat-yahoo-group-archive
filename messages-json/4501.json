About your new question, I\nwould =\r\nsuggest avoiding randomness when possible, even if it means a\nbit more eval=\r\nuation.  However, note that you may not need actually 15\ndifferent trials t=\r\no get good generalization, even if it is not random.\n I do not know the exa=\r\nct number of course, but the rule of thumb with\ngeneralization is that if i=\r\nt is easier for it to learn the general\nprinciple than it is for it to memo=\r\nrize each individual case (even if\nthey are deterministic) then it will lik=\r\nely produce a general answer\neven without random trials.  On the other hand=\r\n, randomness introduces\nnoise, for which evolutionary algorithms pay a heav=\r\ny price in efficiency.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;matthias.linhard=\r\nt&quot; &lt;faulerlennert@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have finally found=\r\n the mistake I made. Between samples, the arm&#39;s \n&gt; speed in the simulator w=\r\nas not set back to 0, resulting in the arm \n&gt; starting each sample with the=\r\n kinetic energy of the last sample.\n&gt; Since the correction of this mistake,=\r\n everything works fine and NEAT \n&gt; produces very good results. \n&gt; I want to=\r\n thank everyone who tried to help me with this!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; PS: Now that I finally can evolve arm controllers, I have another \n&gt; ques=\r\ntion. To get a controller with high ability to adopt to new \n&gt; situations, =\r\nwould it be better to train all organisms with a high \n&gt; number of training=\r\n samples (e.g. 15 different start goal positions) \n&gt; or with a low but each=\r\n generation randomly changed number of samples \n&gt; (e.g. 3 start goal positi=\r\nons which are randomly generated each \n&gt; generation)?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
