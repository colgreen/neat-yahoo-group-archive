It is indeed inte=\r\nresting, but I was left wishing it had spoken more about how the network ac=\r\ntually works (i.e. as some kind of sensor processing system), rather than j=\r\nust how it becomes connected.  The neurons there presumably process the inp=\r\nuts from the sensors, but it is unclear what they are supposed to be doing =\r\nfunctionally.  Without that information, it&#39;s unclear to me whether the obs=\r\nerved strategy is generally useful for forming many different functional AN=\r\nNs or specific to a certain kind of preliminary processing step with this t=\r\nype of sensor.  \n\nOf course playing with your idea inside HyperNEAT would b=\r\ne interesting in any case and might provide some insight into the general u=\r\ntility of the process.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;coli=\r\nn.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.kurzweilai.net/fruit-fly-nervous-system=\r\n-provides-new-solution-to-fundamental-computer-network-problem\n&gt; \n&gt; This is=\r\n interesting from a developmental encoding point of view,\n&gt; specifically wi=\r\nth respect to the latest hyperneat work around\n&gt; placement of neurons.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n My hyperneat take on this idea would be to produce a bunch of\n&gt; &#39;speculati=\r\nve&#39; neurons in the substrate with varying density based on\n&gt; querying the C=\r\nPPN. Then place a random timer in each neuron, when a\n&gt; timer fires that ne=\r\nuron becomes a real neuron and tells surrounding\n&gt; neurons not to fire. I a=\r\nppreciate it puts time back into the\n&gt; developmental process, which could s=\r\nlow things down (one of the wins\n&gt; of CPPNs was the elimination of iterativ=\r\ne developmental processes).\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
