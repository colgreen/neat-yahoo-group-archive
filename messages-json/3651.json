The more important \nf=\r\nundamental questions are search space coverage relative to rate of \nchange =\r\nof the fitness surface and lateral genetic mobility prior to \npre-mature co=\r\nmplexification.\n\nThe underlying benefit of &quot;experience&quot; is often expressed =\r\nas knowing \nwhere not to look. Implicitly a fitness is assigned without nee=\r\nd for \nadditional evaluation. Just as the complexification process is a \npr=\r\nogression implicitly intended to incorporate a refining of the \nevaluation =\r\ntolerance of the fitness surface, the decision to evaluate \nfitness may als=\r\no follow a similar progression.\n\nYou don&#39;t need an electron microscope when=\r\n a simple &quot;lay-of-the-land&quot; \nwill do.\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; We may address it in future experime=\r\nnts in order to speed them up, \n&gt; but I probably would not make it the focu=\r\ns of a publication because \n&gt; its solution is likely fairly straightforward=\r\n, i.e. not that deep \nin \n&gt; a research sense. Also, the problem of revisiti=\r\nng the same points \nis \n&gt; known in stochastic algorithms already.\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nmost obvious way to address the problem is simply to compare \n&gt; new genomes=\r\n with what&#39;s come before.  Of course, such comparisons \n&gt; become increasing=\r\nly expensive as the generations increase, and at \n&gt; some point, it becomes =\r\ncheaper simply to evaluate everyone rather \n&gt; than try to figure out who is=\r\n a repeat.  Depending on available \n&gt; resources, you can program it to look=\r\n for duplicates as long as \nit&#39;s \n&gt; computationally advantageous.  It may t=\r\nurn out not very useful for \n&gt; most of the run.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a potential f=\r\nor more sophisticated appraches, e.g. maybe \n&gt; some kind of hashing scheme,=\r\n but they would need to promise \n&gt; sufficiently impressive results to justi=\r\nfy their effort.  I am not \n&gt; sure how much effort is justified by a 10% im=\r\nprovement.  I am \n&gt; guessing work has been done on this problem before outs=\r\nide of NEAT, \n&gt; but I don&#39;t know about it offhand.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rafael C.P.&quot; &lt;kurama.youko.br@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any p=\r\nlan for addressing this issue in a future paper and/or \n&gt; implementation?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Nov 26, 2007 12:23 PM, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy, thanks for pointing this issue ou=\r\nt.
