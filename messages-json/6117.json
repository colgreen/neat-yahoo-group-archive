Please don&#39;t take it as\noverly c=\r\nritical - I&#39;m much more interested in the issue of where an\nunquestioning d=\r\nrive towards quantification will lead us, so I&#39;m just\nexploring that issue =\r\nthrough your suggestions.  I respect your view and\nunderstand that many sha=\r\nre it.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rhiever489&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Jeff,\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Sure, but those statements are a bit &quot;cowboy science-y.&quot; Let me show\nyou\n&gt;=\r\n how those statements can (and likely will) be translated:\n&gt; &quot;A single (non=\r\n-reproduced?) study has suggested that targeted\nevolution\n&gt; does not work v=\r\nery well (with Picbreeder?). Our method can achieve an\n&gt; error of zero (dat=\r\na not shown). Thus, comparing our method with\ntargeted\n&gt; evolution is point=\r\nless.&quot;\n&gt; Performing such a quantitative comparison would kill two birds wit=\r\nh\none\n&gt; stone: (1) it reproduces the findings that Ken made* in a 3D domain=\r\n,\nand\n&gt; (2) it would address the readers&#39; concerns related to the goal of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; paper, particularly by directly showing that your method produces more=\r\n\n&gt; accurate CPPN-based representations of 3D objects than the &quot;leading&quot;\n&gt; (=\r\nonly) method. For a methods paper, that is an important statement to\n&gt; make=\r\n. Thus, there is value in making a quantitative comparison here,\nand\n&gt; it&#39;s=\r\n not an arbitrary checkbox.\n&gt; * I&#39;m not suggesting that Ken did/does bad or=\r\n unreliable work, but\n&gt; reproducing results that you&#39;re building off of is =\r\nan important part\nof\n&gt; science -- especially when you&#39;re applying those res=\r\nults in a new\ndomain\n&gt; (2D objects vs. 3D objects).\n&gt;\n\nSo you really would =\r\nprefer that Jeff would fill up several pages of this\nshort paper instead wi=\r\nth a comparison between his new method and a\nreproduction of my old target-=\r\nbased evolution experiment with Brian\nWoolley, even though that&#39;s not the s=\r\nubject of this paper?  Jeff&#39;s\nmethod for reproducing these objects is not a=\r\nn optimization method so of\ncourse it is essentially perfect, so why bother=\r\n comparing it to an\noptimization method?  The point of this paper is what h=\r\nappens once you\nevolve beyond such reproductions, not the perfection of the=\r\n\nreproductions themselves.\n\nIf you were a reviewer and succeeded in forcing=\r\n Jeff to switch this\npaper to include such a comparison, do you really thin=\r\nk the resulting\nloss of text on the real topic of the paper (i.e. what happ=\r\nens after you\nevolve further) would not actually reduce its value?\n\nThis su=\r\nggested change might be an example of how demanding\nquantification where it=\r\n is unneeded can actually damage a paper and\ndistort its original intent, b=\r\nut I&#39;m curious how you see it.\n\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a really bad assumption (that many =\r\nof us make) that someone will\n&gt; want to follow up on our work. Yes, it&#39;s go=\r\nod to point out future\n&gt; research directions from the work, but the mindset=\r\n that everyone will\n&gt; want to follow up on our work can be damaging to the =\r\nresearch field.\n&gt; Everyone wants to be the thought leader and establish a &quot;=\r\nnew&quot; research\n&gt; path, and that&#39;s why we see so many people establishing new=\r\n research\n&gt; platforms and whatnot every year and talking about all the cool=\r\n\nresearch\n&gt; that it enables. Then by the next year, that platform has falle=\r\nn into\n&gt; obscurity because no one wanted to actually do that future work, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; thus no one really learned anything from the paper introducing that\n&gt; =\r\nresearch platform.\n&gt; That&#39;s a big reason why I think qualitative/methods/pr=\r\noof of concept\n&gt; papers (whatever you want to call them -- they&#39;re the same=\r\n) are not\nvery\n&gt; useful to publish as full papers, and are better suited as=\r\n a poster or\n&gt; late-breaking abstract.\n&gt;\n\nThese sentiments surprised me. Wh=\r\ny is it a bad assumption that someone\nwould want to follow up on your work?=\r\n  What is the point of publishing\nsomething if you assume that no one would=\r\n want to follow up on it?  What\ncould be more important than what might com=\r\ne next thanks to your\ncontribution?  If anything I&#39;d like to see longer fut=\r\nure work sections\nso I have some idea why people think their ideas are impo=\r\nrtant.\n\nI&#39;m also not clear on why a proof of concept should be relegated to=\r\n a\nposter.  After all, there&#39;s only one proof-of-concept in the known\nunive=\r\nrse of evolution producing human intelligence and it inspired our\nentire re=\r\nsearch field.\n\nIf I evolved a single HyperNEAT neural network with human-le=\r\nvel\nintelligence but could not do it again, would you prefer that the resul=\r\nt\nremains reported only in a poster?  Would you question the capabilities\no=\r\nf HyperNEAT because it &quot;only&quot; evolved human-level intelligence once?\n\nPerso=\r\nnally I think our field will be forced to shift inevitably to more\nproofs o=\r\nf concept because evolution at its most impressive doesn&#39;t like\ndoing cool =\r\nstuff more than once.  No interesting image on Picbreeder\nwill ever be disc=\r\novered again.  No creature on Earth will ever evolve\nagain in the history o=\r\nf the planet.  Finding something once is good\nenough for me to want to know=\r\n about it, and often will be as good as it\ngets.  The fact that human intel=\r\nligence evolved once is amazing enough\nand merits thousands of research art=\r\nicles, as it has indeed provoked.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
