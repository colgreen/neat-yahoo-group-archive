Then I take one individual,\n&gt; &gt;mutate it to pieces and use it to see the side population.  I then\n&gt; &gt;run the side population until it stalls (the main population appears\n&gt; &gt;frozen at its last value during this phase).  I then merge the two\n&gt; &gt;populations (by one of several experimental techniques) overwrite the\n&gt; &gt;main population with the result, scrap the side-population and return\n&gt; &gt;to the initial phase (exolving main).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Err yeh I&#39;m still with you. I notice the side species fitness does\n&gt;indeed exceed the main species on some occasions and on other occasions\n&gt;the merging of the two causes an increase.\n\nSometimes it does, but my current merge technique is &quot;destructive&quot; \n(in the terminology I used when I discussed this before) so that \nmeans that I can also sometimes lose ground on a merge.\n\nThere are ways to make any merge &quot;preserving&quot;, e.g. by including both \nthe parent population champions in a the child population.  But I&#39;m \nnot sure that wouldn&#39;t defeat the purpose of the merge, because my \nspecies are small here, and if I put a very fit champion on top of a \nlot of only potentially fit hybrids, it might well just displace them \nall before they could demonstrate their potential.  OTOH, if I keep \nthe species champions _and_ the merged species then I have \neffectively increased the number of species in the merge, instead of \ndecreasing it...\n\n&gt;  In other words it seems to be\n&gt;working. So are you going to try with multiple side species next?\n\nMy thoughts are straying in that direction.  OTOH, less species = \nfaster exploration of the ones we have so...\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I am also inclined to say that the system as I have it has a net\n&gt; &gt;drive towards smaller individuals (look at the line of the purple and\n&gt; &gt;blue curves from 2.5 MCycles upwards) and that the individuals (i)\n&gt; &gt;grow in size when it is discovering additions that make then fitter,\n&gt; &gt;but, (ii) then slowly squeezes their existing fitness into a smaller\n&gt; &gt;genomes when they are not finding any obvious additions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s a solid mathematical reason why the net drive is downwards,\n&gt; &gt;which I am aching to explain to you all.  Does anybody want to know?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Oh go on then. I&#39;ll be watching CSI but I am listening, honest ;)\n\nIt&#39;ll take 1/2 hour to type in, so I&#39;ll try to do it tomorrow...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
