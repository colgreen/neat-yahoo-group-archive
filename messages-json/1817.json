That is a problem in all Recurrent Networks,\nval=\r\nues are difficult to store more than 10-50 iterations in the\nnetwork (see L=\r\nSTM Link for references). \n\n\tI put LSTM inside a NEAT. The evolution make N=\r\nEAT to use LSTM cells\nin a productive way storing key values, recovering th=\r\nat values when\nthey are useful a forgetting them  if it is useful (The 3 LS=\r\nTM cell\nfunctions).\n\n\tMy analysis of some of the solve problems suggest tha=\r\nt LSTM helps to\nNEAT in some problems to reduce greatly the searching space=\r\n helping to\nmemorize (some times to accumulate) some important key events t=\r\nhat are\nused after to get out the right outputs.\n\n\tAn intuitional example a=\r\nbout reduction of searching space is serial\nXOR, if you solve serial XOR wi=\r\nth NEAT you can see that the solution\nnet use recurrent connection to store=\r\n the first value and later it\ncompares with second value in the serial sequ=\r\nence. In my computer (P4\n2,4Ghz) it last around  2 minutes to find a soluti=\r\non with NEAT alone.\nHowever, when I use one LSTM cell in the NEAT-LSTM it l=\r\nast ONLY 5\nSECONDS!!!!!.\n\n2)  Improving Work Methods in Real Automation Pro=\r\nblems:\n\n      Motivation: Evolution systems have been achieving great resul=\r\nts\nin last years. In my daily work in automation projects business, I\nhave =\r\nto face another problem: cost. That is the reason that most of\nthe times th=\r\ne industry try to avoid complex systems. Complex systems\nare difficult to d=\r\nevelop, difficult to modify and difficult to\nmaintenance. Most of the times=\r\n, it is the last choosen resource. \n\n\tOther problems to use evolution syste=\r\nms are the uncertainty.  Always,\nthere is some likelihood that a problem wi=\r\nll converge to a solution in\na reasonable time. Some time we can evaluate i=\r\nt, sizing the searching\nspace. Other times it very difficult to size such s=\r\npace. Uncertainty\nis a variable related to, what is known in business as, r=\r\nisk. \n\n\tSome recent experiment as in \nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/pap=\r\ners/whiteson.gecco03.pdf suggest\nthat a way to reduce searching space is to=\r\n &quot;draw&quot; the guide\nwhere the\nsolution will be searched. Some of my research =\r\nhas gone in that\ndirection. In most of the systems we have deal with, we ha=\r\nve some\nprevious knowledge about them. My work is focusing in how organize\n=\r\nsuch previous knowledge in: decision trees, tasks, abstraction levels\nand i=\r\nnterdependences among them to reduce as much as possible the\nsearching spac=\r\ne. So the final goal is to find feasibility work methods\nand tools to use e=\r\nvolution systems in real automation Industry\nproblems.\n\nRegards.\n\nGerm=E1n.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
