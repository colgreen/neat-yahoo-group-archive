The \n&gt; add_connection mutation rate is the probability that an *individual \n&gt; genome* might have a single connection added.  In other words, in a \n&gt; population of 100 individuals and a 0.02 rate, you would expect to \n&gt; get on average 2 new connections over the entire population in a \n&gt; single generation.\n\nWow.  Yeah, that&#39;s a pretty friggin&#39; big difference!  Weird that our \nresults were as similar as they were give such a significant \ndiscrpency in implementation.  Of course, doing it our way with lower \ntopological mutation rates might wind up doing about the same thing \nanyway.\n\nSo, let me make sure I have this clear: &quot;mutation rate&quot; means \nsomething different in the context of topological mutations from \nweigth mutations, right?  Weight mutation rate is the percentage of \nconnection *genes* that will have their weights tweaked.  Add \nconnection and add neuron rates are the percentage of *chromosomes* \nthat will be modified.\n\nI guess we were biologically inspired in our interpretation.  \nTypically, a mutation rate is a function of the genetic material, \nright?  A given gene has a certain chance of being modified each \ngeneration.  And there&#39;s nothing stopping 2 mutations from occurring \nin the same individual.\n\n&gt; In addition, it is also true that only one add connection mutation \n&gt; can happen to a single individual in a generation.\n\nCan both happen; i.e., can a chromosome have 1 connection and 1 node \nadded in the same generation?  If so, can the node be added on the \nnew connection, or a connection be added to the new node?\n\n&gt; It seems to me that your interpetation was that the mutation rate\n&gt; is on a &quot;per empty slot&quot; basis.  That&#39;s radically different than my \n&gt; NEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at\n&gt; all...is that how ANJI has been working?\n\nIndeed it is.  Time for me to go change the API doc ...\n\n- Philip\n\n\n\n\n"}}
