I&#39;m=\r\n hoping in the next\n&gt; few weeks I can get the paper up here, and get all of=\r\n the source code\n&gt; posted (it&#39;s all C++ written for Linux boxes).\n&gt; \n&gt; I ha=\r\nve 10 conditions in my experiment, which is basically a repeat of\n&gt; Ken&#39;s c=\r\nompetitive coevolution complexification experiment from a few\n&gt; years back.=\r\n The conditions are standard objective neat, random search,\n&gt; and then 4 di=\r\nfferent methods of novelty search using NCD, repeated\n&gt; with and without mi=\r\nnimal criteria. A few of these novelty search\n&gt; approaches stand out in par=\r\nticular in their performance in finding\n&gt; dominant strategies and objective=\r\n performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Much thanks to Ken and the rest of you for answering my =\r\nquestions the\n&gt; past year or so, this users group has provided much useful =\r\nguidance.\n&gt; Hopefully the paper doesn&#39;t turn out as badly as I think it wil=\r\nl, and\n&gt; is of interest to some here. Too much time coding, not enough time=\r\n\n&gt; writing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Drew\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
