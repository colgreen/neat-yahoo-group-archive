What they do show is how \n&gt; networks of varying complexity are drawn, and hence the limits of \nthese \n&gt; types of diagram.\n&gt; \n&gt; The layout manager basically places the hidden neurons into a \n&gt; rectangular grid that best matches the available space, there is \nno \n&gt; attempt at analysing interconnections to determine which neurons \nshould \n&gt; be in which layers, etc.  Inputs and outputs are all drawn in \ntheir own \n&gt; layer, so for example if there were a lot of  inputs then you \nwould see \n&gt; an overcrowded input layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; The connections are coloured to indicate their strength using a \nblue-red \n&gt; scale. Optionally I can also vary the width of the connections but \nthis \n&gt; seems to clutter up the diagrams that much more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going forward then there will be the able to manipulate the \nnetworks, \n&gt; drag neurons around and zoom in/out and save/load these as \nannotated xml \n&gt; (hint-xpos/ypos in the saved xml). As I mentioned before I hope to \n&gt; incorporate this stuff into the main exe to show the current best \n&gt; network (and perhaps best of each species?) and also in the \nsimulators \n&gt; to show the loaded network in realtime using varying \nneuron/connection \n&gt; colors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
