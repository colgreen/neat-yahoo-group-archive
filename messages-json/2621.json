Plenty\n&gt; of experimental domains\n&gt; (many of which we&#39;ve discussed here) have some form\n&gt; of symmetry inherent in\n&gt; the task, if not bilateral symmetry.  In what cases\n&gt; would there not be *any*\n&gt; symmetry in the &quot;world&quot;?  I would think it would be\n&gt; much more common,\n&gt; especially if the domain involves something like an\n&gt; embodied agent in a\n&gt; simulated world, for there to be a high degree of\n&gt; symmetry in the\n&gt; environment.\n\nOK, it depends what one means by &quot;symmetry&quot;.\n\nWhat I said this was most common I was thinking of\nbilaterally symmetric agents which were embedded in\nsome sort of world where they can rotate/translate\netc.\n\nI now realise I&#39;m discussing two different types of\nsymmetry here:\n\n1) the agent is &quot;functionally symmetric&quot; - turn left\nis the mirror image of turn right and seeing something\non the left is the mirror image of seeing same thing\non the left (or at least the mirror image of that\nthing :)\n\n2) the world &quot;has rich symmetries&quot; in that _its_rules_\nare translationally and rotationally invariant (every\npoint in the world is &quot;just like&quot; every other, every\ndirection likewise).\n\n3) however the world is not bilaterally symmetrical,\ne.g. there is no reason why the right half of the data\nshould be the mirror-image of the left half, and even\nif it was, the symmetry won&#39;t survive the first few\ntimes the agent moves (the world being viewed from the\nagent, so the agent has to be the center of symmetry)\n\n&gt; &gt;Presumably it is totally necessary, otherwise you\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt;two separate neural nets...?\n&gt; \n&gt; RE: contralateral connectivity...well, that&#39;s why I\n&gt; want to know to what\n&gt; extent it is necessary.  There are human patients\n&gt; who have their corpus\n&gt; callosum (the main bundle of nerves connecting the\n&gt; hemispheres) severed, who\n&gt; function almost completely normally.\n\nThey route intra-hemisphere communications via\nroundabout routes.  e.g. even through the world, like\nif you show one eye a picture and ask the patient what\nit is, making them reply in some manner than needs the\nother hemisphere, then they can&#39;t answer, but if you\nleft the first hemisphere answer first, then ask the\nother one, then it will know, because it listened to\nthe first one&#39;s answer.\n\nPersonally I think this falls into the well-known\ncatagory of scientific phenomena known as &quot;oo -\ncreapy&quot;...\n\n&gt;  I have read of\n&gt; experiments with\n&gt; locomotion (maybe I talked about them in an earlier\n&gt; mail), where neural\n&gt; networks controlling paired legs are completely\n&gt; decoupled (that is, they\n&gt; aren&#39;t connected at all).  So contralateral\n&gt; connectivity may be crucial for\n&gt; some tasks, or possibly irrelevant for many others.\n\nThat&#39;s exactly the same phnomena as I was\nmentioning...\n\n&gt; I see that some of your questions were answered\n&gt; later, but some were\n&gt; not...I&#39;ll get to the ones that weren&#39;t later.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Isn&#39;t this last sentance a bit odd, e.g. if you\n&gt; insert\n&gt; &gt;a node into a translateral connection, then if the\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt;new connections are both translateral, the overall\n&gt; &gt;effect is lateral (connecting right-&gt;left-&gt;right)?\n&gt; Very observant. :)  Yes, the result of a neuron\n&gt; mutation on symmetrical,\n&gt; contralateral connections between two symmetrical\n&gt; neurons are two new\n&gt; incoming contralateral connections to the two new\n&gt; neurons, and two new\n&gt; outgoing contralateral connections from the two new\n&gt; neurons.  The\n&gt; alternative to this would have been to have either\n&gt; the incoming or outgoing\n&gt; be contralateral and the other pair of connections\n&gt; be ipsilateral.\n&gt; To be honest, this was a special case, and we\n&gt; weren&#39;t entirely sure the best\n&gt; way to handle it, so we implemented it so that there\n&gt; are four new\n&gt; connections that are all contralateral.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Ah! I see the answer to my previous question, so if\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt;read you correctly, you are specifying the nodes in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&quot;pre-symmetry&quot; format, and then adding symmetry\n&gt; during\n&gt; &gt;network creation according to the symmetry flag on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;node-gene. But for the connections you are\n&gt; specifying\n&gt; &gt;their source and target neurons from the\n&gt; post-symmetry\n&gt; &gt;pool?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;That seems like a very odd choice to me. I had\n&gt; &gt;assumed up to this point that the node and\n&gt; connection\n&gt; &gt;genes were both &quot;pre-symmetry&quot; and that you were\n&gt; &gt;creating the symmetry of the connections are\n&gt; network\n&gt; &gt;creation time as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;pre-symmetry&quot;. \n&gt; Basically every gene has a\n&gt; symmetry attribute, so whether or not a given neuron\n&gt; or connection is\n&gt; symmetrical or asymmetrical is completely determined\n&gt; by the genetic\n&gt; encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;With regard to your current scheme, suppose you\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt;two nodes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1 - hidden, symmetric\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2- hidden, symmetric\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;at network creation time these become:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1left 1right\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2left 2right\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, good so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;And connection genes can separately specify that\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt;are 1left to 2left, or 1right to 2right...\n&gt; \n&gt; Yesï¿½\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;But not 1 left to 2right? err, actually I don&#39;t get\n&gt; &gt;what you mean, there seems to be some ambiguity in\n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt;the connection gene targets and flags interact...\n&gt; \n&gt; No, a connection gene can specify for 1left to\n2right.\n&gt; That would be a connection gene with symmetry=left\nand \n&gt; lateralization=contra.  Symmetry type for a\nconnection \n&gt; determines its source neuron, and lateralization \n&gt; determines whether it crosses the midline.\n\nAh!  I get it, the values for the &quot;symmetry flag&quot; in\nthe connection gene are:\n\n&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; or &quot;both&quot;\n\nnot:\n\n&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as I imagined....\n\nIt seems a little odd to me that you support asymetric\nconnections between symmetric nodes.  e.g. are you\nopen to the case where no symmetric network can\ndevelop because the presence of any asymmetric link\nrenders it unsuited to a symmetric task?\n\nI guess, however, when you do the experiments you will\nturn the probability of &quot;assymetry within symmetry&quot; up\nand down, as a way of measuring how much the symmetric\noptions are contributing?  I think you even said\nsomthing about that...\n\n\tIan\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\n"}}
