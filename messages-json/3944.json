It is now clear that HyperNEAT is indeed a very powerful \ntype =\r\nof NE algorithm. I believe that CPPNs are the best abstraction \nof developm=\r\nent found ever. And evolving and complexifying CPPNs with \nthe NEAT method =\r\nis one important part of the whole thing. Without it, \nCPPN evolution would=\r\n be a very limited technique. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kennet=\r\nh Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share=\r\n with you new results with\n&gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the T=\r\nwenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case St=\r\nudy on the\n&gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;  T=\r\nhe \npaper\n&gt; is available here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\nopti=\r\non=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#gauci.aaai08\n&gt; \n&gt; Or for a=\r\n direct link:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/gauci_aaai08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns paper demonstrates HyperNEAT in a more interesting domain\n&gt; (checkers) th=\r\nan our introductory papers from last year and \nintroduces\n&gt; an effective me=\r\nthod to evolve substrates with a hidden layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason is also planning =\r\nto release the source code for this domain,\n&gt; although we do not have an ex=\r\nact release date at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those familiar with AI conferences will=\r\n also notice that in fact \nthis\n&gt; paper appears in AAAI, which is more asso=\r\nciated with mainstream AI. \n&gt; That they accepted a paper in this area is a =\r\nhopeful sign that\n&gt; evolutionary computation and even indirect encoding can=\r\n in fact\n&gt; succeed in the larger AI community.
