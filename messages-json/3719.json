One question is how much more you can \nallow the use=\r\nr to cusomtize than just the inputs and outputs, \nconsidering that the main=\r\n part of an experiment is usually a type of \nsimulation used during evaluat=\r\nion.  Given the breadth of possible \nexperiments, it&#39;s difficult to think o=\r\nf how to supply any general \nsort of GUI for modifying experimental simulat=\r\nions.  In any case, any \nkind of GUI that adds an elemtn of easy customizat=\r\nion would be cool.\n\nOne thing you might want to take a look at for referenc=\r\ne along these \nlines is Charles Tarun&#39;s NERO Sensor Configuration Utility, =\r\na \nstandalone program made to let users customize NERO&#39;s robot sensors:\n\nht=\r\ntp://z.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/nero/downloads/NeroSensorConfig.exe\n\nIts docu=\r\nmentation is here:\n\nhttp://z.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/nero/downloads/NEROSens=\r\norConfig.html\n\n(it also requires NET 1.1 Framework)\n\nBy the way, another id=\r\nea along similar lines that I think would be \nvery cool is a HyperNEAT subs=\r\ntrate configurator, that lets you \ngraphically construct substrate geometry=\r\n through a nice GUI.  At this \npoint, no such utility exists anywhere that =\r\nI know of.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken Lloyd&quot; &lt;kalloyd@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin,\n&gt;  \n&gt; First, let me say that I am really impressed with Sha=\r\nrpNEAT, and I&#39;m\n&gt; learning a lot through discovering ways of using it. \n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; What I was thinking of developing was a GUI based app that would \nallow =\r\n(say)\n&gt; manufacturers to input throughput functions for various fabrication=\r\n \ncells in\n&gt; a graphical network, then find (one or more) system-wide \nopti=\r\nmizations (as\n&gt; opposed to localized optimizations) for various product rou=\r\ntings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Currently, the way one goes about creating experiments for NEA=\r\nT is \nto &quot;hard\n&gt; code&quot; them.  Yes, these experiments  are made available to=\r\n NEAT by \nusing the\n&gt; IExperiment, and ISimulation interfaces (dependent up=\r\non the\n&gt; IActivationFunction) as well as other experimentally determined \np=\r\narameters.\n&gt; I was thinking of creating an easy way for non-programmer type=\r\ns to \ncreate\n&gt; Design of Experiments that can be saved in the XML format, t=\r\nhen run \non (a\n&gt; distributed cluster of) NEAT dll&#39;s for comparison of \nvari=\r\nous &quot;lessons\n&gt; learned&quot; patterns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Make sense?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The University of=\r\n Edinburgh has an interesting system for \ndeveloping VLSI\n&gt; IC&#39;s that uses =\r\n3 applications (CAESAR, Calphurnia, and RS/1) that \ntakes CAD\n&gt; drawings as=\r\n inputs, creating a DoE tree and simulating them.  The \nsimulation\n&gt; is ana=\r\nlytical.  I was thinking about ways of using NEAT in a \nsimilar system\n&gt; fo=\r\nr pattern discovery.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ken\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf \nOf Colin\n&gt; Green\n&gt; Se=\r\nnt: Saturday, December 22, 2007 11:33 AM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subje=\r\nct: Re: [neat] Design of Experiments Factory\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 22/12/2007, Ken =\r\nLloyd &lt;kalloyd@wattsys. &lt;mailto:kalloyd%\n40wattsys.com&gt;\n&gt; com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nefore I possibly re-invent the wheel, I thought I&#39;d ask if \nanyone has\n&gt; al=\r\nready developed a Design of Experiments interface to NEAT that \nnormalizes\n=\r\n&gt; the experiment functions into inputs, biases and outputs?
