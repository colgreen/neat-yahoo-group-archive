Philip found the problem, enabled\nelitism, and it worked like a dream...solved for XOR\nin 20-30 generations, with very small topologies.\n\nSo we sort of inadvertantly did an ablation test for\nelitism. :)\n\nSo I&#39;m wondering how crucial an aspect of NEAT in\nparticular and GAs in general, elitism is.  It\ncertainly seems incredibly important, at least with\nXOR...so much so that removing it effectively broke\nthe algorithm.\n\nI was also wondering if anyone had implemented elitism\ndifferently than the original NEAT study (the fittest\nmembers of species due to produce 5 or more offspring\nin the next generation are copied over unchanged), and\nwhat their experiences/thoughts might have been.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
