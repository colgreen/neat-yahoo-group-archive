Also you will notice in reports \n&gt;on DPBNV starting with Gruau, they usually report a generalization \n&gt;performance measure, which is taken by starting the champion network \n&gt;at literally hundreds of different start states and seeing if it can \n&gt;balance for over 1000 time steps from each state.  Usually \n&gt;controllers that do well on Gruau&#39;s fitness function can handle at \n&gt;around 1/3 to 1/2 of all the spectrum of 625 different possible \n&gt;starting states, which is not bad considering it wasn&#39;t trained on \n&gt;them directly.  In fact, it shows the controllers are often not so \n&gt;brittle after all.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIndeed, and you might expect this given that a large number of these \nstates must be handled in order to be able to balance the poles from any \none given initial state.\n\n&gt;Now, a separate line of research concerns how to make the task \n&gt;increasingly difficult.  And requiring more generalization is one \n&gt;way to go.  But it&#39;s not really that attractive since it mean a lot \n&gt;more computation dedicated to testing from all those start states.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAlso I suspect a network that can handle a wider range of starting \nstates wouldn&#39;t have to be much more complex anyway.\n\n&gt;Instead, most researchers who have looked for harder DBP tasks have \n&gt;changed the relative lengths of the poles.  Changing them to become \n&gt;closer in length makes the task harder and harder.  In fact, it \n&gt;becomes extremely hard very quickly to the point where only \n&gt;incremental evolution can handle it.  (If you want to go down this \n&gt;route, Faustino Gomez from our group published on a principled way \n&gt;of changing pole lengths...I&#39;d look for that paper, rather than just \n&gt;try arbitrary pole lengths since most ratios will be next to \n&gt;impossible)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIn fact some of pole length pairs will be impossible to balance. \nCertainly poles of equal length are. But how much more complexity do \nthese more difficult DP problems require? ...I&#39;ll go check out the paper eh.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
