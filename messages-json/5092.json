For example, XOR isn&#39;t a typical benchmark for HyperNEAT (i.e.\n&gt; its network doesn&#39;t have regularities and is quite small). Also, it would need to come with a HyperNEAT substrate for XOR. Is that\n&gt; really the intent or is it more than there aren&#39;t really HyperNEAT-centric experiments at least at the moment?\n&gt;\n\nYes so the test code that&#39;s in there currently builds a substrate for\nXOR on the basis that (A) I have known-to-be-working XOR code and (B)\nI already knew a minimal substrate for XOR - in was a quick way to\ntest the code in totallity.\n\nThe harness builds a suitable substrate and &#39;wires&#39; it and various\nother components together, such as a genome decoder, evaluator,\nspeciation strategy and evolution algorithm. The problem domains are\ncompletely independent from NEAT or HyperNEAT so all you have to do to\nget an existing domain designed for NEAT to work is build a substrate\nand switch to using the HyperNEAT genome decoder instead of the Neat\ndecoder.\n\nBTW do you or anyone here have any ideas about what is a good baseline\nproblem domain for HyperNEAT? sort of an equivalent to XOR in NEAT.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
