Since\nyou=\r\n&#39;re not using the substrates you don&#39;t have to worry about this as\nthey are=\r\n already decoded (single-file) in the population evaluator. \nSo each thread=\r\n will get one network to evaluate.  Everything else in\nmy and Colin&#39;s code =\r\nshould be safe to call whenever.

Th=\r\nere is one short\n&gt; question. In the file NetworkEvaluator.cs (for example\n&gt;=\r\n SkirmishNetworkEvaluator.cs), in the method\n&gt; threadSafeEvaluateNetwork(IN=\r\network network, Semaphore sem):\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I just use the network, for exampl=\r\ne with network.SetInputSignals\n&gt; and so on, or will I have to use the Semap=\r\nhore?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I Call SetInputSignals in all Threads simultaneously or will=\r\n this\n&gt; raise problems?\n&gt; \n&gt; I looked at the source code and it seems you h=\r\nave added this semaphore\n&gt; for decoding genomes things. But when i don&#39;t ne=\r\ned them, can I ignore\n&gt; this semaphore?\n&gt; \n&gt; Will every thread get a new, o=\r\nwn network to evaluate?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Christian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Christian,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you would like to use HyperSharpNEAT to just evol=\r\nve neural networks\n&gt; &gt; with different activation functions you should imple=\r\nment everything I\n&gt; &gt; said, but do not run your genomes through the substra=\r\nte class.  In\n&gt; &gt; fact you should not use the substrate class at all.  So i=\r\nn the network\n&gt; &gt; evaluator where I use the substrate, that&#39;s where you sho=\r\nuld be\n&gt; &gt; evaluating the performance of your networks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good luck =\r\nwith your work.
