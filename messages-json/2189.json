I&#39;ve been thinking along similar lines, but never done\nany act=\r\nual experiments on it. The problem with the original concept is\nthat it wou=\r\nld only single out usually deleterious mutations, by giving\nthem lower coun=\r\nts. All other mutations, including largely neutral (and\neven long-term neut=\r\nral) mutations would get high counts, so it would\nbe hard to single out the=\r\n best mutations.\n\nTherefore I would definitely go for your variation 1a. Lo=\r\nok at the\ncomplete mutation history of the best individual of the last\ngene=\r\nration. I think it&#39;s a good idea to look at the history, not only\nthe sums =\r\nover the history, as which mutations are most beneficient\nmight vary depend=\r\ning on which generation you are in - e.g., the best\nindividual might very w=\r\nell have lots of insert mutations in the\nbeginning and delete (or global ga=\r\nussian mutation, if you have real\nvalue) towards the end. For the same reas=\r\nons, it wouldn&#39;t be a very\ngood idea to limit the history to N generations,=\r\n as in variation 1b.\n\nThe original concept has, as I see it, quite a lot in=\r\n common with\nadaptive self-mutation (or whatever it is called) in Evolution=\r\n\nStrategies, but variation 1a is more original.\n\nA further idea I have had =\r\non these lines, but never tried out, is\n&quot;Hebbian mutation&quot; - to make insert=\r\n mutations more likely between\nneurons (supposing that what we&#39;re evolving =\r\nis neurally networks) that\nhave correlated activity. The inverse is of cour=\r\nse also possible:\nsevering connections between unrelated (as determined by =\r\nstatistical\ncorrelation) neurons to modularize the network. If we are evolv=\r\ning\nsomething else than neural networks, we could maybe measure\n&quot;relatednes=\r\ns&quot; in some other way.\n\nJulian\nOn 8/9/05, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Hi,\n&gt;        suppose in a system you have more than one type of=\r\n mutation.  They\n&gt; might \n&gt;  differ in being inserts vs deletes, or you mig=\r\nht even consider mutations at\n&gt;  different locations to be different types.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;        OK, now suppose that the population is in mid-evolve and I wa=\r\nnt to\n&gt; know \n&gt;  the most constructive ratio of the different types of muta=\r\ntion to \n&gt;  attempt.  How do the following grab you.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  1) whenever a m=\r\nutation happens, increment a counter corresponding to its \n&gt;  type and also=\r\n note on the new individual what type of mutation produced it\n&gt;  2) wheneve=\r\nr an individual dies, decrement the counter corresponding to the \n&gt;  mutati=\r\non that produced it\n&gt;  3) allocate attempted mutations proportionally to th=\r\ne current state of the \n&gt;  counters\n&gt;  \n&gt;        As ever, I also generated =\r\na few variations on the idea:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  1a) not only store the latest mutation=\r\ns on an individual, but also store \n&gt;  (and count) the total numbers of all=\r\n mutations found in its ancestry (if \n&gt;  you have sex then you either need =\r\nto count correctly whether a mutation was\n&gt;  preserved in the crossover, or=\r\n else average the numbers from each \n&gt;  parent).  Now you are counting not =\r\njust the last generation of successful \n&gt;  mutations but the whole history =\r\nof successful mutations\n&gt;  \n&gt;  1b) as 1a but just for the last N generation=\r\ns, not the whole of time\n&gt;  \n&gt;  1c) rather than incrementing the counters i=\r\nmmediately, do it only after the\n&gt;  new individual passes some test (fitnes=\r\ns, longevity, #offspring)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  2a) rather than decrementing the counters =\r\nwhen an individual dies, do it \n&gt;  only when one dies too young (assuming y=\r\nou do not replace the whole \n&gt;  population in every tick)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  3a) alloca=\r\nte attempted mutations according to the counters but using some \n&gt;  functio=\r\nn &quot;flatter&quot; than the raw counters.  So that rarely successful \n&gt;  mutations=\r\n become less common, but not too uncommon\n&gt;  \n&gt;        thoughts anyone?\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt;        Ian\n&gt;  \n&gt;  In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;        \n&gt;        \n&gt;              \n&gt; __________________________=\r\n_________________________________\n&gt;  Yahoo!
