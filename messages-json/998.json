I thought I heard you arguing for the accumulation\nof untested structure, in the hope that at some *later* point it would\nprove beneficial.\n\nSo if accumulations of structure that aren&#39;t contributing to the\nfitness of the organism aren&#39;t bloat, then what is?\n\nColin suggests keeping such structure around for a certain amount of\ntime, and then after a certain period of stagnation, killing those\norganisms off.  Is it only bloat after it has been given a large\nnumber of generations to try to prove itself?\n\n&gt; Again, it&#39;s kind of loaded to call it &quot;superfluous.&quot;  You are assuming\n&gt; what you&#39;re trying to prove in a way.  That extra structure may be\n&gt; necessary, as Colin&#39;s been saying.  But I also wonder if it slows\n&gt; anything down anyway.  In general the performance of anything\n&gt; surviving in NEAT that has more structure is in the ballpark of the\n&gt; performance of things with less structure.  In other words, you don&#39;t\n&gt; end up keeping around extra structure that severely cripples\n&gt; performance.  So where are you seeing the slowdown?  \n\nIt increases the network activation, compatibility calculation, and\nthe dimensionality of the search.\n\nIf these aren&#39;t really issues, then why doesn&#39;t NEAT start with a\nrange of complexity in the initial population?  The more complex\nindividuals in the initial population will perform as well as the less\ncomplex individuals.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
