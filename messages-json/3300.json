It should be \neasy, \n&gt; like writing a paint program. :)\n&gt; Something came =\r\nto my mind right now. Such a GUI should support \ngeneral \n&gt; node placement =\r\nconcepts too (like arranging nodes in a circle or a \n&gt; matrix), so the same=\r\n substrate file can be reused in multiple node \n&gt; densities. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I know this is going to happen sooner or later, but Thomas&#39;s \nrecent \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n question brought it to mind.  It will be really interesting \nsomeday \n&gt; to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; be able to set up substrates with a GUI, so you can intuitively \n&gt; sp=\r\necify \n&gt; &gt; how inputs/outputs/hidden nodes are configured and run a range \n=\r\nof \n&gt; &gt; experiments quickly.  There are many ways that such an app could \nb=\r\ne \n&gt; set \n&gt; &gt; up but however it works it would certainly be fun to play wit=\r\nh \nin \n&gt; &gt; conjunction with a HyperNEAT system.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
