While\nimpressive results have been achieved with this=\r\n methodology, and it is\narguably the best suited to human engineers, it neg=\r\nlects numerous\nsituations in which, for instance, a minor change in mechani=\r\ncs can\nsubstantially simplify software and/or electronics. Conversely,\nevol=\r\nution allows living organisms to take full advantage of interactions\nacross=\r\n levels, because it provides a automatic and integrated design\nprocess that=\r\n relies only on the effectiveness of its results as a whole.\n\nLoosely inspi=\r\nred by nature, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) now provide\nmature optimizatio=\r\nn tools that have successfully been applied to the\ndesign of many artifacts=\r\n, from antennas to complete robots. In robotics,\nit has culminated in the E=\r\nvolutionary Robotics research field. Modular\nrobotics, swarm robotics or an=\r\ny robot with non-conventional mechanics\n(high redundancy, dynamic motion, m=\r\nulti-modality) are challenging\nrobotics applications for which such an inte=\r\ngrated approach could prove\nuseful.\n\nThe workshop will present the most rec=\r\nent fundamental developments of\nER, including some not yet transferred to r=\r\neal robotics applications. It\nalso aims at facilitating discussions on ER a=\r\npplications between\nresearchers of the field and potential users. Compared =\r\nto the main\nconference, the emphasis will be on fundamental issues rather t=\r\nhan on\npractical implementations.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nLIST OF=\r\n TOPICS\n\n   * Benchmarks and applications in evolutionary robotics (ER):\n  =\r\n       o what robotics application challenges for future work?\n         o  =\r\nwhat could be the killer app of ER?\n   * Methodological issues related to E=\r\nR use in the context of automatic\nengineering: fitness, genotype, phenotype=\r\n, selection pressure, algorithm\ndesign\n         o bootstrap &amp; premature=\r\n convergence\n         o genotype and phenotype abstraction level in relatio=\r\nn to the\nproblem to be solved\n         o  statistical tools relevant in the=\r\n context of population-based\ndynamics\n         o models of ecological evolu=\r\ntion\n   * Multi-objective approaches\n   * Diversity and novelty in evolutio=\r\nnary robotics\n   * Modularity in genotype, phenotype and selection pressure=\r\n\n   * Evolution and development\n   * Behavior description\n   * On-line evol=\r\nutionary robotics\n   * Evolution of swarm robotics\n\n-----------------------=\r\n--------\n\nORGANIZATION\n\n   * S.
