It is hard indeed,\n&gt; but not that hard :)\n\nHi Peter. I agree! Bipedalism is much harder. But I suspect that HyperNEAT\nis up to the task. It&#39;d be cool to get it working. :-)\n\n&gt;&gt; 3. Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably. The main reason behind why leaky integrator-based substrates\n&gt; may perform worse is because not all networks are guaranteed to\n&gt; oscillate. Some just stabilize forever. Getting oscillation with leaky\n&gt; integrator networks is like a small short-term challenge of its own.\n&gt; :) \n\nDid you ever try the easier (but less powerful) default sigmoid neurons\n(i.e. non-leaky integrators) in your setup?\n\n&gt; Inputting a sine wave explicitly makes the whole thing different.\n&gt; But there is an interesting observation of leaky integrator substrates\n&gt; evolving with HyperNEAT. The neural activity itself appears\n&gt; distributed in a complexifying geometric pattern. The time constants\n&gt; and biases of the neurons are generated by a 2D/3D spatial CPPN.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by that. Can you explain it a bit more? It sounds\ninteresting. \n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Very interesting paper! :)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It reminds me about the experiments I made with HyperNEAT for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; controlling biped robots. Did you try using leaky-integrator based\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neurons for the substrate?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I found them very useful for generating\n&gt;&gt;&gt; oscillation patterns. Substrates of leaky integrators with tanh()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; activation functions produce oscillations much easier than others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hm.. I should really try with robots with 3 legs or more. Getting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; biped walking with HyperNEAT is perhaps too ambitious right now.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have thought a lot about your biped experiment. I&#39;d be really\n&gt; interested\n&gt;&gt; in hearing your opinion, and that of anyone else on this list, as to\n&gt; why\n&gt;&gt; your results were so different from mine. I found that it did not\n&gt; take that\n&gt;&gt; much tuning to get HyperNEAT to evolve really good quadruped gaits.\n&gt; But, as\n&gt;&gt; you note, it was much harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I can suggest a few hypotheses as to what explains the difference.\n&gt; These are\n&gt;&gt; not mutually exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one of\n&gt; them\n&gt;&gt; explains most of the difference, but instead that they add up to the\n&gt;&gt; difference. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt; gaits.\n&gt;&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason\n&gt;&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; There are other differences of course, such as the inputs and the\n&gt; number of\n&gt;&gt; hidden nodes. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This would be easy to test by simply trying a biped with my setup.\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I have some other obligations that will prevent me\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; testing this anytime soon, but if you (or anyone else) would like to\n&gt; give it\n&gt;&gt; a try, that would be cool. I can send you the code I used. One would\n&gt; just\n&gt;&gt; need to change the quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could\n&gt; try to\n&gt;&gt; mimic my setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I do have access to a huge computing cluster. So, if someone makes\n&gt; the code\n&gt;&gt; modifications to my setup (which I know compiles on our cluster) and\n&gt; sends\n&gt;&gt; them to me, I can do a batch of runs.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt; gaits\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This would be an easy test. You could just plug a sine as an input\n&gt; into your\n&gt;&gt; biped. Note: I found that the period of the sine wave made a huge\n&gt;&gt; difference. If I made it too fast or too slow, evolution basically\n&gt; ignored\n&gt;&gt; the signal. Within the range of periods that worked, I found that I\n&gt; got\n&gt;&gt; different types of gaits with different period speeds. With slower\n&gt; periods,\n&gt;&gt; I observed cool tortoise-like gaits with left-right symmetry. With\n&gt; medium\n&gt;&gt; periods, I got the gaits in the paper. With faster periods, I saw\n&gt; slightly\n&gt;&gt; more frantic versions of the gaits in the paper.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period for a short while and\n&gt; it was a\n&gt;&gt; miserable failure. I&#39;d like to try that again, and would be\n&gt; interested to\n&gt;&gt; hear people&#39;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe that\n&gt; attempt\n&gt;&gt; in another email. If someone out there is curious, let me know and\n&gt; I&#39;ll send\n&gt;&gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I did not try leaky integrators. Did you ever try your setup without\n&gt; them?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I did not try them because the default sigmoid neurons worked so\n&gt; well out of\n&gt;&gt; the box that I did not experiment with alternatives. Both Ken\n&gt; (during\n&gt;&gt; preliminary conversations about the paper) and one of the papers&#39;\n&gt; reviewers\n&gt;&gt; asked about leaky integrators, so there is clearly some interest out\n&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; in seeing how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt;&gt; we used in the paper.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better? Why? I\n&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; never worked with them, nor do I know that much about them, so I\n&gt; don&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that they could have\n&gt; made\n&gt;&gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It would be cool to test them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be\n&gt; able to get\n&gt;&gt; to this in the near future so if someone out there wants to swap\n&gt; them in and\n&gt;&gt; give it a go, that would be interesting.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I could not figure out whether your setup did this as well. What\n&gt; were the\n&gt;&gt; outputs in your system?\n&gt;&gt; ---------\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do you think any/all of these hypotheses explain the difference in\n&gt; results?\n&gt;&gt; What other likely hypothesis am I missing (I am sure there are\n&gt; lots).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks again for checking out the paper,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; PS. Tripods would be fun. I also think adding feet and a flexible\n&gt; torso\n&gt;&gt; would be interesting.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT I have wanted to see how\n&gt; it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perform at controlling legged robots.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepted, so I can share\n&gt; it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you now. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A copy of the paper, and videos of the simulated robots, can be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; obtained\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNE\n&gt;&gt;&gt; AT\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you find it interesting.

E., Ofria, C., & Pennock, R. T.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Evolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative\n&gt; encoding.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing\n&gt; Special\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Section\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; navigating\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rough terrain, but the design of their control software is both\n&gt;&gt;&gt; challenging\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce\n&gt; these\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have\n&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such\n&gt;&gt;&gt; active\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential\n&gt;&gt;&gt; solutions, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the\n&gt; problem&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; promising\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve\n&gt;&gt;&gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; without manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more\n&gt;&gt;&gt; easily\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neuroevolutionary\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which\n&gt; may\n&gt;&gt;&gt; aid its\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding\n&gt;&gt;&gt; control, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; vastly\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; better\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results\n&gt; suggest\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; complex,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
