I guess the AAAI\n&quot;Challenges in Game AI Workshop&quot; gets the most submissions (and is the\nmost relevant to modern day computer game dev) but there is also the\nIEEE CIG symposium, which is of interest. I&#39;m sure there are others.\n\nHere&#39;s are a couple of links for you\n\nhttp://csapps.essex.ac.uk/cig/\n\nhttp://www.simbionic.com/gameai/schedule.html\n\nRegards\n\nMat Buckland\n\n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\nIan Badcoe\nSent: Tuesday, October 11, 2005 3:01 PM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [neat] Publish and be damned?\n\nHi,\n\tI experiment with NEAT purely because I enjoy it, and I think\nthere \nis some good progress to be made on a reasonable time-frame.\n\n\tAnd for the purposes of that, there is no need for me to do\nanything \nmore than write the odd web-page (very odd, in all probability :) and \npost things here.\n\n\tBUT, with half an eye on the future, I might want to get back\ninto \nacademia one day (say if its raining and I happen to be passing a \nuniversity), and to do that, you really do have to have a \ntrack-record of publications you can point at.  I know this to be a \nparticularly acute problem (at least here in the UK) because I tried \nit a few years ago and, even explaining that I hadn&#39;t published \nanything because the games industry is paranoid and _never_ publishes \nanything (this 99.5% true) I still couldn&#39;t get them to rate me.\n\n\tSO, I&#39;d quite like to publish some of my current work (when it\ngets \nresults that is, but the reason I mention this now is that at the \nmoment its looking very promising).  And I was wondering what people \nthought the prospects are.  I mean, do journals generally have a rule \nthat says you have to be a member of a university before they&#39;ll look \nat your work?  I&#39;m guessing not because, of course, many corporate \nR&D depts also regularly publish.  But what are the prospects for an \nunknown individual?  Would your submission get the same treatment as \nanybody&#39;s?  Or would they throw it on a &quot;possible loonies&quot; pile and \nforget about it?\n\n\tWould I need somebody in a university to &quot;front&quot; it for me --\ne.g. \nlist themselves as the corresponding author and me as the co-author \nof the work?  If that&#39;s the case, I would be quite open to the idea, \nI mean it even seems reasonably honest, not really different from \nputting your laboratory head on your papers because he provided the \nenvironment in which the work happened (even if he actually \nunderstand nothing of your work -- this used to happen in \nbiochemistry, mentioning no names...).\n\n\tOpinions?\n\n\tIan\n\n\t\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
