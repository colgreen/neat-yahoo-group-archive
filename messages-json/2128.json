It&#39;s certainly one to keep in teh ole tool belt :)\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ideally... yes, but I still say we need some cleverer take on modularity \n&gt;and/or indirect encodings before we can expect to grow a network that \n&gt;exploits symmetry in that way.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes I think I agree. Although for problems with a small number of \ninput/outputs you might get away with plain old NEAT.\n\n&gt;Actually I am toying with a system that might bring some simple indirect \n&gt;encodings into TTT, but for the moment I left the symmetry out and will \n&gt;probably &quot;normalize&quot; before presenting the boards.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBTW I found a nasty in my NEAT code, fixing it seems to have improved \noverall performance (ability to find solutions) quite a lot. I need to \nput out a more general notice and some updated code but as far as this \ndiscussion goes it means I&#39;m a lot more confident that my approach \ncombined with your idea will find good players. A 24hr run (without the \nrotational stuff) resulted in a dominace chain of length 61, previously \nit took a week to get to 54. As it happens the quality of the players \nisn&#39;t that much better at 61 but the increased steepness of the fitness \ngraph is encouraging.\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;          \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I bet I can get there before you... 2mins :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The milestone for delivery of the future has been put back again.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;hmm, I think you missed it. It&#39;s been and gone already.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I _missed_ the future?  But I was waiting for years!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYou&#39;ll have to wait for the next one ;)\n\n\n"}}
