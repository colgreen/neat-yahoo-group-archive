For example if I change the \ndistribution to no=\r\nrmal (gaussian), then points that are far from \n(0,0) in space are visited =\r\nrarely. This makes the bodies more dense \nin the center. It was just a sugg=\r\nestion, it is not really important \nthing to consider. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * if w=\r\ne have (x / distance), (y / distance), (distance) as input \nto \n&gt; &gt; the CPP=\r\nN instead of (x) and (y), the effect is beautiful \nrotational \n&gt; &gt; patterns=\r\n! Spirals and all kind of stuff come up too. So this is \nhow to \n&gt; &gt; get ro=\r\ntation! Just add these to the regular (x,y,1) inputs. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That is in=\r\nteresting, I had not thought of that.  It would be\n&gt; interesting to look at=\r\n patterns generated by such a CPPN.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Playing around with the random=\r\n distributions is a good idea. \nThey \n&gt; &gt; actually control how the raw CPPN=\r\n pattern is about to be \ninterpreted. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What did you mean by playi=\r\nng around with random distributions?  I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure what that means.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
