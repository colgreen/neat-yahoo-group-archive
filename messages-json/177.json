The ROM is in the\nweights.  The neuron outputs are the RAM.  The RAM has\ntwo functions.  It must provide scratch pad memory to\nsupport the computations, and it must remember and\nmake available the data required by the problem at\nhand.  It&#39;s not clear how much is required for the\nformer.\n\nThe total amount of RAM is quite clearly defined:  N\nbits in the case of N binary neurons.   So N bits is\nclearly an upper limit on the memory capacity of a\nfully recurrent binary ANN with N neurons.  Since this\nANN has more than two thousand weights, the memory\ncapacity seems tiny, in proportion.  Furthermore, some\nof it is probably required to support the computation,\nand hence not available for the requirements of the\nproblem domain.\n\nIts relevant to compare this with the theoretical\ncapacity of the Hopfield network, where the memory of\npatterns is stored in the weights.  Each pattern\nconsists of N bits, and the Hopfield network can store\nabout N/6 patterns, so the memory capacity in bits is\nabout N^2/6.  The dependence on N^2 is not surprising\nbecause the number of weights varies as N^2, and the\nweights have the memory.\n\nIt seems that far more data can be stored in the\nweights than in the state vector.  The advantage of\nstate vector storage would be in speed.  Furthermore,\nfor certain tasks there may be no way to modify the\nweights while solving the problem at hand.  (I might\nbe wrong about that; I don&#39;t really understand how the\nweights would be modified during one trial of a card\ngame.)\n\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
