It returns a number guaranteed \n&gt;to be unique within the run.  It does this by just incrementing a counter \n&gt;and returning the result.  I call that same function every time I need an \n&gt;ID.  Topology ID&#39;s, network ID&#39;s, Node ID&#39;s, you name it, it all gets its id \n&gt;from the same place.\n&gt;\n&gt;And whenever a new one (topology, node) is created, I always look through a \n&gt;hash record to see if it is a duplicate of one created earlier.  If it is, I \n&gt;re-use the old ID, which makes things a lot easier.  You may or may not want \n&gt;to do that, but I suggest that it will simplify the search, if not the code. \n&gt;  And if you are coding in a language that makes the hash lookup easy, then \n&gt;it&#39;s even easy in the code.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nJohn, Timmy,\n\nI suppose it depends on the implementation but keeping track of ALL \ninnovations might become cumbersome during a long run. Perhaps then you \ncould keep track of a fixed number of innovations. Old innovation \nrecords will be discarded as new ones are inserted into the table, \neffectively creating a First-In/First-Out buffer of innovation records.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
