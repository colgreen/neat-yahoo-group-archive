I also agree with your argument that a lot of the low-level\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; phenomena we see may be a result of implementation with particular\n&gt; ph=\r\nysical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; systems (and I would add perhaps as a result of evolutionary\n&gt;=\r\n happenstance).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The CPPN is a particularly compelling example of sign=\r\nificant\n&gt; abstraction of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developmental processes, producing many of t=\r\nhe same features of the end\n&gt; &gt; &gt; result of developmental processes. One th=\r\ning it does abstract away, in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; context of plastic networks, is t=\r\nhe effect of external input on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developmental process (which may o=\r\nr may not be an issue depending on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; details of implementation, problem=\r\n domain, etc...).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps we could also assume that, rather=\r\n than some specific set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; functions being the only workable set, wha=\r\nt matters is having a\n&gt; workable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combination of functions, and that t=\r\nhere are many possible combinations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that would work equally well. In =\r\nthis framework we could assume that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biological neural networks repres=\r\nent at least a reasonably good\n&gt; combination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of low-level functions, =\r\nand so we could use this combination as a guide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (but of course this d=\r\noesn&#39;t answer what functions in this combination\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually impor=\r\ntant, or what things can be abstracted away). Also, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combinations=\r\n may be workable, but are far harder to evolve solutions\n&gt; with,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or r=\r\nequire much larger networks, etc (eg evolving networks\n&gt; incorporating\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity can be much easier for some\n&gt; task=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than for those without this type of neuromodulation).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I&#39;m intending to run some experiments to explore these questions\n&gt; (whic=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena are important, acceptable level of abstraction, etc), but=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course to try and thoroughly explore all of these functions in ma=\r\nny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combinations would be a massive undertaking, and is not my main\n&gt; =\r\ninterest,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so at some point I will have to pick a model and run with i=\r\nt after\n&gt; only a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few, hopefully well chosen, experiments... Perhaps o=\r\nne approach is to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; create flexible parameterised versions of these fun=\r\nctions, and let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution determine what combination is right (like y=\r\nour approach\n&gt; described\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in &quot;Evolving adaptive neural networks with a=\r\nnd without adaptive\n&gt; synapses&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but perhaps more flexible and applie=\r\nd to more functions).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mind if I post/quote some/all =\r\nof this discussion in the\n&gt; comments\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my blog post?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

From what I recall,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; howeve=\r\nr, it did become very difficult to figure out which ingredients were&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; essential and exactly what was going on because of all the involved=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; complexity. He may have updated results since I last checked=\r\n in, however.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, you may benefit the actual work that he has=\r\n done on this front and,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; more generally, from his opinions on=\r\n the general scientific approach you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are proposing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope that helps. Best of luck, and I look forward to h=\r\nearing what you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; learn!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeff Clune&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Postdoctoral Fello=\r\nw&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cornell University&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt; jeffclune@...&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://jeffclune.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jeffclune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On May 11, 2012,=\r\n at 6:34 AM, Oliver Coleman wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ken,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I&#39;m pret=\r\nty sure that not all of the phenomena I listed are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; important;=\r\n and that a good starting point in general is to assume that they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; are not. I also agree with your argument that a lot of the low-level&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; phenomena we see may be a result of implementation with partic=\r\nular physical&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; systems (and I would add perhaps as a result of=\r\n evolutionary happenstance).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The CPPN is a particularly compe=\r\nlling example of significant abstraction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; developmental pro=\r\ncesses, producing many of the same features of the end&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; result=\r\n of developmental processes. One thing it does abstract away, in the&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; context of plastic networks, is the effect of external input on the=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; developmental process (which may or may not be an issue depe=\r\nnding on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; details of implementation, problem domain, etc...).&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps we could also assume that, ra=\r\nther than some specific set of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; functions being the only worka=\r\nble set, what matters is having a workable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; combination of fun=\r\nctions, and that there are many possible combinations&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that wo=\r\nuld work equally well. In this framework we could assume that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n biological neural networks represent at least a reasonably good combinatio=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of low-level functions, and so we could use this combinatio=\r\nn as a guide&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (but of course this doesn&#39;t answer what func=\r\ntions in this combination are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; actually important, or what thi=\r\nngs can be abstracted away). Also, some&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; combinations may be w=\r\norkable, but are far harder to evolve solutions with,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; or requ=\r\nire much larger networks, etc (eg evolving networks incorporating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity can be much easier for some tas=\r\nks&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; than for those without this type of neuromodulation).&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m intending to run some experiments=\r\n to explore these questions (which&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; phenomena are important, a=\r\ncceptable level of abstraction, etc), but of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; course to try an=\r\nd thoroughly explore all of these functions in many&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; combinati=\r\nons would be a massive undertaking, and is not my main interest,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; so at some point I will have to pick a model and run with it after only=\r\n a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; few, hopefully well chosen, experiments... Perhaps one app=\r\nroach is to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; create flexible parameterised versions of these f=\r\nunctions, and let&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; evolution determine what combination is rig=\r\nht (like your approach described&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in &quot;Evolving adaptive n=\r\neural networks with and without adaptive synapses&quot;,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but =\r\nperhaps more flexible and applied to more functions).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mind if I post/quote some/all of this discussion in=\r\n the comments&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of my blog post?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
