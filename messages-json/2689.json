There is reason to believe \n(ba=\r\nsed on performance in other areas) that it may be competitive, \nbut it is d=\r\nifficult to be certain.  It is an area for more research.\n\nI&#39;m not an exper=\r\nt on GMDH either; however, it might be interesting \nto consider combining N=\r\nEAT with GMDH.  It may be possible in \nprinciple to do that, for example by=\r\n having NEAT evolve GMDH-style \nnetworks, or by having NEAT evolve the topo=\r\nlogy of the network that \nGMDH then optimizes.  \n\nFinally, there has also b=\r\neen work with NEAT on selecting relevant \nfeatures, called FS-NEAT (feature=\r\n-selective NEAT):\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:gecco05\n\nUltima=\r\ntely the only way to find out how NEAT performs is to try it.  \nOne issue t=\r\nhat may become important is the number of inputs you need \nto perform in th=\r\nis domain.  If it is very large, it could be \ndifficult for NEAT.  However,=\r\n FS-NEAT may help with that problem.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ak=\r\nlein07&quot; &lt;a.klein@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a research student at Humbol=\r\ndt University, Berlin, considering \na \n&gt; couple of evolutionary neural netw=\r\nork approaches to be used for \n&gt; creating models of noisy time series. Conc=\r\nerning NEAT, which seems \n&gt; very promising to me, I do have the following q=\r\nuestions:\n&gt; \n&gt; How does NEAT compare (in estimating models from time series=\r\n) to \nGMDH \n&gt; (group method of data handling: http://www.gmdh.net) type neu=\r\nral \n&gt; networks ?\n&gt; GMDH automatically selects relevant inputs, evolves the=\r\n topology \n&gt; (using genetic algorithms) and estimates coefficients of \npoly=\r\nnomial \n&gt; transfer functions (using least squares for example). Because of =\r\n\n&gt; restricting the GA to the topology, the search space is kept \n&gt; relative=\r\nly small. Like in NEAT, networks are evolved from small to \n&gt; more complex,=\r\n in order find the least complex optimal solution. \nThe \n&gt; gmdh method is s=\r\nupposed to be fast, working well on noisy, small \n&gt; sample data, insensitiv=\r\ne to irrelevant inputs, and creates \nexplicit \n&gt; models (algebraic equation=\r\ns which can be analyzed).\n&gt; \n&gt; Further questions are:\n&gt; How well does NEAT =\r\nperform on noisy time series ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Does it require any enhancements to ma=\r\nke NEAT model (noisy) time \n&gt; series well ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your help,\n&gt;=\r\n Achim\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
