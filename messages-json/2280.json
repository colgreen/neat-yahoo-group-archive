Rather they\n&gt;are fixed pattern classification problems.  I decided to make a\n&gt;version of your experiment because it was straightforward to\n&gt;understand and modify.  The Experiment View window, showing the\n&gt;characters as they are correctly or incorrectly classified, is\n&gt;interesting to watch.  One can cheer the networks on as they learn to\n&gt;distinguish between three or two dots in a column.  The fitness\n&gt;function is also a no brainer ï¿½ the character is either right or\n&gt;wrong.  \n&gt;\nYeh, this whole experiment was created mainly because of it&#39;s speed, \nsimplicity and ability to give NEAT a good workout at high speed. The \nevolved functionality isn&#39;t actually all that useful but that wasn&#39;t the \npoint. It&#39;s good to hear you were able to modify OK anyway.\n\n&gt;You are also correct that Braille characters are essentially\n&gt;3x2 dots.  I put some white space around and between the dots to make\n&gt;the characters &quot;prettier&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell ok, just so long as you are aware that this has made the problem \nmore difficult. You now have 35 inputs instead of just 6, that is going \nto dilute your success rates a lot I imagine. The problem is twofold, \nfirstly NEAT must try out different combinations of inputs to find the \nones that work best, therefore more inputs equals more combinations to \ntry out. A second problem occurs when multiple inputs are conveying the \nsame signal, so in your case the surrounding inputs are always inputting \na 0 for whitespace. This means that networks that are functionally \nequivalent may not be structurally equivalent because they are getting \nthe same signal from different inputs, therefore they may be deemed \nincompatible (placed into different species) and therefore won&#39;t be able \nto generate new offspring via crossover.\n\nThe golden rule is less inputs is/are better.\n\n&gt;The Nero world is way out of my league and even the complications of\n&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe have been surprising to read about. \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s amazing how much depth there is to something seemingly as simple as \ntic tac toe. Well, amazing is one word for it, annoying is another ;)\n\n&gt; This little pattern\n&gt;classification system seemed just right for initially learning about\n&gt;NEAT.  I am having a great time adjusting the various search\n&gt;parameters and slowly digging into the network code to see how they\n&gt;work.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe network code in sharpNEAT is pretty straightforward stuff, the only \ncomplications occur in the optimized code, but that is functionally \nequivalent to the original, slower and easier to understand code.\n\nSounds like you&#39;re having fun anyway. Keep us posted.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
