For starters, what&#39;s a=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; Astro Engine? What kind of intervals are you trading? What are the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; inputs/outputs going to be? What is your data set size? How are you \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; going to prevent over-fitting?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. I think it&#39;s impossible to say =\r\nwithout knowing more.\n&gt; &gt; 2. Not theoretically. I suppose at some point, yo=\r\nur net gets too slow \n&gt; &gt; to be practical.\n&gt; &gt; 3. The EPlex C++ framework: =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html#gaucij_HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; Also, Colin=\r\n Green&#39;s SharpNEAT (C#) framework: \n&gt; &gt; https://sites.google.com/site/sharp=\r\nneat/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Al! so, are you doing this for fun or profit?
