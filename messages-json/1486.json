Yeh OK I&#39;ll have a look at\n&gt;implementing it in SharpNEAT. What do you recon, should I used a fixed\n&gt;number of activations per evaluation or should I relax the network -\n&gt;which allows for open-ended recursiveness. Maybe I&#39;ll try a few\n&gt;variations and see what happens eh. I&#39;ll try and kick it off tomorrow eve.\n\nCool.  Thanks!\n\nYeah, it&#39;s pretty straight forward.  I&#39;ll upload mux.pl to the group web \nsite so you can have a reference to make sure you are using the same inputs \nand the same fitness function.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
