I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for a while, and have been\ninterested in NEAT since attending GECCO 2002.  I&#39;m just about to\nsubmit the following as a Sourceforge project:\n\n**** \n\nREAT (Rete Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an attempt to apply\nthe concepts of Ken Stanley&#39;s NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting\nTopologies) to Charles Forgy&#39;s Rete network.   This will, hopefully,\nenable the evolution of inference rules through continual\ncomplexification of their underlying RETE network.\n\nI intend to develop this in Java, starting from a clean implementation\nof the RETE network.\n\nReference:\n\nNEAT:\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/project-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Projects)=ProjID&ProjID(Projects)=14\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n\nRETE:\nhttp://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/docs/52/rete.html\nhttp://www.drools.org/Rete\n\n**** \n\nI doubt I&#39;ll have this anywhere near ready to submit for GECCO 2005,\neven for a late breaking paper, but I intend on going just to listen\nand learn, and blather about evolving rules to anyone who will listen.\n GECCO 2002 was the first technical conference I&#39;d ever gone to, and\nit was a blast.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;d like any comments you all may have, even on this small\nhint of a project. :)  Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
