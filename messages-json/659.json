First, I tried\ninputting the angles of each joint in the body.  That\nway, they have some sense of their body&#39;s\npose/gesture.  Lately I have been thinking of the\nfollowing options for neural net inputs:\n\n* joint angles\n* joint velocities\n* body part positions (global coordinates or maybe\noffset from the center of mass)\n* overall center of mass\n* forces on body parts\n\nThey need to have enough information to be able to\nperform a complex sequence of actions (e.g. walking). \nAny thought on these ideas for inputs or have other\nideas?  Do you think some are more or less important?\n\nThanks.\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
