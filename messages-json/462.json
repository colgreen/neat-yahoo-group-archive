Actually we are using Torque right\nnow, but the problem is Torque is not really geared towards RTS-style\ngames.  Torque was designed for first-person shooter type play.  That\nis not to say it can&#39;t be made more RTS-like, but in the long run it\nhas issues that make it would be better to have something that was\ndesigned for the right type of perspective.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Chris Christenson &lt;cc57@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Take a look at Torque.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.garagegames.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; the engine was designed for a fps.

We have a graphical game engine that is working for\nus\n&gt; &gt; for now, but we are starting to think more long-term about the\nright\n&gt; &gt; engine for the future.  I wonder if anyone here knows any way to \n&gt; &gt; license or obtain an RTS-style game engine from any company or\n&gt; &gt; organization?  There are several first-person-shooter style\nengines\n&gt; &gt; available, but it&#39;s much harder to find an RTS engine.
