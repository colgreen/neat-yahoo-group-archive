Some things I&#39;m wondering...How \nmany\n&gt; &gt; generations does it take to get the &quot;A&quot; discriminator eye?  \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve been trying a bunch of ad hoc experiments, with all sorts of\n&gt; parameters, so it&#39;s difficult to generalize at this point.  But in \nthe\n&gt; more successful runs, we usually reach 85-95% fitness within around\n&gt; 100 generations, and it normally plateaus out from there.  We&#39;ve \ndone\n&gt; up to 500 generations, but we&#39;ve seen little improvement past the\n&gt; first 100 or so.\n&gt; \n\nGiven you get such a high performance after 100 generations that may \nmake sense that things level out, but once you find some parameters \nthat you are comfortable with, it might be interesting to do a \nsingle weeklong run or something like that to see if things improve \nslowly over thousands of generations.  We have seen that happen in \nsome of our experiments.  Sometimes there can be over 1,000 \ngenerations and then a sudden stream of improvements.   I think it&#39;s \nbecause sufficient complexity builds up to support an elaborated \nstrategy, so it&#39;s possible that wouldn&#39;t happen in blended runs if \nthey don&#39;t build up complexity during stagnation, but the main point \nis that thousands of generations is a whole other time scale that is \nworth checking out if it&#39;s possible.  Of course it&#39;s totally \npossible nothing will happen.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
