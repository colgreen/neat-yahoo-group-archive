Has any one benc=\r\nhmarked it with Neat or HyperNeat?\n&gt;\n\nIt&#39;s quite a different approach than =\r\nNEAT and probably trying to\naddress a different set of issues.  In that sen=\r\nse, it&#39;s potentially\neven compatible with NEAT.  NEAT tries to complexify a=\r\nnd preserve\ndiversity while hBOA (or any EDA) tries to discover the optimal=\r\n\nvariation in the genes.  \n\nI have not seen any direct comparison on any ta=\r\nsk, though one may\nexist.  I would also not be surprised if someone somewhe=\r\nre has or will\ntry to combine them.\n\nOne way to think about BOA, which is n=\r\not the way it&#39;s usually\ndescribed, is as a kind of special indirect encodin=\r\ng, wherein the\nBayesian network that is form is a kind of indirect encoding=\r\n for a\npopulation.  In other words, it embodies certain dependencies and\nre=\r\nlationships the way an indirect encoding like HyperNEAT would. \nHowever, th=\r\ne difference is that BOA tries to explicitly figure out the\nbest relationsh=\r\nips based on the correlations in the genes in the\ncurrent population, where=\r\nas HyperNEAT and most other indirect\nencodings search implicitly.   However=\r\n, searching explicitly is not\nnecessarily better because it means you are a=\r\nssuming that early\nexplicit correlations are not spurious or misleading, wh=\r\nich, in a\nreally complex domain, they probably are.  Not to say that it is =\r\nnot\nvery powerful in some cases.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
