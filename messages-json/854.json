In every\n&gt; experiment I&#39;ve seen \n&gt; except the very simplest, NEAT takes up a tiny\n&gt; fraction of \n&gt; computation time.  It&#39;s the evaluations that are\n&gt; expensive.  \n\nEach evaluation requires the operation (or\ncomputation) of the neural net itself, i.e., giving it\nsome inputs, and progagating the signals through the\nnetwork.  When you studied the time required for\nevaluation did you separate it into time for\nproblem-specific code vs. neural net computation code?\n For a complex network with many connections that\nmight be substantial.\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
