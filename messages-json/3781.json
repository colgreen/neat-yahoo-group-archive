The first one I =\r\nthink \nof, is to add more nodes in the substrate as generations pass. The \n=\r\npositions of the nodes can be determined by some algorithmic way.\nThe other=\r\n way is a bit unclear, but here is the idea. The same CPPN \nthat builds the=\r\n network can be used to build the substrate via one \nadditional output (tre=\r\nating it as an output of a spatial CPPN). \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Luca_PI&quot; &lt;wolfgroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; thanks for the answer.=\r\n Maybe I have not understood all the background.\n&gt; What I tried to explain =\r\nis that looking the code the substrate simply\n&gt; generates the connections f=\r\nor a static structure network. So, in a\n&gt; simple way, I was thinking if usi=\r\nng it as an activation function (in\n&gt; this case it will have one input and =\r\none output) would have given some\n&gt; result.\n&gt; The connection in the network=\r\n would be fixed, giving a &quot;hierarchy&quot; in\n&gt; the list of input, and the subst=\r\nrate (as activation function) would\n&gt; generate the complexity. But maybe is=\r\n not in this way :P\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Luca\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
