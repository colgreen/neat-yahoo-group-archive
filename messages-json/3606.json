I believe that the creators of cmake are\nworking on a script which is co=\r\nmprehensive enough to work on all systems.\n\nIn the meantime, here is what y=\r\nou can do:\n\n1) Get the boost library (either by building yourself or using =\r\na binary)\n\n2) Find out what library name the boost threading examples use.\n=\r\n\n3) edit the CMakelists.txt inside the Hypercube_NEAT directory and in\nthe =\r\nTARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(...) section, replace the boost thread\nlibrary name w=\r\nith the appropriate name.\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclu=\r\nne@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone been able to build HyperNEAT =\r\non OS X Tiger (10.4.1,\n&gt; specifically)?
