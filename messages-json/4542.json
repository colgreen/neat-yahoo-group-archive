It m=\r\nay again lead to some kind of stability, or maybe it\nhas another benefit.  =\r\nIt does seem more principled in terms of\ncharacterizing what a species is. =\r\n \n\nHowever, I am not sure if it would have any benefit towards\nperformance,=\r\n which is probably the most significant issue.  Although\nit would make more=\r\n sense in principle, it may simply not be as good as\nforcing species to clu=\r\nster around their champions.  It is an empirical\nissue and I do not know th=\r\ne answer to it.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My implementation currently =\r\nchooses a single representative of each\n&gt; &gt; species and new individuals in =\r\nthe population are compared with the\n&gt; &gt; list of representatives in order. =\r\n The new individual is placed in \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; first species with a representa=\r\ntive that is within the compatibility\n&gt; &gt; distance.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One other th=\r\ning some people don&#39;t realize is that my implementation\n&gt; &gt; sorts the genom=\r\nes in each species in order of their fitness, which\n&gt; &gt; means ultimately th=\r\nat the representative becomes the individual with\n&gt; &gt; highest fitness.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This issue is something I was thinking of very often. Because one \n&gt; =\r\nspecies can be defined as a group of genomes that have many matching \n&gt; gen=\r\nes close to each other (with respect to the global compatibility\nthreshold)=\r\n, it is possible that the representative of a species could \n&gt; be kind of g=\r\neneralized data across all members of the species, not \n&gt; just one genome. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, the representative can be recomputed every generation, i=\r\nn \n&gt; a process where all members mate into one single individual which \n&gt; b=\r\necomes the representative of the species. All genes should be allowed \n&gt; to=\r\n be inherited in an iterative process resulting in a genome that \n&gt; carries=\r\n all complexity of all individuals of the species. Can this be \n&gt; considere=\r\nd a good representative? Or maybe just regular mating, where \n&gt; excess/disj=\r\noint genes are inherited from more fit members. I don&#39;t \n&gt; know what effect=\r\n this could have. And it is important that the weights \n&gt; of matching genes=\r\n should be averaged during mating.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea is that the representative=\r\n of a species can be not just a \n&gt; genome that is existing as a member, but=\r\n a special genome that is only \n&gt; used during clustering, as the &quot;overall p=\r\nicture&quot; of genetic distance. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does it make sense? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
