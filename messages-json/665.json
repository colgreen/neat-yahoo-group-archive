Can we directly sense joint\n&gt; angles?  I&#39;m guessing not.  I think we probably\n&gt; deduce\n&gt; that from our more direct &quot;force&quot; senses (i.e. sense\n&gt; of touch).  ...Not that that matters for this\n&gt; project.\n\nIt is well established that humans have a &quot;kinesthetic\nsense&quot; which let&#39;s them &quot;feel&quot; the position of their\nvarious body parts.  You can experience it.  Just\nclose your eyes and move your arms into different\npositions, or better yet, relax them and have someone\nelse put them in different positions.  Can you feel\nwhere your arms are?  (You should be able to.)\n\n&gt;  Of course, using simulated senses we (&quot;real&quot;)\n&gt; humans\n&gt; don&#39;t have can help a simulated human.  However, I\n&gt; like the idea of making simulated humans mimic real\n&gt; humans as closely as possible since real humans seem\n&gt; to work pretty well.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think there&#39;s a term for the sense of &quot;knowing\n&gt; your\n&gt; limbs&#39; positions, orientations, etc.&quot; is the\n&gt; &quot;proprioceptive system.&quot;  So maybe an artificial\n&gt; neural network could build this sort of mental model\n&gt; given some primitive input.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another sense could be the vestibular system (the\n&gt; circular tubes in our ears that help us sense\n&gt; angular\n&gt; velocities).  That would be pretty simple to\n&gt; implement\n&gt; and seems like it would help.\n\nCertainly if you want your simulated human to balance\nitself, you should simulate this.  I believe the\nvestibular system senses angular acceleration and can\ncompute angular velocity from this information.\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
