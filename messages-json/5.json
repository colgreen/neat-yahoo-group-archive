I&#39;m mostly interested in AI\n&gt; as applied to\n&gt; game-playing, both board and arcade, and\n&gt; puzzle-solving.\n\nCool.  Are you working on this in your spare time, or\nis this what you do for a living?\n\nDid you attend the AI in Games Conference in Austin\nthis past weekend?\n\nhttp://dmc.ic2.org/conf2003/main.php\n\nAnd are there any specific game domains you&#39;re\nparticularly interested in?\n \n&gt; The NEAT experiments mostly concerned recognising\n&gt; shapes. The network could\n&gt; see a small window of a randomly-chosen shape, and\n&gt; could move the window\n&gt; around if it wanted for a few time steps. Then, it\n&gt; would signal if it had\n&gt; made a decision on what the shape was. \n\nThat&#39;s interesting.  As I stated in my intro, Philip\nand I are particularly interested in applying NEAT to\nGo.  We&#39;ve discussed the idea of some sort of\nview-window, or focus function, that scans the board\nin chunks, decides where the priority board regions\nare, and plays accordingly (as opposed to having 19x19\ninputs simultaneously every turn).  \n\nYou say your results were interesting...what sort of\nresults did you get?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
