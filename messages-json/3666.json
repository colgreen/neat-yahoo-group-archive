I can see now that I really need to go back \ninto\n&gt; the message=\r\n archive and acth up on some of the past CPPn \ndiscussions.\n&gt; e.g. I guess =\r\nthe building/structure domain would need co-evolution \nof\n&gt; the substrate (=\r\npositions of the nodes) and perhaps you could have \ntwo\n&gt; outputs instead o=\r\nf one from the CPPN, one for material strut width \nsay\n&gt; and one for materi=\r\nal type.\n&gt; \n&gt; The visual rotation problem I&#39;m unfamilar with also. When you=\r\n say\n&gt; multiple variables I take that as being multiple collectors on each\n=\r\n&gt; neuron (one per activation input variable/parameter), which is\n&gt; somethin=\r\ng that was discussed ages ago before CPPN. I&#39;ll take a look\n&gt; throught arch=\r\nives on that one also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; On 04/12/2007, petar_ch=\r\nervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I remember that we discussed one issue about visual recognition \nwi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT (CPPNs) and one particular problem arised and this the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n problem of evolving the concept of rotation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; CPPN-NEAT needs to be=\r\n extended with neurons that have activation\n&gt; &gt; functions supporting multip=\r\nle variables for input/output for \nsuch a\n&gt; &gt; thing to be achieved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Another option for a CPPN application is Alife domains, where the\n&gt; &gt; crat=\r\nure&#39;s genotype is a CPPN, but it is still not clear what the\n&gt; &gt; creatures =\r\nwould be and what should they do perform in their \nworld in\n&gt; &gt; order to be=\r\n selected.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recently I proposed that a CPPN could evolve the materia=\r\nl \nproperties\n&gt; &gt; for static physics objects, where the goal is to find the=\r\n right\n&gt; &gt; structure for a building or a bridge, for stuff like eartquakes =\r\n\nfor\n&gt; &gt; example, to make it reliable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many more domains,=\r\n these are just the ones I first \nthought\n&gt; &gt; of.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The good people over at http://galaxyzoo.org/ announce=\r\nd today \nthat\n&gt; &gt; each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; galaxy in their database has been categorized =\r\nby 30 people (on\n&gt; &gt; average).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like they&#39;re building up a size=\r\nable database we might be\n&gt; &gt; able to use.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For the uninitiated you ba=\r\nsically log in and start looking at\n&gt; &gt; pictures of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; galaxies, classif=\r\nying them as spiral (clockwise or \nanticlockwise) or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eliptical. The p=\r\nroblem they have is that some (actually a lot)\nof\n&gt; &gt; the images\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of g=\r\nalaxies are hard to classify, so they explained what to \nlook\n&gt; &gt; for and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; opened the task up to Joe Public, the idea being that by \ngrouping\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n multiple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answers they could determine a good answer for each galaxy.=\r\n \nSeems\n&gt; &gt; the idea\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paid off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I&#39;ve looked at some of=\r\n these galaxies and there&#39;s a lof of\n&gt; &gt; variation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general noise =\r\nand mess in these images, and apart from that \nsome of\n&gt; &gt; them are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\nairly vague.
