You \npass messages between machines. Maybe you are thinking of OpenMP?\n\nHowever, MPI is still designed for clusters. It doesn&#39;t handle partial \nfailure, lag, or latency in a robust way.\n\nWesley\n\nOn 11/2/2010 1:13 PM, garrerc wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the pointer, but I thought that the whole point of MPI was \n&gt; that it was a virtually shared memory model for a compute cluster.
