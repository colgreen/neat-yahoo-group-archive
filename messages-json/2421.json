We choose a function based on the\n&gt; &gt;problem at hand, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a different\n&gt; &gt;function. But often we come up with different ways of evaluating netwoks\n&gt; &gt;for a given problem and we often have discussions about what is the best\n&gt; &gt;function. What if we were to code up a few of theses different functions\n&gt; &gt;and allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This then could be\n&gt; &gt;something akin to an extinction event occuring in nature and changing\n&gt; &gt;the fitness landscape.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;.... or if your function has a bunch of measures that are weighted to\n&gt;give a final fitness score you could just change the weighting\n&gt;occasionally.\n\nI have been toying with this.  e.g. because TTT-PPS involves testing \neach individual over 620-odd boards, you could regard the fitness of \neach individual as a vector or values (one value for each \nboard).  This still reduces to a single overall fitness if you sum \nover the vector, but by keeping the values separate for some \npurposes, you might be keeping information that would otherwise be discarded.\n\n((This is not specific to TTT, it would apply just as well to any \ncase where the score is built as a sum over a set of test \ncases.  Even co-evolution might be expressible this way, e.g. if each \nindividual plays against every other member of the population, then \nthat set of results is a fitness vector as well.))\n\nYou can use this to identify individuals with important new features, \neven if their overall score is low.  e.g. given two individuals, we \nhave the simple comparison of scores:\n\nDScore(1, 2) = Score_1 - Score_2.\n\nBut we also can divide up the test-cases according to who passed them:\n\nCommonScore(1, 2) = Sum(Cases_Both_Pass);\nCommonFail(1, 2) = Sum(Cases_Both_Fail);\nAdvantage(1, 2) = Sum(Cases_1_Passes_But_2_Fails);\nAdvantage(2, 1) = Sum(Cases_2_Passes_But_1_Fails);\n\nThus, when 2 has a lower overall score than 1, but a non-zero \nAdvantage(2, 1).  That tells us that although 2 is a step back in \nabsolute fitness, it has discovered something that 1 cannot do \n(especially if 1 is the population leader, because the leader is \nleast likely to be missing anything obvious and least-likely to be \nable to acquire a new feature without losing some existing score).\n\nWhich might be a strong case for either:\na) 2 being regarded as fitter than naive fitness woudl suppose, or,\nb) splitting 2 off into a new species to see if it can improve on its \nnew feature (with the scope to merge it back later)\nc) trying hard to merge 1 and 2 right now\n\n         Ian\n\np.s. I don&#39;t really know anything about it, but doesn&#39;t one of the \nclassifier approaches work a little like this?  Maybe pareto?\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
