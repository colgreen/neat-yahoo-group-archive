What a=\r\nre the necessary and sufficient conditions for\n&gt; &gt; something to be consider=\r\ned a coupled non-linear oscillators?\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Ken!  The coupling here means =\r\nthat the oscillators influence each\n&gt; other&#39;s behavior.  Let me use the ter=\r\nm &quot;coupled cell system&quot; to be\n&gt; more precise.  A coupled cell system is a c=\r\nollection of cells, where\n&gt; each cell i is a dynamical system with state x_=\r\ni.  If cell i is\n&gt; coupled to another cell j, then it means that the state =\r\nof cell i\n&gt; depends on the state of cell j.  Such a system is represented b=\r\ny a\n&gt; system of ODEs.  For example, the ODEs for a system with two cells\n&gt; =\r\nthat are coupled to each other can be written as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt;    .\n&gt;    x_=\r\n1 =3D F_1(x_1, x_2)   ........ cell 1\n&gt;    .\n&gt;    x_2 =3D F_2(x_2, x_1)   .=\r\n....... cell 2\n&gt; \n&gt; The LHS of the above ODEs represent the time derivative=\r\ns of the state\n&gt; variables, and the functions F_1 and F_2 represent the int=\r\nernal\n&gt; dynamics of the cells.  The linearity or non-linearity of the syste=\r\nm\n&gt; is determined by the nature of F_1 and F_2.\n&gt; \n&gt; The term &quot;cell&quot; is use=\r\nd instead of &quot;oscillator&quot; in the above\n&gt; terminology because it is not nece=\r\nssary for individual cells to be\n&gt; capable of producing oscillations.  Howe=\r\nver, the coupled cell system\n&gt; as a whole can display oscillatory behaviors=\r\n.  More importantly,\n&gt; making some of the cells and couplings identical can=\r\n constrain the\n&gt; cells to oscillate synchronously or with constant phase re=\r\nlations with\n&gt; each other, a property that is useful for modeling gaits.  F=\r\nor\n&gt; example, making the cells and couplings identical in the above\n&gt; two-c=\r\nell system results in F_1 =3D F_2 =3D F.  It is then possible to show\n&gt; tha=\r\nt functions F exist for which solutions x_1 and x_2 of the system\n&gt; are per=\r\niodic and half a period out of phase with each other (see [1]\n&gt; below for d=\r\netails).\n&gt; \n&gt; Gaits are produced by assigning these cells to control the le=\r\ngs of a\n&gt; robot.  But how do we find an appropriate function F?  In my GECC=\r\nO\n&gt; paper, I found F by representing it as a neural network module and\n&gt; th=\r\nen evolving it.  That is, the coupled cell system is implemented as\n&gt; a neu=\r\nral network controller, where each network module represents one\n&gt; ODE of t=\r\nhe system.  The state variables x_i are the leg joint angles.\n&gt; Thus the ne=\r\ntwork takes joint angles as input and produces desired\n&gt; joint angular velo=\r\ncities as output.  This formalism has the following\n&gt; advantages:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1.=\r\n Theoretical understanding of the possible gaits.  Coupled cell\n&gt;      syst=\r\nems can be designed that model central pattern generators in\n&gt;      animals=\r\n, producing symmetric, animal-like gaits.\n&gt; \n&gt;   2. Modularity: The coupled=\r\n cell system I used for quadrupeds has\n&gt;      four identical cells/modules =\r\nthat differ only in the permutation\n&gt;      of inputs they receive.\n&gt; \n&gt;   3=\r\n. Simple feed-forward neural network implementation, i.e. no need\n&gt;      fo=\r\nr leaky integrators or recurrency.  Notice that the sigmoid\n&gt;      activati=\r\non function of the neurons in the network provides any\n&gt;      necessary non=\r\n-linearity.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I had to manually specify the modules and the per=\r\nmutation of\n&gt; inputs to each module. It would be cool if HyperNEAT can evol=\r\nve that\n&gt; specification automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  For\n&gt; &gt; example, I am ass=\r\numing that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\n&gt; &gt; part of a coupled n=\r\non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for the neurons=\r\n to be non-leaky?  I guess I am curious why\n&gt; &gt; having a non-leaky neuron w=\r\nould be the most favorable choice in such a\n&gt; &gt; model, or whether it is som=\r\nehow a matter of definition.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Notice that my description above did no=\r\nt make any assumptions about\n&gt; leaky or non-leaky neurons.  Either type sho=\r\nuld be OK.  I used\n&gt; non-leaky neurons because they are simpler and suffici=\r\nent.  I did not\n&gt; experiment with leaky neurons.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, what are=\r\n the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n&gt; &gt; that would cre=\r\nate this kind of system?\n&gt; \n&gt; Essentially, the substrate needs to implement=\r\n the ODEs of the coupled\n&gt; cell system, i.e. substrate outputs must be the =\r\ntime derivatives of\n&gt; its inputs.  This condition is satisfied if inputs ar=\r\ne joint angles\n&gt; and outputs are desired angular velocities.  The minor adj=\r\nustment to\n&gt; Jeff&#39;s substrate that I mentioned was to interpret outputs as =\r\ndesired\n&gt; angular velocities instead of desired angles.  In principle, inpu=\r\nts\n&gt; besides joint angles are also not necessary for generating gaits.\n&gt; Ho=\r\nwever, the other inputs he used (roll, pitch, yaw, and touch) may be\n&gt; usef=\r\nul for more complex behaviors that require such additional sensory\n&gt; inputs=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce oscillat=\r\nions\n&gt; &gt; reliably, but I am not sure if that is actually anything different=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; from what you are describing or just another instance of the same\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nphenomenon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As I mentioned above, a coupled cell system is a dyna=\r\nmical system.\n&gt; Since networks of leaky neurons can approximate any dynamic=\r\nal system,\n&gt; you are right that it is another instance of the same phenomen=\r\non.\n&gt; However, the coupled cell system framework allows us to reason about\n=\r\n&gt; the high level properties of the system such as synchronicity and\n&gt; phase=\r\n relations that are useful for gait generation, producing the\n&gt; advantages =\r\nI listed above.  As a result, evolutionary search can be\n&gt; biased to discov=\r\ner robust and effective gaits more easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; References:\n&gt; \n&gt; There are =\r\nseveral papers by Stewart, Golubitsky and others on the\n&gt; theory of coupled=\r\n cell systems and how they can be used to model\n&gt; animal gaits.

Instead, neural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; network c=\r\nontrollers with standard sigmoid neurons were\nmodularized to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behave a=\r\ns coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems).  As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explaine=\r\nd in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; &gt; &gt; post, su=\r\nch oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\n&gt; &gt; &gt; periodic beh=\r\naviors suitable for generating gaits.  They are easy to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolve and pr=\r\noduce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and trot for q=\r\nuadrupeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; With only minor adjustments to your setup, you can =\r\nconvert your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillat=\r\nors.  In\nfact,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you would get a configuration similar to my modular co=\r\nntrollers by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint angles =\r\nand\nproducing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs.  Hyper=\r\nNEAT\nwould then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by han=\r\nd.  I think\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if su=\r\nccessful would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.  BTW, di=\r\nd you find\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) w=\r\nere\nnecessary to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nVinod\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
