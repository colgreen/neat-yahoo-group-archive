First, I had made reference to \nonGe=\r\nneration equal to 0 in produceNextGeneration and confused it with \ngenerati=\r\nons equal to 1 in ExperimentRun::start, which is what you \nwere refering to=\r\n with the &quot;generations&gt;0&quot; test. Bad news, I believe \nthat for your intended=\r\n purpose(?), the call to finishEvaluations \nshould be inside the &quot;for (size=\r\n_t generations=3D(population-\n&gt;getGenerationCount()-1);generations&lt;maxGener=\r\nations;generations++)&quot; \nbraces. \n\n   I am getting a call to produceNextGene=\r\nration with generations \nequal to 1, with no prior call to finishEvaluation=\r\ns, with \nspecies.size equal to 0 and the species ID undefined, resulting in=\r\n \nthe exception associated with a call to getSpecies. I note that there \nis=\r\n some editing in this area. Maybe a difference in compilers (MSVC \n2003)?
