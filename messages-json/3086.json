Each such property will then be patterned across the \nsubs=\r\ntrate \n&gt; just like weights.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, the one problem that comes up wit=\r\nh nodes is that node-\ncentric \n&gt; properties are overspecified by a 4D CPPN =\r\nbecause nodes are \nspecified \n&gt; by only two dimensions (that is, they are p=\r\noints in space rather \nthan \n&gt; lines).  Therefore, you have to set a conven=\r\ntion for when to read \nthe \n&gt; value of a node-centric output and assign it =\r\nto a node.  For \nexample, \n&gt; you could say that the node at x1 y1 is set to=\r\n the value of the \nnode \n&gt; output only when x2 y2 are both zero.  Of course=\r\n there are many \n&gt; alternative ways it could be done, but some convention m=\r\nust be \nset.  \n\nI will try to do the following.. the CPPN will have 2 more =\r\noutputs, \nthat will specity the time constant and bias of THE SECOND node, =\r\n\n(x2,y2) .. I think this shouldn&#39;t hurt performance.. But I guess it \nwill =\r\ntake some trial and error. \n\nPeter\n\n\n\n"}}
