I have a few ideas I would like to try out, but I would like to be ab=\r\nle to compare them to the original research to see if I can get any improve=\r\nment.\n\nI have two questions to ask of those of you who have tried recreatin=\r\ng this:\n\n1. How big is the area? I have got all of the internal &quot;walls&quot; in =\r\nplace in scale to the total size of the map, however I would like to get a =\r\nrough idea of the width/height of the &quot;map&quot;. I understand that this should =\r\nall be relative, but without some sort of &quot;scale factor&quot; for my map from th=\r\ne original I don&#39;t know what is a reasonable amount of space for the agent =\r\nto move etc. Currently my world is 120 x 115 units big, and the agent can m=\r\nove anywhere up to 2.5 units per time period.\n\n2. I also am interested in h=\r\now the outputs of the neural network are interpreted. I know from the paper=\r\ns that there are two output neurons, one for forward/backward and one for l=\r\neft/right. Currently I am interpreting these as output &lt; 0.5 =3D turn left,=\r\n output &gt; 0.5 =3D turn right and the same for forward/backward. This is lea=\r\nding to a pretty constant behaviour of moving in circles around the map, al=\r\nways turning left - so I am wondering how other people have interpreted the=\r\n output result to get a more intelligent movement pattern.\n\nThankyou for yo=\r\nur time,\n\nAidan\r\n------=_NextPart_000_017C_01CA3ADE.7D47F920\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Typ=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18812&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot; bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 fac=\r\ne=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;I am trying =\r\nto replicate the &quot;hard&quot; learning \nproblem from the behavioural diversity pa=\r\npers that have recently been discussed \non the mailing list.
