In addition, this question actually \n&gt; comes up fairly frequently from people new to NEAT, so it is \n&gt; answered in a question in the NEAT FAQ on the NEAT Users Page at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Please see the question:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Should a record of innovations be kept around forever, or only for \n&gt; the current generation?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Well NEAT does have such a compatibility function, so I take \n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;question to be whether you could somehow grade the probability \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interspecies mating based on the compatibility of various \n&gt; networks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and the answer is yes. It is possible to do anything you want \n&gt; based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on the compatibility function, and using it as a basis for \n&gt; deciding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which interspecies matings are tolerable is certainly feasible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;no. I mean what if two mutations are identical but were inovated\n&gt; &gt; &gt;seperatly, so that that they are rated as less compatable. In \nthe \n&gt; early\n&gt; &gt; &gt;part of a search, the ratio of members in a population may be \n&gt; comparable\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to the possible number of node insertion points. So if in the \n&gt; second\n&gt; &gt; &gt;generation, the same mutation occured as had occured in the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt;generation, it would be described as a different gene. Later, as \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;phenomenon happens more than once, measured compatability as \n&gt; returned by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the compatiablity function wouldn&#39;t reflect the identical \n&gt; mutations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Am I making a mountain out of a molehill, or am I missing \n&gt; something\n&gt; &gt; &gt;important about the compatibility function?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That really depends on how you handle the assignment of \ninnovation \n&gt; ID&#39;s.  \n&gt; &gt; For example, I remember which connection was split to make a \n&gt; node.  Later \n&gt; &gt; (even hundreds of generations later), if a connection between \n&gt; those two \n&gt; &gt; nodes is again split, the new node will receive the same node ID \n&gt; as the \n&gt; &gt; first time.  So if a particular piece of structure happens to \n&gt; evolve twice, \n&gt; &gt; it is recognized as being the same structure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ken&#39;s implementation doesn&#39;t do that, not between generations \n&gt; anyway.  But \n&gt; &gt; at the same time, Ken&#39;s implementation has managed to evolve \n&gt; solutions to \n&gt; &gt; things, so obviously it isn&#39;t critical.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My suggestion is this:  If you are aware of the possibility of \n&gt; compatible \n&gt; &gt; structures being seen as incompatible, and that bothers you, and \n&gt; you have \n&gt; &gt; the time, energy, and know-how to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen, \n&gt; then by all \n&gt; &gt; means, make sure it doesn&#39;t happen!  You&#39;ll sleep better at \n&gt; night... ;)  \n&gt; &gt; Otherwise, don&#39;t worry, NEAT will still work just fine. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
