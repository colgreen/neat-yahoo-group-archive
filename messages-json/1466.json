I think it would be interesting (and revealing) \nto be able to see how the roving eye moves around the image during a \nrecognition. Apart from being cool to look at (would make a nice \ndemonstration) it might give some indication of the strategy the eye is \nusing to distinguish between characters.\n\nThe long search durations are a bit of a concern going forward, but not \nunexpected given the complexity of the tasks. What sort of hardware was \nthe search running on BTW?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
