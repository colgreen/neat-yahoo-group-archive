You are as=\r\nking whether the substrate would still be called an ANN if it contained non=\r\n-sigmoidal nodes.  I believe no one has evolved such substrates (i.e. with =\r\ndifferent activation functions), so I think it is a theoretical question, b=\r\nut I think what you are saying is probably correct.  The substrate does not=\r\n need to be an ANN.  Of course, some ANNs do not use sigmoids (such as RBF =\r\nnetworks), so just because the nodes are not sigmoids does not guarantee th=\r\nat it is not an ANN, but in some cases I would agree it is not an ANN.  \n\nI=\r\n would be careful with the term &quot;tree&quot; because most graphs are not &quot;trees,&quot;=\r\n so I would not call it an &quot;expression tree&quot; unless it really was somehow f=\r\norced to produce trees or somehow output a tree as the optimal result.  Whe=\r\nther it would be called &quot;simple&quot; is also probably a matter of opinion.  Gen=\r\nerally, if there are many connections it may not really be simple, but it m=\r\nay be simple if the connection weights of those connections adhere to a sim=\r\nple underlying pattern.\n\nI hope this answer helps clarify some of your ques=\r\ntions.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nikolai, you have the main idea right but the one aspect of your \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; description that I would correct is the idea that the substrate must\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; be a perceptron.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks Ken, as I understood, you call &#39;substrate&#39; a=\r\n final ANN that evaluates the solution to the problem activating each node =\r\none by one where each node uses the same activation function.\n&gt; In a paper =\r\nabout CPPNs you say that CPPN is not an ANN and this is why it is called &#39;C=\r\nPPN&#39;, i agree. But when a CPPN produces weights for an ANN, the result (sub=\r\nstrate) must be an ANN. If each node of the substrate is not perceptron typ=\r\ne (i.e does not have a sigmoid activation function), then we can not call i=\r\nt an ANN, right ? It could be called as some sort of an &quot;expression tree&quot;? =\r\nAnd if it does not have many hidden layers, it would represent a simple (re=\r\npetitive, symmetrical, etc) expression. A &#39;simple expression at large scale=\r\n&#39; if it is dealing with large number of connections. \n&gt; Please correct me i=\r\nf i am missing something.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Nikolai\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
