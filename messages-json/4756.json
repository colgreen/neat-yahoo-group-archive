I&#39;d like=\r\n to be able to define them intuitively, e.g., in some XML format (a GUI is =\r\nprobably asking too much). I&#39;ll also want to  display them visually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there an accepted (XML) format for substrate (or general NN) =\r\ndefinitions? With a (C++) parser? Or should I brew my own (and if I do, is =\r\nanyone interested in it)? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of available visualisat=\r\nion tools or code?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TIA,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Evert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Evert,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote a 3d substrate visualizer for the=\r\n HyperNEAT C++ implementation, but it isn&#39;t polished enough to release to t=\r\nhe public yet.  I&#39;ve been debating whether or not to make a released versio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In it&#39;s current state, the sheets are layed out on planes a=\r\nnd the camera can rotate and move around the substrates.  The node colors r=\r\nepresent activation levels, but when you mouse over a node, the colors chan=\r\nge to represent the connection weights emanating from the focused node.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this the kind of thing you had in mind?  If there is a demand =\r\nfor this app, I can package it with the next HyperNEAT C++ release.
