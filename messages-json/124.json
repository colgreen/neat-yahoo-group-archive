See\n&gt; Darren Izzard&#39;s first message (#8), and the ensuing\n&gt; &quot;Shape Recognition&quot; thread.  Similar idea.\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nI read through that thread.  Now there are three ways\nof doing this! :)\n\nOriginally, I had only considered looking at the whole\ntable, meaning that the ANN has inputs for the state\nof every position.\n\nA second way of doing it, based on my\nmisinterpretation of what you said, is to give to the\nANN all of the CHANGES to the table.  Since the\nstarting information is &quot;all cards face down&quot;, the\ntheoreticall, if you know all the changes, that&#39;s\nequivalent to knowing the exact state of the table.\n\nNow I see what you have been talking about, which is\nto let the ANN have a small scanning window and let it\nspend several computational steps looking over the\ntable.  At least, that&#39;s what Darren&#39;s method is when\napplied to this game.\n\nAll of those may be worth trying.\n\nThere is another large architectural decision here,\nwhich I might get some opinions on.  I have been\nplanning to start with a sharp threshold function for\nthe activation function, rather than a sigmoidal\nfunction.  My reasoning is that, since the inputs and\nfinal outputs are binary, why not use binary neurons? \nThe weight & thresholds will be the only floating\npoint numbers in the ANN.  Everything else will be 0&#39;s\nand 1&#39;s, and integers to boot.  I think this will\nallow me to code a faster calculating ANN, which in\nturn speeds up the number of generations per hour.\nI&#39;m planning on using a fully connected binary ANN,\nmeaning that every neural output is also an input to\nevery neuron, through a weight of course.  So for N\nneurons we have an NxN matrix of weights.  (I&#39;m not\nusing NEAT, as I have mentioned previously, but I hope\nsomeone else tries NEAT on this problem.)\nThere is another matrix of weights for the external\ninputs.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
