There&#39;s be=\r\nen a lot of talk recently about novelty search\n&gt; versus objective search, a=\r\nnd maybe mixtures of the two. I myself\n&gt; talked about how in the natural wo=\r\nrld organisms are separated in both\n&gt; behavioural space (i.e. novel behavio=\r\nur is less likely to compete for\n&gt; the same resources as existing behaviour=\r\ns) but also geographical\n&gt; space, and I think that geographical space is a =\r\nkey factor that is\n&gt; missing from NEAT based search currently, and possibly=\r\n EC as a whole,\n&gt; with the caveat there may be other research groups with w=\r\nork in that\n&gt; area that I&#39;m unaware of.\n&gt;\n&gt; My current plan is to focus on =\r\nthis geographical space idea for this\n&gt; iteration because it is the simples=\r\nt to implement. Dealing with\n&gt; behavioural space is potentially more compli=\r\ncated because how to\n&gt; compare behaviour varies across problem domains and =\r\nhow you identify\n&gt; the key factors to compare is probably a non-trivial pro=\r\nblem. I want\n&gt; to try and tackle this at some point, but I&#39;m also keen to e=\r\nxplore the\n&gt; geo-space idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; What does this all mean in practical terms=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; SharpNEAT is a kit of parts that allows you to swap in replacement\n&gt; =\r\nparts such as an alternative genetic representation and/or associated\n&gt; gen=\r\netic operators (recombination, mutation, etc) with minimal impact\n&gt; on othe=\r\nr parts in the kit (in principle anyway). I&#39;m proposing to\n&gt; provide an alt=\r\nernative evolution algorithm class that replaces NEAT&#39;s\n&gt; genome based spec=\r\niation (which clusters genomes into K clusters in\n&gt; genetic space), with a =\r\ngeographical space alternative (I&#39;ll call it\n&gt; geo-space for short).\n&gt;\n&gt; Th=\r\ne idea is that we have some cartesian/euclidean space (probably a\n&gt; square =\r\n2D space initially to keep the code simple, but 3D or &#39;globe&#39;\n&gt; space (2-sp=\r\nhere) are reasonable alternatives). The seed genomes are\n&gt; each assigned a =\r\nrandom coord in the geo-space and this will be fixed\n&gt; for the life of that=\r\n genome. So we are basically adding a physical\n&gt; attribute to the genome su=\r\nch that our population members are probably\n&gt; better referred to as organis=\r\nms (or agents or population members).\n&gt; I&#39;ll use &#39;agent&#39; because it&#39;s easie=\r\nr to type :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Agent fitness is now adjusted by population density at the=\r\n agent&#39;s\n&gt; geo-location, this allows really bad agents to survive so long a=\r\ns they\n&gt; are in a sparse region of geo-space, thus allowing for some divers=\r\nity\n&gt; of the genome pool.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reproduction - I haven&#39;t put much thought int=\r\no this but the two\n&gt; options I see are to create offspring agents near to t=\r\nheir parent(s)\n&gt; versus randomly scattered. Probably some &#39;dispersion&#39; vari=\r\nable will\n&gt; define the amount of scattering with 0 being atop of the parent=\r\n (or\n&gt; between the two?) and 1 being totally random. (Question: Is e.g. see=\r\nd\n&gt; scattering in nature gaussian?). Clearly if agent&#39;s are spawned near\n&gt; =\r\ntheir parent&#39;s we would expect to see clusters of agent&#39;s with similar\n&gt; be=\r\nhaviour, and that clustering will increase population density and\n&gt; therefo=\r\nre lower the fitness of agent&#39;s in that cluster. So there is a\n&gt; form of fi=\r\ntness sharing going on, but as I say, I haven&#39;t really\n&gt; thought through th=\r\ne implications and dynamics of that. But it would be\n&gt; interesting to set u=\r\np, play with and observe what happens.\n&gt;\n&gt; Factoring in behavioural space c=\r\nonsiderations should be possible at a\n&gt; later date, e.g. fitness at a geo-l=\r\nocation is not adjusted down if an\n&gt; agent has novel behaviour compared to =\r\nother agent&#39;s at that\n&gt; geo-location.\n&gt;\n&gt; As per usual - any thoughts and f=\r\needback are welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n&gt; No virus found in this message.\n&gt; Checke=\r\nd by AVG - www.avg.com\n&gt; Version: 2013.0.3392 / Virus Database: 3211/6611 -=\r\n Release Date: 08/26/13\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
