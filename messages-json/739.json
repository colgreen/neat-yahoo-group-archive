Why would we care if our resultant champions have 25%\n&gt; unnecessary topology?  Because we wouldn&#39;t be minimizing the space we\n&gt; have to search through very effectively.\n\nWell, in common case we don&#39;t know whether found solution has minimal topology or not. So we can&#39;t define what part of result net is unnecessary. This analisys can be applied for well known tasks only when there is no actual need to use neuroevolution or other methods. Also in some cases more complex network allows to implement more accurate approximation between input and output signals.\n\nSome work to minimize the search space can be done beforehand. For example statistical analisys of interrelationship between input and output parameters can sometimes reveal lesser of non- significant parameters.\n\nAnother way is to use methods that deal given solution using information on connection weight from some network input. If it&#39;s small then there is a probability that its removal will not harm overall results.\n\nAnd there is one more way. To delete connections during the networks evolution. I mean a kind of mutation but also a Xover can be devised. But there is a problem to define whether we have to search in growing or diminishing networks, i.e. to decide whether it&#39;s better to add or to delete connection to the given neural net.\n\n\n\n"}}
