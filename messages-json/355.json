For each individual in each generation you\ninput the four sets of inputs: (0,0; 0,1; 1,0; 1,1). \nFor each output, you subtract the network&#39;s output\nfrom the target value, square that, and sum each of\nthese values for the four sets of stimuli.\n\nAnd let&#39;s say that your run is 100 generations, and\nthat it&#39;s a miserable failure.  None of your networks\never solves XOR.  In fact, the fitness of each\ngenerational champion never improves.  The average\nfitness of the population never improves.  But let&#39;s\nsay that the average chromosome size increases by a\nfactor of 10.\n\nHas evolution occurred?\n\nYou had a selection pressure, but it failed to induce\na behavioral change in the resulting networks.  And\nyet the networks changed dramatically topologically. \nThey no longer resemble their ancestors in any\nrespect.  And they are no better or worse than their\nancestors at solving XOR.\n\nHave they evolved?\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! SiteBuilder - Free web site building tool.
