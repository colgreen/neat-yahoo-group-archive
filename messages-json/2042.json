If we tesselate multiple functions together (and they need\n&gt; not be repetitions of the same function) then we now have a far larger\n&gt; combination of input values to test against, e.g. in binary input\n&gt; problems such as XOR the number of test cases doubles with each extra\n&gt; input we add. This of course corresponds to more time per network\n&gt; evaluation and so the idea doesn&#39;t scale quite as well as might be\n&gt; apparent at first.\n\nYes, this becomes very time-consuming, and is precisely the reason why I \nswitched over to learning a controller for a board game instead. The game \ndomain allowed even larger input/output spaces (i.e. the kind of problem \nMNEAT could excel at), but performance could be evaluated after letting \nthe network play a few games.\n\n&gt; So what we now have is a framework for defining benchmarking problems in\n&gt; terms of functional &#39;circuits&#39; and repetition of those circuits. But now\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking that the repetition element is unnecessary, we can just\n&gt; hand craft a set of funtional circuits that define a whole range of\n&gt; complexity.\n\nYeah I didn&#39;t mean to suggest using repetition as a panacea for generating \nbenchmarks; rather, tesselated functions is one area where we can find \nconceptually simple benchmark problems that are surprisingly difficult for \nNEAT. Hence I think they are important because they point out areas in \nwhich NEAT can be improved.\n\nAnyway, analogous to your circuit idea is using NNs to fit arbitrarily \ncomplex curves. These can range from easy (composing gaussians) to \ninsanely difficult (functions with NK-level ruggedness or other \nnonlinearities). Mattias I think has done some work in this area.\n\nIt might help to set up some goals for doing NEAT benchmarking. Is it just \nfor the sake of comparability?\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
