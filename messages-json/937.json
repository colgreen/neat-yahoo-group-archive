I tried measuring \nthe my gene comparison/compatibility code a while agoand it was not \nmeasurable for a single generation (less then 1ms).\n\nI was trying to kill two birds with one stone, by keeping innovations \nmatched throughout a population A) I think this is a better approach \nthen just keeping track of new innovations and B) It solves the problem \nwith crossover. But since it&#39;s not going to work with distributed NEAT \nand also if say you load a seed population that already has matching \nconnections. I think I will have to do as you say - and maybe try and \nmaintain innovation numbers across the population as well if I can.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
