This was an \nearly use of the &quot;roving eye&quot; technique. The network could see a small \nwindow on the overall shape. For each test, the network was reset, and \nover several timesteps (each an evaluation of the network) had to \nissue commands to move the eye around the shape before finally issuing \na command saying that it had made its decision.\n\nSince several evaluations were required to solve the problem, the \nnetwork had to evolve some kind of memory. In my first run, I was \npresented after a couple of days with a 100% successful network, which \nseemed rather gangly. Ken kindly drew out a tidied-up version of the \nnetwork, which revealed long strings of nodes connected end-to-end. As \nhe was pondering their purpose, I suddenly noticed an error in the \nconfiguration which meant recurrence had been turned off. The &quot;delay \nlines&quot; (as Ken called them at the time) were providing a rudimentary \nmemory for the network during each tests.\n\nThe way it worked was, each evaluation, the contents of each node in \nthe chain was passing one link further down it. So, the input to a \ndelay line of five nodes would appear at the other end after five \ntimesteps.\n\nIt&#39;s surprising that this could take the place of recurrent \nconnections, and indeed probably only works in limited circumstances, \nbut it did nonetheless solve the problem.\n\nI did try the experiment again with recurrence turned on. Again, it \nfinished with a 100% successful network, but it was much simpler than \nthe delay line version!\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
