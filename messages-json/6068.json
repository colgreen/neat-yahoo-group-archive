Each subfield\nof AI has a different persp=\r\nective on intelligence and unspoken\nassumptions about what is critical to r=\r\necreate it computationally. To\nbetter understand such differences, we aim t=\r\no bring together a diverse\ngroup of AI researchers interested in discussing=\r\n and comparing how\nintelligence and processes that might create it are abst=\r\nracted in\nvarious subfields. For example, such discussion may include hones=\r\nt\nexamination of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches,\nand =\r\nwhat features of biological intelligence are crucial or\nunnecessary to incl=\r\nude in algorithms.\n\nWe hope to encourage cross-pollination of ideas between=\r\n researchers\nviewing intelligence in different ways (e.g. through the lens =\r\nof MDPs\nor symbolic manipulation) and at  different levels of abstraction\n(=\r\ne.g. biologically-plausible neural simulations or restricted\nBoltzmann mach=\r\nines). One goal is to facilitate  revising or creating\nnew abstractions of =\r\nintelligence and intelligence-generating\nprocesses. More information can be=\r\n found here:\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/AAAISymposium2013/\n\nContributions =\r\nrelated to how intelligence can or should be abstracted\nalgorithmically in =\r\nartificial intelligence research are invited.\nExtended abstracts that summa=\r\nrize the results of a research program\nalong these lines are most welcome, =\r\nas are personal position papers or\ncontributions describing speculative wor=\r\nk or work in progress. Works\nbridging traditionally separate AI paradigms a=\r\nre encouraged.\nParticipants should be open to inspiration from work and ide=\r\nas in\nother subfields, and be willing to step outside their intellectual\nco=\r\nmfort zones.\n\nInterested participants are encouraged to submit extended abs=\r\ntracts\n(no more than 2 pages), or full-length papers (up to 6 pages in AAAI=\r\n\nformat) in PDF format to sebastian.risi@.... Accepted\nsubmissions =\r\nwill be published as citable, peer-reviewed papers in the\nAAAI technical re=\r\nport.\n\nAreas of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n- Different level=\r\ns and types of knowledge representation and reasoning\n- Abstractions of the=\r\n following:\n   - Neural networks (e.g. deep learning networks, spiking ANNs=\r\n, and\nplastic ANNs)\n   - Learning (e.g. machine learning and reinforcement =\r\nlearning)\n   - Biological development (e.g. generative and developmental\nsy=\r\nstems, and developmental robotics)\n   - Evolutionary search (e.g. digital e=\r\nvolution and evolutionary\nalgorithms)\n- Biologically-inspired computation\n =\r\n  - Evolutionary robotics\n   - Swarm intelligence\n   - Artificial life\n- Ph=\r\nilosophical arguments on characteristics of appropriate abstractions for\nAI=\r\n\n\nThe symposium will be held Friday - Sunday, November 15-17 at the\nWestin =\r\nArlington Gateway in Arlington, Virginia (adjacent to\nWashington, DC).\n\n** =\r\nInvited Speakers **\nAndrew Ng (Stanford University, USA)\nGeorg Striedter (U=\r\nniversity of California, Irvine, USA)\nRandall O&#39;Reilly (University of Color=\r\nado, Boulder, USA)\nMore TBD\n\n** Schedule **\nFull Paper/Extended Abstract Su=\r\nbmission: May 24, 2013\nNoti=EF=AC=81cation: June 21, 2013\nFinal Camera-read=\r\ny Paper/Extended Abstract: September 12, 2013\n\nWe look forward to hearing f=\r\nrom you.
