Any node that has =\r\nnot yet received \ninput it assumed to be outputting a zero.  In other words=\r\n, time \ndelay does not enter into it at all (I have never actually used the=\r\n \ntime-delay code).  Also, activation does not travel all the way from \ninp=\r\nuts to outputs in a single timestep unless there is a direct \nconnection fr=\r\nom inputs to outputs.  But activation traveling over \nintervening nodes wil=\r\nl take extra time to get there.\n\nSo what happens is that a node that connec=\r\nts to itself receives the \nactivation that itself output on the *previous* =\r\ntimestep.  Networks \nare activated over a series of timesteps.\n\nIt is impor=\r\ntant to note that you should *not* be relaxing a network \nduring a control =\r\ntask like food gathering.  Charles mentions \nrelaxation but that is only ap=\r\npropriate for classification tasks \nwhere the network is trying to decide o=\r\nn a final answer.  See the \nquestion, &quot;How do I ensure that a network stabi=\r\nlizes before taking \nits output(s) for a classification problem?&quot; in the NE=\r\nAT FAQ for \nmore info on this.\n\nIn a continual control task like food gathe=\r\nring (or most tasks NEAT \nis used for) there is always new input coming in =\r\nand new output \ncoming out, so the network will never relax, since there is=\r\n \nno &quot;final&quot; answer.  The only question that comes up is how many \ntimes (s=\r\nteps) to activate the network per world tick.  Almost any \nexperiment I&#39;ve =\r\nheard of activates once per tick, but it is possible \nto imagine activating=\r\n &gt;1 time per tick, which is equivalent to \nspeeding up the rate of thought.=\r\n   However, note that more \nactivations also means more CPU time per world =\r\ntick.\n\nI hope this help; feel free to ask any other questions.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, Charles Tarun &lt;ctarun@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello Maitri=\r\nkaruna,\n&gt; I would like to offer any help I can, and I&#39;m sure others will \na=\r\nlso help,\n&gt; \n&gt; I also don&#39;t have any training on NN either, but I&#39;ve been r=\r\nead a \nlot about \n&gt; them. Each implementation of NEAT handles the firing of=\r\n the node \nin their \n&gt; own way, as NEAT doesn&#39;t define it exactly. My metho=\r\nd of choice is \none of \n&gt; the SharpNEAT ones, &quot;FastConcurrentNetwork&quot;. This=\r\n network \nsimulates each \n&gt; neuron activating concurrently.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Assign =\r\nthe values to all input nodes\n&gt; 2) Activate the network \n&gt; 3) Relax the net=\r\nwork\n&gt; 4) Read the outputs\n&gt; \n&gt; Activate network is pass a parameter of how=\r\n many times to run for, \nthis is \n&gt; basically how many steps to run for. Ea=\r\nch step uses the signal \nstrength from \n&gt; the previous.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Relax netw=\r\nork function is very much like the Activate \nfunction, but also \n&gt; take in =\r\na maxAllowedSignalDelta. It runs until the signal change \nfor each \n&gt; node =\r\nis &lt;maxAllowedSignalDelta or the maxSteps count is reached. \n&gt; \n&gt; |-------\n=\r\n&gt; v |\n&gt; NODE1--&gt;NODE2--&gt;NODE3\n&gt; \n&gt; They way I see this working with your di=\r\nagram is(assuming the \nlinks had \n&gt; enough weight to cause the next to fire=\r\n):\n&gt; \n&gt; Step 1:\n&gt; Node1(input) is firing.\n&gt; node2 get enough signal to fire=\r\n at this time stamp\n&gt; node3 only getting signal from the previous step when=\r\n node2 wasn&#39;t \nfiring \n&gt; does not have enough signal to fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Step2:\n&gt;=\r\n Node1(input) is firing.\n&gt; node2 gets enough signal to fire from node1&#39;s la=\r\nst step, but is \nnot getting \n&gt; signal from node3.\n&gt; node3 gets enough sign=\r\nal to fire from node2&#39;s last step and fires\n&gt; \n&gt; step3:\n&gt; Node1(input) is f=\r\niring(As always, input nodes don&#39;t change)\n&gt; node2 is getting signal from n=\r\node1 and node3 now\n&gt; node3 is getting signal from node2 last time step, the=\r\n recurrent \nconnection \n&gt; hasn&#39;t effected the signal from 2 to 3 yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nUnder such a system it is possible to get oscillation in the \nsignals, that=\r\n&#39;s \n&gt; why there is a maxSteps on the relax function.

I spent the last few days imple=\r\nmenting NEAT in\n&gt; &gt; PowerBASIC and I&#39;m nearly done. I am doing a rather sim=\r\nple\n&gt; &gt; simulation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I basically set up a &quot;room&quot; and drop an agent =\r\nin the middle.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; agent needs to eat=85so I place a large circle r=\r\nepresenting\nfood in\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; room. The agent has so many steps to find t=\r\nhe food or it\n&gt; &gt; disappears. The food is then moved to a new location and =\r\nthe \nagent\n&gt; &gt; can try again. The agent is tested against four different fo=\r\nod\n&gt; &gt; locations. The agent has 8 sensors that allow it to &quot;see&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; tho=\r\nse 8\n&gt; &gt; directions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right now with only 50 parents and 10 generat=\r\nions it is able to \nfind\n&gt; &gt; all the 4 different food bins after about9 or =\r\n10 gens...which is\n&gt; &gt; pretty good.. Especially since I discovered that I h=\r\nave a neuron\n&gt; &gt; firing issue in my code..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway..I am completely=\r\n new to NN&#39;s...i have no training on them \nat\n&gt; &gt; all, although I do know G=\r\nA&#39;s fairly well (I am CEO of \nbioinformatics\n&gt; &gt; firm that uses GA&#39;s to ana=\r\nlyze genetics data).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a question I hope you can help with. t=\r\nhe way I setup the\n&gt; &gt; networks allows for recurrent connections to occur. =\r\nSo suppose \nyou\n&gt; &gt; have a simple netowrk where input node 1 connects to hi=\r\ndden node \n2,\n&gt; &gt; which connects to hidden node 3, which connects to back t=\r\no node \n2.\n&gt; &gt; How is firing to proceed in such a scenario? Node 2 can&#39;t fi=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; until it has all its inputs, yet one of its outputs(the one to \nnode=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 3) affects what its input will be. Thanks for your help...\n&gt; &gt; |------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; v |\n&gt; &gt; NODE1--&gt;NODE2--&gt;NODE3\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And what if a node links back =\r\nto itself? Then how is the firing\n&gt; &gt; sequence to work? I saw a time delay =\r\nin teh C code and I am\n&gt; &gt; guessing this is involved, but I&#39;m not quite sur=\r\ne how...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I get this working, I would like to tackle the tic-t=\r\nac-toe\n&gt; &gt; problem you guys are working on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i really appreciate al=\r\nl your posts...very enlightening...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; Kevin Cramer\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
