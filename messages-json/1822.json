There also many\ndifferences, among them that there are a potentially unlimited number\nof modules organized in a hierarchical fashion, that each module\nstarts without any connections and connections are added not only\nbetween inputs and outputs but between any two neurons and with\ninitially zero strength (to maximize neutrality, which can be seen as\nan alternative way of protecting innovation), gaussian mutation is\nused over all connections, and perhaps most importantly that I don&#39;t\nuse symbiotic coevolution - all genomes contain both modules, bindings\nand connections. I&#39;m working on a proper explanation of the system,\nthe few pages I&#39;ve written on it wasn&#39;t even comprehensible to my\nsupervisor.\n\nAnyway, the encoding definitely works, using the Cellz game as a\ntestbed, even though I have yet to analyze the amount and character of\nmodularity in the evolved solutions. The next step is implementing the\nsimple board game you used in your article, and compare my results\nwith yours. I have a few questions regarding this, which I&#39;d be very\nhappy if you helped me with:\n\n1. Am I right that the inputs are presented to the network (and\noutputs read from the network) as a one-dimensional array, consisting\nof the concatenated rows of the two-dimensional board?\n\n2. The position to place the next stone is taken to be the highest\nactivation in the output array. What does the game do when the network\nspecifies a position where there already is a stone, black or white?\n\n3. Is a stone counted as next to another stone if it&#39;s placed\ndiagonally adjacent to it?\n\nYes, I did try looking at the code to find out about these things, but\nI&#39;m first and foremost a Java programmer, and my ability to understand\ncomplex c++ code is far from adequate.\n\nI hope your GRN experiments work out well - I myself hope to be able\nto submit some of my results within the extended GECCO deadline, but\nI&#39;m not sure that&#39;s realistic. Alas, there is still CEC and ECAL...\n\nJulian\n\n\n\nOn Wed, 8 Dec 2004 11:54:06 -0600 (CST), Joseph Reisinger\n&lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Thans for pointing to your thesis, which I have now read. Good stuff.\n&gt;  &gt; It did clear up most of the details I was wondering about, but it\n&gt;  &gt; would be handy to have your code available to look at in case there is\n&gt;  &gt; something more I&#39;m wondering about.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Ok, sorry for the delay. I&#39;ve posted a tarball at:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii/mneat.tar.bz2\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I cleaned up the package a bit and wrote a (short) README file addressing\n&gt;  some basic issues. Please take a look if you have time. Also please feel\n&gt;  free to ask any questions at all about the code. I never really inteded to\n&gt;  release it so its in a terrible state, but I think it still runs fine. As\n&gt;  I get questions I&#39;ll add clarification to the README and comments to the\n&gt;  code, and hopefully this package can be made a little more usable.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; I am currently working on comparing different ways of encoding\n&gt;  &gt; modularity for evolving controllers in the simple game of Cellz, where\n&gt;  &gt; agents have radial symmetry. One of the methods will be something very\n&gt;  &gt; much like modular neat, but without the speciation and symbiotic\n&gt;  &gt; coevolution parts. (If I understand your thesis right, you didn&#39;t find\n&gt;  &gt; any evidence that the symbotic coevolution part actually improved\n&gt;  &gt; effectiveness.)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Right exactly. Finding ways to percolate the fitness from the chromosomes\n&gt;  down to the modules was troubling, and even worse, modules had no control\n&gt;  over their own expression patterns, so they could not be expected to\n&gt;  evolve anything but highly generic structures. I&#39;d be really interested to\n&gt;  see an implementation of this without symbiotic coevolution; in my mind\n&gt;  that is the current greatest weakness of the method.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt; Actually, I&#39;m not convinced that artificially embryogenetic systems (e g\n&gt;  &gt; GRN-based) neccessarily have more to offer in terms of evolvability\n&gt;  &gt; (though they might be more interesting from a biological point of view)\n&gt;  &gt; than the straightforward approach to modularity taken in neat.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Hehe well the main hope is that developmental systems will eventually\n&gt;  elimnate the need to have different kinds of representations for different\n&gt;  kinds of problems. I imagine some system that does just as well on double\n&gt;  pole balancing as it does on my 7x7 board game, evolving\n&gt;  functional modularity as required to increase the overall evolvability. In\n&gt;  any case my next paper will focus on this topic so I hope I can sway you\n&gt;  somewhat :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Anyway thanks for your interest in MNEAT, and good luck with your\n&gt;  research.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Joe\n&gt;  \n&gt;  -- \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Joseph Reisinger\n&gt;  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Yahoo!
