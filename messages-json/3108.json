Craziness.\n\nThere are=\r\n no dependencies other than the various files in the \nResources directory a=\r\nnd the .param file.  The directory where you&#39;re \nrunning PMAI.exe should co=\r\nntain the Resources directory (along with \nall its contents) and the AIPac.=\r\nparam file.  I&#39;ve tested it on \nvarious machines and had no problems.  It i=\r\ns all programmed in \nWin32, so a Windows machine should suffice.  Let me kn=\r\now if you \ncan&#39;t seem to work out what the issue is.\n\nAs for inputs and con=\r\ntrolling the application, I have uploaded an \nadditional file to SourceForg=\r\ne that explains some of the details.  \nIt is called ExtraDetails.txt, and I=\r\n&#39;ve copied the text of it \nbelow.  The application isn&#39;t very interesting i=\r\nn its current state \ndue to a long evolutionary step, but I give some ideas=\r\n on how to \nshorten that in the ExtraDetails.text file.  In particular, if =\r\nyou \npress the &#39;B&#39; key, this will toggle the PacMan visualizer to show \nyou=\r\n the best controller thus far.  Be patient after hitting the &#39;B&#39; \nkey, thou=\r\ngh, as it doesn&#39;t realy show its effect until after an \nevolutionary step.\n=\r\n\nA lot of control can be gained from the AIPac.param file.  Also, \nthere is=\r\n some brief explanation of the inputs used in that file.  As \nit stands, th=\r\ne inputs are based on a window centered around PacMan \nwhich is 6 &quot;tiles&quot; i=\r\nn radius.  This gives a 13x13 window around \nPacMan.  For each tile, there =\r\nare inputs for each of the following:  \nwall/no wall, dot/no dot, edible gh=\r\nost/no edible ghost, hunting \nghost/no hunting ghost, powerup/no powerup.  =\r\nThis gives 13x13x5 \ninputs - a lot, but it seems to work well.  You can con=\r\ntrol the \nwindow size in the AIPac.param file.\n\nYou can control the way the=\r\n inputs are determined using the AIType \nparameter.  It can be Global or Wi=\r\nndowed (described above).  If you \nset it to Global, the inputs are quite d=\r\nifferent and are \ncontrollable from the parameter file as well.  Here&#39;s a s=\r\nnip from \nthe parameter file with the inputs available in Global mode:\n\n\n\n#=\r\nInput Selection for Global AI type - 1=3Don 0=3Doff\n#Number of inputs are c=\r\nomputed from these - maximum of 34 when all \nare turned on\t\n#CheckForWalls =\r\ngives 4 inputs, one for each direction around PacMan. \nThe input is 1 if th=\r\nere is a wall there, 0 if PacMan can move that \ndirection\n#CheckDots gives =\r\n4 inputs for each direction around PacMan, each \nwith the total number of d=\r\nots on that side of PacMan&#39;s current \nposition\n#MaxDotDirection gives 4 inp=\r\nuts, 1 of which will be set to 1 (others \n0) corresponding to the direction=\r\n in which most dots are present\nGhostXY\t\t\t\t1\t\nGhostState\t\t\t1\t\nPowerUpXY\t\t\t1=\r\n\t\nPowerUpState\t\t\t1    \nPacManXY\t\t\t1    \nCheckForWalls\t\t\t1    \nCheckDots\t\t\t0=\r\n\nMaxDotDirection\t\t\t1\n\n\nI hope that helps to explain some of the details.  B=\r\ne careful when \nadjusting the parameter file.  Spelling is important.  I us=\r\ned \nwhitespace as the delimiter, so absolute positioning isn&#39;t \nimportant, =\r\nbut make sure you use spaces or tabs.  If you have any \nmore questions, ple=\r\nase don&#39;t hesitate to ask.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n\nAIPac Additional Details\n10 April 200=\r\n7\nRobert Kirk DeLisle\n\nHere are some additional details related to AIPac th=\r\nat might come in \nuseful.  I&#39;ve tried to put the details in the order of in=\r\nterest and \nthose pieces that will get you up and running the fastest.\n\nRem=\r\nember that the Resource directory needs to be present.  This has \nall the g=\r\nraphics, mazes, etc. needed for the simulator.  You can \ncontrol most (all,=\r\n I think) of the details of where the various \nfiles are found within the p=\r\narameters files, AIPac.param, but I \nrecommend leaving things as they are u=\r\nntil you&#39;re familiar with the \nprogram.\n\nWhile the simulator is running, if=\r\n you press the &#39;B&#39; key, this will \ntoggle displaying the current best PacMa=\r\nn controller after each \ngeneration.  Remember that there will be a delay i=\r\nn displaying the \nbest controller due to the fact that generations take a w=\r\nhile to \nprocess.\n\nCurrently, I have the parameters set up for a rather len=\r\ngthy \nevolution step.  If you want to see some action more quickly, try \nch=\r\nanging the following parameters in AIPac.param:\n\nReplicates\t- In the availa=\r\nble downloads, I have this set to 10 \nwhich means that each PacMan controll=\r\ner will be tested 10 times and \na measure of performance assessed across th=\r\ne multiples.  Set this to \na smaller number and things will run faster.\n\nPo=\r\npSize \t- Obviously, reducing population size will make \nthings faster, alth=\r\nough potentially less interesting.\n\nAIType\t\t- I have this set to Windowed w=\r\nhich defines a window \naround PacMan, as described in the readme file.  Set=\r\nting this to \nGlobal will be a very different type of AI.  Specifically, th=\r\ne \ninputs defined in the section following AIType setting will be used \nrat=\r\nher than a window around PacMan.  This will shrink the number of \ninputs si=\r\ngnificantly, but I&#39;ve found it to be less interesting.\n\n\n\nIf there are othe=\r\nr questions or comments, please leave a message in \nthe forum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kenneth Stanley=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wonder if I&#39;m the only one with this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; It di=\r\nd run for me (Windows XP, P4@3GHz, 3.25GB RAM).
