You can get the source code with =\r\nmanual here: \nhttp://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~jgauci/Releases/HyperNEAT_v3_0.zip \n=\r\n\nThe HyperNEAT html reference is updated.  You can access it here:\nhttp://w=\r\nww.eecs.ucf.edu/~jgauci/Reference/HyperNEAT/\n\nThere is a new reference for =\r\nPyHyperNEAT (including the visualizer):\nhttp://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~jgauci/Ref=\r\nerence/PyHyperNEAT/\n\nHere are some of the updates since 2.6:\n\n-PyHyperNEAT:=\r\n A python wrapper around NEAT and HyperNEAT\n\n-Visualizer: A python substrat=\r\ne visualizer for analyzing the structure of large substrates.  Includes a f=\r\nunction to dump activation levels, receptive fields, and influence maps to =\r\nPDF/SVG/PNG\n\n-Mac OS/X support: The cmake-generated source code now correct=\r\nly generates an os/x application. OS/X support is now complete for both the=\r\n GUI and command line versions.\n\n-MPI has been reimplemented and tested wit=\r\nh several cluster experiments.\n\n-Manual included with step-by-step instruct=\r\nions for adding a new experiment to the system.\n\n-Code reorganization.  Sub=\r\nstrate-generation code removed from each experiment in the HyperNEAT librar=\r\ny and added to a common file in the NEAT library.\n\n-Plenty of bug fixes.\n\nP=\r\nlease do not hesitate to post any feedback to this group or via email.\n\nJas=\r\non G.\n\n\n"}}
