One motivation \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; this competition is comparing st=\r\nrengths and weaknesses of various \n&gt; CI\n&gt; &gt; techniques, such as temporal di=\r\nfference learning, neuroevolution, \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; &gt; Another motivation is just h=\r\naving a fun competition that is as \n&gt; easy as\n&gt; &gt; possible to participate i=\r\nn, but still has some depth to it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think NEAT could do very well=\r\n on this problem, and interfacing it\n&gt; &gt; (especiall one of the Java version=\r\ns) to the competition code \n&gt; should be\n&gt; &gt; quite simple. Is anyone up to t=\r\nhe challenge?
