If there&#39;s waste at the end, there\n&gt;was waste throughout.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that if you include a \ncomplexity penalty in the fitness function, you create an evolutionary \npressure towards or bias for simpler networks.  This pressure will cause the \nsearch to favor avenues that end up going directly to the final solution \nwithout picking up a lot of baggage along the way.  The only exception is \nwhere it is absolutely necessary to gather in some &#39;baggage&#39; in order to \narrive at the final solution, which I can&#39;t envision ever actually being \nnecessary.  Or in the early phases when no specimen has yet even approached \na solution.\n\nAlso, wouldn&#39;t it be true that irrelevant topology would tend to &#39;remove&#39; \nitself by means of low weights?  Any random mutation that increased the \nweights of irrelevant topology would decrease fitness, right?  So relevant \n&#39;paths&#39; would tend to form a relationship to one another, and irrelevant \ntopology would tend to decrease relative to it.  Or is that a \nmisunderstanding?  True, that doesn&#39;t help you reduce computational costs \nduring evolution, which is part of the goal (yes?), but if correct, it would \nhelp you identify the non-contributing structure.\n\nOn the other hand, there is &#39;irrelevant&#39; and then there is &#39;excessive.&#39;  For \nexample, full interconnection with a large number of hidden nodes may be \noverkill for a particular problem.  But how would you identify the \n&#39;irrelevant&#39; nodes?  Since each one contributes to the solution (if the \nweights are right), you can&#39;t drop any.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
