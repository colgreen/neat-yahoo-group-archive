I would\nsuggest that defining CPU resource usage as one of the fitness metrics\nin that scheme would be a logical choice for most non-trivial problem\ndomains to allow some exploration of high CPU usage solutions but with\nconstraints on how many genomes can explore such strategies.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
