Is there any way you could post a couple of the \ncompressed and\n&gt; &gt;target images in the photos section?\n&gt; \n&gt; Done.  Photo album IEX has two images.  Ignore the thumbnails, \nlook at the \n&gt; actual images.  The first image is a 9x9 input image, what is \nbeing input \n&gt; into the network.  The other is the target image, what the network \nwants to \n&gt; be able to reproduce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every activation returns ONE pixel.  Which pixel, and how big that \npixel is \n&gt; is determined by the top,left,right,bottom inputs.  a top,left of \n0,0 and \n\nDo you mean outputs rather than inputs?  This description doesn&#39;t \nseem to leave anything left for the network to decide if everything \nis based on only its inputs?\n\n&gt; bottom,right of 1,1 means return one pixel that corresponds to the \naverage \n&gt; intensity of the whole target image.  With a bottom,right of \n0.5,0.5 it \n&gt; means return the average intensity of the region that is the upper \nleft \n&gt; quadrant of the target image.  Make sense?\n\n\n"}}
