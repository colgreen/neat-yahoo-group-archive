A wiki won&#39;t cover all the things a HOL can cover=\r\n, but I agree that it would be the best choice for any detailed parameter e=\r\nxplanation. My only concern is, that a wiki will also become very technical=\r\n over time and consequently scare away most of the new interested users (I =\r\nalways refer to people like me, who consider neural networks only as a spar=\r\ne-time activity).\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Evert Haas=\r\ndijk &lt;evert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe a wiki would be just the tic=\r\nket here?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Evert\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 23 Nov 2009, at 00:07, dkuppit=\r\nz wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; here&#39;s just another vote for a tutorial,=\r\n with the difference that I  \n&gt; &gt; would prefer it for HyperSharpNEAT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; It would be great to see something like a HOL (Hands on Labs) where  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a new experiment is created from the scratch. Parameters should be  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nexplained in detail, for example: Which impact has the parameter  \n&gt; &gt; Tres=\r\nhold, which impact has WeightRange, etc.? How are the values for  \n&gt; &gt; each=\r\n parameter determined, what is taken into account when you set  \n&gt; &gt; the va=\r\nlues? There are so many unanswered questions for those who are  \n&gt; &gt; new to=\r\n HyperNEAT and I think most people (including me) have a  \n&gt; &gt; really great=\r\n interest in this topic, but not the time to read (and  \n&gt; &gt; understand) al=\r\nl the technical papers. So any tutorial should target  \n&gt; &gt; beginners and e=\r\nxplain things that have become self-evident for  \n&gt; &gt; intermediates.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I think one such &quot;official&quot; tutorial that explains every step in  \n&gt; &gt; de=\r\ntail should be enough, more will surely follow from the growing  \n&gt; &gt; commu=\r\nnity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Daniel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot;=\r\n &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andrei, which version of HyperN=\r\nEAT are you interested in and what  \n&gt; &gt; references have you looked at so f=\r\nar? We can potentially improve the  \n&gt; &gt; documentation based on your commen=\r\nts (and a tutorial is a good  \n&gt; &gt; idea), but first I want to understand wh=\r\nich &quot;comment-less examples&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; you are referring to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Note th=\r\nat several experiments with complete source code are  \n&gt; &gt; available in two=\r\n existing HyperNEAT releases of which I am aware.  \n&gt; &gt; These and a variety=\r\n of publications from several groups are linked  \n&gt; &gt; from the HyperNEAT Us=\r\ners Page, which also provides a brief  \n&gt; &gt; introduction:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand yo=\r\nu may have already been through this site and its  \n&gt; &gt; associated software=\r\n and papers, but I wanted to point it out in case  \n&gt; &gt; you had not been aw=\r\nare of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We want to make the algorithm as accessible as possi=\r\nble so your  \n&gt; &gt; comments are appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ca=\r\nn anyone please recommend some HyperNEAT documentation, a  \n&gt; &gt; tutorial, d=\r\niagram, some clue, or anything that does not mean reverse  \n&gt; &gt; engineering=\r\n the comment-less examples ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
