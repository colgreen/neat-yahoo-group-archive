I&#39;am\nw=\r\norking on this approaches, I will be also at Gecco in the\ndevelopmental app=\r\nroaches track :D  Using developmental encodings to\nevolve flags is not the =\r\nbest ways to do flags : simply evolving f(x,\ny) =3D z is enougth, far simpl=\r\nier and have a much better algorithmic\ncomplexity. \n\nBut those developmenta=\r\nl encodings are not meant to be used to make\nflags and only flags. They can=\r\n use environmental information to\nprovide a solution to a problem for diffe=\r\nrents contexts. A\ndevelopmental encoding could encode the building process =\r\nof bridge,\nand such an encoding could works for any river length and depth.=\r\n.. Or\nwe can imagine that each &#39;cells&#39; of the embryo could have and\ninforma=\r\ntion a physical information, and then the embryo would converge\nto an optim=\r\nal structure. With a single evolution we could solve\nseverals problems. Tha=\r\nt&#39;s the real power of the embryogenic\napproaches. I spoke about &quot;convergenc=\r\ne&quot; : that means that with an\nembryogenic approache, we simply defines the s=\r\nolution of problem the\nfixed point of cells interaction. This convergence, =\r\nif the evolution\nworked well, could be achieved for a range of environmenta=\r\nl\nconditions. Flags are only a benchmark. I&#39;am currently working on a\nnew p=\r\nroblem to show a practical example of what I call &quot;the real power\nof develo=\r\npmental encodings&quot;. It will probably works for Gecco :D\n\nAlex\n\n--- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ian, thanks fo=\r\nr the great post.  These are indeed critical and deep \n&gt; issues at the core=\r\n of indirect encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to carefully address them because I have=\r\n been thinking about \n&gt; these issues for a long time and they are tied into=\r\n the theory \n&gt; behind CPPNs.  \n&gt; \n&gt; First, note that our new journal paper =\r\nthat I just \n&gt; announced, &quot;Compositional Pattern Producing Networks: A Nove=\r\nl \n&gt; Abstraction of Development,&quot; gives an extensive treatment of the \n&gt; is=\r\nsues you raise in a better way than the old &quot;Patterns Without \n&gt; Developmen=\r\nt.&quot;  (The journal paper has replaced &quot;Patterns Without \n&gt; Development,&quot; whi=\r\nch is no longer available)  So you may find a \n&gt; better motivation in that =\r\npaper.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I will give my thoughts here in short.  I have com=\r\ne to \n&gt; the conclusion after thinking about this issue for a couple years \n=\r\n&gt; that there may be no representational or even computational \n&gt; advantage =\r\nto iterated developmental systems over CPPN-like \n&gt; functional representati=\r\non.  I say &quot;may&quot; because I am not yet 100% \n&gt; certain, but I am nearing it.=\r\n  If I am right, this is a very deep \n&gt; and significant fact that should ch=\r\nange the way we are looking at \n&gt; representation through development.  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There are a few reasons for this view.  One is the simple \n&gt; theoretical =\r\nfact that a single hidden layer neural network can \n&gt; represent any functio=\r\nn with arbitrary accuracy (a theorem by \n&gt; Cybenko).  From the perspective =\r\nof patterns, this theorem means that \n&gt; *theoretically*, there is no patter=\r\nn that iterative development can \n&gt; produce that a functional description c=\r\nannot describe with \n&gt; arbitrarily close precision.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, that is=\r\n only theory, and theory and practice are often \n&gt; opposed:  It still leave=\r\ns open the possibility that somehow \n&gt; representations of certain patterns =\r\nare for some reason more \n&gt; *compact* if they are described and mapped thro=\r\nugh an iterative \n&gt; process.  Thus one can still argue they are more powerf=\r\nul.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet I also have come to believe that that is not the case either. =\r\n \n&gt; The reason hinges on an interesting insight that you put like this:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;genes essentially &#39;pattern recognize&#39; certain areas in the  \n&gt; organism&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; That is absolutely correct for biological organisms, and for \n&gt; itera=\r\nted developmental systems in general.  However, the deep \n&gt; question is *wh=\r\ny* should they need to &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain \n&gt; areas?\n&gt; \n&gt; And the a=\r\nnswer is because they need to know where they are.  In \n&gt; effect, in the ph=\r\nysical universe, there is no intrinsic coordinate \n&gt; system that cells can =\r\nquery to ask their location.  Thus, they must \n&gt; develop elaborate and ad h=\r\noc ways of communicating to each other, as \n&gt; a group, where everyone is.  =\r\nI send my neighbor signals, my neighbor \n&gt; sends me signals back, and we ne=\r\ngotiate our roles. \n&gt; \n&gt; My undoubtedly controversial contention is that th=\r\ne question &quot;where \n&gt; am I?&quot; is the ONLY reason that such negotation is nece=\r\nssary.  If you \n&gt; didn&#39;t have to ask that question, then you would not need=\r\n to talk to \n&gt; your neighbors in order to determine your role.  Rather, you=\r\n could \n&gt; just compute your role as a function of your known \n&gt; coordinate/=\r\nposition in the world.  \n&gt; \n&gt; That is exactly what CPPNs do.  Because insid=\r\ne a computer the \n&gt; coordinates of every &quot;cell&quot; in (2D or 4D or 6D or whate=\r\nver) space is \n&gt; known, they do not need to communicate with each other.  R=\r\nather, \n&gt; they simply compute a function of their position.\n&gt; \n&gt; That funct=\r\nion in effect encompasses all the unfolding events that \n&gt; would happen in =\r\na normal iterative process, as the CPPN theory \n&gt; says.  So if there was a =\r\nsymmetric gradient laid from one side to \n&gt; another in a growing organism t=\r\nhrough some complex process of \n&gt; communication, a CPPN simply instantiates=\r\n a symmetric function \n&gt; instead as an analogue of the same process.  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thus, I would argue that the CPPN likely completely subsumes \n&gt; iterative =\r\ndevelopment, and that all the fancy stuff that is so mind-\n&gt; blowing that l=\r\nooks so important in devleopmental biology is simply a \n&gt; big complicated q=\r\nuest to answer the question &quot;where am I?&quot; (and \n&gt; hence &quot;who am I?&quot;).  In a=\r\n computer, since we know the &quot;where&quot; answer \n&gt; a priori by definition, we c=\r\nan wipe out all of this unnecessary \n&gt; complexity, in effect massively simp=\r\nlifying the problem of \n&gt; represnetation.\n&gt; \n&gt; My hunch is that this princi=\r\nple is why CPPNs are producing such \n&gt; intricate and complex structures com=\r\npared to every artificial \n&gt; developmental encoding that has come before.  =\r\nHave you ever seen a \n&gt; pattern as nuanced and intricate as the spaceship p=\r\nroduced by CPPNs \n&gt; produced by another developmental encoding?  In fact, e=\r\nvolving a \n&gt; blob or a flag-like pattern is currently considered cutting ed=\r\nge \n&gt; with such systems today.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;d actually argue that CPPNs are a =\r\nmore powerful representation \n&gt; than an iterative system because they wipe =\r\nout all kinds of \n&gt; unnecessary complexity that results at the core from si=\r\nmply needing \n&gt; to know where one is in the body plan.  And they also wipe =\r\nout the \n&gt; iterations themselves.  So it&#39;s a radical contrast.  In effect, =\r\nthis \n&gt; radical shift away from iteration and local interaction is possible=\r\n \n&gt; because CPPNs are cheating: They can know the coordinate frame \n&gt; withi=\r\nn which they operate a priori- something that is not available \n&gt; in biolog=\r\ny.  So it is not a surprise that when we cheat we can do \n&gt; better.  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThus, I am arguing an admittedly radical position that classic \n&gt; iterated =\r\ndevbelopment is best abandoned as a form of indirect \n&gt; encoding for evolut=\r\nionary algorithms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note however, having said that, that iterati=\r\non IS necessary \n&gt; for developmental systems that interact with the environ=\r\nment over \n&gt; their lifetime (such as brains).  However, CPPNs can iterate i=\r\nn such \n&gt; a way just as any other system.  It only means re-querying the CP=\r\nPN \n&gt; at each iteration.  Thus, CPPNs do not miss this capability even \n&gt; w=\r\nhen it is necessary (and it will be in the long run).\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, my hu=\r\nnch is that CPPNs (or something quite similar) are \n&gt; the best type of abst=\r\nraction we will get.  The enchantment with a \n&gt; process of unfolding over t=\r\nime and local interaction may turn out to \n&gt; be an intuitive mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \tCan I add my opinion to the other&#39;s saying that from what=\r\n I \n&gt; read so \n&gt; &gt; far, the idea of HyperNEAT is brilliant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tHavin=\r\ng said that (always got to balance the praise and \n&gt; criticism) I \n&gt; &gt; do f=\r\neel that there is a little something that has been missed in \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; p=\r\narticular approach.  I really meant to say something before, way \n&gt; &gt; back =\r\nwhen you posted the &quot;Patterns without development&quot; work that \n&gt; &gt; preceded =\r\nthis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tWhat I am getting at, is the difference between a function =\r\n\n&gt; mapping, \n&gt; &gt; however complex, and an iterative system.  This difference=\r\n seems \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; me to be a fairly crucial factor in the nature of develop=\r\nmental \n&gt; biology.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tThe reason this difference matters is somethin=\r\ng I touched on \n&gt; before:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/=\r\nmessage/1818\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \talbeit only &quot;touched&quot; on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tI am having s=\r\nome difficulty justifying this position, partly \n&gt; because \n&gt; &gt; I haven&#39;t b=\r\neen near the literature on any of this for over a year, \n&gt; &gt; partly because=\r\n it is quite a deep point about evolvability, and \n&gt; &gt; partly because it is=\r\n by no means proven, intuitive and a \n&gt; quantitative \n&gt; &gt; difference rather=\r\n than a qualitative one, however:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tFIRST let me illustrate the sor=\r\nt of iterative system that I \n&gt; &gt; mean.  What I am referring to is (say) so=\r\nmething like your 4D \n&gt; &gt; connection density function (substrate configurat=\r\nion, I think you \n&gt; &gt; called it).  Some sort of field, probably discretised=\r\n into cells \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; convenience of computation, with some value(s) stor=\r\ned on each cell.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tNOW, the difference in the two approaches is tha=\r\nt using \n&gt; CPPNs, all \n&gt; &gt; we will do is evaluate one function (possibly ve=\r\nry complex) once, \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; each cell in the field.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tBUT for an =\r\niterative approach, we will probably fill the \n&gt; field in \n&gt; &gt; that manner =\r\nas a start state, but after that we will then iterate \n&gt; &gt; over it N times =\r\napplying some sort of rule to update the field on \n&gt; &gt; each pass.  It is th=\r\ne fact that the rules act on the output of \n&gt; &gt; previous stages that gives =\r\nthe system its power.  Rules could be \n&gt; &gt; targeted in various ways and hav=\r\ne various effects, but we can \n&gt; imagine \n&gt; &gt; the general case of recognizi=\r\nng some pattern (either of values in \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; single cell, or else relativ=\r\ne values in a locality of cells) and \n&gt; &gt; changing some values in a cell as=\r\n a result.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tIn BIOLOGY, this equates to real cells.  Every cell co=\r\nntains \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; same genes but not all genes are activated.  The embryo =\r\nstarts \n&gt; with a \n&gt; &gt; simple polarity (up-down) defined by a chemical gradi=\r\nent.  Genes \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; activated at certain places based on the amount of =\r\nchemical and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; gene-products produce other chemicals.  Some chemi=\r\ncals also leak \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; cell to cell.  Thus simple patterns of chemical=\r\ns become more \n&gt; complex \n&gt; &gt; because genes essentially &quot;pattern recognize&quot;=\r\n certain areas in the \n&gt; &gt; organism, and start producing other chemicals in=\r\n response.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tThe power of a system like this is, if (say) the numbe=\r\nr of \n&gt; legs \n&gt; &gt; changes (by changing the number of repeats of a pattern a=\r\nt an \n&gt; early \n&gt; &gt; stage in the process), then the later stages still have =\r\na \n&gt; reasonable \n&gt; &gt; chance of doing something sane even though the basic p=\r\nlan has \n&gt; &gt; changed.  The process that would wire nerves and blood to N le=\r\ngs, \n&gt; &gt; works (almost) as happily with N+2 legs.  This is why two headed \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; snakes are alive (if unfit) but two nosed Boeing 747&#39;s are scrap.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \t[[I have spoken about this before, and in fact I wrote (most \n&gt; of) a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; complex philosophical web-page (called &quot;the Manifesto for Evolving \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Agents&quot;) which went into this in some depth.
