Keep in mind that there are still a few(!) kinks. The Jmdns \npackage doesn&#39;t work too well (sometimes a client will  resolve the \nserver and sometimes it wont - seemingly randomly). If you can&#39;t get \nthe client to work, try stopping it and starting it again.\n\nAnother problem - the server and client don&#39;t like to be stopped with \n^C (or rather - they refuse to die). I haven&#39;t put in correct ^C \nhandlers yet, so you&#39;ll have to suspend the jobs (if you&#39;re using linux \nor OS X) with ^Z and then kill -9 them.\n\nThanks,\nReuben\n\n--\nReuben Grinberg\nreuben.grinberg@...\n(203)436-1156\nTrumbull College\n\nThere is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly \nwhat the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly \ndisappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely \ninexeplicable.
