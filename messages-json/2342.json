So I think I might try and adapt something \nsimilar to the scheme you describe.\n\nBTW are you still evaluating with Tic-Tac-Toe players? I find that more \nsimple and hence faster fitness functions are more conducive for testing \nand experimenting with when developing code. Just a thought.\n\nSeems like good progress is being made anyway. Keep it coming!\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
