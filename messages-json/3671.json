It also was the first learning =\r\nalgorithm of any \ntype that I know of to solve double pole balancing withou=\r\nt velocity \ninputs.  Another thing that was interesting was that Gruau prov=\r\ned in \nhis thesis that the encoding can produce any graph structure, so it =\r\n\nis complete.\n\nHowever, compared to more modern approaches I do not think i=\r\nt is a \ngood choice today.  I think the focus was too much on completeness =\r\n\nand too little on efficiency.  Being complete is not a great \nadvantage if=\r\n it takes too long to find the solution.  In fact, the \nmore important issu=\r\ne is *bias*, i.e. to what kinds of structures is \nany particular indirect e=\r\nncoding biased.  CE seems biased towards \nrigid iterative repreating struct=\r\nures, including hierarchies.  For \nexample, it can solve parity problems of=\r\n arbitrary arity.  That can \nbe impressive, but I don&#39;t believe partity pro=\r\nblems are \nrepresentative of most interesting problems.  CE also seems slow=\r\n in \nterms of # of evaluation to a solution from the reported results.  \n\nA=\r\nll indirect encodings including CPPNs have some kind of bias towards \nprodu=\r\ncing certain kinds of structures.  Usually this bias is good \nfora certain =\r\nlevel fo complexity.  However, at low complexity, you \nmay just want a dire=\r\nct encoding like regular NEAT.  For example, in \npole balancing, there is n=\r\no need for indirect encoding because the \nproblem is small, so NEAT will be=\r\n much faster than CE.\n\nOverall, CE is not in use very much today as far as =\r\nI know and is \nmainly a historical achievement that inspired further work i=\r\nn \nindirect \nencoding.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rafael C.P.&quot; &lt;k=\r\nurama.youko.br@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Stanley, I&#39;d like to know if you&#39;ve analyze=\r\nd the Cellular Encoding \napproach\n&gt; while developing NEAT and what&#39;s your v=\r\niew about Cellular Encoding \nX Direct\n&gt; Encoding, please.\n&gt; Reference:\n&gt; \nh=\r\nttp://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/13526/http:zSzzSzearth.cs.\nttu.e=\r\nduzSz~pyeattzSzpaperszSzgp96.pdf/gruau96comparison.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; Rafael C.P.\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
