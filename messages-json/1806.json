So maybe institutions loose \nmore money? Also, if some of these big players are using AI agents then \nthese agents may themselves have weak points in their strategies that \ncan be indirectly exploited.\n\n&gt;I have a feeling that day traders are more gamblers than intra day\n&gt;traders. The question is if that makes them more or less predictable. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt probably makes them more random, but like I say, there may be some \npopulation dynamics mixed in with the noise.\n\n&gt;Reminds me of a funny fact, most people assume that straight men have more\n&gt;sexual partners, on average, than straight women. This is patently not\n&gt;true (possibly slightly true because there are more women than men). Why\n&gt;MUST it be untrue? Because for each man that has a partner, there&#39;s a\n&gt;woman that has one too.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk this *really is* off topic. All I will say is this - your logic does \nnot take homosexuals into account.\n\nMoving quickly on.... :)\n\n&gt;The reason I mention this is that while your quote is true, the opposite\n&gt;is surely also true, since as money is lost, it&#39;s mostly gained by someone\n&gt;else. On average, day traders come out about even - commission + the\n&gt;general trend. But it&#39;s probably safe to bet that there&#39;s a great herd of\n&gt;losing day traders and a few winning ones. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOn average they may be loosing to city traders, or vice versa.\n\n&gt;Most importantly, there&#39;s more movement in the day market than in the\n&gt;intra day.\n&gt;\nMany smaller movements but not necessarily a larger movement of funds. \nThe main idea to take on board is that inter and intraday trading are \nprobably distinct enough to warrant their treatment as seperate systems \nthat can be exploited in different ways.\n\n&gt;&gt;It depends how you are interpreting your output. You say &gt;0.5 indicates\n&gt;&gt;buy and &lt;0.5 indicates sell. So presumbaly you consider anything within\n&gt;&gt;magnitude 0.5 to be a hold signal? \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry, I meant &gt;=0.5, but _exactly_ 0.5 (with double precision) is a very\n&gt;rare occurance indeed. I don&#39;t have a hold signal, though I might add a\n&gt;band for that. \n&gt;\nAh, that&#39;s what I was getting at, I assumed anything within -0.5 &gt;= x &lt;= \n0.5 would be a hold signal.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, if the system wants to signal hold, it\n&gt;has a parameter for &quot;Currently Owning&quot;, which it can use to hold (strong\n&gt;influence from &quot;Currently Owning&quot; tends to reinforce the current\n&gt;owning/not owning position).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOh ok, so you neywork is really saying - &quot;you should own this&quot;. You can \ntake this signal to mean &#39;buy&#39; if you don&#39;t already own, or &#39;hold&#39; if \nyou do. Is that right? I still think it would be nice to have the \nnetwork give a seperate confidence output, you can then interpret low \nconfidence as an indication for human intervention if you own a lot of \nthat stock - you probably want to sell if you don&#39;t have any confidence \nin what is happening, otherwise you may as well spend the money on \nrandom bets on the horses!\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
