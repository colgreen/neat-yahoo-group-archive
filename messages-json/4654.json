I believe it works, but =\r\ncould do with testing by someone other than me.  If anyone is up for that I=\r\n can let them have the code.  Not sure when I will release this, looking fo=\r\nr a new job as I have been made redundant.  Don&#39;t you just love the global =\r\neconomy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth S=\r\ntanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; JT, is your Java-based HyperNEAT somethi=\r\nng you&#39;d be interested in sharing in general?  There is currently no Java v=\r\nersion of HyperNEAT, so others might be interested as well.  Do you have an=\r\ny experiments working in it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (I understand if it&#39;s not ready for t=\r\nhat but I wanted to at least raise the possibility.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I actually implemented HyperNeat in Java about a year ago. (I had so=\r\nme trouble understanding what to do with ANJI and JNEAT too.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIt was designed to be able to modify the number of hidden layers. It was my=\r\n first Java project and it was unnecessarily complicated. However, a large =\r\nchunk of the code was ported from the original C++ HyperNeat. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s=\r\n reusable with a bit tuning (e.g. not mutating number of layers and their c=\r\nonnection patterns.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want it, I will email you the code=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
