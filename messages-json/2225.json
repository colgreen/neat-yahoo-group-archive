As soon as it\n&gt; becomes recurrent, you have to make a decision about how to order the\n&gt; firing, because there is no &#39;correct&#39; way.  Here&#39;s the gotcha:  When\n&gt; you add topology to an existing network, it may cause you to make a\n&gt; different choice of what order to activate it.  Topology and weights\n&gt; that may have been tuned to a particular firing order may suddenly get\n&gt; fired in a different order, which may cause it to take a huge hit in\n&gt; fitness.  For a discriminator network, that shouldn&#39;t ever be a\n&gt; problem.  For a controller, it may very well present a problem to the\n&gt; evolution of the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; The solution, of course, is to have a deterministic approach to\n&gt; determining firing order that will NOT have any possibility of the\n&gt; addition of new topology changing the firing order of any of the old\n&gt; topology that is not connected to that new topology.  When you have a\n&gt; loop, and you need to determine which path to activate first, you have\n&gt; some choices to make:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. You can&#39;t choose randomly, because that&#39;s not deterministic\n&gt; 2. You could choose to activate the longest path first, but then you\n&gt; run the risk of new topology changing the firing order\n&gt; 3. Or the best option:  Choose based on AGE of the topology.  \n&gt; \n&gt; With option 3, you get a deterministic method of determining firing\n&gt; order that will not be suceptable to the problems that the evolution\n&gt; of new topology might cause.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, that said, it is entirely possible that having such a firing\n&gt; pattern might make a controller network harder to evolve, as you might\n&gt; potentially lose the ability to have a &#39;time delay&#39; circuit.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I were you, I would retain the ability to fire the networks using\n&gt; either method.  Choose the firing-order optimizer for classifier\n&gt; networks, to speed up your evolution, and use the real-time firing\n&gt; method for controllers that need to have time-based processing.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n\n"}}
