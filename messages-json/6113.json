It doesn&#39;t say tha=\r\nt p-values are utterly uninformative, but it does point out a lot of proble=\r\nms with them. \n\n&quot;Utterly informative&quot; was an exaggeration on my part, I&#39;ll =\r\nadmit. :-)\n\n&gt; I do not believe in a magical threshold (e.g. p=3D0.5), so I =\r\nescape most of the criticism of this article. But I do think p-values are i=\r\nmportant. I agree that effect size should also be important=85.but I was un=\r\nder the impression that both are important for different reasons (one does =\r\nnot replace the other because they serve different purposes). This article =\r\nagrees, saying you need both, since effect sizes don&#39;t focus on whether the=\r\n effect is true &quot;in the world&quot;; instead, effect sizes just describe the siz=\r\ne of the effect in the sampe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Do you disagree?\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, most (all?) papers do report effect sizes: =\r\nthey report the mean/median +/- variance/std/stderr for treatment A vs. B, =\r\nas well as a p-value. The effect size is the difference in the averages of =\r\nA & B, no? The problem is that not all papers (in our field, especially) re=\r\nport the p-value in addition, which I (and wikipedia) think they should. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;d be interested to hear why you think p-values are meaningless, and w=\r\nhat you would propose instead to ascertain whether the sample reflects the =\r\ntrue distribution. \n\np-values can be replaced by constructing a 95% confide=\r\nnce interval around the effect size (or 99%, or whatever confidence thresho=\r\nld we prefer) and seeing if the confidence interval overlaps with 0.0. If i=\r\nt overlaps, it is not a significant effect; if it does not overlap, then we=\r\n can claim that there is a significant effect in the treatment.\n\nAlternativ=\r\nely, if you don&#39;t like just showing effect size (or it is inappropriate for=\r\n what you&#39;re plotting), you can construct the 95% confidence interval aroun=\r\nd treatment A and treatment B&#39;s measurements. If they overlap at all, there=\r\n is no significant difference; if they do not overlap at all, then there is=\r\n a significant difference.\n\nThis is why I always plot means and 95% confide=\r\nnce intervals in my manuscripts so it is visually straightforward to compar=\r\ne treatments.\n\n\n&gt; PS. The most worrisome section of this post for me is thi=\r\ns: \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But now suppose we&#39;ve learned our lesson: and so, chastened, we a=\r\nbandon our arbitrary threshold a value and look instead at the exact p valu=\r\ne associated with our predictor variable, as many writers have advocated. A=\r\nnd let&#39;s supposed that it is impressively low, say p =3D 0.00073. We conclu=\r\nde, correctly, that if the null hypothesis were true (which we never really=\r\n believed in the first place) then the data we actually obtained in our sam=\r\nple would have been pretty unlikely. So, following standard practice, we co=\r\nnclude that the probability that the null hypothesis is true is only 0.0007=\r\n3. Right? Wrong. We have confused the probability of the data if you are gi=\r\nven the hypothesis,  P(Data|H0), which is p, with its inverse probability P=\r\n(H0|Data), the probability of the hypothesis if you are given the data, whi=\r\nch is something else entirely. Ironically, we can compute the inverse proba=\r\nbility from the original probability =96 but only if we adopt a Bayesian ap=\r\nproach that allows for &quot;subjective&quot; probabilities. That approach says that =\r\nyou begin the study of some prior belief (expressed as a probability) in a =\r\ngiven hypothesis, and adjust that in light of your new data.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I admit =\r\nthat I do tend to do this: &quot;following standard practice, we conclude that t=\r\nhe probability that the null hypothesis is true is only 0.00073.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d=\r\n be happy to switch to the Bayesian approach, though I don&#39;t know much abou=\r\nt it yet. Do you know of a nice, short, introduction to this paradigm?\n\nI&#39;l=\r\nl admit that the later part of that article I agree less with, and I haven&#39;=\r\nt &quot;bought into&quot; Bayesian statistics yet. Especially since in EC/ALife, we a=\r\nre rarely building off of another person&#39;s data set (the posterior distribu=\r\ntion) to further test a hypothesis. As such, I could not do any better than=\r\n a Google search for recommending introductory literature. :-)\n\nCheers,\nRan=\r\ndy\n\n\n"}}
