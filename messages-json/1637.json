That has recently popped up in ES as well,\n&gt;&gt;though the math behind it is not simple at all.\n\n&gt;But that is a step away from the basis of an evolutionary search and\n&gt;towards a gradient-based method.  Gradient-based methods are\n&gt;well-established and the choice for many problems, but they have certain\n&gt;weaknesses which evolutionary methods address... IMHO, that is.\n\nBasically, I was saying what you were saying...that this takes us one\nstep closer to back-propagation / gradient-based methods.\n\nAnd that perhaps we might learn from both the successes and failures\nof that technique.  But that we would do well do do so conscientiously\nas opposed to re-inventing it in an effort to make improvements to our\ncurrent approach.  Make sense?\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
