It&#39;s only bloat if the added structure doesn&#39;t \n&gt;carry with it proportional performance in fitness.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s as straightforward as that. Take XOR as an example. \nTo solve XOR we need one hidden neuron with incoming connections from \nthe two inputs. NEAT adds that neuron by splitting a connection. If we \ncould now apply some function that highlights redundant structures we \nwould see that the new connection is redundant - since it doesn&#39;t \nactually improve on the parent structure, not until a further mutation \nconnects it to the other input.\n\nPerhaps bloat is not the right word. My point is that some redundant \nstructure is later connected too and made useful, but some will never be \nuseful. We can&#39;t distinguish between what will and what won&#39;t be useful, \nso the concept of a phased search is basically allowing redundant \nstructure to persist for some amount of time, and if it hasn&#39;t been \nincorporated into some useful structure after a certain number of \ngenerations then discard it. Thinking about it, you could achieve the \nsame thing by giving each neuron and connection an age variable and then \nduring a blended run you could only allow deletion on structures that \nhave passed a certain age.\n\nAs NEAT stands, some non-useful structures might persist indefintately \nbecause they happned to be around on a genome that had some other \nimprovements on it that made it very fit. These structures are what I \nwould call bloat - they piggy back on good genomes, slowing them down. \nhmm, but actually I would imagine that these will eventually get their \ndisbale bit set and so will not make it into the ANN&#39;s that are \nevaluated - but they are still in the genomes.\n\n&gt;&gt;A phased search would periodically remove ALL redundancy \n&gt;&gt;from the entire population, thus improving the efficiency of a \n&gt;&gt;search \n&gt;&gt;from a computational expense point of view.  Now you could argue \n&gt;&gt;(Derek \n&gt;&gt;made this  point) that the &#39;trim&#39; phase is going backwards in the \n&gt;&gt;search \n&gt;&gt;space and therefore it will take extra time to work back forwards \n&gt;&gt;again.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s not exactly what I was arguing.  I was saying that if you do \n&gt;two phases, only-complexifying followed by only-simplifying, that&#39;s \n&gt;going to be less efficient than using both dynamics in the first \n&gt;place.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI honestly can&#39;t make a my mind up on this one. Conceptually I like the \nidea of trimming away all non-functional structures and cleanly \nre-starting the search, but whether it would actually be an improvement, \nor even a good idea I don&#39;t know.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I believe that allowing the population to complexify/bloat \n&gt;&gt;unbounded is \n&gt;&gt;a very important part of the NEAT search process, but that it \n&gt;&gt;becomes \n&gt;&gt;detremental in medium to long searches. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t think allowing liberal additions to the network at any stage \n&gt;is very useful.  The whole philosophy of NEAT is that innovations \n&gt;are added incrementally, and verified for usefulness along the way. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBut not verified immediately,  if you did that you would only ever solve \nvery simple problems.\n\n&gt;Again, the best approach would be to never let the junk pile up in \n&gt;the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt;It seems intuitive that it&#39;s going to take longer to let junk pile \n&gt;up and then clean it out, rather than never allowing it to pile up.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBut some junk may be a precursor to building some larger useful structure.\n\n&gt;&gt;Get the search technique right/optimized first and THEN \n&gt;&gt;optimize the nuts and bolts code. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d probably agree that optimizing the search is more important in \n&gt;general than optimizing code...but they&#39;re both important.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAgreed. There&#39;s no harm in working on two fronts.\n\n\nOne more thing I was thinking about while I&#39;m here... I think there is \none type of &#39;bloat&#39; that single neuron/connection deletion doesn&#39;t \ntackle and that is connection chaining. Say a connection is performing a \nuseful role and then we split it several times so that we have a long \nchain of neurons, but from a functional perspective it is just doing the \njob of a single connection. If you remove any one neuron/connection then \nyou break the network&#39;s functionality. But if we were to intelligently \neliminate neurons by shifting their connections to the source or target \nneuron then we could elmininate this kind of chain. Again though this \nsort of chain may form the basis of a future good structure so we \nwouldn&#39;t want to do this too aggresively - hence again my thinking that \na phased search might work quite well.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
