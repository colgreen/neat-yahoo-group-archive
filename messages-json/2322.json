As you say, it can be necessary just to protect against \nother people doing it.\n\n\tI think my problem might be one of the difference between broad \nconcepts and fine details.\n\n\te.g. the broad concept of continuous NEAT is to my mind obvious.  In \nfact, I think about the third thing I thought when I first read your \npaper (after &quot;now how does this work?&quot; and &quot;that is clever!&quot;) was &quot;if \nI did this, I would do it continuously&quot;.\n\n\tAnd many of the ideas involved in doing that, are very obvious and \nalso not specific to NEAT:\n\n- replacing one unfit individual at a time\n- picking fit parents\n- minimum life if required\n\n\tSo I would be very uncomfortable if the patent tried to cover any of \nthese basic concepts.\n\n\tOTOH, the devil is in the details, and so also is the hard work and \nthe place where a person&#39;s talents most show.  So I would never wish \nto stop you protecting your investment in that.\n\n--\n\n\tThe other side of this is that not everything discussed is clearly \nproperty of one or other individual....\n\n\te.g. arbitrary labels, I invented those!  I distinctly remember it \nwas about 10 years ago and I wanted them for GP at the time....\n\n\tEqually, I completely believe Colin used a version of them in one of \nhis old projects...\n\n\tAnd that you (Ken) came up with them in the context you were \ndescribing yesterday...\n\n\tSo, until about 2 months ago all three of us genuinely believed we \nhad a novel, unique and useful invention there.  And either one of us \nmight have patented it, to the horror of the others....\n\n\t...but that&#39;s to do with the nature of patent and nothing we can control :)\n\n--\n\n\tAnyway, you have clarified the situation a lot an reassured me \nsomewhat, but can you briefly tell us what is and isn&#39;t covered by the patent?\n\n\tIs this patent only in the US?\n\n\tIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
