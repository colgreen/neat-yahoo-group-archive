I did a run overnight and started another one this\nmorning, neither of these two runs has found a solution yet. So the\nbest answer I can give right now is that it takes a non-trivial amount\nof time on average - we&#39;re talking 1+ days of CPU time with SharpNEAT,\nthe run I&#39;m doing now is at 5.5M evaluations and 7000 generations.\n\nI use a population of 1000, the target number of species is between 40\nand 50. The activation function is SharpNEAT&#39;s default, the &#39;Steepened\nSigmoid&#39;:\n\ny = 1/(1+exp(-4.9*x))\n\n\nRegarding Mono - last time I tried it with SharpNEAT it was a\nstraightforward and painless exercise. Just type &#39;mono SharpNEAT.exe&#39;\nat the command line. I think there was a bug or two in the GUI as I\nclicked around but it was essentially all working fine without any\nmessing about.\n\nHope that helps, I&#39;ll post again with an update from the current run.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
