With each, I could see some potential areas of\nimprovement \n&gt; over the original research.  One of which is network topology, for\nwhich \n&gt; NEAT is a good match.\n&gt; \n&gt; My plan is to do some detailed statistical analysis of natural\nphotos and to \n&gt; cull out some good, representative training data to use in\nconjunction with \n&gt; NEAT to try and construct a high-quality adaptive image enlargement\nengine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, being a total newbie to neural nets and NEAT in particular, I\nmay have \n&gt; some questions.  I&#39;ll do my best to figure stuff out on my own, but\nif I get \n&gt; stuck, can I ask for help? :)\n&gt; \n\nBy all means, and other people here may also be able to help you.  Can\nyou say a little about what&#39;s involved in image enlargement (i.e. how\nit works)?  It may give some insight into the way you should approach\nit with NEAT.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
