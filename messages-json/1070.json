What I would suggest is slowly\nscaling up to your goal.  First, just learn how to use NEAT by\ndownloading a version you like and playing with it.  Then maybe try\naltering an expriment to see how things change.  Then you can think\nabout designing your own experiment.  You may want to start with a\nreally simple one, such as one wolf and one rabbit, and move up in\ncomplexity.  Have you seen my robot duel experiments?  They are\nsomewhat related to the kind of thing you are talking about (i.e.\npredator/prey/food situations):\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pages/research/neatdemo.html\n\nAnyway, what I would suggest is getting started just by using NEAT and\nseeing what problems come up.  That will help you discover the\nspecific questions you will need answered to accomplish your goal,\nwhich you can then ask the group.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new to neural networks, NEAT, and even computer science (only \n&gt; matlab experience). Anyway, I want to make a biological system of \n&gt; wolves and rabbits and I thought it&#39;d be cool if each agent had \n&gt; a &quot;brain&quot; to guide its movement and if their brain evolved with\ntime. \n&gt; Wolves eat rabbits, rabbits eat grass, they have to go find it, if \n&gt; they don&#39;t, they die, etc. As I said, I&#39;m very new to this so any \n&gt; advice or referrals would be great. I&#39;m here to learn as much as I \n&gt; can without being a burden. Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Timmy\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s. also please tell me if i&#39;m way over my head with this site. \n&gt; thanks\n\n\n"}}
