Maybe we should have spelled that out better.\n\n&gt; Also,\n&gt; it would be beneficial to have some discussion of cases (such as S3,\n&gt; I believe) where the match % was bad.  What did those shapes or\n&gt; orientations look like and why did it fail on them?\n\nYou&#39;re probably right.  There wasn&#39;t a discussion of the behavior of\nindividuals from unsuccessful runs.  The shape randomization works the\nsame for all runs, so it was simply the case that in about 1 out of 3\nruns, the population did not evolve to perform well on the task.\n\n&gt; Anyway, I think it&#39;s really good work and a great start for this\n&gt; kind of research.  It&#39;s interesting that you don&#39;t need all the\n&gt; possible transformations to be able to succeed.  Of course, they may\n&gt; still offer advantages for more complex images.\n\nYeah.  Our next step is to be able to easily and consistently solve\nthe task in the paper.  If we can&#39;t get 100% on shapes, we&#39;re going to\nhave a hard time with more complex images.\n\n&gt; I wonder how good these would be at finding a particular shape in a\n&gt; crowded picture of shapes.  The ones you described that search by\n&gt; just going to one corner sound like they wouldn&#39;t be that good at a\n&gt; general &quot;find the shape&quot; task, but maybe if the task was explicitly\n&gt; to search they would evolve scanning strategies?\n\nYes, it would be interesting do apply this paradigm to object\ndetection in noisy images.  That obviously has a lot of real-world\napplications, too.  Right now our focus is on\nrecognition/discrimination, but I&#39;d definitely like to see how this\nperforms at related tasks.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
