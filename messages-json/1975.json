I&#39;ve\nbeen re-reading your posts several times now, exploring the Internet\nfor information on Unis and thinking long and hard about my future. \nAfter all this, besides getting a headache, I have come up with a few\nkey points:\n\n(1) I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m &quot;qualified&quot; to enter into a PhD programme at\nthe moment.  More than anything else this is because I am not really\nsure what&#39;s involved in getting accepted.  I find that concrete\ninformation can be difficult to find on Universities&#39; websites.  From\nmy limited exposure to the entry requirements, I have noticed that\napplicants are required to write comprehensive essays and give\ndiscussions on their interested topic, including its history.  I do\nfeel that my enthusiasm is at about 1000%, after engrossing myself in\nthe subject for the last year, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d live up to the\nPhD entry standards.\n\nFurthermore, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it seems that if I&#39;m\ninterested in pursuing a PhD at a particular University, it is on me\nto: (a) come up with a project idea, (b) email the appropriate person,\n(c) convince them to fund me while I do the work at their institution.\n While I certainly have the enthusiasm and the drive to accomplish\nsuch a feat, I wonder if I would be successful after only 0.5 years of\nexperience in the subject itself.  I find it difficult to know who\nexactly to ask in a Uni such specific questions and I don&#39;t want to\nbother the department heads if I don&#39;t need to.\n\n(2) Unfortunately, as I&#39;m sure you can all tell, this whole process is\nbeing rushed quite severely as I would like to continue studying ASAP\nand not take too long of a break in between.  Of course, I need to\nbalance this with finding the right institution, which may prove\ndifficult.  That being said, it appears that most of the North\nAmerican Universities stopped accepting MSc applications several\nmonths ago.\n\n(3) Does anyone know of any Universities in Canada that are doing work\nin the fields being discussed here?  I&#39;ve looked myself and come up\nempty handed.  I&#39;ve also emailed the CompSci departments at Waterloo\nand UofT to get their opinion, but have yet to hear back.\n\n(4) Right, more opinions needed.  I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m VERY keen to do\na PhD at UCF once Ken gets settled and gets the department up and\nrunning.  In the mean time, the University of Sussex&#39;s &quot;Evolutionary\nand Adaptive Systems&#39; MSc programme looks absolutely perfect for where\nI am right now.  My thinking is that the extra year of intensive NE\nwork should provide me with a more thorough background in NE (and\nrelated subjects) and thus perhaps get me into these surely\ncompetitive programmes.  What do you guys think?  Is that overkill or\ndoes it seem like a reasonable plan?\n\nOnce again, thanks to everyone for helping me out here.\n\nSincerely,\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
