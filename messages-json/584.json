On one\nhalf, we learn the game where ones are initial, and zeros are played by\nthe NN, and on the other half, zeros are initial, etc. However, along the\nborder, we could get something like this:\n\n- - - - -\n- - - - -\n- 0 * * *\n* 1 * * *\n* * * * *\n\nWhere the NN played both the 0, and the 1. Then, by the normal game\nscoring method, there would be a point generated, because a 0 is next to a\none. This is an erroneous point, i.e. the NN is not learning to capture\npre-existing stones, instead, it is learning to capture its own stones.\nThis just results from the &quot;split-game&quot; hack that I used to promote\nmodularization. So, &quot;split-game&quot; dynamics just refers to avoiding this by\ntreating the two halves as separate and not touching.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m extremely interested in indirect encoding in the\n&gt; context of NEAT.  We have some ideas about various\n&gt; approaches to take, and at some point we&#39;d probably\n&gt; like to do a comparison with standard NEAT, as well as\n&gt; your approach to modularity.  Is the code available\n&gt; somewhere now?\n\nNo the code isn&#39;t available yet. Its not particularly clean, or well\ndocumented, and I don&#39;t have a lot of time to make it so now (I will\nprobably over the summer if there is enough interest). If you need it\nbefore then, I can send it to you, and I can go over some of the\nimplementation quirks with you. Otherwise just keep poking me and I&#39;ll\nmake a public release.\n\nI&#39;m also very interested in an indirect encoding using NEAT, so I&#39;d\ndefinitely like to see the results of such a comparison.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
