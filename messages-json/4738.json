I agree  that step 2 is the more open. Int=\r\nuitively, I prefer the interleaving approach as you do, so I&#39;ll try that fi=\r\nrst. \n\nAs to developing a controller modularly or monolithically,  I hadn&#39;t=\r\n considered the monolithic approach yet, and it bears thinking about. My in=\r\ntuition (I have liottle more to go on right now) is that  keeping them sepa=\r\nrate may promote a CPPN for scaleable morphologies (e.g., spiders with legs=\r\n of varying length) - that would be very nice to have. Also, a modular appr=\r\noach might adapt controllers more easily when body shapes change. On the ot=\r\nher hand, it&#39;s just intuition and the same may be true for the monolithic a=\r\npproach. Hmmm....sounds like a little project right there. See if I can fin=\r\nd a Masters student somewhere ;)\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Sta=\r\nnley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Evert, sounds like a great project.  I thin=\r\nk there is enough precedent for step 1 that it could be realistically achie=\r\nved.  Of course, step 2 is more speculative.\n&gt; \n&gt; For step 1, my question i=\r\ns whether it is necessary to regard the individual robots that make up the =\r\nfull organism as being separate for the purposes of evolving the controller=\r\n?  That is, would it not work to simply regard it as a single whole and ign=\r\nore the individual separations?  That way you could just evolve one monolit=\r\nhic controller for the assembly.\nHowever, I can imagine that it might not b=\r\ne possible to do that depending on your communication constraints.  In any =\r\ncase, HyperNEAT can represent it either way.  If the identity of each robot=\r\n matters, you can certainly input the location along the organism to the CP=\r\nPN as additional information, and that could indeed be helpful.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Step=\r\n 2 (evolving the morphology) sounds very interesting butis a much more open=\r\n problem.  I think interleaving might be more effective than simply doing a=\r\n meta-search in which every potential morphology is evaluated through an en=\r\ntire evolution run to find a controller for it.  That sounds very expensive=\r\n.  After all, in nature both brain and body evolve together so presumably i=\r\nt can happen here too.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the representation of the morphology (i=\r\n.e. how it is translated from the CPPN output) will be very critical and de=\r\nserves careful thought. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;eve=\r\nrtwh2004&quot; &lt;evert@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am involved in a modul=\r\nar robotics project (www.symbrion.eu), where we are developing robots that =\r\ncan hook onto each other to create &#39;organisms&#39; that consist of linked robot=\r\ns. The robots can manipulate the link(s), e.g., to lift each other. Recentl=\r\ny, Jeff Clune (hi Jeff) introduced me to hyperNEAT, and it looks like just =\r\nthe ticket to address two issues that we have to tackle. So here I am, exci=\r\nted newbie and all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, I want to try and use hyperNEAT to evol=\r\nve gaits for organisms with pre-defined shapes (e.g., spiders, snakes). The=\r\n idea is to develop a single genome that determines the weights for neural =\r\nnets in each of the individual robots that make up the organism, so I would=\r\n expect to pass the coordinates of nodes within the individual NN, but also=\r\n about the location of the individual in the organism (possibly related to =\r\nsome central node or whatever).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The next step will be to use hyper=\r\nNEAT&#39;s CPPNs to evolve morphologies for organisms. I&#39;m thinking of a 3D gri=\r\nd where the CPPN assigns some value to each cell which defines, according t=\r\no some threshold, whether a robot goes in that spot or not. The fitness of =\r\nthe CPPN would be the level of success in evolving a gait for the resulting=\r\n shape as described above. Another method of combining morphology and gait =\r\ndevelopment would be to interleave them in some way (waves hands).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n So...does that sound like a good plan, are there any pointers to related w=\r\nork? Do&#39;s and don&#39;ts? Expressions of interest, ridicule or awe?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TI=\r\nA,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evert Haasdijk\n&gt; &gt; VU Amsterdam\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
