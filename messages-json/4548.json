Ther=\r\ne are a few issues raised and I&#39;ll\n&gt; try to cover all of them. Apologies fo=\r\nr the length of the post.\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly I did of course mean tabu search - e=\r\nasily confused terms I\n&gt; think you&#39;ll agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some general themes then:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Speciating by comparing new genomes (I call them offspring from\n&gt; =\r\nhere) with each species in turn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally I like this, but there are =\r\nsome potential side effects I&#39;m\n&gt; unsure about. e.g. if the species overlap=\r\n in the encoding space then\n&gt; any offspring that exist in an overlapping re=\r\ngion will always get\n&gt; assigned to the species that comes first, this leave=\r\ns an empty bite\n&gt; shaped region (a crecent shape in 2D space) in the second=\r\n species.\n&gt; Ultimately you might end up where the two regions are almost ex=\r\nactly\n&gt; the same (the exemplars are very close) and so the genomes in the\n&gt;=\r\n second species are all in a very thin cresent formation. In fact you\n&gt; mig=\r\nht have several species where each one is a cresent shape on the\n&gt; edge of =\r\nthe previous one.\n&gt; \n&gt; This in turn might affect some of our other mechanis=\r\nms. e.g. if\n&gt; species number 2&#39;s genomes are as fit as number 1&#39;s then we e=\r\nxpect\n&gt; them to contain about the same number of genomes (through fitness\n&gt;=\r\n sharing), but in fact most of species 2&#39;s offspring end up in the\n&gt; first =\r\nspecies. Later on (in sharpneat at least) we might take N% of\n&gt; the best ge=\r\nnomes in each species as the parents for the next\n&gt; generation, but because=\r\n the total number in each species has been\n&gt; distorted, that N% is similarl=\r\ny distorted - thus species 2 is\n&gt; potentially (depending how you make the c=\r\nalculations)\n&gt; under-represented as a parent for the next generation of off=\r\nspring.\n&gt; \n&gt; The explicit clustering algorithm I described is in fact calle=\r\nd\n&gt; k-means clustering. So if we use k-means (or some other standard\n&gt; appr=\r\noach) as a way of dividing our genomes into clusters before we\n&gt; start the =\r\nmain NEAT loop running we lessen the problem of overlapping\n&gt; regions betwe=\r\nen species. We can still use the same speciation\n&gt; technique in the main lo=\r\nop and perhaps periodically re-speciate using\n&gt; k-means if we think overlap=\r\n is occuring, if there is some easy way of\n&gt; detecting the amount of overla=\r\np.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) In sharpneat v1 I actually test offspring against their parent\n&gt;=\r\n species first (note. there are two parent species in cross species\n&gt; breed=\r\ning, but normally only one), and *then* test against every other\n&gt; species =\r\nin turn. I didn&#39;t properly consider what this means when I\n&gt; wrote the code=\r\n. Firstly it means performance is improved because most\n&gt; offspring will in=\r\n fact be placed in their parent&#39;s species, thus no\n&gt; further comparisons ar=\r\ne necessary. However it introduces the\n&gt; possibility (likelihood?) of speci=\r\nes overlapping to a large degree,\n&gt; they could even represent the exact sam=\r\ne region in the encoding space.\n&gt; Ultimately they may drift apart but in th=\r\ne mean time they are both\n&gt; searching the same fitness space which is preci=\r\nsely what speciation is\n&gt; trying to avoid.  Potentially all species could a=\r\nll get stuck on some\n&gt; local maximum (=3D bad).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So at this point a =\r\nbetter strategy than both mine and Ken&#39;s is to use\n&gt; Ken&#39;s approach of comp=\r\naring species in turn (with the species in a\n&gt; fixed order between generati=\r\nons) but to avoid cresent shaped species\n&gt; (if indeed that is what happens)=\r\n by using k-means at the outset and\n&gt; periodically, e.g. when the species c=\r\nount goes outside of some limits\n&gt; or every N generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Petar, r=\r\negarding your suggestion about creating a representative\n&gt; genome for each =\r\nspecies. This is potentially equivalent to calculating\n&gt; the center center =\r\nof the region in space defined by the genomes, in\n&gt; fact if you average the=\r\n weight of connections with the same ID you\n&gt; calculate the center of mass =\r\nof the genomes. So in 2D the exemplar is\n&gt; currently in the center of a cir=\r\ncle, but the bulk of the other genomes\n&gt; may be clustered around one edge o=\r\nf the circle (because of some local\n&gt; maximum say), thus the center of &#39;mas=\r\ns&#39; is in fact not in the center\n&gt; but somewhere towards (or within) the clu=\r\nster. So ff we did anchor our\n&gt; species for their lifetime this would becom=\r\ne far more likely.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW this center of mass of genomes is effectively w=\r\nhat k-means\n&gt; clustering is doing, we calculate the average distance from e=\r\nach\n&gt; genome in a cluster; for each cluster; and assign a genome to the\n&gt; c=\r\nluster it is nearest to - that is, it gets assigned to the cluster\n&gt; whose =\r\n*center of mass* is closest. We could calculate the center of\n&gt; mass direct=\r\nly to reduce the number of comparisons we make, but there\n&gt; are some reason=\r\ns not to - (A) Whenever we re-assign a genome from one\n&gt; cluster to another=\r\n we move the center of mass of both of those\n&gt; clusters, thus they would ne=\r\ned recalculating (although you could avoid\n&gt; recalculating right way). And =\r\n(B) Calculating the center of mass\n&gt; requires us to to define a coordinate =\r\nsystem, which admitedly would be\n&gt; easy, it&#39;s just an array of numbers. But=\r\n it&#39;s even easier to plug in a\n&gt; function that take two genomes and returns=\r\n the distance between them\n&gt; as a single number. The function effectively d=\r\nefines a distance metric\n&gt; and we can plug in and try alternative distance =\r\nmetrics (euclidean,\n&gt; manhattan, kens original [I&#39;m calling it ken&#39;s canoni=\r\ncal distance\n&gt; metric :) ] )\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Anchoring of species. I think if we we=\r\nre to try tabu search we\n&gt; would need to anchor the species. Otherwise if a=\r\n species drifts then\n&gt; we have only partially searched some regions and we =\r\nneed some means of\n&gt; recording that information. What you end of with is a =\r\nsort of density\n&gt; map of the search space where density represents how much=\r\n searching\n&gt; has occured in a given region. It&#39;s just a lot simpler if the =\r\nsearch\n&gt; regions are fixed/distinct chunks of space that we flag as being\n&gt;=\r\n search or not searched (not exhaustively searched, but enough that we\n&gt; de=\r\ncided to move on). There is still a problem in that as the compat.\n&gt; thresh=\r\nold varies the radius of each species/region is changing - so\n&gt; they&#39;re not=\r\n actually fixed chunks but varying in size.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see the pros of allo=\r\nwing species to drift; following the species\n&gt; champ. But maybe it&#39;s not so=\r\n bad to acnhor. What might happen is that\n&gt; as genome smove towards some fi=\r\ntter space they end up on the edge of\n&gt; the species/region they are in. Now=\r\n their offspring are outside the\n&gt; region, they form a new species because =\r\nthey are not close enough to\n&gt; an existing one.  If we now re-speciate usin=\r\ng k-means (rather than the\n&gt; current approach of increasing the compat. thr=\r\neshold) then the new/fit\n&gt; cluster will form a new species with a new ancho=\r\nr, the old\n&gt; species/regions are thrown away completely. \n&gt; \n&gt; The idea nee=\r\nds a bit of work/thought but I think it might work. So in\n&gt; conclusion k-me=\r\nans clustering potentially gives you less species\n&gt; overlap (in sharpneat&#39;s=\r\n case) or less cresent shaped species with a\n&gt; distorted size relative to t=\r\nheir fitness (in Ken&#39;s case). And along\n&gt; with anchored species exemplars i=\r\nt gives you an easy(er) way if doing\n&gt; tabu search.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
