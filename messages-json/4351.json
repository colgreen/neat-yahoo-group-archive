I think your question is an\ninteresting one, but I do not think it affords an easy general answer. My\nguess is that the result of combining the evolution of mutation rates with\ndiversity preservation would depend highly on the particulars of the\nimplementation. \n\nImagine a population on a local peak. My work shows that there is a strong\npressure to lower the mutation rate in the absence of a diversity preserving\nmechanism.  A diversity mechanism would effectively give a fitness boost for\norganisms that were different from the current population, and the only way\nto obtain that is to have a higher mutation rate. So, there would be a short\nterm increase in the mutation rate *if* the fitness boost from the diversity\npromotion mechanism was stronger than the pressure to lower rates.\n\nBut even if the diversity pressure is strong enough to overcome the pressure\nto reduce mutation rates, what happens soon thereafter? Imagine that\norganisms find a couple other local peaks, say one peak per species. Now the\ndiversity preservation mechanism will become watered down, since there is a\nhealthy amount of diversity, but the mutation rate pressure will floor the\nrate and the population will become permanently trapped on those various\nlocal peaks. Again, a different diversity mechanism might overcome this\nproblem...but you can see that it will require a lot of tweaking because you\nhave these opposing forces.\n\nBut, more importantly, what good is the evolution of the mutation rate doing\nfor you? I don&#39;t see it helping much, since it is only trying to run up the\nside of the current fitness hill and then zero out the rate. I don&#39;t know\nthat we want a pressure like that in the mix if our goal is long-term\nadaptation. \n\nI should note that I began this research with a similar goal: using\nsomething from evolution to help evolution evolve good mutation rates. In my\ncase, I thought that group selection would cause the evolution of mutation\nrates that were good for the group&#39;s long-term goals at the expense of the\nindividual member&#39;s short-term goals. I was able to show, as theory\npredicts, that group selection can bring about the evolution of altruism.\nBut it turned out that no matter how hard I tried I could never overcome the\ndownward pressure on mutation rates. It is very strong. That is why my\ninstincts tell me that it would be hard to get the diversity mechanism to\novercome this downward pressure in an elegant and productive way.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIn any case, it is worth a shot if you want to test it out. If you do, I\nwould be very interested in the results.\n\nCheers, Jeff\n\n\n\n"}}
