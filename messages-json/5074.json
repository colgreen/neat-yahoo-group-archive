However=\r\n, there is research that looks at the issue in more rigorous detail.  For e=\r\nxample, Shimon Whiteson&#39;s paper, &quot;Critical factors in the empirical perform=\r\nance of temporal difference and evolutionary methods for reinforcement lear=\r\nning,&quot; is an excellent study of the effect of nondeterminism and other fact=\r\nors on NEAT and SARSA (a value-function-based reinforcement learning algori=\r\nthm):\n\nhttp://staff.science.uva.nl/~whiteson/pubs/whitesonjaamas09.pdf\n\nIn =\r\nparticular look at figures 9 and 15.  In figure 9, NEAT rises to a fitness =\r\nof 14 seconds hold time in the traditional nondeterministic Keepaway soccer=\r\n task.  This figure is actually good, and does better than SARSA at 12.\n\nBu=\r\nt in figure 15, in a deterministic version of the task, NEAT rises to an am=\r\nazing 200 seconds of hold time!  SARSA on the other hand only rises to abou=\r\nt 25 seconds.\n\nSo I think we have to be careful with analyzing the &quot;problem=\r\n&quot; of nondeterminism.  In fact, NEAT is still working relatively well with i=\r\nt, when compared to other (non-evolutionary) algorithms.  Yet when the nond=\r\neterminism is taken away, NEAT is unstoppable, as if it were unleashed.  Th=\r\ne story is more that determinism is a powerful grease on the wheels of evol=\r\nution, rather than that nondeterminism is cataclysmic.  (It is also importa=\r\nnt to note that the genome that achieves 200 seconds may not be better in g=\r\neneral than the one that achieves 14 - I don&#39;t think Shimon tested both of =\r\nthem in a nondeterministic scenario to find out.)\n\nPersonally, I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk natural evolution handles noise any better.  Great people constantly die =\r\nyoung, which of course is absolutely deplorable and can hardly be &quot;good&quot; fo=\r\nr evolution, unless one takes the circular view that anything natural evolu=\r\ntion does is what it&#39;s supposed to do.  (That is, if someone died, that mus=\r\nt be good because they weren&#39;t fit enough.)  I think a more reasonable inte=\r\nrpretation is that natural evolution succeeded despite being handicapped by=\r\n noise rather than because it handles it in some elusive way.  If we could =\r\ngive everyone in nature a fair shake, the whole thing would probably go a l=\r\not faster and smoother.\n\nI would guess that this phenomenon is very general=\r\n.  The more noise, the more chaotic evolution becomes.  Of course, there ar=\r\ne happy mediums.  Sometimes a little noise can help achieve generality at t=\r\nhe cost of many evaluations.  Yet if it can be avoided somehow by being mor=\r\ne clever about being deterministic then it should.\n\nI do view it as a resea=\r\nrch challenge.  I am not a big fan of noise because of its deleterious effe=\r\ncts and indeed &quot;deterministic noise&quot; is often better, but I believe there m=\r\nay be even better ways to get the generality you want without the cost of n=\r\noise, and I consider it an interesting research question.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your th=\r\noughts on this Ken.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a shame that non-deterministic fitness has su=\r\nch an adverse effect here,\n&gt; given that many real problems are noisy, and t=\r\nhat natural evolution handles\n&gt; a ton of noise.

In a stagnant situation, you do not have information (i.e. a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; gradient) suggesting which direction is right to go.  Therefore, the mo=\r\nst\n&gt; &gt; principled response is to expand your options while never putting al=\r\nl your\n&gt; &gt; eggs in one basket.  When fitness is stagnant, we cannot know if=\r\n further\n&gt; &gt; search within the currently dimensionality might eventually fi=\r\nnd a solution,\n&gt; &gt; or if the current dimensionality is insufficient and con=\r\ntains no solution at\n&gt; &gt; all.  In the latter case, the number of nodes and =\r\nconnections would need to\n&gt; &gt; ascend to higher dimensionality.  Because we =\r\ndo not know which case we are in\n&gt; &gt; when stagnation occurs, the best idea =\r\nis to try both:  Some species start\n&gt; &gt; arriving with bigger networks while=\r\n others keep searching in the same old\n&gt; &gt; spaces.  Thus, we would expect t=\r\nhe *range* of sizes to increase along with the\n&gt; &gt; average size.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Your situation with nondeterminism is probably somewhat similar, causing t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; average size of solutions to go up because of stagnation.  However, =\r\nbecause\n&gt; &gt; the champion will keep changing with the randomized evaluation,=\r\n you will\n&gt; &gt; observe this phenomenon in the champion itself.  The more noi=\r\nsy it is, the\n&gt; &gt; more it is probably observable (i.e. because the more &quot;ra=\r\nndom&quot; it is who\n&gt; &gt; happens to look best at any given time, in effect leadi=\r\nng to a kind of\n&gt; &gt; sampling of the population through the champion).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Of course, that may not be a complete explanation for the steep angle o=\r\nf the\n&gt; &gt; incline.  I would guess that nondeterminism is also causing a gen=\r\neral\n&gt; &gt; unhealthiness about the evolutionary process overall. Nondetermini=\r\nsm is highly\n&gt; &gt; destructive to evolutionary algorithms.  This issue is con=\r\ntroversial (even\n&gt; &gt; within my own group!) but my personal opinion is one s=\r\nhould avoid\n&gt; &gt; nondeterminism unless it is absolutely essential.  For exam=\r\nple, you can choose\n&gt; &gt; a random order of examples but then subject everyon=\r\ne to the same random set -\n&gt; &gt; a kind of &quot;deterministic randomness.&quot;  Of co=\r\nurse, you are banking on the\n&gt; &gt; impartiality of randomness to give you max=\r\nimal generality, but it will often\n&gt; &gt; be outweighed by its unhealthy side =\r\neffects on the population.  So I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; guessing that part of the phenomenon=\r\n is just a side-effect of an inconsistent\n&gt; &gt; evaluation scheme leading to =\r\nrelative chaos.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There may also be more to it; it merits further in=\r\nvestigation as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello Ken-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am p=\r\nlotting the number of CPPN nodes in the generation champion.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thi=\r\ns fitness function is not deterministic (here I am running the bit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mir=\r\nroring problem, and I randomly generate 10 different sets of inputs per\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; organism per generation).

If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the s=\r\name champion stick around\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new=\r\n individuals occasionally come in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with the same fitness as the champi=\r\non, but it would be very surprising if\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is happening on eve=\r\nry single generation.  Yet that would seem to be the only\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; possibility=\r\n with the number of champion nodes going up so rapidly even while\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fit=\r\nness is flatlined.
