I am writing my Master Thesis with my\ngood friend Mathias who is also a student here ;-). As you probably\nalready noticed this thesis is about poker (Texas Hold&#39;em) and GAs.\n\nThe project is (like many others) inspired by D. Fogels Blondie24 and\nwe would like to see how well we can learn the ANN players to play\npoker without presenting them with explicit expert knowledge about eg.\nhow many better straights exsists than mine (J. Noble does this).\n\nWe have the poker framework and the standard GA with elitism. \n\n\nWe would like for those of you that are interested in our project to\nsee the following implementation details.\n\nThe framework:\nIt is coded in Java and has a couple og interfaces such that we can\nswitch player types between our different ANN players, players based\nprimarily on pot-odds and of course our own &quot;human-player-gui&quot;.\n\nWe just recently discovered NEAT (sadly :-() and yesterday we finished\na new player based on jNEAT. The player ANN takes the following\ninputs:\n\n1 pot / bet\n1 position\n9 player actions this round\n9 player passive / aggressive index\n9 player tight / loose index\n2 suit count (4 or 5 siuted cards)\n2 connector count (4 or 5 connected cards)\n4 card associations (pair, two pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind)\n2 hole cards in use ( are we using 1 or 2 hole cards in our hand?)\n3 game stage (FLOP/TURN/RIVER)\n\nTOTAL: 45 input neurons\n\nWe actually started out with an ANN that had 52 neurons for the cards\nand a constant k it could add to the hole cards (Like the kings in\nBlondie24). But we realised that it would be very had if not\nimpossible for the ANN to &quot;see&quot; the good hands and separate them from\nthe bad ones. Therefore we decided to show the ANN that certain hands\nappeard (or almost appeard in connector / suit count). This also\ndramaticaly reduced the number of inputs.\n\nThe outputs from the ANN are straight forward:\n3 neurons:\nFOLD | CALL | BET/RAISE\n\nThe output neuron that is activated the most is the action we choose\nif it is &quot;legal&quot; at the table otherwise we choose the second most\nactivated and so on.\n\n\nThe fitness of the players:\nWe have experimented with several settings but the best we have right\nnow is this: \n\nThe 50 players play against each other and a pot-odds-player\n(PO-player) - five of each at each table. They play 600 hands but not\nat one table only - we mix them between the tables five times such\nthat they get to meet different individuals from the entire\npopulation.\nThe reason we have the PO-players at each table is for the players to\nbe forced to learn faster and play tighter from the very beginning.\n\nSince we have discovered NEAT we are more open to leaving the\nPO-players and going back to strict competitive co-evolution between\nour own individuals. We also consider expanding the population to\nabout 200. But still the problem is here that the weak players at one\ntable can make only slightly better players at the same table look\nvery strong compared to really strong players actually competing and\nnot winning much at another table. Another option is to make a\ntournament or like Darse Billings [Alberta GAMES group] suggests: Let\neach player take the same position at the table and see who is the\nbest over-all player.\n\nA major concern is the fitness: We have talked about it for hours and\ndays but we always come back to the cash of the player. If we cannot\napply expert knowledge - we cannot think of anything else than the\namount earned after x hands.\n\nWe would like comments on the above and if possible we would like some\nsuggestions or answers to the following questions:\n\n1) Is it possible to achieve results with a 45-&gt;N-&gt;3 ANN in NEAT?\n\n2) Any general comments regarding the population size for the above\nANN?\n\n3) Any parameters we should put in a particular favourable setting?\n\nWe use these settings recommended from a NEAT website:\nHi Everyone\n\nMy name is Lars and I am a student at Department of Computer Science,\nUniversity of Aarhus, Denmark.
