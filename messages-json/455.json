I&#39;m a PhD student at UT (Ken is one of my\nofficemates). Nate Kohl and I have done a lot of research applying\nneuroevolution to the SoccerBots domain over the past couple years.  If\nanyone is planning to work in this domain, they might be interested in\nchecking out our papers on the subject:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/shimon/school.html\n\nWe also have a journal paper (not yet published) that discusses some\ncoevolutionary approaches, which I&#39;d be happy to send to anyone who&#39;s\ninterested.  All this work was done with ESP and not NEAT so obviously its\nrelevance in somewhat limited.  But it does describe the input and output\nrepresentations that we found useful.  It focuses primarily on the issue of\ntask decomposition: how to break a hard task like robot soccer into smaller\npieces that our learning algorithms can tackle.\n\nFrom doing this research I have become convinced that trying to learn\nmonolithic controllers for soccer players is completely infeasible using\ncurrent methods.  I would strongly recommend that anyone who works in this\ndomain consider using some of the decomposition approaches we describe in\nthe papers or even developing your own.\n\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to drop me a line if you want to discuss any\nSoccerbots-related issues.\n\nCheers,\nShimon\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 27, 2004 9:31 AM\nSubject: [neat] Soccerbots\n\n\n&gt; --- German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; My name is German Viscuso and I would like to\n&gt; &gt; introduce myself to the group\n&gt; &gt; members.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi German...welcome to the group. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a degree in Computer Science and I &#39;m now\n&gt; &gt; researching neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; techniques for application in the robotic soccer\n&gt; &gt; domain. I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; hardware?\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; it).\n&gt;\n&gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; forward).\n&gt;\n&gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt;\n&gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt;\n&gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt;\n&gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; interest in this domain.  Anybody else have\n&gt; experiences or thoughts on robot control domains?\n&gt; Robot soccer?
