This does then\n&gt; mean that the eye is must analy=\r\nse what it sees in isolation of what it\n&gt; just saw - e.g. normally it might=\r\n detect patterns larger than the eye\n&gt; itself by sweeping over an area, but=\r\n if we rotate the inputs then we\n&gt; break this kind of approach... unless we=\r\n inform the eye of what rotation\n&gt; it is currently in. Has any of the peopl=\r\ne doing roving eye experiments\n&gt; used this approach of factoring out rotati=\r\nonal invariance?\n\nNo, but it&#39;s on our to-do list. :)\n\nKen of course present=\r\ned a paper last year at GECCO applying the roving\neye technique to 9x9 Go, =\r\nbut his eye did not rotate.  We implemented\nrotation into our eye for use i=\r\nn identifying images with rotational\nvariance...that&#39;s what our paper at GE=\r\nCCO this year was about.  But we\nhaven&#39;t applied it to board games, and wou=\r\nld very much like to.\n\nIt makes an awful lot of sense.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
