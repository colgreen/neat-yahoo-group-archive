The\n&gt; methods I use, if succesful, could theoretically be\n&gt; applied to a real robot, but it would be difficult,\n&gt; because a fairly accurate simulation of the entire\n&gt; real situation is required in order to perform\n&gt; neuroevolution.  Developing this simulation is the\n&gt; difficult part.  We cannot perform neuroevolution in\n&gt; the actual vehicle, but only in a computer simulation.\n\nBy &#39;high-level&#39; task I meant a NN that would receive at it&#39;s inputs \nthe bearing and distance of a target location plus information about \nlocal obstacles. The output of the NN would then be a bearing and \nspeed the vehicle should go in in order to get to the target \nlocation, but avoiding the local obstacles. A model can be built for \nthis task and an NN evolved for it.\n\nThe resultant NN is then fixed, it&#39;s a black box with inputs and \noutputs, no more evolving of the NN is necessary. \n\nWe would then move onto the next task, evolving a NN that receives at \nits inputs a bearing and speed the vehicle should move. It&#39;s outputs \nthen give controls signals for steering and drive motors.\n\nWhen both NNs are ready they can be combined to create a complete \nsystem. Keep in mind this is just an example scenario to explain my \npoint, it&#39;s not meant to be complete!\n\nThe point is that the first &#39;high&#39;level&#39; black box should not require \nany further evolving in order to work in the real world - it can be \nused as it is. \n\nThe other task though would require complex models - e.g. to take \ninto account different surface and terrain types. These sort of \nmodels can never be completely accurate and this does present a major \nproblem for evolving solutions since you need to be able to run many \ntrial runs automatically.\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
