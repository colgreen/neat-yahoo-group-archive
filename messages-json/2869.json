It is very similar to =\r\nthe \nactive vision system in ANJI. I use only the basic generational NEAT \n=\r\nmethods there, no matter that there is realtime code. I expanded the \npacka=\r\nge with CTRNN neurons support and nice visualisation of NNs for \nWindows. \n=\r\n\nI set up the compatibility theshold to be high enough, so that in the \nfir=\r\nst 2-3 generations there will be only one species. But when some \nmutations=\r\n occur and 1-2 new species appear, the first species die and \nthe whole pop=\r\nulation is replaced by the new ones. \n\nI think this is wrong. After some in=\r\nvestigation, I found that in the \nNEAT::Population::epoch(int gen) method, =\r\nthere is code that checks \nfor coevolution stagnation. Something happens an=\r\nd the first species \nget marked as oblitarate. \n\n---- CODE ----\n\n//Flag the=\r\n lowest performing species over age 20 every 30 generations \n//NOTE: THIS I=\r\nS FOR COMPETITIVE COEVOLUTION STAGNATION DETECTION\n\n\tcurspecies=3Dsorted_sp=\r\necies.end();\n\tcurspecies--;\n\twhile((curspecies!=3Dsorted_species.begin())&&=\r\n\n\t\t((*curspecies)-&gt;age&lt;20))\n\t\t--curspecies;\n\tif ((generation%30)=3D=3D0)\n\t\t=\r\n(*curspecies)-&gt;obliterate=3Dtrue;\n\n---- CODE END ----\n\n\nWhen I commented th=\r\nis out, the problem was fixed. My system still \nperforms below expectations=\r\n, but this is something I should tell you.\n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
