Running NEAT on a domain that is not\nco-evol=\r\nutionary, the fitness of an individual will stay the same, and\na good indiv=\r\nidual will continually benefit its species. However, in a\nco-evolutionary d=\r\nomain, the fitness landscape is ever changing, and a\nonce-promising individ=\r\nual may soon be seen as low-fitness with no\nbenefit to its species (this is=\r\n especially true in novelty search). So\nthe bias towards promising genotypi=\r\nc lines seems to be less in novelty\nsearch. This could be a good thing, mea=\r\nning a less greedy search, and\nthe assumption that a certain genotypic line=\r\n is more predisposed to\nleading to novelty may not be warranted. \n\nBut if y=\r\nou use static novelties, then it seems as if species that once\ncreated nove=\r\nlty are continually rewarded, once again biasing the\nsearch towards promisi=\r\nng lineages. If this is an important facet of\nspeciation, then maybe a more=\r\n explicit way of rewarding it would work\nbetter than the ad-hoc static nove=\r\nlties approach (e.g. award a species\na certain bonus in proportion to the h=\r\nighest novelty it has found). I\nam not convinced that this lineage bias is =\r\nimportant, but I think it\nbears further thought.\n\nSo I think there is a dif=\r\nference in the effects of speciation on\nco-evolutionary tasks with highly v=\r\nariable fitness landscapes and on\ntasks with static fitness landscapes, but=\r\n perhaps this is what we do\nwant in those kinds of landscapes.\n\nJoel\n\n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Are the=\r\nse issues regarding speciation in novelty search really any\n&gt; different fro=\r\nm the very same issues in fitness-based search?  I am\n&gt; still thinking abou=\r\nt this issue, but I am not sure they are really\n&gt; different.\n&gt; \n&gt; In NEAT-b=\r\nased novelty search, speciation is still happening as normal.\n&gt;  One thing =\r\nspeciation does in fitness-based search is protect unique\n&gt; individuals who=\r\n may have lower fitness based on the idea that they may\n&gt; take a while to r=\r\neach their potential.  By analogy, in novelty search,\n&gt; the effect is to pr=\r\notect genetically unique individuals who may not be\n&gt; very novel behavioral=\r\nly on the chance that they too may need some time\n&gt; to discover how to do s=\r\nomething novel.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, speciation means less greedy search.  =\r\nIn some cases,\n&gt; of course, being less greedy means being slower (such as w=\r\nhen there is\n&gt; a single global optimum on a giant hill across the entire se=\r\narch\n&gt; space).  In particular, if the most fit (or most novel) individuals\n=\r\n&gt; for whatever reason turn out to be the best jumping-off points for\n&gt; even=\r\n more fit (or more novel) individuals, then the time spent on\n&gt; protected i=\r\nndividuals was &quot;wasted.&quot;  Yet that would not be the case in\n&gt; all domains, =\r\nso to forego such protection is to take a risk in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; It could be=\r\n that in the maze domain a greedier kind of novelty search\n&gt; would be faste=\r\nr.  But would that be true in other domains?  An\n&gt; interesting question is =\r\nthe extent to which novelty search is better\n&gt; served by greediness than fi=\r\ntness-based search.  I am not sure if\n&gt; there is any basis to believe that =\r\nit is.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea of taking species age into account might be interestin=\r\ng, but\n&gt; the question is still why this consideration would matter more or =\r\nless\n&gt; than in fitness-based NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, the way I see speciation i=\r\nnteracting with novelty search is\n&gt; to protect small species that have uniq=\r\nue genotypes even if those do\n&gt; not translate to novel behaviors in the hop=\r\ne that unique genotypes may\n&gt; have the potential to turn into unique behavi=\r\nors if given the chance. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is possible that I am misinterpreting the=\r\n idea that you guys are\n&gt; developing, so please do clarify my comments if t=\r\nhat is the case. \n&gt; Novelty search does challenge a lot of common assumptio=\r\nns about search.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervens=\r\nki&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I believe so.
