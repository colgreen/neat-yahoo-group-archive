Also I found some \n&gt; problems where the modular NEAT =\r\napproach\n&gt; wont be better than NEAT because the results of two or more modu=\r\nles are \n&gt; not used in further calculation.\n&gt; I hope to build a hierarchica=\r\nl hyperNEAT algorithm with a dynamic modul \n&gt; approach which fixes those pr=\r\noblems\n&gt; in my diploma thesis. It will also implement a dynamic substrat \n&gt;=\r\n configuration, so you might want to wait for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robin\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Kenneth \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nikolai, the idea of having a ge=\r\nne encapsulate a number of \n&gt; &gt; components is similar to the idea in Modula=\r\nr NEAT from Joeseph \n&gt; &gt; Reisinger a few years ago:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://nn.c=\r\ns.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco04 \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keywor=\r\nd?reisinger:gecco04&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thanks Ken.\n&gt; &gt; i will try Modular NEAT =\r\ntoo however, and compare it to Hyper NEAT \n&gt; &gt; after that, i think on a big=\r\n cluster working on small problem modular \n&gt; &gt; NEAT could give more quality=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
