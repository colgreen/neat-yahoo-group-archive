E.g. if the outputs are labeled A thru G\n\n    A\n  -----\n  |   |\nB |   | C\n  | D |\n   ---\n  |   |\nE |   | F\n  |   |\n  -----\n    G\n\nThe binary input samples 0010 (deimal 2) and 1100 (decimal 12) should \nboth &quot;turn on&quot; the outputs ACDEG which represents a decimal digital \ndisplay &quot;2&quot;. I.e. the outputs represented as binary should be: 1011101\n\nResults:\nSo far all experiments on the full set of outputs have failed.  It \nalways reaches a local optimum and gets stuck for more than 3000 \ngenerations.  This, in spite of some amazingly complex evolved nets\n\nWhen I run NEAT on a single output at a time (change the topology to \nproduce a single output, representing only one of the LED&#39;s instead \nof all 7), occasionally after hundreds of generations it will find a \nsolution.  Interestingly, some of the single LED attempts converge \nmore quickly averaged over repeated runs, while others (like &quot;D&quot;) \ntake much longer.\n\nI&#39;ve tryed all different kinds of combinations of the NEAT \nparameters, and even tried a different activation function \n(hyperbolic tangent instead of sigmoid) with similar dismal results \non the full set of outputs.\n\nAny ideas?\nThanks,\nKarl\n\n\n"}}
