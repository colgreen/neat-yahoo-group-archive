I have a few intuitions about them which you might\n&gt; &gt;like to argue with:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1) They&#39;re big.  And for any really interesting question (like how to play\n&gt; &gt;chess) they&#39;re not big like the universe is big, they&#39;re _much_ larger than\n&gt; &gt;that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Also, quite often they have a lot more than 3 dimensions.\n\nOh yes, did I not mention that ;-)\n\nBut....  acherly the number of dimensions is a thing that gets fuzzy as the \ncase gets complex.\n\nFor example, consider a human being (you probably have one around the place \nsomewhere).  You can call the human genome a point in a 3,000,000,000 \ndimensional search space.  On the other hand:\n\n1) each &quot;dimension&quot; in that space has only 4 possible values (CGTA)\n2) (or in a different view) since evolution can add to the size of the \ngenome, the space is &quot;infinitely dimensional&quot;\n3) (but then again) the dimensions are not really distinct, since I can \ntranspose a whole gene somewhere else in the genome without changing its \n&quot;meaning&quot;\n4) (but) if we ignore the &quot;junk DNA&quot; then the space is much small, say \n150,000,000 dimensions\n5) (however) in a codon, the last base rarely changes the amino-acid coded, \nso roughly 1/3 of all dimensions have no effect\n6) (and anyway) if we take the amino-acid residue view then instead of \n150,000,000 4-choice dimensions, we have 50,000,000 20-choice dimensions\n7) (but anyway) most of the amino-acids can be changed without altering the \nprotein&#39;s function (a few are critical, others just need to retain rough \nsize or hydrophobicity)\n8) (and even then) I would characterize the really interesting &quot;different \nplaces&quot; in this space as the high-points of remote optima (or the whole \n&quot;fit enough&quot; regain around each optimum).  e.g. the whole region for \n&quot;human&quot; vs. the whole region for, say, &quot;alligator&quot;.  The existence and \nseparation of these regions is largely independent of how many dimensions \nwe visualize the space in [although I might suggest that a visualization \nwhich leaves the whole human meta-optimum in a single locality was better \nthan one that spread it all around...]\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
