The canonical HyperNEAT substrate I think is nodes arranged=\r\n in layers of lines on the cartesian plane, with each row having a distinct=\r\n position on the y-axis and the nodes within that row arranged along the x-=\r\naxis. Hence the strength of a connection is a function of all four coords, =\r\nweight =3D f(x1,y1,x2,y2).\n\nSeems to me that many common tasks (such as pro=\r\ncessing image data) require each layer to be a plane, so we could have node=\r\ns in a plane occupying x/y axes and the planes/layers being distinguished b=\r\ny the z axis. weight =3D f(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) and the original &#39;flat&#39; subst=\r\nrate can still be represented if necessary.\n\nI&#39;m intending to implement it =\r\nlike this - has anyone else implemented CPPNs this way? Are there any probl=\r\nems with this approach?\n\nThanks,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
