One is that the version in NERO is tied in\nwith Torque (the game engine used in NERO) and so would not function \noutside Torque.  \n\nAnother reason is that we need to draw up a research license for it \nbefore it is released since rtNEAT is currently patent pending (it\nhas been submitted to the US patent office).  It is important to note\nthat the rtNEAT patent will NOT stop research use, and we intend to\nsupport and allow its use for research purposes.  However, for-\nprofit commercial use will require a license from the University of \nTexas at Austin, or from anyone who has been granted the right to \nsublicense rtNEAT.  So we need to draw up a research license \n(meaning a license that grants unrestricted rights to use the method \nfor research purposes only), which will take a little while, but we \nintend to do it.\n\nIn any case, you are certainly free to implement rtNEAT yourself and \nplay with it.  Note that the patent will cover any version of rtNEAT,\nso you will not be able to profit commercially without paying \nroyalties (i.e. you would need a commercial license); HOWEVER no one \nwill stop you from performing any kind of not-for-profit research\nwith it that you want, and research purposes are unrestricted.  \nPlease let me know if you have questions.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;paeris20&quot; &lt;dwl01@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I was reading the paper on NERO and hoping to try some of the\nmethods\n&gt; they discussed on a project I&#39;ve been working on for a while. But I\n&gt; wanted to ask if rtNEAT was availible somewhere or if I&#39;ll have to\n&gt; modify NEAT to work in rt on my own.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; -Lenna\n\n\n\n"}}
