Originally, I was calculating \nstagnation by keeping track of the highest fitness value ever acheived for \nthat topology.  However, since there is a certain amount of randomness to \nthe fitness evaluation, there is a problem with that approach.  At one \npoint, there may be an uncharacteristically high single fitness value.  For \nthe next hundred generations it may be making steady progress without ever \nexceeding that single peak value.  Thus, it is deemed &#39;stagnant&#39; and killed \noff.  Oops!\n\nInstead of using the peak, I&#39;m using a weighted average.  For each \ntopology/species I keep a history of up to 100 past &#39;best&#39; fitness values \n(one per generation).  The average is computed by weighting the current \nfitness at 100, the last one at 99, the one before that at 98, and so on.  \nThis makes for a &#39;running average&#39; value that tends to follow the current \ntrend fairly closely without being unduely influenced by the peaks and \nvalleys of the past, making for a smoother avg line than would be acheived \nby a more typical running average.\n\nInstead of tracking the peak fitness value, it uses the peak weighted \naverage.  As long as the average max fitness is going up, the topology is \nnot stagnant.  Also, to avoid anomalous results right after a topology is \ncreated, I do not begin checking for stagnation until I have at least 20 \nhistorical fitness values.  The idea is that hopefully by then a meaningful \naverage has been established.\n\nI also changed the trend line in the fitness history graph to follow this \nsame technique.  The trend line does a much better job of following the \nactual trend of the data, compared to before.\n\nI have made a number of cosmetic changes to the status page.  Looks much \nbetter now.
