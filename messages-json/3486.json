Then the resulting objects can be \n&gt; simu=\r\nlated in real-time via Finite Element Analysis.. And fitness \ncan be \n&gt; com=\r\nputed from the results of the simulation.. \n&gt; It&#39;s difficult to discretize =\r\nthe output of the CPPN into finite \n&gt; elements, so this is the major issue =\r\nfor building such a system.. \nBut \n&gt; once such a system is built, it has un=\r\nlimited potential for \nevolving \n&gt; any kind of structure...\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
