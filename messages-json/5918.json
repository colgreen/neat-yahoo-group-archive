For example, aside from symmetry, sensors that are next to each other =\r\nare responsible for adjacent areas of the sensory field.  It&#39;s also possibl=\r\ne that even though the node placement is asymmetric that their internal con=\r\nnectivity among each other is still somehow a derivation of the more explic=\r\nit symmetric geometry of the sensors and outputs, like if you took a symmet=\r\nric pattern and twisted it in a half-pretzel - within the pretzel itself (i=\r\ngnoring its curvature) there is still a notion of symmetry.  Also, often we=\r\n do see ES-HyperNEAT produce nice symmetric patterns that even the human ey=\r\ne can appreciate.\n\nHowever, none of that really answers your question about=\r\n what it implies if there is no clear geometry to begin with.  I believe Je=\r\nff Clune can point you to some of his work where he tried training off rand=\r\nomized geometries and found that even there HyperNEAT still can gain some a=\r\ndvantage from arbitrary geometric relations that can still be exploited.  B=\r\nut in terms of ES-HyperNEAT, I don&#39;t know of any explicit studies of this i=\r\nssue.  If there is really no geometric principle whatsoever then I think it=\r\n won&#39;t work out as well as if there is, so I&#39;d try to have one.  But if you=\r\n really can&#39;t (e.g. because of the domain) there still might be hope of som=\r\nething interesting happening in the hidden node configuration nevertheless.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have thoughts or experience on the benef=\r\nits or issues of using\n&gt; ES-HyperNEAT for evolving recurrent neural network=\r\ns which deal with input\n&gt; and output that does not necessarily/explicitly c=\r\nontain geometric\n&gt; regularities (compared to, say, NEAT). I notice that in =\r\nthe example evolved\n&gt; substrate shown in &quot;A Unified Approach to Evolving Pl=\r\nasticity and Neural\n&gt; Geometry&quot; (Risi and Stanley, 2012) the neuron placeme=\r\nnt does seem to\n&gt; contain regularities (perhaps reflecting the geometric re=\r\ngularity in the\n&gt; input, but this isn&#39;t clear) but isn&#39;t symmetrical, even =\r\nthough the input\n&gt; and output spaces for the substrate do contain symmetry.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
