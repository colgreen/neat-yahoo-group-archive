In my opinion, there is.\n &gt; \n &gt; -- John\n \n John, you argue persuasively for your idea, and I can see the \n appeal.  I would not dismiss the idea that there is the possibility \n that a classifier could evolve that detects something surprising \n about aesthetic value and thereby filters the search for interesting \n images.  It is an intoxicating idea and I would love to hear about \n and see the results of any such attempt.\n \n Yet let me give you an idea about the origin of my skepticism.  I&#39;m \n basically jaded by the underwhelming results of past such efforts.  \n For example, a friend of mine tried to evolve a neural network to \n detect good music in a similar approach to yours.  I have heard of \n other attempts like that one (usually they seem to be with music).  I \n realize these stories are only anecdotal, yet I draw a lesson from \n them which shows the danger in such an approach:\n \n Evolution likes to cheat and get by easy.  If you want it to learn \n something deep and general, it tries to learn some cheap trick to do \n almost as well without having to deal with the deep stuff.  In other \n words, like lightning, it takes the path of least resistance.  The \n problem with training to detect artistic quality is that there may be \n predominant correlations among pictures or songs that we deem good \n that are really not the reason they are good.\n \n For exampele, &quot;good&quot; songs may tend to have a lot of C notes, not \n because C makes a good song, but rather because it happens to appear \n a lot in a particular genre, perhaps because it is the base note of \n some scale.  Thus, an evolved classifier will simply predict that \n anything with a lot of C&#39;s is good, missing the deeper reasons \n entirely.  Or, in Picbreeder, you may notice if you look closely that \n many (though not all) of the published images have some sort of small \n circular formation near their center.  For example this object may be \n a nose, an eye (in a profile), a cockpit window, an iris, a keyhole, \n a sun, a moon, a fingernail, etc.  Therefore, a classifier would do \n well to learn to predict that any picture with a small circle in the \n middle is good, again missing the point.\n \n I think the reason such projects have failed in the past is because \n of just such spurious correlations.  The question is how to push \n evolution to learn the deeper meaning of &quot;good,&quot; which is so \n profoundly slippery.\n \n Nevertheless, I would not say it is a lost cause.
