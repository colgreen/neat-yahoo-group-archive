I&#39;ve griped to Ken about the terminology\nin this area (many researchers call individuals\ncompeting amongst themselves for the same niche\n&quot;host/parasite&quot; coevolution, which doesn&#39;t sound right\nto my ears).  \n\nAnyway, I&#39;m especially interested in trying different\nmethods of sampling opponents each generation, and the\ndifferences between single-population and two- or\nmultiple-population coevolution.\n\nWhat sort of stuff might you be working on?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
