However, the deep\n&gt; question is *why* should they need to &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain\n&gt; areas?\n&gt;\n&gt; And the answer is because they need to know where they are.  In\n&gt; effect, in the physical universe, there is no intrinsic coordinate\n&gt; system that cells can query to ask their location.  Thus, they must\n&gt; develop elaborate and ad hoc ways of communicating to each other, as\n&gt; a group, where everyone is.  I send my neighbor signals, my neighbor\n&gt; sends me signals back, and we negotiate our roles.\n&gt;\n&gt; My undoubtedly controversial contention is that the question &quot;where\n&gt; am I?&quot; is the ONLY reason that such negotation is necessary.  If you\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to ask that question, then you would not need to talk to\n&gt; your neighbors in order to determine your role.  Rather, you could\n&gt; just compute your role as a function of your known\n&gt; coordinate/position in the world.\n\nYour answer to &quot;why we need to pattern recognize&quot; is a little  \nincomplete. Basically you&#39;ve only answered this from the cell&#39;s  \nperspective. Lets consider &quot;pattern recognize&quot; from the perspective  \nof the developmental program instead of the cell. Then the main  \nquestion is &quot;how do I select a bunch of cells that match some  \nproperty?&quot; That is, I want to select some contiguous region, e.g.,  \n&quot;toe cells&quot; or &quot;heart cells&quot; or maybe I want to select something more  \ndevelopmentally useful, e.g. &quot;epithelial cells&quot; or &quot;cells in some  \nstripe pattern along the HOX axis.&quot;\n\nWhy is this useful? Because then we can make mutations that affect  \nthese areas and no others, i.e. mutation selectivity that is defined  \nfor some (hopefully) useful phenotypic axes of variation. A lot of  \nuseful things fall out naturally from this idea, like modularity or  \nevolvability (this is where I cite my GECCO 2007 paper, which is not  \nyet on the web). In CPPN terms it would be like being able to select,  \nsay, all the black stripes in a sine grating, but not the white ones.  \nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, CPPNs support this idea of regional selection  \nvery nicely, so I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t mention it here.\n\nAnyway, I totally agree that doing away with the &quot;negotiation&quot; step  \nrequired for developmental systems using purely local interactions is  \na useful optimization, but I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to say that being  \nable to &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain areas serves the sole purpose of  \nlocalization with respect to only the global coordinate system.\n\nI&#39;ll go into this issue in more detail in my talk at GECCO, but I  \nthink its very important, and our empirical results seem to back it  \nup quite strongly.\n\n-- Joe\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n\n"}}
