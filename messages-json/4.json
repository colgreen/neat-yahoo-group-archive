And what&#39;s your\n&gt;interest/involvement in NEAT?\n\nWell, my name is Darren Izzard and I&#39;m a programmer and multimedia designer,\nmostly working on games. I&#39;m mostly interested in AI as applied to\ngame-playing, both board and arcade, and puzzle-solving.\n\nI ran a few experiments with NEAT a while back (after successfully compiling\nit under Windows using Cygwin), and before that, SANE. I keep meaning to do\nsome more with NEAT but lately I&#39;ve been quite busy with work.\n\nThe NEAT experiments mostly concerned recognising shapes. The network could\nsee a small window of a randomly-chosen shape, and could move the window\naround if it wanted for a few time steps. Then, it would signal if it had\nmade a decision on what the shape was. My runs with this did produce some\ninteresting results.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
