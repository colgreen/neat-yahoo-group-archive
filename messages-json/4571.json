You=\r\n cannot simply expect\nany biped to walk.  Great care is necessary to ensure=\r\n that everything\nabout the model makes sense and is proportionate.  \n\nWe&#39;re=\r\n still in the midst of an extensive study, and we will let\neveryone know al=\r\nl the details when it&#39;s completed.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jef=\r\nf Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very interesting paper! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. I=\r\n&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It reminds me about the experiments I made w=\r\nith HyperNEAT for\n&gt; &gt; controlling biped robots. Did you try using leaky-int=\r\negrator based\n&gt; &gt; neurons for the substrate?\n&gt; &gt; I found them very useful f=\r\nor generating\n&gt; &gt; oscillation patterns. Substrates of leaky integrators wit=\r\nh tanh()\n&gt; &gt; activation functions produce oscillations much easier than oth=\r\ners.\n&gt; &gt; Hm.. I should really try with robots with 3 legs or more. Getting\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; biped walking with HyperNEAT is perhaps too ambitious right now.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n have thought a lot about your biped experiment. I&#39;d be really\ninterested\n&gt;=\r\n in hearing your opinion, and that of anyone else on this list, as to why\n&gt;=\r\n your results were so different from mine. I found that it did not\ntake tha=\r\nt\n&gt; much tuning to get HyperNEAT to evolve really good quadruped gaits.\nBut=\r\n, as\n&gt; you note, it was much harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I can suggest a few hypotheses as to what explains the difference.\nThese=\r\n are\n&gt; not mutually exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one of=\r\n\nthem\n&gt; explains most of the difference, but instead that they add up to th=\r\ne\n&gt; difference. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped ga=\r\nits\n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\nga=\r\nits.\n&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason\n&gt; 4) I used a =\r\nPID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\nof the\n&gt; neural net =\r\n(and not the force to be applied)\n&gt; \n&gt; There are other differences of cours=\r\ne, such as the inputs and the\nnumber of\n&gt; hidden nodes. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll make a f=\r\new comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve th=\r\nan quadruped gaits.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be easy to test by simply trying a bipe=\r\nd with my setup.\n&gt; Unfortunately, I have some other obligations that will p=\r\nrevent me from\n&gt; testing this anytime soon, but if you (or anyone else) wou=\r\nld like to\ngive it\n&gt; a try, that would be cool. I can send you the code I u=\r\nsed. One would\njust\n&gt; need to change the quadruped into a biped. Alternatel=\r\ny, you could try to\n&gt; mimic my setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt; \n&gt; I do=\r\n have access to a huge computing cluster. So, if someone makes\nthe code\n&gt; m=\r\nodifications to my setup (which I know compiles on our cluster) and\nsends\n&gt;=\r\n them to me, I can do a batch of runs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided mad=\r\ne it really easy to evolve periodic gaits\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be an easy test. =\r\nYou could just plug a sine as an input\ninto your\n&gt; biped. Note: I found tha=\r\nt the period of the sine wave made a huge\n&gt; difference. If I made it too fa=\r\nst or too slow, evolution basically\nignored\n&gt; the signal. Within the range =\r\nof periods that worked, I found that I got\n&gt; different types of gaits with =\r\ndifferent period speeds. With slower\nperiods,\n&gt; I observed cool tortoise-li=\r\nke gaits with left-right symmetry. With\nmedium\n&gt; periods, I got the gaits i=\r\nn the paper. With faster periods, I saw\nslightly\n&gt; more frantic versions of=\r\n the gaits in the paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period =\r\nfor a short while and\nit was a\n&gt; miserable failure. I&#39;d like to try that ag=\r\nain, and would be\ninterested to\n&gt; hear people&#39;s thoughts as to why it faile=\r\nd. Maybe I&#39;ll describe that\nattempt\n&gt; in another email. If someone out ther=\r\ne is curious, let me know and\nI&#39;ll send\n&gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not =\r\ntry leaky integrators. Did you ever try your setup without\nthem?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did=\r\n not try them because the default sigmoid neurons worked so\nwell out of\n&gt; t=\r\nhe box that I did not experiment with alternatives. Both Ken (during\n&gt; prel=\r\niminary conversations about the paper) and one of the papers&#39;\nreviewers\n&gt; a=\r\nsked about leaky integrators, so there is clearly some interest out\nthere\n&gt;=\r\n in seeing how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt; we used in =\r\nthe paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better?=\r\n Why? I have\n&gt; never worked with them, nor do I know that much about them, =\r\nso I\ndon&#39;t have\n&gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that they c=\r\nould have made\n&gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be cool to te=\r\nst them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be\nable to get\n&gt; to this in the nea=\r\nr future so if someone out there wants to swap\nthem in and\n&gt; give it a go, =\r\nthat would be interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the targ=\r\net angle was the output\nof the\n&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applie=\r\nd).\n&gt; \n&gt; I could not figure out whether your setup did this as well. What\nw=\r\nere the\n&gt; outputs in your system?\n&gt; ---------\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think any/all of =\r\nthese hypotheses explain the difference in\nresults?\n&gt; What other likely hyp=\r\nothesis am I missing (I am sure there are lots).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for chec=\r\nking out the paper,\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; PS. Tripods would be fun. I also think addi=\r\nng feet and a flexible torso\n&gt; would be interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pete=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT I have wa=\r\nnted to see how it\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perform at controlling legged robots.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepted, so I can share i=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you now. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A copy of the paper, and videos of the=\r\n simulated robots, can be\n&gt; &gt; obtained\n&gt; &gt;&gt; here:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://de=\r\nvolab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNE\n&gt; &gt; AT\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you find it interesting.

T.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Evolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encodi=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing S=\r\npecial\n&gt; &gt; Section\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. =\r\nTo appear.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks=\r\n, such as\n&gt; &gt; navigating\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rough terrain, but the design of their contro=\r\nl software is both\n&gt; &gt; challenging\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and laborious. Traditional evolutio=\r\nnary algorithms can produce these\n&gt; &gt;&gt; controllers, but require manual deco=\r\nmposition or other problem\n&gt; &gt;&gt; simplification because conventionally-used =\r\ndirect encodings have\n&gt; &gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regu=\r\nlarities and symmetries. Such\n&gt; &gt; active\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intervention is time consumin=\r\ng, limits the range of potential\n&gt; &gt; solutions, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requires the user =\r\nto possess a deep understanding of the problem&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; structure. This paper=\r\n demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and\n&gt; &gt; promising\n&gt; &gt;&gt; generative encod=\r\ning for evolving neural networks, can evolve\n&gt; &gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt; &gt;&gt; witho=\r\nut manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n easily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt; &gt; neur=\r\noevolutionary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetrie=\r\ns, which may\n&gt; &gt; aid its\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT,=\r\n a direct encoding\n&gt; &gt; control, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evo=\r\nlve impressive quadruped gaits and\n&gt; &gt; vastly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Com=\r\nparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are more holis=\r\ntically affected by genetic operators, resulting in\n&gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coordin=\r\nation of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results suggest\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; H=\r\nyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for\n&gt; &gt; compl=\r\nex,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Mic=\r\nhigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
