In\nother words, NEAT was forced to solve the problem without recurrent\nconnections.  That may sound impossible, but actually it explains why\nthere are so many nodes.   The &quot;chains&quot; of nodes act like a memory,\nbecause it takes several steps for activation to travel all the way\ndown the chain, so it is able to effectively store information from\nthe past that does not come to the outputs for several iterations.  If\nI am right about this, this architecture is actually somewhat\nremarkable, since it implements a kind of &quot;memory&quot; that is hardly ever\ndiscussed when people talk about NN&#39;s.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wow!  The ANN is complicated and large!  But I think\n&gt; that&#39;s necessary.  Darren has solved a problem of the\n&gt; type requiring active use of memory, after the weights\n&gt; are fixed.  The problem of pattern recognition by\n&gt; looking at only part of the pattern, and then\n&gt; scanning, requires remembering what was seen.  This\n&gt; may be the most difficult problem of this nature that\n&gt; has been solved.  So, I am impressed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The picture is too complex for me to interpret.  I\n&gt; would like to know how many recurrent connections\n&gt; there are, how many total weights & biases, and how\n&gt; many neurons.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I might try to do this with one of my recurrent binary nets.\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Free Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\n&gt; http://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n\n"}}
