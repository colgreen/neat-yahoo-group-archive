We don&#39;t have to e.g. bac=\r\nkprop\nerror values calculated against specific output targets, instead we\np=\r\nump noise into the high level feature nodes and monitor the frequency\nwith =\r\nwhich certain output patterns occur. This gives us an objective\nevaluation =\r\nof the how well the domain in question is modelled. Now to\ndate I&#39;m only aw=\r\nare of modelling of simple imput-output relationships\nsuch as handwriting r=\r\necognition, but it should be possible to evaluate\n(and indeed train) a mode=\r\nl of a dynamic system (e.g. a robot arm that\npicks up and moves an object).=\r\n The stochastic patterns are now spread\nout over time and thus the weight u=\r\npdate rules are more complex, but\nit&#39;s theoretically possible. Quite how th=\r\nis fit in with HyperNEAT I&#39;m\nnot sure, I suppose HyperNEAT can actually evo=\r\nlve very complex\ntopologies if you take all connection weights below some v=\r\nalue to be\nnot present, this trimmed down set of connections might then be\n=\r\ntrained using the RBM-like update rules.\n\n\n\n&gt; The problem I have of describ=\r\ning the interrelationship of all the above with\n&gt; HyperNEAT is &quot;it&#39;s all en=\r\ntangled, and interrelated&quot; - meaning it\n&gt; works=A0precisely like a TWEANN.=\r\n=A0 I&#39;ve been working with=A0NEAT devices for over\n&gt; eight years, Kohonen S=\r\nOFM before that=A0- and I wish I could more precisely\n&gt; describe their beha=\r\nvior in deterministic terms.=A0 I can&#39;t. I can describe\n&gt; them mathematical=\r\nly in probabilistic terms, but that isn&#39;t very satisfying\n&gt; to most folks.\n=\r\n\nOr most folks need to understand probabilistic models better, since\nthat&#39;s=\r\n where all the interesting/promising AI developments seem to be.\n:)\n\nKen, I=\r\n feel like I&#39;m on a different wavelength to you a lot of the\ntime but you s=\r\nure get the old brain cells working :)\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
