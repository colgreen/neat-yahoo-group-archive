It does appear that behavi=\r\noral diversity and novelty are emerging through recent research such as you=\r\nr own as more critical factors in maintaining healthy diversity than geneti=\r\nc diversity, in particular when the diversity is in service of achieving a =\r\ntraditional objective (i.e. when one of the multiple objectives is some kin=\r\nd of task-specific performance measure).\n\nHowever, genetic diversity may st=\r\nill play a useful role in combination with behavioral diversity or novelty,=\r\n which I want to illustrate here.  Recall that the original motivation in N=\r\nEAT for maintaining genetic diversity was to ensure that genetic innovation=\r\ns (i.e. additions of structure) are not eliminated prematurely.  That is, t=\r\nhe point is to ensure that individuals with new structure are not eliminate=\r\nd before they have a chance to show their potential by optimizing their wei=\r\nghts over several more generations.  Placing them in protected species give=\r\ns them that opportunity to optimize further.\n\nHowever, recent results such =\r\nas yours suggest that when you have a target objective, protecting behavior=\r\nal diversity is so effective (most likely because it help avoid deception) =\r\nthat a system with only behavioral diversity will likely come closer to the=\r\n objective than one with only genetic diversity.\n\nBut that leaves open the =\r\npossibility that genetic diversity can complement behavioral diversity or n=\r\novelty.  One interesting question is whether in the &quot;Encouraging Behavioral=\r\n Diversity in Evolutionary Robotics&quot; paper the results would be even better=\r\n if *both* behavioral diversity/novelty and genetic diversity were combined=\r\n (as our group has done in recent papers).  Going back to the motivation in=\r\n NEAT for genetic diversity, the logic for why it would still matter when c=\r\nombined with behavioral diversity/novelty can be seen:  \n\nJust as we do not=\r\n know at first for any structural innovation whether that innovation might =\r\nlead to higher fitness in an objective-based problem, we also do not know i=\r\nnitially whether a particular structural innovation might lead later to mor=\r\ne *novelty*.  Often structural additions in neuroevolution lead to a comple=\r\nte collapse in behavior, which obviously hurts fitness, but also hurts nove=\r\nlty because degenerate behaviors are not considered novel (except at the ve=\r\nry beginning of the run).  Therefore, if you are not protecting genetic div=\r\nersity when novelty/behavioral diversity are one of the objectives, then yo=\r\nu are risking prematurely eliminating genotypes before their potential for =\r\nnovelty has been explored.\n\nHowever, perhaps more significant in magnitude =\r\nthan even that scenario is whether novelty alone (as in novelty search) can=\r\n drive a search as effectively without genetic diversity than it can with i=\r\nt.  When you are searching for a specific objective target, deception is th=\r\ne overriding pathology, which is why behavioral diversity is such a potent =\r\nantidote.  However, if you are searching only for novelty, then obviously d=\r\neception is no longer the issue (since you are not looking for any one thin=\r\ng), which means that now other pathologies (such as prematurely losing stru=\r\nctural innovations from the population) would become more important.  There=\r\nfore, the impact of forgoing genetic diversity might be more evident in tha=\r\nt context.\n\nFurthermore, even if this issue is most evident in pure novelty=\r\n search, it may still appear to some extent in any search where behavioral =\r\ndiversity is important, since genetic diversity ultimately drives behaviora=\r\nl diversity.\n\nThis issue probably merits further study.  I only mean to rai=\r\nse the question, not to argue that the answer is conclusive.  I&#39;m guessing =\r\nthe real answer is probably nuanced.  For example, it may be that genetic d=\r\niversity is more important early in a run when small structural changes ten=\r\nd to have the most dramatic effects on behavior.  Perhaps in later generati=\r\nons because the effect tends to be less the need for genotypic protection m=\r\night reduce.  But my guess is that ultimately genetic diversity and behavio=\r\nral diversity both play a role in healthy evolution, and in fact complement=\r\n each other (because genetic diversity helps foster behavioral diversity). =\r\n I would also guess the effect would be more pronounced the more a search r=\r\nelies on novelty as its primary driver (with pure novelty search being the =\r\nmost extreme such case).  Of course these are currently just speculations o=\r\nn my part.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, St=E9phane Doncieux &lt;=\r\nstephane.doncieux@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Oliver,\n&gt; \n&gt; we are using NSGA-II for =\r\nneuroevolution for quite a while now, and in\n&gt; the same situation, we have =\r\nactually chosen to use a simplified version\n&gt; of NEAT. We have discarded th=\r\ne innovation numbers and thus the\n&gt; speciation and crossover and kept only =\r\nthe idea of starting simple. We\n&gt; have actually replaced all of it with an =\r\nobjective that rewards the\n&gt; behavioral diversity of the robot we were evol=\r\nving. We made some\n&gt; comparisons with NEAT in this paper: &quot;Mouret, J.-B. an=\r\nd Doncieux, S.\n&gt; (2012). Encouraging Behavioral Diversity in Evolutionary R=\r\nobotics: an\n&gt; Empirical Study. Evolutionary Computation. Vol 20 No 1 Pages =\r\n91-133&quot;, cf\n&gt; http://www.isir.upmc.fr/files/2011ACLI2061.pdf\n&gt; It revealed =\r\nto be more efficient than NEAT on the different setups that\n&gt; we did consid=\r\ner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then, if we don&#39;t have a reason to use something else, we us=\r\ne this\n&gt; simple encoding either with a behavioral diversity objective or wi=\r\nth a\n&gt; novelty objective. It gives not bad results, see\n&gt; http://www.youtub=\r\ne.com/watch?feature=3Dplayer_embedded&v=3DTrj0_A1ZfNo, for\n&gt; instance. It h=\r\nas at least the advantage of being simple. If you want\n&gt; some source code a=\r\nnd/or look at the work we have done on this topic, you\n&gt; can have a look at=\r\n http://pages.isir.upmc.fr/evorob_db/.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that it does not directl=\r\ny answer your question, but my advice\n&gt; would be at least to test such an a=\r\npproach with a simpler encoding and\n&gt; some helper objectives. It is quite s=\r\ntraightforward to implement and\n&gt; will give you some reference points with =\r\nwhich to compare the\n&gt; performance of more complex algorithms. The other ad=\r\nvantage is that the\n&gt; day researchers in multi-objective evolutionary algor=\r\nithms come up with\n&gt; a new and more efficient algorithm, it should be simpl=\r\ne to use it. By\n&gt; the way, if you experience problem with that, I would be =\r\nhappy to\n&gt; discuss it with you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope it helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; stephan=\r\ne\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
