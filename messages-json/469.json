I didn&#39;t like that.  I suspect that deep in the \nbowels of the network is a continuous function, but how we access it renders \nit discreet.  I really wanted continuous, but figured I had to settle for \ndiscreet.\n\nBut this morning, I had an idea.  Tell me if you think this might work...\n\nInstead of having an output matrix, have only a single output node, \nrepresenting a single output pixel.  Then add four additional inputs:  The \nx,y position of the upper left corner of the region of interest, and the \nlower right corner.  The output is to represent the average of the function \ndescribed by the rest of the network at the specified location relative to \nthe input space.  0,0 represents the upper left corner of the input sample, \nand 1,1 represents the opposite corner.\n\nI realize that it would make more sense if described visually.  I&#39;ll try...\n\nInput:\n[  ] bias\n[  ][  ][  ][  ]  pixels\n[  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ] x1\n[  ] y1\n[  ] x2\n[  ] y2\n\nOutput:\n[  ] output pixel value that is the average for the region x1,y1-x2,y2\n\nThus, the output region would be (for a 2x enlargement)\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][a][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][b][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n[  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ][  ]\n\nSo if x1 = 0.25 and x2 = 0.375, y1=0.25 and y2=0.375, the output of the \nnetwork should be the pixel labeled &#39;a&#39;.  Whereas, if all other input is \nkept the same but x1=0.5, x2=0.625, y1=0.625, y2=0.75, then the output \ncorresponds to &#39;b&#39;.  If I were to input 0,0-0.25,0.25, I should get as an \noutput the value of the input pixel at 0,0.  And once trained, I could get \nANY level of enlargement by just sampling the network at progressively \nsmaller intervals.\n\nThe best part is, it is more conducive to complexification.  With a number \nof input nodes, and only a single output node, it can complexify the way it \nshould.\n\nSo, what do you think?  Sound plausable?  Any known reason why such an \napproach might be doomed to failure?\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet business advice and resources to improve your work life, from bCentral. \nhttp://special.msn.com/bcentral/loudclear.armx\n\n\n"}}
