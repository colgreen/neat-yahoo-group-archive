In particular he points\n&gt;out that double precision is required in applications involving\n&gt;chaotic processes.  Pentiums have dedicated double precision floating\n&gt;point hardware that is extremely efficient while the majority of\n&gt;embedded processors implement single precision floating point in\n&gt;software and usually don&#39;t support double precision at all.\n\nHe may have had good reasons for this, but it sounds like he&#39;s missed the \npoint about chaos theory...\n\nThere&#39;s no &quot;cure&quot; for chaotic behaviour and increased precision cannot \n&quot;help&quot; it.  In fact there is _greater_ scope for chaos at higher precision, \nalthough that cannot be taken as an argument against it, because chaos \narises as a real feature of the system under study, it&#39;s not a side effect \nof precision or any other aspect of how the maths is done.\n\nNeural nets can only be chaotic if there is feedback from later to earlier \nstages.  This may be because the network is recurrent, or it could happen \nif the external application does any thing to feed previous answers back \ninto the inputs.\n\nIn either case, if you are set on evolving your topology/weights, then \nthere&#39;s not a lot you can do about it (in a hand-specified system you might \nbe able to reduce the magnitude of the feedback and at some point the chaos \nwould stop).\n\n&gt; &gt; Are you able to elaborate on the types of problem you&#39;re\n&gt;considering?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;We are investigating the development of a real time, using ANN based,\n&gt;in-scene object recognizer/tracker running on an embedded processor\n&gt;(Analog Devices Blackfin) possibly augmented with a floating point co-\n&gt;processor (Analog Devices Shark) .  We&#39;re just getting starting and\n&gt;the threads here have been very helpful.  The show stopper is double\n&gt;verse single precision.\n\nThe precision of single is 1 in 1000000, so:\n\n1) can a difference of 0.0000001 matter in the inputs?\n2) will the output of any node be multiplied by enough (possibly over \nseveral stages) that a difference of 0.0000001 would matter?\n\n((that last is where chaos can come in, becuase with feedback a difference \ncan be multiplied across the same stage over and over again...))\n\nMy guess is that single will be fine for you.  If you wanted to save the \ncost of the FPU then you could probably code it in a fixed-point integer \nsystem, but that will cost more software development time/testing/debugging...\n\nI assume you will prototype on a PC?  Do that in single and when it works \nOK, then worry about the limits of the embedded system...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
