I have been having some\n&gt;  problems trying to compile rtNEAT. However, today I stumbled across a\n&gt;  solution. I run ubuntu 7.10 at home and it has gcc 4.1.3, This\n&gt;  version of gcc does not compile the rtNEAT code. It gives the\n&gt;  following errors below. However, on my lunch break I tried using an\n&gt;  older version of gcc 3.4 and this worked fine. When I got home\n&gt;  tonight, I installed gcc 3.4 on my home machine. I tried compiling\n&gt;  the rtNEAT but got some different errors. I then tried the rtNEAT\n&gt;  that came with the dance evolution and that seemed to compile\n&gt;  correctly. Do you know of any rtNEAT code that will compile with gcc\n&gt;  4.1.X ?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Best Regards\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ty\n\n"}}
