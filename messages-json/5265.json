SharpNEAT has been a great resource and I am sure versi=\r\non 2 will be appreciated.  I was wondering how you feel about the HyperNEAT=\r\n component of SharpNEAT 2.0.  Do you consider a full release of HyperNEAT? =\r\n That is, is it an alternative to the two current releases that we have out=\r\n?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nStatus (2010-06-17) - SharpNEAT 2 Candidate Release\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; SharpNEAT 2 development has reached candid=\r\nate release status. This\n&gt; is a fully functional release that is made avail=\r\nable in order to\n&gt; highlight any defects before issuing the code as an offi=\r\ncial version\n&gt; 2.0\n&gt; \n&gt; Features:\n&gt;    * Parallel execution. Concurrent gen=\r\nome decoding and genome\n&gt; evaluation, also concurrent speciation by k-means=\r\n clustering.\n&gt; Implemented using Parallel Extensions (built-in to .Net 4, a=\r\nvailable\n&gt; as a separate library for compiling within Mono).\n&gt;    * Support=\r\n for both NEAT and HyperNEAT/CPPNs.\n&gt;    * Generic framework classes with h=\r\nigh level of abstraction and\n&gt; therefore flexibility and reusability in bot=\r\nh NEAT and non-NEAT\n&gt; projects.\n&gt;    * Flexible XML configuration.\n&gt;    * X=\r\nML IO for genomes and populations.\n&gt;    * Problem domains -\n&gt;          o Lo=\r\ngical XOR.\n&gt;          o Binary 3-multiplexer, 6-multiplexer & 11-multiplexe=\r\nr.\n&gt;          o Function regression - sin(x), sin(x^2) & multiplication\n&gt; (=\r\nwith visualization).\n&gt;          o Boxes Visual Discrimination (with visuali=\r\nzation). (see\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2009/stanley.alife09.h=\r\ntml)\n&gt;          o Prey Capture (with visualization).\n&gt;          o Single Po=\r\nle Balancing\n&gt;          o Double Pole Balancing (and variants)\n&gt; \n&gt;    * Sp=\r\neciation by k-means clustering (Single thread and parallel\n&gt; versions). To =\r\nmy knowledge this is the first NEAT implementation to\n&gt; use this approach a=\r\nnd as such this code is experimental. Results so\n&gt; far have been positive.\n=\r\n&gt;    * Complexity Regulation (previously known as phased pruning).\n&gt;    * G=\r\nUI for modifying experiment parameters, controlling the\n&gt; execution of the =\r\nevolution algorithm and visualization of genomes and\n&gt; problem domains.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
