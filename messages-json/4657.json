You&#39;re right that bo=\r\nth papers managed to somehow list different but still incorrect fitness fun=\r\nctions.  I actually used 1000r-Ttot to get the amount of time remaining sin=\r\nce each trail was allocated 1000 time steps.  However, your fitness functio=\r\nn makes perfect sense too, so I doubt choosing one or the other would signi=\r\nficantly affect the results.\n\nDavid\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Si=\r\nmmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken\n&gt; \n&gt; I had done an experiment =\r\nin conjuction with the Torcs competition that Julian Togelius et al are run=\r\nning.  The results were not that encouraging when compared with a standard =\r\nNEAT experiment (maybe I need to sort out the geometry, though given the re=\r\ncent paper by Jeff, any geometry should work better than standard NEAT).  I=\r\n implemented David B. D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s Food Finder experiment and that worked j=\r\nust fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know you used this experiment in your alife 09 paper and I=\r\n have one question regarding the fitness function of this experiment.  Firs=\r\nt, the algorithms are slightly different - could be typos or could be just =\r\ndifferent.  However, in both, they seem to reward (increasing fitness) bots=\r\n that take longer with the (Ttot * 1000r) or (Ttot / 1000r) terms of yours =\r\nand David&#39;s experiments. This seems at odds with the goal.  I have implemen=\r\nted (1000r / Ttot) which after all food is found rewards quicker bots.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Maybe I have missed something or misunderstood.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nMatt, what kind of experiment is implemented in your hyperneat?
