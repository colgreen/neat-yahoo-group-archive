I think \na good rule of thumb for me has been to aim for an average size of \n15.  My version of NEAT, and perhaps others, uses a truncation \nselection that knocks the bottom n% of the population out of \ncontention for reproduction (specified by the \nparameter &quot;survival_thresh,&quot; which sats what percentage should \nsurvive).  That is something to consider.  If you are selecting very \nstrictly within species, then you want bigger species.  So I know \nthat if survival_thresh is 0.3, then a species of 15 will have about \n5 individuals of high quality mating with each other.\n\nThe other issue is dynamic vs. static compatibility thresholding.  \nBecause I do not like to spend a lot of time tuning parameters \nunnecessarily, I greatly prefer the dynamic method.  I realize there \nare actually a lot of interesting arguments for going either way.  \nAnother way to articulate this reasoning for going dynamic is that \nif you are going to choose a parameter, it is much more intuitive to \nchoose the species size target rather than a meaningless threshold \nvalue.  \n\nThere is a further reason that I like the dynamic method, which is \nthat long-term population dynamics are very hard to predict, even \nwith a lot of tuning.  Just because you have found a threshold that \nconsistently leads to 10 species arising in 100 generations, does \nnot mean there will still be 10 after 1000.  Chaotic dynamics and \nsudden disasterous of serendipitous events can alter the population \ndistribution radically at some unforseen point in the future.  I \nlike to know that no matter what, the population will settle around \nmy target # of species.\n\nThis is actually a complicated issue with a lot of pros and cons, \nboth philosophical and practical, either way.  Unfortunately. I do \nnot know of any extensive experimentation that gives empirical \nsupport to either method, so it&#39;s really an open question.  My \npersonal biases may not necessarily pan out to be the best.\n\nI&#39;m actually not completely sure what the word &quot;clamp&quot; means. Does \nit mean you are doing dynamic thresholding in the style of my NEAT \nsystem, or does it mean you literally stop speciation from \nprogressing after some number already exist?  (I guess Derek or you \nmay be able to answer this question) My dynamic thresholding is \nconstantly moving towards a target number by moving the \ncompatibility threshold, which doesn&#39;t seem like a &quot;clamp&quot; exactly, \nso I think clamping may be a third option.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Thanks for that Derek.  Personally, I try to have the average \nspecie\n&gt; size to be about 10, which allows for sorting and the mating of the\n&gt; top n%, either by tuning the threshold manually or choosing the\n&gt; required number of species for dynamic threshold manipulation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t clamped my species, to be honest, never even thought of \nit\n&gt; as an option.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have thought about having an average specie size of around 30 as\n&gt; this is supposed to be the min size of a cow herd, for example, to\n&gt; have enough genetic material to produce healty offspring.  Not so \nsure\n&gt;  it matters so much here if brother and sister mate though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I seem to remember 30 being the smallest statistically\n&gt; significant size for a sample, so maybe we should always aim for \nthat\n&gt; number of species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, any thoughts/opinions as to specie number clamping or specie \nsize\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Matt,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think to a certain extent it&#39;s dependent on your population \nsize. \n&gt; &gt; Larger populations are more tolerant of more species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think most of the current NEAT implementations clamp the \nnumber of\n&gt; &gt; species...something like 5-8 (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong on \nthis).\n&gt; &gt;  Obviously if you only have 1 species, you&#39;re not exploiting its\n&gt; &gt; advantages...likewise if you have a population of 100 and you \nhave 100\n&gt; &gt; species (everyone is in their own species), you&#39;re not getting \nany\n&gt; &gt; crossover.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ANJI doesn&#39;t clamp the number of species, and so we end up \ntuning the\n&gt; &gt; threshold manually.  We usually end up with somewhere between 20-\n30\n&gt; &gt; species in a typical run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Theoretically, I like to think of species as camps moving out \ninto the\n&gt; &gt; search space and exploring.  They&#39;re clusters of similar \nsolutions in\n&gt; &gt; the fitness landscape.  You don&#39;t want too many and you don&#39;t \nwant too\n&gt; &gt; few.  And you want a certain amount of turnover or dynamism, \nbecause\n&gt; &gt; you want to encourage more exploration, and probably have some \nsearch\n&gt; &gt; spaces abandoned in favor of more promising ones.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Others may have some insights into why they clamped the species \nsize.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The short answer, though not very helpful, is somewhere between \n1 and\n&gt; &gt; your population size. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Derek\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On 9/7/05, Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just wondering if anyone has any view as to the optimum(ish) \nnumber of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; species.  My implementation will cope with both a fixed and \ndynamic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compatability threshold so I can control the number of species \nto a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain degree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I find that with a fixed CT, the number of species decline \neventually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to just a few, after intially having many (tens/hundreds).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts, opinoins etc very much welcomed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
