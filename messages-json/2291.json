A very good player of any game will learn to find and\n&gt;exploit weakness of an opponent.  If we can&#39;t do this at the level of\n&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe, what&#39;s the point of tackling more difficult games like\n&gt;Checkers or Chess or Go?\n\nHi Derek,\n\nI agree that PPS is far from the whole story, but it&#39;s all I know how to do \nat the moment, and I think will be useful as a basis of comparison until \nsomething better comes along.\n\ne.g.\n\nWhen we say &quot;let&#39;s evolve a player for game X&quot; we are actually being \nambiguous.  We might mean:\n\n- evolve a player in the context of some opponent(s), or,\n- evolve a fixed strategy for the general case of any opponent, or,\n- evolve a adaptive strategy that adjusts itself to the current opponent\n\nAt the moment I am working on the second of these, and I&#39;ll use a lot of \ninstances of the first along the way.  But I think the third is too far \nbeyond the current state of the art.\n\nPPS is designed as a tool with this in mind.\n\nNote that even a fixed strategy can adapt to things it learns about its \nopponent during a single game, however.\n\n--\n\nThe flip side is that I know how to design a definitive score for the \ngeneral case.  But the score against either a fixed opponent, or for a \nsystem adapting itself to a variable opponent, could only be defined in the \ncontext of the opponent, and as that opponent will vary from time to time \nand project to project, the score would no longer be useful as a general \nmeans of comparison.\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
