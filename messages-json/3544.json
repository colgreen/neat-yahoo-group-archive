I&#39;d like to weigh in on it a\nlittle and maybe throw in an idea for how to make things even more\ninteresting...\n\nFirst of all, there is always a goal.  In one case, the goal is very\nstrictly defined, in the other, it is more losely defined.  But there\nis still a &#39;goal&#39;.  The goal in PicBreeder is &#39;makes me feel good&#39;\nwhich CAN be defined, it just has to be defined in terms of something\nwe can&#39;t see, which is the neuron firing pattern in our brains.\n\nMy hypothesis, though, is that there is a pattern to our internal\nchoosing of what we like.  And I posit that it may be possible to\nLEARN it.  Meaning, create a &#39;chooser&#39; network that also evolves\n&#39;interesting&#39; images.\n\nYou see, I think that &#39;recognition&#39; is a key element in deciding what\nto choose.  And I think that the method that we use to recognize order\nvs. chaos could be modeled.  Sure, recognizing the difference between\ntwo people&#39;s faces would be harder to model, but I think it would be\nfairly easy to learn to model the difference between chaos and order.\n\nI&#39;m thinking you should be able to evolve a network that tends to\nchoose (rank higher) images of real-world things over images of\nrandom, unstructured noise.  You could take many image chunks the size\nof the PicBreeder output images, all of which have some kind of\nrecognizability and pleasantness to them.  Then create a large number\nof counter-examples that are built out of unstructured randomness, be\nit pixels or blobs or arcs or whatever.  Then evolve a network that\nconsistently recognizes the &#39;pleasing&#39; images (ranks them highly) and\nrecognizes the chaotic images as such and thereby ranks them lower.\n\nWhen that&#39;s done, integrate it into the PicBreeder app as a &#39;chooser&#39;\nwhich evolves and evolves until somebody shuts it down.  Whenever it\nfinds something that it likes more than some threshold, it &#39;saves&#39; it.\n When it likes something more than an even higher threshold, it\npublishes it.\n\nI predict that there will be a sweet spot for complexity of the\nPicBreeder image generating networks.  For a while, as complexity\ngrows, the chooser network will rank the images higher and higher.\nBut I suspect that at some point, that trend will reverse.  The number\nof highly ranked images as a percentage of all evolved images at a\nparticular complexity level will get lower as the complexity rises\nabove that sweet spot.\n\nI would also like to mention that combining such a &#39;general coolness\nchooser&#39; with a goal-oriented chooser could be quite interesting.  The\ntwo could work together synergistically to help walk the search space\nfaster.  Problem may be to generate that chooser correctly to begin\nwith.  But my instincts tell me that one that is evolved to find\nregularity in an image and finds &#39;pleasing&#39; relationships between\nthem, such as the one described above, would be adequate to use in\nconjunction with a goal-oriented evolution of the CPPN networks for\nwho-knows-what.  The reason I say that is that I suspect that the same\n&#39;regularities&#39; that make for a &#39;pleasing&#39; image are the same\ncharacteristics that lead to a functional CPPN network.  But I&#39;m sure\nyou would know better based on your experiences working with them.\n\nJust thought I&#39;d throw that out there for you to think about.\n-- \nJohn Arrowwood\nJohn (at) Hanlons Razor (dot) com\nJohn (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n--\nhttp://arrowwood.blogspot.com\n\n"}}
