In many gradient descent (or\nhill climbing), there are two very real problems.  The first is becoming\nstuck in local minima and the second related problem is (as you describe) is\nlow perturbation potential at some point in time.  The common solution I use\nto handle both conditions is a scheduled form of simulated annealing.  This\nkeeps the plasticity of the topology &quot;pliable&quot; (in NEAT, and in radial basis\nfunction ANN&#39;s, we are dealing with both lengths (such as distance, L-p\nnorms, etc) and weights. But even here, single precision floats properly\nnormalized will help.  This forms an interesting computational relationship\nwith mechatronics and bond graphs. Again far off the beaten path, but\ninteresting.\n \nA very important aspect I really didn&#39;t want to get into on this project was\nthe balancing of parallelization paths between tasks run on CPU cores with\nkernels run on the GPU process cores, which close-couple with the\npartitioning of the data structures between device and host memory sectors.\nThis discussion may have changed my mind.  Realize, that there will always\nexist some resolution limit in the data - even in double-doubles.  I think\nthat issue becomes a red herring in neuroevolution, for reasons more related\nto the probabilistic (non-deterministic) nature of recurrent network graph\nstructures.  What is evolving is actually a probability density envelope -\nrepresenting an ensemble of solutions - not one deterministic answer. Even\nas the solution approaches certainty (rho = 0), there may still be an\ninfinity of solutions in that deterministic solution set.  This is where\ncycles of forward and inverse Bayesian refinements are helpful (running on\nthe CPUs while evolution of genome commences on the GPU).  Again - far off\nthe track for what I see as the fascinating study of NEAT.\n \nSo I ask your input, as I also ask of the group: What do want to accomplish\nby running n-dimensional substrates NEAT on a hybrid CPU/GPGPU compute node\n(or clusters thereof)?  Solutions, or learning opportunities?\n \nKen Lloyd\n \n\n  _____  \n\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Colin\nGreen\nSent: Tuesday, May 19, 2009 11:33 AM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [neat] Doble/Single digit precision NEAT\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record the default neural net implementation in SharpNeat uses\nsingle precision floats although there are implementations that use\ndouble, and also the genome class uses doubles. Unless there is some\noverriding reason you may be aware of (e.g. for the problem domain in\nquestion) then using doubles is probably unnecessary. E.g. I was\nrecently experimenting with a gradient descent algorithm and noticed\nthe algorithm stopped with very small learning rates when using single\nprecision - the reason being that the update increments were simply\ntoo small, that is, when adding a tiny value to a non-zero variable\nthe true result may require more precision than is available and so\nthe variable becomes &#39;stuck&#39;.\n\nI chose floats for a small performance gain on standard CPUs, it&#39;s not\nnecessarily the CPU arithmetic that is faster since CPUs are designed\nto do double precision very fast these days, but there will always be\na 2x memory bandwidth benefit with floats and of course gains when\nusing CUDA, Larabee, SIMD instructions etc.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00A0_01C9D89B.CD8CFF70\r\nContent-Type: application/ms-tnef;\n\tname=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00A0_01C9D89B.CD8CFF70--\r\n\n"}}
