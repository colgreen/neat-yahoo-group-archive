I\n&gt; assume other members of this group are going, too.  Does anyone have\n&gt; recommendations for any of the tutorials or workshops they are\noffering?  It\n&gt; looks like there&#39;s only one on neural networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n\n\nYeah the guy giving the NN tutorial is Xin Yao, who is famous for his\n1999 pre-NEAT paper on neuroevolution, &quot;Evolving Neural Networks,&quot;\nwhich was and probably still is the most comprehensive review of the\nfield.  But unfortunately at least in past years it looks like his\ntutorial is mostly from that era, so it&#39;s missing a lot of the recent\ndevelopments in the field like NEAT.  (Of course this year could be\ndifferent.)  Still, I recommend checking it out since he&#39;s a well\nknown researcher and his perspective may be useful.\n\nI think the big topic this year in workshops will be indirect\nencoding.  It&#39;s a really interesting open area and starting to\ninterest a lot of people.  There are several workshops on this type of\nthing:\n\n-Regeneration and Learning in Developmental Systems\n-Self-Organization on Representations for Genetic and Evolutionary\nAlgorithms\n\nAnd probably the most interesting one:\n\n-Modularity, regularity and hierarchy in open-ended evolutionary\ncomputation\n\nI also find interactive evolutionary computation promising and\ninteresting, and there&#39;s a workshop for that too:\n\n-Interactive Evolutionary Computing\n\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
