First, the distrib=\r\nution\nof the population was heavily lopsided. We had a population of 100 ge=\r\nnomes\nand 10 species, but the size of species 0 was usually around 80 genom=\r\nes.\nSecond, even accounting for this, we saw better performance from random=\r\nly\nselecting individuals for subcultures.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense to me=\r\n, since speciation is intended for the\nopposite of what subcultures should =\r\nbe doing. Speciation is aimed at\ngrouping similar individuals in genome spa=\r\nce, thereby protecting (with the\nhelp of fitness sharing) innovation in the=\r\n population and allowing it to\nflourish. Subcultures, however, are intended=\r\n to create diverse groups of\nindividuals in phenome space and thus promote =\r\nthe sharing of innovations\namong the population. In this light, I think it&#39;=\r\ns clear why randomly\ncomposed subcultures would outperform species-based: i=\r\nndividuals in the\nsame species, with similar genomes, are more likely to ha=\r\nve similar\nphenotypic behavior and observations of similar individuals real=\r\nly won&#39;t\nhelp social agents outside of some minor local optimization on the=\r\n\nsub-policies they have already discovered.\n\nPhilosophically, I think the r=\r\nesults are actually very encouraging when\napplied to human society. We show=\r\n that the notion of learning only from\nwhat those in power tell you is actu=\r\nally a suboptimal strategy. Rather,\neveryone-- rich, poor, young, old, etc-=\r\n- may have something to contribute\nand even if overall they aren&#39;t as &quot;fit&quot;=\r\n as everyone else, their individual\nactions can still have worth and add va=\r\nlue to society.\n\nSpecifically to novelty, I believe social transmission is =\r\ncrucial in human\nsocieties. Generally when biologists study learning paradi=\r\ngms in nature,\nthere are a few levels of cognitive ability. In our experime=\r\nnts we were\neffectively applying  an emulation paradigm, where agents learn=\r\n to mimic\nexact behaviors. Humans fortunately function at a higher level, i=\r\nmitation,\nbecause we can observe a behavior and then acquire new skills or =\r\ntalents by\ncombining it with other knowledge or experiences we&#39;ve previousl=\r\ny acquired,\nresulting in an entirely new behavior. So from my perspective, =\r\nsocial\nlearning among humans is one not a threat to novelty, but rather one=\r\n of the\ngreatest sources of it.\n\nSincerely,\nWesley\n\nOn Thu, Apr 19, 2012 at=\r\n 6:48 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Wesley, co=\r\nngrats on the GECCO paper and also thanks for sharing the\n&gt; software.

In a complex foraging task, ESL converg=\r\nes to near-optimal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; strategies faster than either benchmark approac=\r\nh, outperforming both by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; more than an order of magnitude. The resu=\r\nlts indicate that egalitarian&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; social learning is a promising new p=\r\naradigm for social learning in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; intelligent agents.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Paper page: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D127=\r\n157&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D127157&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Github repository for all source code:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;https://github.com/tansey/social-learning&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https:/=\r\n/github.com/tansey/social-learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A couple of thing=\r\ns to note here that I believe will be very helpful to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; anyone using=\r\n SharpNEAT in general:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - If you&#39;re looking to do Lam=\r\narckian evolution, it turns out to be very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; easy: &lt;a href=3D&quot;https:=\r\n//gist.github.com/2410490&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/241049=\r\n0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - We implemented backpropagation through time for =\r\nthe FastCyclicNetwork.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Using the SharpNeatV2 that is in the github=\r\n repo, you can perform&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; supervised learning on a NEAT network very =\r\neasily, enabling online learning&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; algorithms to be incorporated int=\r\no SharpNEAT experiments:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;https://gist.github.com/241054=\r\n5&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2410545&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Colin, I&#39;d love if you could take a look at the backprop implementatio=\r\nn and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; potentially integrate it into a future release of SharpNEAT.=\r\n Outside of our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hacking of the FastCyclicNetwork class, it only re=\r\nquired changing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; permissions on a few properties here and there.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The caveats here are that the backprop implementation requ=\r\nires you reset&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the network state at every activation to be correct=\r\n. If you&#39;re doing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something where recurrent networks that main=\r\ntain state between calls are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; required, then the performance of thi=\r\ns method is not guaranteed to work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If anyone has any co=\r\nmments or questions on the paper, I&#39;m happy to discuss&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wesley&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--f46d0444812d7806ee04be245f6e--\r\n\n"}}
