Instead of further delay, I am just releasing it as is.\n\nHere is a link to it:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/JeffCluneHyperNEATcode\n\nThe most requested code--that for evolving gaits for simulated quadruped\nrobots--is in here as the LegSwingExperiment. There is a readme file for how\nto get started. If you have any questions, just let me know.\n\nPS. I think it would be fun to have the robot experiment included in the\nmore canonical HyperNEAT releases, if the maintainers of those packages are\ninterested. It is very fun to watch the robots evolve, and it quickly gives\none a sense of the difference in behaviors produced by HyperNEAT vs. NEAT\nand FT-NEAT. I have found that being able to download a package and see\nsomething that is visually intuitive can often engage an enthusiast/hobbyist\nwho does not immediately know how to evaluate improved performance on more\nabstract problems (e.g. the boxes domain). So, it would be nice to have\nsomething like this for them to immediately see and play with. Just a\nthought. \n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
