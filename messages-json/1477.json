How complex is the network?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Just wanted to let everybody know that we&#39;ve uploaded a video of \nthe\n&gt; eye behavior for one of our OCR experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s in the Files section, &quot;eye.swf&quot;.  You&#39;ll need the free Flash\n&gt; player to view it.  The quality is pretty grainy.  The actual \nimages\n&gt; aren&#39;t that noisy.\n&gt; \n&gt; What you&#39;re seeing is the champion network from 800 generations,\n&gt; looking at &quot;A&quot; and other letters of the alphabet.  Each image is\n&gt; randomly rotated slightly, either clockwise or counterclockwise, \nand\n&gt; the letter position is also randomly transformed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The eye has a resolution of 7x7 pixels, and can move horizontally \nand\n&gt; vertically, as well as being able to zoom in or out and rotate cw \nor\n&gt; ccw each time step.  We calculate the number of steps that a given\n&gt; network gets to look at the canvas based on its size.  This network\n&gt; has 68 steps to view each image.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s interesting to note that the eye invariably zooms in on the \nupper\n&gt; left portion of the symbol, presumably because this area is unique \nto\n&gt; the letter &quot;A&quot;.  &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; have similar peaks, but with smaller\n&gt; angles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, we&#39;re continuing to experiment...just thought we&#39;d share \nsome\n&gt; interesting results.  Let us know your thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
