Yeh OK I&#39;ll have a look at\n&gt;&gt;implementing it in SharpNEAT. What do you recon, should I used a fixed\n&gt;&gt;number of activations per evaluation or should I relax the network -\n&gt;&gt;which allows for open-ended recursiveness. Maybe I&#39;ll try a few\n&gt;&gt;variations and see what happens eh. I&#39;ll try and kick it off tomorrow eve.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Cool.  Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty straight forward.  I&#39;ll upload mux.pl to the group web \n&gt;site so you can have a reference to make sure you are using the same inputs \n&gt;and the same fitness function.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n[thinking cap on] With a 3x3 grid there are 14 different possible sets \nof inputs right, so 9 individual squares + 4 (groups of 4) + 1 for the \nwhole 9 together. With such a small number of possibilities it&#39;s highly \nlikely that a solution will be found by classifying each of these 14 \ngroups, e.g. 14 hidden nodes each representing one of the groups. \nHowever this classification approach doesn&#39;t scale well, with a 4x4 grid \nthe number of possible groupings becomes 30 (hope i got that right) and \nwith a 5x5 there are 55, so we can see that this will quickly become an \nunfeasable technique.\n\nMy point is that this problem will probably be solved using a structrue \nthat takes advantage of the small number of inputs and that wouldn&#39;t \nwork with a larger number of inputs. Anyway I&#39;ll give it a go and try to \ncode it so I can vary the grid size and experiment with larger grids as \nwell.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
