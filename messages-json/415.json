The only disadvantage is that the\n&gt;genomes in XML are difficult to read or edit.  For example, the format\n&gt;I&#39;ve been using for genome files (which is completely ad hoc) is\n&gt;easier to read or edit:\n&gt;\n&gt;genomestart 1\n&gt;trait 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n&gt;node 1 0 1 1\n&gt;node 2 0 1 1\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;gene 1 1 14 -0.242932 0 1 -0.242932 1\n&gt;gene 1 2 14 -0.665275 0 2 -0.665275 1\n&gt;gene 1 3 14 -0.690939 0 3 -0.690939 1\n&gt;gene 1 4 14 0.313999 0 4 0.313999 1\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;genomeend 1\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s easy to delete a gene, see the nodes and\n&gt;genes, see the historical markings (the numbers \n&gt;increasing  from 1 to 39 in the gens). The\n&gt;format also allows comments in C-style, so \n&gt;genes can be commented out:\n&gt;\n&gt;/* gene 1 10 16 0 0 36 0 1 */\n&gt;\n&gt;And later reinstated (for ablation studies).\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree that the small amount of data required for current NEAT genes is \neasier to read than equivalent XML with all of it&#39;s associated clutter.  \nArguments in favour of XML would be:\n - It does allow commenting out with the &lt;!--  --&gt; syntax.\n - If you expand an XML definition then any new pieces of data will be \nignored by old readers,  thus aiding backwards compatibilty (not a major \nconcern though at this point).\n - As Derek pointed out you can apply all manner of stylesheets \ntransforms (XSLT) to convert between formats, generate SVG, run reports, \nanalyses, etc.\n - If in the future we were to store more data against each gene then \nthe raw XML may be easier to read since long lists of floating point \nnumbers soon become confusing to the eye. But again transforms can aid \nwith readability.\n\n&gt;Anyway, XML has some great properties and uses, so\n&gt;I am not arguing against XML.  But what I think\n&gt;would be especially cool would be if there was\n&gt;a conversion function both ways between NEAT-XML \n&gt;and NEAT-traditional genome styles.  That way,\n&gt;you could get the benefits of both formats, \n&gt;as well as get backward-compatibility with all the \n&gt;genome files people already have in the old format.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nConverting from XML to a non-XML format should be almost trivial in this \ncase (if you know XSLT!). Converting back the other way though would \nprobably require some code since XSLT operates primarily(exclusively?) \non XML AFAIK.\n\nFood for thought,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
