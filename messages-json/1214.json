I initially modified the strategy by making it randomly select\n&gt; from the set of available moves at any given point in a game. \n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; What this does is provide a more varied range of play, that hopefully\n&gt; will help evolve more robust players. \n\nWe thought about doing a probability distribution of suggested moves. \nIt&#39;s a good idea, and I&#39;ll be interested to see how it works out.\n\nAs for the range of play and robustness of evolved players, it&#39;s\nprobably worth noting that all of our hand-coded players have an\nelement of randomness (especially RAND!).\n\nThis makes the evaluation noisier, but in general we&#39;ve found that it\nprevents overfitting and leads to more robust players.  I think adding\nrandomness to pretty much any domain is important in order to\ncompensate for noise in the domain and produce more robust\ncontrollers/players/etc.\n\n&gt; This extra player hasn&#39;t greatly improved the evolved networks so far,\n&gt; although some experimenting with the above startegy is still required.\n\nKeep us posted.\n\nOn that note, we&#39;ve continued to tinker with Tic-Tac-Toe as we&#39;ve\nimplemented our active vision system.\n\nOne thing we&#39;ve noticed is that some of the activation function\napproximations (e.g., the EvSail sigmoid) tend to increase speed, but\nproduce less-than-desirable results.  In both XOR and TTT, the\napproximated activation functions lead to signficantly reduced\nperformance.  I&#39;d be interested to know if anyone else has done such\ncomparisons.\n\nIt looks like the smoothness of the curve in the activation function\nis really quite important, at least in the domains we&#39;ve worked in.\n\n&gt; 2) Phased searching - The current plan then is to implement the &#39;phased\n&gt; search&#39; technique discussed on this groups a while ago, and to see if it\n&gt; is able evolve better players. Before I do this though I want to\n&gt; implement a more simple problem domain, one that is fast to evaluate so\n&gt; that experiments can be run a lot faster....\n\nAgain, keep us up to date.\n\n&gt; 3)OCR - Optical Character Recognition. \n\nWe&#39;re going to be doing OCR as well. :)  We&#39;ll be using an active\nvision/roving eye approach.\n\nWe hope to be able to post some results in a few weeks.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
