One proble=\r\nm is that many interesting domains involve a domain-simulation (such as sim=\r\nulating physics), which makes evaluation take a long time.  So those types =\r\nof domains (like quadruped walking) are likely ruled out.  Strategic domain=\r\ns like board games are cheaper, but their expense comes from the opponent c=\r\nomputing its move.  Perhaps if you create your own very rough checkers heur=\r\nistic, or limit the ply-depth to which it can search, you could get a fast =\r\ncheckers player.  However, it is possible the problem could then become too=\r\n easy.  Parallel computing can be a help, but that depends on the computing=\r\n resources you have available.  It is possible that you will need to create=\r\n your own benchmark (perhaps some kind of image processing problem like the=\r\n boxes domain but a bit harder) to meet your needs.  Or, you might need to =\r\ntake an existing problem and modify it to be easier.  \n\nAnother problem is =\r\nthat there are other domains available (e.g. Keepaway soccer) but they are =\r\nnot in the same version of HyperNEAT so you can&#39;t use them directly with Hy=\r\nperNEAT C++ 2.6.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jan van der Lugt &lt;janlu=\r\ngt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; We are working on tuning the 30-som=\r\nething parameters for HyperNEAT (2.6 in\n&gt; our case) and we are looking for =\r\nhard problems that do not take too much\n&gt; computational effort, which means=\r\n a run can take about 15 minutes. We\n&gt; already tried most of the problems s=\r\nupplied with HyperNEAT, but most of them\n&gt; proved to be either too simple (=\r\nnear-optimal fitness within a few\n&gt; generations) or too expensive to run (o=\r\nne run can take hours). In this\n&gt; context a run is a complete run of HyperN=\r\nEAT with n generations, not the\n&gt; evaluation of 1 generation. We cut back o=\r\nn the number of generations\n&gt; (default is 300), so problems that take 30-45=\r\n minutes for a whole run are\n&gt; also ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our interest lies only in usin=\r\ng our tool to tune the parameters, so we won&#39;t\n&gt; use the source code of the=\r\n experiments for anything other than parameter\n&gt; tuning and we will hand ou=\r\nr results (e.g. parameters and best performance)\n&gt; back to you in exchange =\r\nfor letting us use your work (provided we got to\n&gt; tuning your problem). As=\r\n a result of this work, we hope to be able to\n&gt; release validated tuning so=\r\nftware for use with HyperNEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Jan van der Lugt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
