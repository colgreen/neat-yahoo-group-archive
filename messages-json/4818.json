When \n&gt; this happens I want to throw out the fitness of all the individuals in \n&gt; my population that were obtained from the old environment and force them \n&gt; to be reevaluated in the new environment. Does anyone have a suggestion \n&gt; for how this can be done?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Josh\n&gt;\n\nHey Josh,\n\nThe ExperimentRun::evaluatePopulation(...) function is the one that loops\nthrough the population and assigns fitness to all the individuals based on\nthe experiments. There are several experiments so that the application can\nbe multithreaded.\n\nAs long as you aren&#39;t using MPI, all you have to do to change an experiment\n(or the environment, as you call it), is loop through all of your\nexperiments in the ExperimentRun class, dynamically cast the experiment to\nyour specific experiment class, and call some function that changes the\nexperiment in the future.\n\nIt would be easiest to do this in between generations. In this case, you\nwouldn&#39;t have to worry about re-evaluating individuals who have already\nreceived a fitness, although I supposed it could be done anytime. If, during\na call to evaluatePopulation, the environment needs to be updated, you&#39;ll\nhave to write some code to abort the population evaluation and start it over\nagain, to ensure that the entire generation of individuals is evaluated the\nsame.\n\nJason G.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01E4_01CA1A5F.41F21580\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18812&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=\r\n=3D565143614-11082009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;Jason,&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D565143614-1108=\r\n2009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D565143614-11082009&gt;&lt;FONT color=\r\n=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;I&#39;m using MPI (OpenMPI) for RDMA of param=\r\netric sections and \npopulations.&nbsp; While this doesn&#39;t change the forwar=\r\nd operations of the \nexperiment, it does change everything else.&nbsp; Is t=\r\nhere something else I have \noverlooked?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr =\r\nalign=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D565143614-11082009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=\r\n=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN class=3D565143614-11082009&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff \nsize=3D2 face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;Ken Lloyd&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #0000=\r\nff 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; \ndir=\r\n=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr lang=3Den-us class=3DOutlookMessageHeader align=3D=\r\nleft&gt;\n  &lt;HR tabIndex=3D-1&gt;\n  &lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com \n  [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] &lt;B&gt;On Behalf Of &lt;/B&gt;Jason=\r\n Gauci&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; \n  Tuesday, August 11, 2009 7:09 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; \n =\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [neat] Re: HyperNEAT - force \n  re=\r\nevaluation of population&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;D=\r\nISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;--- In &lt;A \n  href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, Joshua \n =\r\n Auerbach &lt;joshua.auerbach@&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have a =\r\n\n  question for any of you that know the HyperNEAT code. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Basically=\r\n I am \n  trying to incorporate changing environmental conditions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; i=\r\nnto my \n  algorithm such that when a certain criteria is met the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; e=\r\nnvironment I \n  evaluate my evolved neural networks in is modified.
