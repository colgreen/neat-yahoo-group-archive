Updated deadlines !! [May 31, 2014]\n\nto be held at the\n14th Internat=\r\nional Conference on the Synthesis\nand Simulation of Living Systems (ALIFE-1=\r\n4)\n\nNew York City, 31 July 2014\n\nhttp://cs.union.edu/~rieffelj/EPS-Workshop=\r\n/index.html\n\nOrganizers: John Rieffel (Union College, USA), Jean-Baptiste M=\r\nouret (Univ. Pierre and Marie Curie, Nicolas Bredeche (Univ. Pierre and Mar=\r\nie Curie), and Evert Haadijk  (University of Amsterdam)\n\nABOUT:\n\nThe aim of=\r\n this half-day single-track workshop is to bring together\nresearchers who a=\r\nre currently involved in the Evolution of Physical\nSystems, as well as thos=\r\ne interested in the technique, in order to share\nideas and innovations. As =\r\nthe frontiers of artificial life move from the\ncomputer to the petri dish, =\r\nthe Evolution of Physical Systems offers to\nprovide inroads into domains wh=\r\nich are otherwise impossible to simulate.\n\nWe use the term Evolution of Phy=\r\nsical Systems (EPS) to refer to\nevolutionary algorithms which occur entirel=\r\ny in real-world physical\nsubstrates rather than in simulation. The term enc=\r\nompasses both parallel\nEmbodied Evolution (Watson et al., 2002), in which e=\r\nvolution is distributed\nacross a population of robots, as well as Evolution=\r\nary Robotics (Floreano\nand Mondada, 1994) where evaluation is serialized on=\r\n a single robot.\nNotable examples of EPS occur across a wide variety of sys=\r\ntems, ranging\nfrom Robotics (Zykov et al., 2004)] to FPGAs (Thompson, 1996)=\r\n to 3D\nprinters (Rieffel and Sayles, 2010). Although EPS comes at a cost (t=\r\nhe\nspeed of the real world, unlike CPUs, does not follow Moore&#39;s Law), by\nd=\r\nefinition it avoids the &quot;reality gap&quot; imposed by simulation, and has\nproduc=\r\ned novel and tangeable real-world results.\n\nThe first two EPS Workshops at =\r\nALIFE13 and ECAL &#39;13 were tremendous\nsuccesses. We hope to continue the tra=\r\ndition at ALIFE14. We will have time\nfor 4-6 speakers, as well as an extend=\r\ned panel session on the promises and\npitfalls of the Evolution of Physical =\r\nSystems. In addition, this year we\nwill also feature a poster session.\n\nWe =\r\ninvite authors to submit a 1-page abstract describing research or a\nreview/=\r\ndiscussion related to the Evolution of Physical Systems.\n\nFollowing the wor=\r\nkshop, we will invite participants and attendees to submit\nto an upcoming s=\r\npecial issue of Artificial Life Journal (MIT Press) devoted\nto the Evolutio=\r\nn of Physical Systems.\n\nHow to Submit: E-mail the workshop chair (rieffelj@=\r\nunion.edu) with your\nname, contact info, and a PDF containing your 1 page s=\r\nubmission.\n\nDates\nSubmission Deadline: May 31, 2014\n* Author Notification: =\r\nJune 7th, 2014\n* Early Bird Registration: June 13, 2014\n* Workshop Date: Ju=\r\nly 31, 2014\n\nBest regards,\n=97 Jean-Baptiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.=\r\nfr/~mouret/\n\n\n"}}
