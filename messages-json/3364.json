I&#39;m \nsure you&#39;ve thought about these things much more than me, especially \nsince these aren&#39;t much more than 2 second impulses through my tiny brain :)\n\n* As Ken says, objective function is going to be important, but I think \nit may not be the *most* important step toward success.\n\n* I wondered about the ability of your body configuration to actually \nstand up?  In that sense, are segment masses appropriate?  Joint limits? \n  Joint accelerations?  Can the muscular forces react quickly and \nforcefully enough?  For example, I can recover from leaning/falling \nforward with a single leg (i.e. a &quot;lunge&quot;).  I can furthermore support \nmy entire body weight with a single leg.\n\n* I believe we humans have an AWFUL LOT of feedback.  Is it ten times as \nmuch feedback as it actually is muscle command paths?  Something like \nthat.  Anyway, seems that this task is very heavily dependent on lots of \ngood feedback.  As an example, I&#39;m seeing quite a bit of this: a) find a \nposition that is nearly balanced, b) hold it, c) fall over.  What&#39;s your \nfeedback look like right now?\n\n* I&#39;m also seeing quite a bit of the weird &quot;squatting toe-stand&quot; \nposition, for lack of a better description.  This brings to mind the \nidea of pain.  It hurts me to stand on my toes.  More feedback.\n\n* The problem of balance is incredibly complex (like I need to mention \nthis, right?).  There&#39;s a certain level of granularity that are probably \nbeyond simulation.  For example, we use our toes quite a bit when \nstanding ourselves upright.  In some ways, this extra complexity may be \nnecessary to efficiently stand; however, in bigger ways (as Ken eludes \nto), they only complicate the search space.\n\n* One fitness related idea I had was to reward individuals that use less \nenergy.  For example, to balance, I&#39;d move my arms first, because it&#39;s \neasier, than moving my legs.\n\n* I&#39;d like to see you really use the &quot;Hyper&quot; part of &quot;HyperNEAT&quot;.  That \nis, evolve something simple, than increase the substrate density with \n100&#39;s or even 1000&#39;s of nodes.\n\nOverall, it&#39;s a very cool project.  I&#39;m looking forward to your next \nupload and please keep up the great work!!!\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
