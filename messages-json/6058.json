I think we essentially agree...the fundam=\r\nental thing should be the &quot;whether I learned something&quot; criterion. And I wo=\r\nuld qualify that as &quot;whether I learned something *general*&quot;, i.e., that I t=\r\nhink that will apply to other systems.\n\nA quantitative comparison is often =\r\na good way to demonstrate something clearly. Then one can test significance=\r\n, etc. However, one can also make quantitative comparisons that do not cont=\r\nribute to a clear take-away. For example, a common problem is papers that m=\r\neasure something very specific to a particular system, while failing to giv=\r\ne the reader any confidence that the conclusions can be generalized to othe=\r\nr systems. Thus clearly it&#39;s possible to test a hypothesis, or make a quant=\r\nitative comparison, that does not help the reader &quot;learn something&quot; from th=\r\ne paper.\n\nYes I agree that in our field we should have the very highest sta=\r\nndards! I&#39;m not saying that every paper that says &quot;look, cool simulated rob=\r\nots&quot; should be accepted. (And yes, I do feel your frustration with a histor=\r\nic glut of papers that show cool videos but don&#39;t try to provide any enduri=\r\nng take-away lesson.) I am saying that if a paper shows &quot;unprecedented comp=\r\nlexity&quot; (subjectively defined) in the robot behavior, that is a real contri=\r\nbution of the paper (and should push the reviewer toward acceptance - along=\r\n with good clear writing, reproducibility, etc. etc.)\n\nIn the GDS track we&#39;=\r\nre pursuing something called &quot;complexity&quot; which we don&#39;t yet agree how how =\r\nto measure. When we do have good measures of complexity in the future, then=\r\n we will move into a more quantitatively demanding era of our field. But in=\r\n the meantime if something does appear to be subjectively &quot;more complex&quot; th=\r\nan what has been published before, I don&#39;t think we should penalize the aut=\r\nhor for not being able to measure it. It is currently a shortcoming of the =\r\nwhole field.\n\n(Definitely a primary goal of the track should be to come up =\r\nwith suitable measures of complexity! We are not yet articulating this well=\r\n enough in the call for papers.)\n\nSo in the GDS track in particular, we are=\r\n in this special (short-lived, I hope!) period where we don&#39;t yet know how =\r\nto measure the main thing we are after! But generally, in any scientific fi=\r\neld, that may be the case from time to time, especially in new fields. Vict=\r\norian naturalists spent a lot of time observing and describing nature; late=\r\nr generations started to quantify evolution with population genetics. That&#39;=\r\ns OK.\n\nAgain, yes we agree, the fundamental criterion should be how importa=\r\nnt and general are the lessons we learn from a paper. I am glad to hash thr=\r\nough these issues!\n\nCheers,\n\nMike\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jean-Baptis=\r\nte Mouret &lt;mandor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; On 20 avr. 2013, at 20:35, =\r\nJeff Clune wrote:\n&gt; &gt; However, my point is that you don&#39;t *always* need a q=\r\nuantitative test. I agree that there are many papers that describe some ver=\r\ny complex system, show some cool results, and we don&#39;t learn anything. But =\r\nsometimes there are papers that show something extremely impressive and don=\r\n&#39;t have any informative quantitative measures, and we learn a lot. It is th=\r\ne job of the reviewer to judge whether there is a contribution: but a revie=\r\nwer should not start with the assumption that &quot;if there is no quantitative =\r\ntest, it&#39;s not science and is not publishable.&quot; My guess is that you agree =\r\nwith that, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree. What I was trying to explain in the previou=\r\ns e-mail was: (1) we need to learn something from the paper and (2) quantit=\r\native analysis is an easy way to argue something in a convincing way.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI agree that the reviewer should not start with the assumption &quot;if there is=\r\n no quantitative test, it&#39;s not science and is not publishable.&quot; However, I=\r\n think that it is much harder to write a convincing paper without any quant=\r\nitative test than with the help of measures/comparisons/etc. As a result, a=\r\ns a reviewer, I start being suspicious when I see a paper without strong qu=\r\nantitative results. I may accept it, but I know that the challenge =97 for =\r\nthe author =97 will be more difficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another important point is that=\r\n there is, in my opinion, a strong correlation between weak papers and pape=\r\nrs without strong quantitative results. Correlation does not imply causatio=\r\nn, but we somehow learn to have an intuitive bad feeling when we see a pape=\r\nr without quantitative results.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is one strong argument for not =\r\nmandating a quantitative test: we have not created AI yet, so there are man=\r\ny things that humans can judge better than computers/quantitative tests. Ta=\r\nke computer vision, for example. All of us are blown away by the images tha=\r\nt resulted on Picbreeder,\n&gt; \n&gt; [Picbreeder is not related at all with compu=\r\nter vision]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder taught us a lot about why CPPNs are powerf=\r\nul and interesting, but they did not do so with numbers. My guess is that t=\r\nhe Picbreeder papers did jump through some hoops to provide numbers to sati=\r\nsfy reviewers that insist on them (I forget at this point, it&#39;s been a whil=\r\ne since I read those papers), but those numbers likely taught us very littl=\r\ne about the central advance. \n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed. Sometimes, examples can teach us=\r\n many things. But, again, it&#39;s hard to make a strong points with examples. =\r\nI&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible and your example is probably a good example.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same is true for many domains: if I come up with a new story-t=\r\nelling algorithm, the judgement of whether it is a huge advance would be yo=\r\nu listening to the stories and thinking about whether they feel more natura=\r\nl and impressive than what came before.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is typically quantified b=\r\ny taking 30 people and make them grade your story. My subjective opinion do=\r\nes not count that much.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you agree?\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with you. Neverth=\r\neless, our field is young and I think we have to put pressure to have stron=\r\ng papers on which we can build strong foundations for future researches. On=\r\ne way to put this pressure is to have high standards and encourage to measu=\r\nre everything that is measurable/comparable, so that the average paper is a=\r\ns good as possible. Keep in mind that papers like &quot;look, cool simulated rob=\r\nots!&quot; are making our field weaker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I&#39;m advocating that we shoul=\r\nd judge papers by how much they teach us. I think we agree on this. Quantit=\r\native analysis is an easy way to teach something to the reader, other ways =\r\nare possible. But they are harder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =97 JBM\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
