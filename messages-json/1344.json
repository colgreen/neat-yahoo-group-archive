It is currently averaging 26 generations an hour, \nwhich is not bad compared to what it was (less than 2).\n\nUnfortunately, it hasn&#39;t gotten anywhere to speak of.  The fitness is \nremaining mostly flat, right down near the bottom where it has been since it \nstarted.  But then, I knew this was a hard domain...  Which is why I wanted \nto use NEAT:  I wanted to use just the right topology for it!  :)\n\nRight now, there are 7 machines at work and 4 at home working on the \nexperiment.  3 of the 4 at home aren&#39;t really that fast, either.  Whereas 6 \nof the 7 at work are pretty fast.  So I talked to the IT guys at work.  \nThey&#39;re going to let me take my controller machine to work and give it a \nspot in the server room.  That&#39;ll reduce the latency in transferring work \npackets to those machines.  I estimate about a 2x increase in processing \nspeed once the controller is close to the worker machines and the \ngenerational latency is eliminated.  That&#39;ll be nice.\n\nI&#39;ll probably give it about another week or so, and then I&#39;ll start worrying \nabout whether or not it will be capable of finding a solution to what I have \nasked it to do.  I *know* it is capable of the first task I have asked of it \n(model the pixel inputs).  I&#39;m not so sure about the second part (a \nmechanism for querying that model).\n\nA thought just occurred to me, and I want you guy&#39;s input into it.  When I \nsplit a connection to make a new node, should I be adding a connection to \nthe bias input immediately, rather than relying on it to evolve on its own?  \nThat way it has a means by which it can make the most of that node right \naway?  What do you think?\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
