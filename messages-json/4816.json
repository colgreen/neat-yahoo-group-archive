When \n&gt; this happens I =\r\n want to throw out the fitness of all the individuals in \n&gt; my population t=\r\nhat were obtained from the old environment and force them \n&gt; to be reevalua=\r\nted in the new environment.  Does anyone have a suggestion \n&gt; for how this =\r\ncan be done?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Josh\n&gt;\n\nHey Josh,\n\nThe ExperimentRun::evaluateP=\r\nopulation(...) function is the one that loops through the population and as=\r\nsigns fitness to all the individuals based on the experiments.  There are s=\r\neveral experiments so that the application can be multithreaded.\n\nAs long a=\r\ns you aren&#39;t using MPI, all you have to do to change an experiment (or the =\r\nenvironment, as you call it), is loop through all of your experiments in th=\r\ne ExperimentRun class, dynamically cast the experiment to your specific exp=\r\neriment class, and call some function that changes the experiment in the fu=\r\nture.\n\nIt would be easiest to do this in between generations.  In this case=\r\n, you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about re-evaluating individuals who have alrea=\r\ndy received a fitness, although I supposed it could be done anytime.  If, d=\r\nuring a call to evaluatePopulation, the environment needs to be updated, yo=\r\nu&#39;ll have to write some code to abort the population evaluation and start i=\r\nt over again, to ensure that the entire generation of individuals is evalua=\r\nted the same.\n\nJason G.\n\n\n\n"}}
