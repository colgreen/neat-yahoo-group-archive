I needed \naccess to an expert in the domain or I needed to greatly increase my \nknowledge of the domain. To that end I opened a free game account with \na currency trading platform and began experimenting with a few existing \nmanual trading systems. I&#39;m not yet ready to start coding again (or to \nstart trading with real money!) but I can share my thoughts to date. \nAnyone familiar with Dr. Elders&#39; books on trading will notice the \ninfluence.\n\nThe trading systems I&#39;m interested in have a setup and trigger. Where \nthe setup is a specific set of market conditions that may lead to the \ntrigger. The trigger is the actual flag to enter the trade. The idea is \nto filter the historical data to use only test cases that match a \nspecific setup. Depending on the rules of the trading system, the setup \nmay only occur most often during a trending phase or it could be a \nsetup that targets swings during a sideways or consolidation phase. I \nthink either can be profitable but might be best approached as \ndifferent systems. In any event, the goal is to evolve a network(s) to \ngive a confidence measure based on the trigger occurring after a \nspecific setup. Any trading system, good or otherwise will having \nlosing trades. I&#39;ll be perfectly happy If I can take a good system and \nfilter out some losing trades without throwing out too many nice ones.\n\nThe trading systems I&#39;m working with are price action and standard \nindictor based and involve two timeframes. The trading timeframe and a \ntimeframe 5 orders of magnitude greater. If the trading timeframe is \nbased on daily data, the longer timeframe would be based on weekly \ndata. The inputs would be the indicator(s) from each timeframe along \nwith the price data for each timeframe. Each training case would be \ndata spanning some portion of the setup to the trigger. The target \noutput would be 1.0 for the greatest successful result over the \ntraining set while 0.0 would be the worst result over the training set. \nThe result is defined as the difference in price from the entry trigger \nto the exit signal. (or stop loss reached) The training cases would be \nlimited to setups that actually result in the trigger occurring as the \ntrade would not be entered without the trigger occurring anyway.\n\nA typical trading system might involve two indicators and price (or \ndifferences) for each timeframe. That could involve a few dozen inputs \ndepending how many time steps of the long term timeframe are required. \nOr could this be setup as multiple continuous time steps with a single \noutput at the end of the series?\n\nJust my thoughts at this point. This approach might short cut some of \nthe more grievous problems of the domain.\n\nI have really enjoyed reading this list over the last several months. \nThanks much to Ken and everyone involved.\n\n- jim\n\n\n\n\n"}}
