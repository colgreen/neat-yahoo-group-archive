This\nbasically prevents me from having to write the LIKE\nstatements etc....\nWell I was thinking about rathing than using that\ncoming up with a set of inputs such as Page UpTime,\nNum Clicks, etc.. and using those inputs into the\nNeural Network and using Ga to evolve the weights. \nWell I have looked at the smartsweepers example on\nai-junkie and Matt has done a gerat job, but I am not\nsure how I could apply it to my solution. For instance\ninthe smartsweepers problem he had a controller which\niterataed through the sweepers and each sweeper had a\nbrain independent of the other sweepers. For my\nproblem would I have a SearchSweeper with its own\nbrain and then it would get a list of results from the\ndatabase(perhaps FullText INdexing still) and then\nrank them on the basis of the weights of the inputs or\nshould each search result have its own brain and\ndetermine its own ranking?\nDoes that help, not sure if it does.\nThanks,\nRog\n\n--- Colin Green &lt;cgreen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Roger,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry you still lost me! I think you need to back up\n&gt; a bit and explain \n&gt; in lay mans terms what you want to achieve. Do you\n&gt; want to implement an \n&gt; actual search engine where a search phrase is input\n&gt; and a load of \n&gt; results are output? or do you want to somehow extend\n&gt; the results from an \n&gt; existing search engine?\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; Roger Smith wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hey all,\n&gt; &gt;I am going to rephrase my question.\n&gt; &gt;I guess what I am trying to figure out is if I\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt;have a SearchController which has &quot;The Brain&quot; (the\n&gt; &gt;neural net) and then when it searches it filters\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;search results through the weights to get the\n&gt; ranking\n&gt; &gt;OR \n&gt; &gt;does each Search result have a brain?\n&gt; &gt;Any thoughts, ideas?\n&gt; &gt;Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;Rog\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\n\n\n \n\n \n\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nRoger R.
