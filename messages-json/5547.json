Fairly obvious I guess but I thought it was worth\nmentioning.\n\nI was looking at these domains again in particular because I&#39;m about\nto use them to test use of radial basis functions (new to SharpNEAT)\nand these are good examples of &#39;fractured&#39; domains that are possibly\nconducive to solution by RBF networks.\n\nAnd as a final note, 11-multiplexer is still a pretty hard problem for\nNEAT so it&#39;s going to be interesting to see how RBF-NEAT performs on\nthis metric in particular.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
