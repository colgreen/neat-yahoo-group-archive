It&#39;s a free download\nfrom http://sourceforge.net/projects/annevolve.\nEvSail is a program that uses neuroevolution to obtain\nan artificial neural network that can navigate a\nsimulated sailboat.  It is written in standard C and\nwill compile and execute correctly on all platforms. \nThere is no graphics included in the software,\nalthough trajectory tables are produced that are\neasily plotted with gnuplot or other graphing utility.\n\nThe ANN created by EvSail guides the simulated\nsailboat by continuously adjusting the rudder and sail\nangle in order to circumnavigate an island in shifting\nwinds.  The weights of the ANN are found by simulated\nevolution (GA).  The ANN is a multi-layer perceptron\nwith (optionally) one or two hidden layers.\n\nThere is plenty of documentation; everything is\nexplained in detail.  In addition, questions may be\nsubmittted to the annevolve mailing list, and will\nreceive prompt answers.\n\nMitchell Timin\n\n-- \n&quot;In theory, there is no difference between theory and\npractice.
