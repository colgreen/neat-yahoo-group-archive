I&#39;ll readily admit that if they were encoded then it was far \nless directly than in other AI approaches, but...\n\nWhat I&#39;m getting at is that the choice of coordinate space for the \nhidden layer (2D) and the choice of sampling pattern and interval \n(8x8 square grid) were supplied in the experimental setup...\n\nI don&#39;t have a full fix for this, but what I&#39;d like to see is \nexperiments along the lines of (some of these overlap):\n\na) use hidden layers of differing size and dimensionality.  This may \nnot degrade performance at all, in that there is no reason for the \nnodes in the hidden layer to be entirely geometric in their \n&quot;meaning&quot;.  e.g. there may be a node in the hidden layer which means \n&quot;number of my pieces in corner locations&quot; -- the meaning may not be \ndirectly related to the area of the input layer corresponding to the \nnode in the hidden layer...  I&#39;d be inclined to try:\n\na1) 1d hidden layer of various lengths (akin to degrading to a \nnon-hyper NEAT approach except you still have half the capability to \nexploit geometry, e.g. the CPPN can still exploit regularities in \ncoordinates on the input layer)\na2) 3d hidden layer of similar volume to the original but different \nshapes, e.g. original was 8x8 = 64, 4x4x4 is a different shape but same size...\na3) high-dimensional but small hidden layer, such as \n2x2x2x2x2x2.  You may want to look to the types of function in the \nCPPN for this, e.g. because each ordinate on the hidden layer is \nbinary, you may want binary operators in the CPPN\n\nb) change the sample grid on the hidden layer:\n\nb1) over sample x2, x3\nb2) sample the 7x7 or 9x9 grids that correspond to the square corners \non the input layer\nb3) under sample by x2, x3\nb4) offset each sample position in the hidden layer by a constant \nrandom vector (different for each sample but fixed for the \nexperiment), vary the size 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5...\n\nc) change the coordinate system.  I do wonder whether in defining the \nCPPN in terms of 2D coordinates (OK, 2x 2D) you have accidentally \nbuilt in fore-knowledge of the geometry...  Try:\n\nc1) input and hidden layers sampled at same points but using polar coordinates\nc2) as previous but one polar and one Cartesian\nc3) rotate the sample points in the hidden layer by: 90 degrees \n(should have no effect?), 45 degrees, or 10 degrees\n\nI think experiments such as these would hammer down whether hyperNEAT \nis fully discovering the geometry, or whether it was gifted with a \ngeometric system.  In the latter case it is still discovering \nregularities, but it is doing it within a geometric framework that it \nalready knew.\n\nGreat experiment as it stands though!  And congratulations for \ngetting it closer to the mainstream (not that we need them :-) ).\n\nJust a quick question, were &quot;kings&quot; used in the rule base, e.g. when \na piece reaches the back row it becomes a &quot;king&quot; and can move \nbackwards...  If so I guess you used input values of greater \nmagnitude for those?\n\nRegards,\n\nIan\n\n\n"}}
