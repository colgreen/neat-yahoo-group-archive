XOR meets this need somewhat, but\nis really too sim=\r\nple to do anything other than a simple confirmation.\n\nIt would be nice to h=\r\nave a reasonably easy task to code that would\nallow comparison between NEAT=\r\n implementations and other approaches. \nIn his 2002 paper, Ken chose pole b=\r\nalancing, specifically double pole\nbalancing without velocity information, =\r\nand with a punishment for very\nfast oscillations.  He showed that NEAT solv=\r\ned the problem more\nquickly than previous approaches.\n\nBut in conversations=\r\n with Colin, he&#39;s noted that Ken&#39;s solution to\nDPNV only required something=\r\n like 16 connections and 1 hidden node (I\nthink).  Colin noted that in orde=\r\nr to test phased searching\n(alternating complexifying and pruning phases), =\r\nthis task was\ninsufficient, since the population complexity never got high =\r\nenough to\nactivate the pruning phase.  Is this task almost too easy to real=\r\nly\nuse as a reliable benchmark for NEAT?\n\nThere have been some variations t=\r\no pole balancing, but they seem to be\nrather ad hoc.  For example:\n\n2D pole=\r\n balancing -- Allowing the pole to fall in any direction and\nallowing the &quot;=\r\ncart&quot; to move in any direction on a 2D plane.  Was used\nto test ESP in 1998=\r\n I think.\n\nParticle Chasing -- Presented in a paper at GECCO this year, inv=\r\nolving\na pole which the neural network can vary the length of at any given\n=\r\ntime step by extending or retracting, with the goal of getting its tip\nas c=\r\nlose as possible to a randomly-moving point hovering above the\ncart.\n\nDo pe=\r\nople on this list see these or other approaches as viable\nbenchmarks?  Are =\r\nthere others in the literature that people know about\nthat would work bette=\r\nr?\n\nOr do you think DPNV is sufficient as a benchmark?  Could we or should\n=\r\nwe come up with a more complex control task?  Or a small suite of\neasily-im=\r\nplementable benchmarks?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
