This chromosome is a\n&gt;mutated clone (it has a single parent).  Chromosomes\n&gt;that result from crossover have a primary and\n&gt;secondary parent.\n&gt;\nyup, very similar to what I came up with. Which basically means all we \nwould really need to do is settle on trivial details such as tag and \nattribute names - I&#39;ll adopt yours since they seem entirely \nreasonable/straightforward. Perhaps some additional data at the head of \na file to indicate which implementation and code version the data came \nfrom and other stuff like that. Note that the XML I posted was purely a \nNN definition - not a genome/chromosome. The distinction was necessary \nbecause I was using an indirect encoding.  I never got around to \noutputting genome XML but with NEAT being a direct encoding one XML \ndialect does both jobs.\n\n\n&gt;We also use XML to persist information about runs, and\n&gt;we use XSL style sheets to convert the XML into SVG\n&gt;for display purposes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs Joseph said - very clever :)  Looking forward to seeing the output \nfrom these.\n\n&gt;&gt;I only ask \n&gt;&gt;as I work a lot with XML for my day job and it would\n&gt;&gt;seem sensible for \n&gt;&gt;all the various NEAT projects to have some kind of\n&gt;&gt;standard for \n&gt;&gt;transfering data. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes...I agree.  Hashing out some XML standards seems\n&gt;like an excellent use of this list. :)  Anybody got\n&gt;any strong opinions on formatting issues?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNot really. I personally try to keep tag and attribute names as short as \npossible since they get repeated so much and therefore add to file size \nbloat if they&#39;re to long. So e.g. instead of src-id I might have used \nsrc. And I might have used the word genome instead of chromosome in this \ncase - since the two mean the same thing within the context of NEAT \nAFAIK. These are pretty trivial/petty points though. Most schemas I see \nthese days define lower case tag/attribute names (e.g. xhtml / xforms \ntags are all lower case) -  note that XML is case sensitive.\n\nRegarding what sort of data to store, my initial instinct is to save the \nentire current population both at intervals and at the end of a run - \ncreating a population.xml file. Within that file we would store a list \nof &lt;chromosome&gt; tags and at the top some additional data about the run, \nin fact I imagine it would look something like...\n\n&gt;Here&#39;s an example of some of our run.xml:\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;run&gt;\n&gt;&lt;parameters&gt;\n&gt;&lt;num_generations&gt;10&lt;/num_generations&gt;\n&gt;&lt;pop_size&gt;10&lt;/pop_size&gt;\n&gt;&lt;neuron_mut_rate&gt;0.02&lt;/neuron_mut_rate&gt;\n&gt;&lt;connect_mut_rate&gt;0.04&lt;/connect_mut_rate&gt;\n&gt;&lt;weight_mut_rate&gt;0.75&lt;/weight_mut_rate&gt;\n&gt;&lt;survival_rate&gt;0.1&lt;/survival_rate&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/parameters&gt;\n&gt;&lt;generation id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&lt;fitness&gt;\n&gt;&lt;max&gt;75&lt;/max&gt;\n&gt;&lt;min&gt;38&lt;/min&gt;\n&gt;&lt;avg&gt;55.0&lt;/avg&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/fitness&gt;\n&gt;&lt;specie id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&gt;&lt;count&gt;2&lt;/count&gt;\n&gt;&lt;chromosome id=&quot;0&quot; fitness=&quot;48454710&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;&lt;chromosome id=&quot;1&quot; fitness=&quot;51381215&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;&lt;/specie&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGreat minds think alike eh ;) \n\nApart from my comments above about keeping names short this is \nessentially the dialect I had in mind. One trivial point - I would move \nthe &lt;count&gt; tag to be an attribute within the &lt;specie&gt; tag.\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
