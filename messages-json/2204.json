First, is this an\n&gt; ANJI-specific question?  Which software are you using?  I just want to\n&gt; make sure since I think there is an error in the calculations you are\n&gt; citing.  More below...\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whilst calculating the number of offspring for a valid (i.e. non\n&gt; &gt; extinct and size &gt; 0) specie, the count returns 0.  This is\n&gt; &gt; particularly prevalent in large species where the adjusted fitness\n&gt; &gt; becomes quite small comapared with the rest of the other, and\n&gt; usually\n&gt; &gt; much less populous, species. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This becomes even more marked if I boost young species fitness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as I understand, the offspring is calculated as follows.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (av adjusted specie fitness) / (total of all species av adjusted\n&gt; &gt; fitnesses) * Population size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This formula looks wrong.  It turns out there are a number of ways to\n&gt; express the number of offspring (all being mathematically equivalent\n&gt; formulations), but the specifics are crucial.  And this looks like it\n&gt; has some specifics wrong.  The formula should be:\n&gt; \n&gt; Offspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / Total_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss)\n&gt; * PopulationSize \n&gt; \n&gt; Note that &quot;adjusted&quot; never comes into it.  The presence of the word\n&gt; &quot;adjusted&quot; in your formulation implies to me that you may be\n&gt; double-adjusting.  The adjustments come in when you are modifying\n&gt; fitnesses on a per-organism basis and assigning offspring on a\n&gt; per-organism basis.  In other words, each organism has its fitness\n&gt; divided by the total number of individuals in its species.  But if you\n&gt; then SUM all those adjusted fitness together, what do you get?  You\n&gt; get AverageSpeciesFitness, i.e. the simple average *unadjusted*\n&gt; fitness of all the organisms in the species.   \n&gt; \n&gt; The point is this:  either you adjust the fitnesses of individuals and\n&gt; then sum those adjusted fitnesses (as I do in my version of NEAT), or\n&gt; you just take the average fitness of the species.  You do *not* do\n&gt; both.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note also that the denominator is the sum of all the average species\n&gt; fitnesses.  No adjustment in that part either.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem boils down to the fact that there are two ways to express\n&gt; offspring assigned in fitness sharing as it&#39;s done in NEAT: on a\n&gt; per-species or per-individual basis.  Equations in my papers are\n&gt; usually expressed per-offspring.  It&#39;s easier to understand\n&gt; intuitively on a per-offspring basis because in those equations you\n&gt; can see how the individual&#39;s fitness is being reduced according to its\n&gt; species size.  In other words the fitness of any individual matters\n&gt; less towards how many offspring the species gets the more individuals\n&gt; are in that species.  Averaging without adjusting, however, is just a\n&gt; different way to formulate the same concept in which you don&#39;t diretly\n&gt; see the reduction according to species size.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, imagine we have 3 species. Specie_1 has 3 members av\n&gt; raw\n&gt; &gt; fitness 0.85, Specie_2 has 2 members av raw fitness 0.82 and\n&gt; Specie_3\n&gt; &gt; has 145 members with av raw fitness 0f 0.9.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specie_1(adj) = 0.85/3 = 0.28333\n&gt; &gt; Specie_2(adj) = 0.82/2 = 0.41\n&gt; &gt; Specie_3(adj) = 0.9/145 = 0.006\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specie_1 then generates 61 offspring\n&gt; &gt; Specie_2 then generates 87 offspring\n&gt; &gt; Specie_3 then generates 2 offspring\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, this doesn&#39;t make sense.  If 0.9 is the average fitness of\n&gt; species 3 then it should be getting over 1/3rd of the offspring.  if a\n&gt; system is showing this behavior there may be a bug in the speciation\n&gt; code.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\n\n\n"}}
