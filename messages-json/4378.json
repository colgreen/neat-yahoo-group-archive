It&#39;s the # of evalua=\r\ntions that counts (and that is also how\nperformance is measured in machine =\r\nlearning in general: # evaluations\nto success).\n\nMy dissertation points out=\r\n the dramatic difference in # evaluations to\nsolve pole balancing between n=\r\normal population sizes and tiny\npopulation sizes.  This fact also shows why=\r\n pole balancing is a\nmisleading benchmark:  Population size probably eclips=\r\nes any other\nfactor in correlating with performance, which means any method=\r\n can be\nmade to look better by simply dropping the population size.  \n\nken\n=\r\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For p=\r\nole balancing, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; turns out that you can solve it fastest with a minus=\r\ncule\npopulation of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; size under 20 total (that&#39;s for the whole populatio=\r\nn!).   That is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because smaller populations are greedier (they concentr=\r\nate resources\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on a small part of the search space) and apparently pole=\r\n balancing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits greatly from greedy search.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s really=\r\n interesting. I have always thought the higher the\n&gt; &gt; population size the =\r\nbetter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello. I think Ken is saying that if you are measuring success=\r\n by fewest\n&gt; *evaluations* then it is better to have a lower population siz=\r\ne. You\nneed a\n&gt; lot of generations because you need to mutationally tune th=\r\ne\nweights, but\n&gt; you don&#39;t need that much diversity because you can just hi=\r\nll climb.\nSo if\n&gt; you cut the population size down, you get more generation=\r\ns for fewer\n&gt; evaluations. \n&gt; \n&gt; I do think it is the case that, all else e=\r\nqual, a larger population\nwill be\n&gt; better (on average: individual runs may=\r\n differ) if you are counting\nsuccess\n&gt; in terms of number of generations.\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
