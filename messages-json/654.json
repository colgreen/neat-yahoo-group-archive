In doing some runs with XOR with subtractive mutations, \n&gt; we found that our smallest solutions do not require a connection \n&gt; from the bias input node.  This led me to wonder what would happen \n&gt; if I were to start with a more minimal arhitecture.  I did some\nruns \n&gt; starting with 0 connections, and was still able to solve it in\nabout \n&gt; the same number of generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; So a few question:\n&gt; - has anyone else tinkered with alternate starting architectures? \n\nShimon (as you now know).\n\n&gt; - is there any reason to start with ANY hidden neurons or \n&gt; connections?  \n\nYes there is a reason to start with at least one connection, because\notherwise you have nothing to evaluate.  If you start with zero\nconnections you are just deferring the first evaluation to the future.\n\n&gt; - Ken, in your experiments, do you have the bias input fully \n&gt; connected along with the other inputs?\n&gt; \n\nYes I do.  (Although in XOR that just means connection to the output)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
