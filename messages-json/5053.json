There are a few ways=\r\n to look at this issue.  \n\nOne option is to take a hard-line perspective to=\r\n see how far the most extreme form of CPPN-alone argument can go.  It would=\r\n go something like:  We can just look at the environment in this case as an=\r\nother geometric coordinate cue in lieu of something better.  That is, the a=\r\nir hitting these cells is just a way of telling them they are in that part =\r\nof the lung.  If you look at it that way, it might not be so profound.  Tha=\r\nt is, a coordinate would have been just as good for communicating such info=\r\nrmation as an arbitrary environmental cue.  And this kind of environment-ba=\r\nsed trick hardly addresses the global probably of cells needing to know whe=\r\nre they are.\n\nOn the other hand, it&#39;s probably more reasonable to acknowled=\r\nge a useful role for the environment in some aspects of development.  In th=\r\nis case, it may well be that oxygen coming in is a good heuristic for knowi=\r\nng what kind of cell you should be.  So the environment was put to good use=\r\n.  Yet if you look at the overall construction of the body, it appears over=\r\nall there is only so much the environment can tell you (internally), so it =\r\nshouldn&#39;t be overstated.\n\nYet the one place where there is evidently a ton =\r\nof environmental influence is the brain.  Learning or adaptation is a form =\r\nof environmentally-mediated development.  All the signals that come in thro=\r\nugh the sensors ultimately shape the connectivity of the brain, so the envi=\r\nronment is playing a strong role in the development of adaptive neural netw=\r\norks.  Certainly we will need to ultimately capture that capability to evol=\r\nve realistic brains.\n\nYet I believe such functionality can complement and e=\r\nxtend CPPNs without replacing their central role in encoding neural structu=\r\nres.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; The article below is interesting. It suggests that lung c=\r\nells know to become\n&gt; lung cells based on the air passing back and forth ov=\r\ner them. It is\n&gt; intriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows th=\r\nat sometimes\n&gt; nature does not use geometric position (provided by complex =\r\nprotein\n&gt; patterning) to make differentiation decisions, but uses environme=\r\nntal cues.\n&gt; Of course, HyperNEAT could create the same end product just wi=\r\nth positional\n&gt; information, but it might be easier to accomplish this with=\r\n simple\n&gt; environmental-based tricks like this one. Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; New Scie=\r\nntist\n&gt; Breath of fresh air transforms stem cells\n&gt; \n&gt; 14:32 09 November 20=\r\n09 by Andy Coghlan\n&gt; For similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n=\r\n&gt; Mimicking the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough =\r\nto\n&gt; transform stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physi=\r\ncal&quot;\n&gt; techniques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth f=\r\nactors\n&gt; alone aren&#39;t enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lindsey Van Haute of the Free University=\r\n of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium and\n&gt; colleagues spread human embryonic stem =\r\ncells onto a porous membrane. The\n&gt; cells were fed from beneath by nutrient=\r\ns and from above by a fluid that\n&gt; encouraged them to multiply. Removing tw=\r\no chemicals from the growth fluid\n&gt; kickstarted differentiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Four =\r\ndays later, the team removed the fluid covering the cells, leaving them\n&gt; o=\r\npen to the air while still being sustained and supported from below, as\n&gt; t=\r\nhey would be in the trachea. After 24 days the cells had developed surface\n=\r\n&gt; proteins that identified them as specific types of lung cell, including\n&gt;=\r\n alveolar cells, which allow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\n=\r\n&gt; bacteria and dirt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Physical influence\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our study proves differe=\r\nntiation into lung cells is influenced by physical\n&gt; forces,&quot; says Van Haut=\r\ne. Previously, stem cells have been made to\n&gt; differentiate into lung cells=\r\n using a cocktail of different growth factors,\n&gt; but Haute says using physi=\r\ncal forces might be simpler.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Physical forces are certainly a factor i=\r\nn getting the lung lining to be\n&gt; fully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Im=\r\nperial College London, who has made\n&gt; alveolar cells from mouse stem cells =\r\nusing growth factors alone. &quot;But I find\n&gt; it difficult to believe that raw =\r\nstem cells would differentiate through to\n&gt; these uncommon types of cells s=\r\nolely in response to physical forces.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Haute&#39;s team plans to use the c=\r\nells they created to study lung diseases,\n&gt; such as cystic fibrosis. Such c=\r\nells might one day be used to treat people\n&gt; with damaged lung tissue, but =\r\nonly if the cells can be made from a person&#39;s\n&gt; own tissue. This could be d=\r\none by converting the cells first into induced\n&gt; pluripotent stem cells.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Journal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI: 10.1186/1465-9921-10-105\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan Stat=\r\ne University\n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
