BTW, I will also be\npresenting a paper that utilizes the same domain at the same GECCO\ntrack, and it also has been nominated for the Best Paper Award.  It\nintroduces a new abstraction of indirect encoding for evolving\nsymmetric and modular neural networks:\n\n   http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?valsalam:gecco09\n\nSo it looks like we are going to have an exciting competition for the\nBest Paper Award :-)\n\nSome thoughts and questions on your paper:\n\n-- Table 1, listing the gaits for different leg orderings, is\n   particularly interesting because it gives insight into the type of\n   patterns that the CPPN tends to produce. Do you have online videos\n   of the different gaits?\n\n-- What is the phase difference between the legs for the gaits with\n   left-right and front-back symmetry (Table 1)?  In particular, do\n   they qualify as pace and bound respectively, i.e. is the phase\n   difference between the sides a half-period? (I usually find it\n   useful to plot the leg angles as a function of time to determine\n   the leg phases more accurately than by observing the videos.)\n\n-- What kind of gaits did the HyperNEAT experiments with randomized\n   geometry produce?  Are they similar to the gaits in Table 1, with\n   all four legs in synchrony occurring in the majority of trials?\n\n-- In the randomized experiments, do you think keeping the PRYS inputs\n   fixed and randomizing only the other inputs would produce better\n   results?  It seems to me that including the PRYS inputs in the\n   randomization may disrupt the geometry more since they do not have\n   a clear geometric interpretation.\n\n-- You mention that each controller was simulated for 6000 time steps,\n   but the simulation was terminated early if the controller did not\n   produce good behavior.  Do such early termination occur during the\n   evaluation of champions evolved by HyperNEAT as well?  Also, how\n   long was each time step?\n\nThanks!\nVinod\n\n\nAt Wed, 15 Apr 2009 20:07:52 -0400,\nJeff Clune wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Below is a link to a new HyperNEAT paper that I will present at GECCO 2009\n&gt; this summer. It studies how sensitive HyperNEAT is to different geometric\n&gt; representations of the same problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am especially excited about this paper because it was nominated for the\n&gt; Best Paper Award in the Generative and Developmental Systems track. If you\n&gt; are going to GECCO this year, and enjoyed the paper, please keep it in mind\n&gt; when casting your ballot.\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper can be viewed here:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HyperNEATSensitivity\n&gt; ToGeometry.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; HyperNEAT, a generative encoding for evolving artificial neural networks\n&gt; (ANNs), has the unique and powerful ability to exploit the geometry of a\n&gt; problem (e.g., symmetries) by encoding ANNs as a function of a problem&#39;s\n&gt; geometry. This paper provides the first extensive analysis of the\n&gt; sensitivity of HyperNEAT to different geometric representations of a\n&gt; problem. Understanding how geometric representations affect the quality of\n&gt; evolved solutions should improve future designs of such representations.\n&gt; HyperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\n&gt; quadruped robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representation.\n&gt; Here, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometric\n&gt; representations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the quality\n&gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantially affected by\n&gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a direct encoding\n&gt; control even with randomized geometric representations, but performs even\n&gt; better when a human engineer designs a representation that reflects the\n&gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even choices in geometric\n&gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori can significantly affect\n&gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representation can bias the type of\n&gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right symmetry more common than\n&gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest that HyperNEAT practitioners can\n&gt; obtain good results even if they do not know how to geometrically represent\n&gt; a problem, and that further improvements are possible with a well-chosen\n&gt; geometric representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As always, I look forward to any questions or comments you may have.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
