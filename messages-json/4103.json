But I guess that the best \nway =\r\nis to recompute the novelty scores at regular intervals.. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;lehman.154@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; G=\r\nlad to hear that you are interested in the method, and that you&#39;ve\n&gt; been a=\r\nble to implement it.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are correct, the novelty of each individual i=\r\ns calculated with\n&gt; respect to the current population and the archive.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yes, sparseness in the behavioral space around an individual is\n&gt; equated =\r\nwith novelty, which is used for the fitness of the \nindividual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ideall=\r\ny, novelty would recomputed for each individual in the current\n&gt; generation=\r\n after each evaluation. In our implementation it is \nallowed\n&gt; to get stale=\r\n for a few evaluations (in the same frequency that\n&gt; individuals are respec=\r\niated according to rtNEAT). In our \nexperiments,\n&gt; allowing for a bit stale=\r\nness did not effect the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, in the scenario you describ=\r\ne, each of the individuals \nwould\n&gt; now have a lower novelty, the original =\r\nindividual included. This\n&gt; reflects that the area around these individuals=\r\n in behavior space is\n&gt; more dense than it previously was. As more individu=\r\nals come into a\n&gt; particular area, the novelty of all of them drops, and pr=\r\novides\n&gt; pressure for individuals to do something new in order to be seen a=\r\ns \nnovel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know if you have any more implementation questions, I=\r\n&#39;ll be\n&gt; releasing my source based off the rtNEAT package in the next few \n=\r\nweeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pet=\r\nar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I implemented novelty sear=\r\nch and the maze navigation task (it \n&gt; &gt; works! :)), but I need to ask you =\r\nabout something. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when a new individual is spawned from the pop=\r\nulation, its \nnovelty is \n&gt; &gt; computed based on the domain-specific distanc=\r\ne measure to all \nother \n&gt; &gt; behaviors in the population and the archive, r=\r\night. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But what about the population itself, should every individu=\r\nal \nthere \n&gt; &gt; recompute its sparseness on every evaluation, based on the n=\r\new \n&gt; &gt; circumstances? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I ask this because when I observe the spar=\r\nseness (I assume \nsparseness \n&gt; &gt; equals fitness) of the individuals, say o=\r\nne happens to be in a \nvery \n&gt; &gt; sparse area so it receives a high fitness =\r\nscore. But then a \ncouple of \n&gt; &gt; other individuals come into this area, so=\r\n it becomes more dense. \nBut \n&gt; &gt; that first individual still has a high fi=\r\ntness score?
