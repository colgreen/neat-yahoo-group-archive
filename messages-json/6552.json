We haven&#39;t yet t=\r\nried it on\nsorting and recall but those are definitely tasks we will try as=\r\n well.\nThe copy task was first on our list because Graves also evaluated\nth=\r\neir SGD-based version on it. We do expect it should work on the\nother tasks=\r\n as well though. It will be interesting to see if evolution\ndiscovers solut=\r\nions similar to backprop or in what regards they\ndiffer. However, our main =\r\nmotivation for the ENTM, and what I find\nmost excited, was to try it on non=\r\n-supervised tasks (e.g. T-Maze),\nwhich an SGD-based approach can not direct=\r\nly be applied to.\n\nWe actually also have multiple heads implemented but hav=\r\nen&#39;t yet\nexperimented too much with it. Also, Graves et al. used just one r=\r\nead\nand one write head for the copy task and more heads only for priority\ns=\r\nort. Of course, adding more heads will also make the ANN more complex\nso an=\r\n obvious way forward would be to use HyperNEAT instead, which we\nhave some =\r\ninitial\nresults as well. More on that later :)\n\nAlso, Jeff you are correct,=\r\n Diff-ENTM is not trained with backprop but\ninstead trained with evolution.=\r\n We should highlight that more in\nsubsequent papers.\n\nPlease let me know if=\r\n you have any other questions. We also plan to\nmake the source code availab=\r\nle soon.\n\nBest,\nSebastian\n\nOn Mon, Nov 23, 2015 at 11:17 PM, kstanley@...=\r\nexas.edu [neat]\n&lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Sebastian, tha=\r\nt was an extremely interesting paper.  It&#39;s very impressive that you seem t=\r\no be doing better than the more complicated SGD-based version.  It&#39;s a shor=\r\nt paper though as you know so it leaves all kinds of questions.  I realize =\r\nmaybe these are coming in future papers so I&#39;m not sure how much you can an=\r\nswer, but in case you can say more - have you tried it on other tasks from =\r\nthe original paper like sorting and recall?  Why did you choose the copying=\r\n task in particular?  It seems like if you do better on all the tasks that =\r\nshould make a lot of impact on the community.  It would also be nice to see=\r\n the differences between the two approaches more explicitly shown, like in =\r\na side-by-side graphic or chart of some sort.  Also, why are there the  dif=\r\nferences that there are?  You make the case that this model is simpler, but=\r\n was that the main motivation?  For example, the original had multiple head=\r\ns but you have just one - why is that?  It makes me wonder why they didn&#39;t =\r\njust try theirs with one, or is there something about SGD that would be und=\r\nermined if they did that?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, it raises all kinds of interesting is=\r\nsues and suggests a useful role for evolution in systems where the need to =\r\ndifferentiate could be a liability, which raises a lot of interesting oppor=\r\ntunities and questions.  Really nice idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best,\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n-- \nD=\r\nr.
