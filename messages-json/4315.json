Bu=\r\nt that does not seem to answer the question of how the\nreaction-diffusion s=\r\nystem chooses its own border, since the zero\nborder is imposed a priori by =\r\nthe researcher?  I think the key issue\nis how the system itself would event=\r\nually define its own edges (and\nperhaps then wrap a skin layer around that =\r\nborder).  Perhaps you are\nexplaining that the existence of a zero border wi=\r\nll stop one side of\nchemicals from wrapping around into the other and there=\r\nfore lead to a\nkind of termination reaction at the edges that might lead to=\r\n shapes\nother than the actual shape of the zero border itself.  Perhaps tha=\r\nt\nwould indeed lead to various shapes in a smooth search landscape.\n\nYet it=\r\n is hard to get an intuitive sense from e.g. Sanderson&#39;s work\n\nhttp://www.s=\r\nci.utah.edu/~allen/materials/Sanderson_JGT_2006.pdf\n\nwhat kinds of distinct=\r\n bounded objects would be produced by such a\nsystem.  If you look closely a=\r\nt the images in that paper, the actual\nrepeated motifs within the patterns =\r\nare either highly irregular or\nvery simple.  There are not really examples =\r\nof complex *regular*\npatterns such as my old spaceship that was evolved wit=\r\nh CPPNs or many\nother such examples on Picbreeder.  While I understand from=\r\n your\nexplanation that the wallpaper-like property is not fundamental to th=\r\ne\nprocess, I would still expect to see *within* the wallpaper certain\nmotif=\r\ns indicative of such a capability.  \n\nIf the system produces complex irregu=\r\nlar shapes, that would\n(potentially)indicate a different bias from CPPNs, w=\r\nhich seem to\nproduce more regularity.  While I should not speculate too\nspe=\r\ncifically about exactly what shapes might be produced with\nreaction-diffusi=\r\non systems since I lack the experience (so I\nacknowledge that they may very=\r\n well produce nice regular shapes), they\nalmost certainly do have a differe=\r\nnt bias from CPPNs because they are\ndifferent computationally by their natu=\r\nre.  The question is what that\nbias is and why it is good or not good.\n\nI w=\r\nould be quite interested in seeing whether such systems produce\nstructures =\r\nsuch as faces and butterflies, for example. \n\nAnother interesting issue is =\r\nwhether or not small mutations lead to\nlarge changes.  In fact, from playin=\r\ng with complex CPPNs, I believe\nthat in fact small mutations lead to small =\r\nchanges.  Perhaps it is the\nsame with reaction-diffusion systems, but I am =\r\nless confident about it\nbecause of their internal interactions being more o=\r\npaque (at least to\nme).  That is, in a CPPN, everything that &quot;happens&quot; is e=\r\nxplicitly\nexpressed as an activation function somewhere in the network.  So=\r\n you\nknow what you&#39;re getting.  However, in reaction diffusion, reactions\nc=\r\nan occur as emergent properties from the initial conditions that are\nnot ex=\r\nplicit in the genetics, making it harder to reason about how\nthings will tu=\r\nrn out (though I am sure that you could reason about it\nbetter than I can).=\r\n  \n\nFinally, while a RD system might produce a Cartesian coordinate\nsystem,=\r\n it is not clear that it *would* produce one in general,\nwhether it is easy=\r\n to disrupt that system through mutation, and even\nif such a coordinate sys=\r\ntem were generated, whether it would end up\nusing it explicitly or gain any=\r\n advantage from it (in contrast, the\nCPPN must take the Cartesian coordinat=\r\nes as inputs).\n\nThis is a very interesting discussion from the point of vie=\r\nw of\njustifying various developmental processes.  Alexandre, we are lucky\ni=\r\nn the group to have your expertise on reaction diffusion systems, and\nI am =\r\ncertainly respectful of the work on such systems going back to\nTuring.  The=\r\ny are clearly excellent models for certain types of\nbiological phenomena (l=\r\nike patterns on animal exteriors and shell\nformation), but I think the ques=\r\ntion is whether they are most useful\nnot as models, but as practical tools =\r\nfor design within evolutionary\ncomputation.  That is a slightly different i=\r\nssue than what inspired\ne.g. Turing.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ale=\r\nxandre Devert &lt;marmakoide@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Guten Tag\n&gt; \n&gt; To make a reaction=\r\n-diffusion system, you have to pick\n&gt; 1) chemicals diffusion coefficients\n&gt;=\r\n 2) a Laplacian operator (how to compute the variation of chemicals\naround =\r\na given point)\n&gt; 3) a reaction function\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) and 3) could be encoded as =\r\na Perceptrons with a hidden neurons\nlayer. Small changes in the weights of =\r\nthe Perceptron are likely to\nproduce small changes on the patterns expresse=\r\nd by the system. I think\nthat the search landscape could  be quite smooth. =\r\nAlso, I might argue\nthat with CPPN, frontiers depends on a delicate balance=\r\n of it links\nweights... I&#39;m pretty sure that small perturbations on complic=\r\nated\nCPPNs generate pretty large change in the pattern it outputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rea=\r\nction-diffusion are diffusions of chemicals coupled with\nreactions of those=\r\n chemicals. They are expressed as partial\ndifferential equations, wich are =\r\nintegrated over a domain : usually,\nthe unit square, but a disc, a sphere o=\r\nr whatever shape. Indeed, Greg\nTurk did reaction-diffusions on horses, see =\r\n&quot;Generating Textures on\nArbitrary Surfaces Using Reaction-Diffusion&quot;. To in=\r\ntegrate a\ndifferential equations over a domain, you have to specify what ha=\r\nppens\nat the border of the domain. Usually, on a square, people considers\nt=\r\nhat &#39;left&#39; is wrapped with &#39;right&#39;, &#39;top&#39; with &#39;bottom&#39;, which\nexplains the=\r\n &quot;wallpaper&quot; look... But you might consider that outside\nthe square, chemic=\r\nals concentration are just always 0. Chemicals are\nproduced within the squa=\r\nre and dissipate to the void at the square\nedge... No more wrapping, no mor=\r\ne perfect tiling, thus no more\n&quot;wallpaper&quot; look.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, generating coor=\r\ndinate systems with pure local interactions is\npretty easy. In my soon-fini=\r\nshed Phd dissertation, I show a cellular\nautomaton that generates a Cartesi=\r\nan coordinate system. If the states\nof the cells are perturbed, the cells r=\r\nestore the coordinate system\n(with a theoretical warranty of it). A spheric=\r\nal coordinate system ,\nresilient to noise in it states, is also pretty easy=\r\n to setup\n(diffusion of a single chemical, with &#39;0&#39; border conditions). No =\r\nneed\nto provide coordinates of each cells. By a rather optimistic leap, we\n=\r\ncan hope that the optimizer (evolutionary stuffs in our case) will\nfind the=\r\n coordinate system that suit best for the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alexandr=\r\ne Devert\n&gt; \n&gt; --- En date de : Jeu 11.9.08, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; =\r\na =E9crit :\n&gt; De: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Objet: Re : [neat] Re: A=\r\nn argument in favor of developmental processes?\n&gt; =C0: neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n&gt; Date: Jeudi 11 Septembre 2008, 12h02\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n \n&gt;             To follow the details of the argument, I think the issue\nis=\r\n not so\n&gt; \n&gt; much with whether or not such systems can build a sharp fronti=\r\ner but\n&gt; \n&gt; with the structure of the search space of the shapes bounded by=\r\n such\n&gt; \n&gt; frontiers.
