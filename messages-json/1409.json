I poked through the big paper, and it said what you \njust\n&gt; said, but I&#39;m still stuck on the competing conventions problem. \nYour\n&gt; paper didn&#39;t present any opposing views to compare historical \nmarkers\n&gt; to. I&#39;m still pretty new to the field, and I don&#39;t understand what \nkinds\n&gt; of alternatives exist. Is this a totally new approach, or is there \nsome\n&gt; computationally intensive way of compareing traits/genes that \nmight also\n&gt; be studied? \n\nThe historical marking approach is unique and did not exist before \nNEAT.  It is hard to answer whether &quot;alternatives&quot; exist because \nthere certainly are other methods that evolve topologies (of various \nthings including neural networks) but they tend to do things that \nare not principled like cutting an arbitrary subgraph out of one \ntopology and swapping it into another.  So such an approach might be \nconsidered an &quot;alternative&quot; although it does not really address the \nconcern that we don&#39;t know which gene is which.  The short answer \nthen is that yes NEAT is the first such method.\n\n&gt; I seems to me that two species that evolve totally\n&gt; independantly until their history seperates them to much, and they \nwill\n&gt; not be afforded significant chance to combine. ( less than 1% as \nyou say\n&gt; )\n&gt; If there were a function to evaluate the compatability of two \nnetworks (\n&gt; perhapse that were representative of a species ) than the \nlikelyhood of\n&gt; succesfull interspecies crossovers would increase.\n&gt; so has this tree been barked up by plenty of other dogs, or is \nthere\n&gt; something to play with here?\n\nWell NEAT does have such a compatibility function, so I take your \nquestion to be whether you could somehow grade the probability of \ninterspecies mating based on the compatibility of various networks, \nand the answer is yes.  It is possible to do anything you want based \non the compatibility function, and using it as a basis for deciding \nwhich interspecies matings are tolerable is certainly feasible.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
