Colin, you&#39;re right that the \nword doesn&#39;t com=\r\ne up much in the writings on the subject.  That&#39;s an \ninteresting point.\n\nI=\r\n think the reason I haven&#39;t used the word a lot is because the \nword &quot;modul=\r\ne&quot; tends to give me a feeling of something that is \nexplicitly and discrete=\r\nly defined.  For example, you can define \nan &quot;arm&quot; as a separate module and=\r\n then you can modify it \nindependently or reuse it more than once.  \n\nYet w=\r\nith CPPNs we have been trying to avoid that particular brand of \nmodularity=\r\n, which I would call perhaps &quot;brittle modularity.&quot;  If you \nlook at the lit=\r\nerature on modularity in EC, you will find a good deal \nof attempts to disc=\r\nover explicit modules and then reuse them.  But \nwhat happens with such sys=\r\ntems is you often can get an arm growing \nout of your head, because the enc=\r\noding has no sense of overall \nregularity or structure.\n\nCPPNs on the other=\r\n hand offer a kind of &quot;implicit modularity&quot; in that \nyou cannot point to a =\r\nparticular place in the encoding where any \nmodule is defined.  Yet, I do a=\r\ngree that they are there at an \nimplicit level.  For example, the spaceship=\r\n image always kept its \nwings and tail fins (once they were discovered), ev=\r\nen as they changed \nand warped.  So in a sense, those were implicit modules=\r\n that were \nbeing maintained.  At least in comparison with nature, I believ=\r\ne such \ndynamics better capture how natural modularity works.\n\nIn any case,=\r\n that is just to explain why I haven&#39;t been using the \nterm much- it evokes=\r\n ideas of brittle modularity that I felt were the \nwrong concept.  Neverthe=\r\nless, you rightly point out that in effect \nthere is indeed a potential sol=\r\nution to the problem of modularity in \nthe theory, and outside of the narro=\r\nw semantics of my little research \nniche, it makes good sense to highlight =\r\nthat capability.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelis=\r\nle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not up on CPPN theory, but the inherent modularity i=\r\ns excellent\n&gt; news.  As you mentioned, the lack of an need to design modula=\r\nrity \nbut\n&gt; to allow it to emerge is presumably closer to the biological \ns=\r\ncenario.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kirk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;=\r\nlocster01@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 05/01/2008, newtwist2000 &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  A bit of an aside, the ability to establish modularity may be =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  significant next step.  Most EC applications are limited in \nthis\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  capacity.  I&#39;m not sure if NEAT is fully compatible with\n&gt; modularit=\r\ny or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  not - thoughts?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just on this point - I would say that =\r\nthe ability of CPPN&#39;s to\n&gt; &gt; generate repeated structures and elaboratation=\r\ns on those repeated\n&gt; &gt; structures means that modularity (re-use) is inhere=\r\nntly part of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; CPPN model.  I know this is a central part of why CPP=\r\nNs were \ndevised\n&gt; &gt; but I&#39;m not sure that the word modularity has come up =\r\nbefore when\n&gt; &gt; discussing CPPNs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway it&#39;s another nice charact=\r\neristic of CPPNs because it means \nwe\n&gt; &gt; no longer have to explicitly writ=\r\ne code to allow modularity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
