The new enhancement iteratively searches only th=\r\nrough cross-sections of the hypercube instead of through the entire hypercu=\r\nbe at once.  Also, while last year&#39;s work only showed that ES-HyperNEAT can=\r\n perform as well as regular HyperNEAT, this work shows that ES-HyperNEAT ha=\r\ns an advantage on some problems, in particular when progressive elaboration=\r\n of network structure is useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Figure 8 on page 8 shows a nice examp=\r\nle of a progression of networks over evolution that illustrates why evolvin=\r\ng the substrate is promising.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are planning to release source code f=\r\nor the evolvable substrate before this year&#39;s GECCO.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
