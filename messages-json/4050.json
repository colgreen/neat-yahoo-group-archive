As w=\r\ne mention in the paper briefly under\n&quot;Typical Solution,&quot; solutions from bot=\r\nh methods just go straight to\nthe goal.  In other words, they do not take m=\r\neandering paths; they\ntake the most rational path and appear goal-oriented.=\r\n  So there is no\ndiscernible quality difference.\n\nHowever, it&#39;s an interest=\r\ning issue because it gets to the question of\nwhat it means to be smart vs. =\r\nlucky.  In general, if an animal has a\nbehavior that gets the job done cons=\r\nistently, one could say the animal\njust &quot;happens&quot; to do the right thing, or=\r\n one could say the animal is\n&quot;smart.&quot;  In fact, I think these are one and t=\r\nhe same and the\ndistinction does not really add insight into the inner work=\r\nings\nof the animal&#39;s mind.  \n\nOne of the reasons we get stuck on the issue =\r\nof whether something is\n&quot;really&quot; smart is because of the allure of the adap=\r\ntive hypothesis in\nevolutionary theory:  We try to explain everything we se=\r\ne in nature in\nterms of some kind of adaptation, and as soon as you assume =\r\nthat what\nyou are seeing is the result of an adaptation, you are susceptibl=\r\ne to\nthe idea that it must be &quot;good&quot; in some way (which equates to &quot;smart&quot;\n=\r\nwhen decision-making is at issue).  Yet what novelty search shows is\nthat a=\r\n non-adaptive process can in many cases produce equivalent\nbehaviors, which=\r\n really turns the adaptive hypothesis upside-down, and\nmakes the interpreta=\r\ntion of the &quot;value&quot; of a behavior more confusing.\nYet at the end of the day=\r\n, if it works it works, regardless of why it\nbecame the way it did.\n\nAnyway=\r\n, so on the question of time series, I would not be concerned\nwith this iss=\r\nue of whether it is really smart.  However, another\nconsideration is whethe=\r\nr there is sufficient domain constraint to make\nthis search something other=\r\n than exhaustive enumeration.  Novelty\nsearch relies on the properties of t=\r\nhe domain (i.e. the environment)\nto create a useful landscape for the searc=\r\nh.  Something without any\nenvironmental constraint may not make a good sear=\r\nch space.  So for\nexample searching through all possible pictures hoping to=\r\n find Mona\nLisa one day may not be a good idea because just about anything =\r\nyou do\ngenetically produces something &quot;novel.&quot;  In other words, there is no=\r\n\n&quot;collapse&quot; of multiple genetic points into fewer novelty points (or\nmore a=\r\nccurately, there may not be cases of novelty points clustered\ncloser togeth=\r\ner in behavior space than the corresponding genomes in\ngenome space).\n\nStil=\r\nl, I am not sure about time series, because the distribution of\ninput precu=\r\nrsor series may be thought of as a kind of constraint,\nsince there are some=\r\n precursor series you would never see.  So it may\nactually work...I&#39;m not s=\r\nure, but it&#39;s an interesting possibility.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; when yo=\r\nu mentioned that Tyler used no inputs but just internal \n&gt; pattern generati=\r\non, it reminded me about a question I wanted to ask \n&gt; you a few days ago. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In novelty search, it searches for new behaviors, right. But are \n&gt; t=\r\nhey &quot;smart&quot; in a sense.. For example, does the robot in the 2D maze \n&gt; expe=\r\nriment succeed just because of luck? It is possible that a \n&gt; behavior that=\r\n appears a solution to be discovered, but the robot acts \n&gt; like a beheaded=\r\n fly and reaches the solution by accident? How much \n&gt; this depends upon th=\r\ne environment and the inputs provided? Is it the \n&gt; same with fitness-based=\r\n search? I am asking this because I am about \n&gt; to introduce novelty search=\r\n to time series forecasting which is very \n&gt; complex domain in terms of cha=\r\nracterizing behavior. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kennet=\r\nh Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter C&#39;s message brings up another i=\r\nssue that might be useful to\n&gt; &gt; Peter B:  For ambulation, it might be more=\r\n effective to use leaky\n&gt; &gt; integrator neurons than the usual feedforward n=\r\neurons that are used \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; most ANN models.  The leaky integrators are =\r\nbetter for precise \n&gt; timing.\n&gt; &gt;  However, they may not be necessary if jo=\r\nint angles are being \n&gt; provided\n&gt; &gt; as input.  But when joint angles are n=\r\not provided, I do not think I\n&gt; &gt; have ever seen a regular recurrent ANN (i=\r\n.e. non-leaky or not some\n&gt; &gt; other special type of neuron) be able to make=\r\n something walk.  In\n&gt; &gt; fact, the &quot;flailing&quot; motions are often reduced sig=\r\nnificantly by \n&gt; leaky\n&gt; &gt; integrator neurons.  Tyler Streeter saw this whe=\r\nn he worked on his\n&gt; &gt; biped with NEAT, which actually stopped flailing aft=\r\ner switching to\n&gt; &gt; leaky integrators.

As you are experiencing, the \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; selection.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be \n&gt; useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; because it does not care about the # inputs or outputs (and \n&gt; can \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potentially exploit geometric regularities), but configuring \n&gt; the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate then becomes the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assu=\r\nming all of that stuff is set up well with whatever \n&gt; system, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty search is a potentially winning approach.  Yet as you \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; point \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In f=\r\nact, we \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to t=\r\nhese \n&gt; questions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general p=\r\nrinciples might help for \n&gt; now: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the archive i=\r\nn novelty search does not not need to \n&gt; contain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every point eve=\r\nr visited.  Therefore, it tends to grow much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than =\r\nthe #of evaluations.  However, if it is indeed getting \n&gt; too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; big  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreasonable to collapse some of the archive \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; points, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although there is no standard method yet for how that =\r\nshould \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done.  But we have reason to believe there will be =\r\neffective \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple ways to do that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Se=\r\ncond, the issue of one individual looking different just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same behavior is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; complicated.  For certain phase disaparities, the two \n&gt; individuals \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but it is true that at some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; disparity, they may look very different.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwhether that fact is actually problematic to the novelty \n&gt; search \n&gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it would simply reward both types of behavior.  \n=\r\n&gt; It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the phase difference is a result of=\r\n some useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, which could make it a stepping st=\r\none to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  Or, it is possible that it is s=\r\nuperfluous \n&gt; information \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply takes some extra tim=\r\ne exploring the area around the \n&gt; phase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shifted individual.  So=\r\n it is hard to say a priori whether it \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major conc=\r\nern.  We will have better answers to such questions \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; technique is further explored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I agree t=\r\nhat it would be nice to be able to say the \n&gt; two \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase-shifted =\r\nindividuals are largely the same if that is \n&gt; indeed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you w=\r\nant to say.  And for that, you would need a pattern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matching met=\r\nric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  There are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainl=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available.  However, it&#39;s important to recognize =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident at this point that ignoring the ph=\r\nase shift \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than taking it into consideratio=\r\nn, because \n&gt; taking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means add=\r\ning more information to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So overall I think novelty search is a very promising \n&gt; directi=\r\non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go for such problems, but it is still in the realm =\r\nof \n&gt; research \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no existing precedent), so =\r\nit will involve \n&gt; considerable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error to get it right =\r\nuntil all these issues are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fleshed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out more clearly.  Ult=\r\nimately, though, if our hypothesis \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty vs. fitness =\r\nis correct, novelty search may turn out \n&gt; to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way =\r\nto get certain highly complex types of \n&gt; behavior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in =\r\nsome domains, which is a sobering thought.  But if \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; true, then there is not much to do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; &lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read K=\r\nen&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new approach.

You \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WIP vide=\r\nos at my youtube page here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/user/thehair=\r\ncrow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ultimately, I would like to package AI&#39;s with=\r\n the Toribash \n&gt; game \n&gt; &gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are fun to play again=\r\nst in single player- I think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is att=\r\nainable despite being difficult.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deception is a BIG problem her=\r\ne; if my fitness criteria is \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; integrated distance from a=\r\n goal, it encourages the \n&gt; behaviour of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Tori&quot; bala=\r\nncing in a stable configuration forever, rather \n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking=\r\n, which is what I&#39;m trying to encourage. As there is \n&gt; 20 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joint=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this rig, I am providing joint position and velocity \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for each joint, as well as a bias, a sine-wave, t=\r\nhe x, y, \n&gt; and z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components linear velocity in the reference f=\r\nrame of the \n&gt; Tori&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and finally 3 variables =\r\nwhich correspond to the vertical, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and for=\r\nward orientation of the tori&#39;s head with respect to \n&gt; world\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current experimental configuration I am starte=\r\nd out as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll control where neural net outpu=\r\nts correspond \n&gt; directly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity; a tanh activat=\r\nion function is used to allow \n&gt; positive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; negative j=\r\noint movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then remodeled the experiment to perform as in=\r\n the \n&gt; Toribash \n&gt; &gt; &gt; game;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the net will receive inputs (and =\r\neffect joint movements) \n&gt; only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time steps.=\r\n More importantly, I increased the amount of \n&gt; outputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40, in order to accomodate the 4 \n&gt; possible \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions which can occur on a turn: holding, relaxin=\r\ng, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extending, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that gives a \n&gt; staggeringly \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Due to the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large n=\r\nets as the starting \n&gt; net \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram=\r\n on the heap. Realizing this was a \n&gt; bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculous, I impleme=\r\nnted feature selection and phased \n&gt; pruning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, even wit=\r\nh this, deception seems to prevent any \n&gt; useful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour; the=\r\n Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI am using a python implementation of neat developed by \n&gt; Cesar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gom=\r\nez\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the GPL, which is available at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://code.goog=\r\nle.com/p/neat-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This implementati=\r\non is a WIP and I&#39;ve already done a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying =\r\nto incorporate the linear genome encoding taken from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EANT=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method. I&#39;ve also been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in \n&gt; orde=\r\nr to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimize weights but I haven&#39;t had much success meshing \n&gt;=\r\n this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later today when I am home I will post my source files for=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual=\r\n creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; FINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rep=\r\nresented\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amo=\r\nunt \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The nove=\r\nlty search method \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is=\r\n fairly simple; if theres a \n&gt; new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of discovered behaviours. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n works \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I imagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot =\r\nof information to \n&gt; hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is =\r\nhow I can compare the behaviour of 2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers=\r\n for novelty; is there any compact encoding that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nork? Since it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluations to \n&gt; get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; any\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this right now, theres going to \n&gt; have=\r\n to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate behaviours in some=\r\n way that \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to compare; wha=\r\nt if a Tori has identical behaviour to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later instead? Just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; compari=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviours it would appear that they were=\r\n 100% unique, \n&gt; yet \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer would i=\r\nnstantly notice the similarity in how they \n&gt; act.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
