Do you plan to take another whack at a\n&gt; larger domain, Mitchell?  I&#39;d be very interested to\n&gt; see how things change as the problem scales up.\n\nMaybe.  I have been improving my methodology somewhat.\n If I feel I have made significant improvements I may\ntry the six-card game again.  It is much more\ndifficult since the win/loss is not decided by the\nfirst or even second turn.  In the 4-card game between\nintelligent players the game is decided on the first turn.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
