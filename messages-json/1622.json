This way involves coding of \n&gt;parameters inside the genotype, so the genome not only include \n&gt;network information but also has a standalone gene containing weight \n&gt;mutation type (let&#39;s say 00 -- for proportional, 01 -- for fixed \n&gt;number and so on). During the mating, networks and these genes are \n&gt;recombinated independently. In this case it&#39;s possible that \n&gt;individuals that mutate defferently are present at one and the same \n&gt;time. Thus a self-tuning is possible (with simultaneous task \n&gt;solution!) and I think it&#39;s not so time expensive.\n&gt;\nHi Yuri,\n\nI did consider this approach, one problem I can see is that I think lot \nmore runs would be needed to seperate out genuine positive results from \nthe large amount of noise. What I mean by this is that you may have a \nvery poor set of mutation parameters on a gene and then it might (by \nchance) acquire a beneficial mutation, thus indicating that a poor set \nof parameters are in fact good. The reverse could also happen , where a \ngood set of mutation parameters generate a good genome but then the \nparams are mutated so they are not so good - the end result is we have a \ngood genome that appears to have come from a poor set of parameters. We \nhave to kep in mind that a genome is the result of the parameters on all \nof its ancestors, not just the parameters we end up with.\n\nFocusing in on one set of parameters at a time keeps things simple and \nmakes the results easy to interpret, there will still be a large amount \nof noise but I hope to compensate for this by performing multiple runs \nfor each set of parameters and calculating an average (time to success \nor whatever). Having multiple sets of parameters in the system at a \ngiven time greatly increases the complexity of the system, probably \nbeyond a level where we can properly comprehend everything that is going on.\n\nSorry to have put the dampers on your idea :)\n\n&gt;I think it&#39;s not so time expensive. And also if you \n&gt;use some meta-GA, how are you going to set its&#39; parameters?  ;) \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYou&#39;ve got me there. I&#39;m going to pick some numbers out of a hat, just \ndon&#39;t tell anyone :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
