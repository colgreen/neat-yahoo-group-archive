Are you using the cmake scripts to build HyperNEAT?

I do not think that using the regular tinyxml library wil=\r\nl work with HyperNEAT.

The examples for HyperNEAT are very good and helpful. Some technical =\r\nquestions will follow once I get this whole thing to compile. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So =\r\nfar, I have been able to compile tinyxml to a DLL. Apparently NEAT has to b=\r\ne compiled to a DLL as well, and that is where I ran into a road block. Whe=\r\nn I attempt to compile NEAT, I get a number of errors. They are all related=\r\n to Tinyxml. Any advice on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciate=\r\nd. I am using version 2.6.1 of tinyxml. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (I am building this on a =\r\nwindows machine using QT - Once I get things working here, I am going to cr=\r\noss-compile this for use on a Gumstix)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In constructor &#39;NEAT::Genet=\r\nicPopulation::GeneticPopulation(std::string)&#39;:\n&gt; &gt; no matching function for=\r\n call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXmlDocument(std::string&)&#39;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In member fu=\r\nnction &#39;void NEAT::GeneticPopulation::dump(std::string,bool,bool)&#39;:\n&gt; &gt; no =\r\nmatching function for call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXmlDocument(std::string&)&#39;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In member function &#39;void NEAT::GeneticPopulation::dumpBest(std::st=\r\nring,bool,bool)&#39;\n&gt; &gt; no matching function for call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXml=\r\nDocument(std::string&)&#39;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
