For example, maybe you \ncould allow adding disjoint genes from the lower fitness genome but \nnot excess genes.  Or you could just use all the genes from both \ngenomes in all cases.  Of course, it makes some sense to not take \nstructure from inferior individuals, in order to reduce potential \nbloat, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s any evidence this really matters \nthat much in terms of # evaluations to a solution.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Karl Lewin &lt;lewinke67@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In doing some more thinking I think that it may be\n&gt; possible to change structure during crossover even in\n&gt; the fitness are not the same by inheriting disabled\n&gt; genes when selecting from matching pairs. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Karl Lewin &lt;lewinke67@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Is it a correct statement that if fitness between\n&gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt; genomes is never equal that structure can only be\n&gt; &gt; added via mutation (add node/connection) and not\n&gt; &gt; through crossover since disjoint and excess are\n&gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; taken from the parent with higher fitness?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is this implementation dependent? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If discussion of this has taken place before let me\n&gt; &gt; know so I can look it up myself and not clutter up\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks-\n&gt; &gt; Karl\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t\n&gt; &gt; \t\t\n&gt; &gt; __________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Friends.
