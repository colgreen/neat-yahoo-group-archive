[neat]\n&lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not related to NEAT, however, I thought this might be a good place to ask since there\n&gt; are a lot of EC minds in this group.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working on creating decision trees using genetic algorithms. Anyone know any\n&gt; references to genotype representations for decision trees? I am looking forward to &quot;direct\n&gt; encoding&quot; but any views on &quot;indirect encoding&quot; are also appreciated.\n\n\nI think it depends on the problem you&#39;re trying to solve. Random\nForests (RF) is a method based on ensembles of decision trees, which\nworks very well at modelling low dimensional data or &#39;spreadsheet\nstyle&#39; data sets - a number of kaggle competitions have been based on\nthis type of data and RF used to be the go-to approach for winning\nthose competitions (not sure if that&#39;s still the case though, I would\nguess not).\n\nMy point being that each decision tree (DT) in an RF is very cheap to\nconstruct, and as such I&#39;m not sure what benefit an evolved DT would\ngive. In fact one of the cool features of RF is that each DT is highly\nrandomized, i.e. each tree node splits the data into two based on a\n(partially) randomly chosen feature (dimension), and either the\noptimal split on that dimension (using linear least squares), or the\noptimal point with some random noise added, or even just a totally\nrandom split (see Extreme Random Forests). And because we are just\nadding new cheap semi-random models to an ensemble rather than\ntraining just one model, the result is that RFs exhibit little to no\noverfitting to a given data set, which is fairly unique. I&#39;ve even\nseen RFs *under*fit, i.e. test set data score is /better/ than the\ntraining set data score.\n\nThis underfitting is not a feature of RFs per se, but rather it&#39;s a\nknown feature of ensembles, and RFs happen to take the ensemble\napproach to an extreme because each DT in the &#39;forest&#39; is cheap to\ncompute, and therefore you can build hundreds or thousands of them in\nvery little time.\n\nIf instead you were to apply evolutionary training (or direct gradient\ndescent) to a single DT then you would once again have a problem of\noverfitting to the training data.\n\nNot sure if this answers your question but hopefully/maybe some of\nthat was useful at some level.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
