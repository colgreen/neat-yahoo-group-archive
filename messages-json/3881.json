Going back to a physical analogy, the network=\r\n \ngraph can\n&gt; also relate to bond graphs or mechatronic graphs.  The input =\r\nand \noutput\n&gt; nodes can exhibit something akin to impedance in an electroni=\r\nc \ncircuit -\n&gt; depending upon the frequency in which they are activated.  T=\r\nhis \nmeans (with\n&gt; a little help from complex numbers) that the connections=\r\n can emit \nheat,\n&gt; which affects the local thermodynamics of the various gr=\r\naph nodes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Is this consistent with your concept of a leaky integrator=\r\n?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Obviously, this adds a bit of computational complexity to the mix -=\r\n \nbut the\n&gt; force displacement vectors can be easily computed on graphics \n=\r\nprocessor\n&gt; unit(s) - which is probably beyond the scope of this thread.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Ken Lloyd\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yahoogroups.com [ma=\r\nilto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf \nOf\n&gt; petar_chervenski\n&gt; Sent: Monday,=\r\n March 17, 2008 10:26 AM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: S=\r\npatial & connective CPPNs for Alife domains\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not using bias =\r\nnode/s for two reasons.

The fitness function can&#39;t exactly be defined, since \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; can be=\r\n evolved towards some tasks like &quot;go there&quot; or something. I \n&gt; &gt; want to br=\r\niefly describe the details behind it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same network is used fo=\r\nr both the body and the nervous system \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; the creature. First the b=\r\nody is built by a spatial CPPN and \n&gt; converted \n&gt; &gt; to a mass-spring model=\r\n. There are several tissues (the CPPN \noutputs \n&gt; &gt; tissue type instead of =\r\nlevel of expression). One type of tissue \nis \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; sensor tissue, which=\r\n excites upon collision. Another type of \ntissue \n&gt; &gt; is a muscle tissue, w=\r\nhich contracts the springs when excited. \nLike \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; regular bilogical =\r\nmuscle. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The key point is, that after the spatial CPPN builds the =\r\nbody, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same CPPN is then used for HyperNEAT (additional outputs, \n=\r\nthough), \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; evolve the connectivity of the neural network controlli=\r\nng the \nbody. \n&gt; &gt; Inputs are located on sensor tissue only. Outputs are lo=\r\ncated on \n&gt; &gt; muscle tissue. Hidden nodes are located on the remaining tiss=\r\nue. \n&gt; This \n&gt; &gt; is essentially evolving both the substrate and the connect=\r\nivity \nof \n&gt; &gt; the network, but in a meaningful way, because of the geometr=\r\ny and \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; simulated 2D physics space. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The simulation is l=\r\nike this - when the sensor tissue is excited \nby \n&gt; &gt; some collision, this =\r\nalso plugs 1.0 into the associated \nHyperNEAT&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; network&#39;s inputs. When=\r\n the outputs activation level exceeds some \n&gt; &gt; treshold, the associated sp=\r\nrings on the muscle tissue are \n&gt; contracted. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that usin=\r\ng the same network for both pusposes (spatial \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; connective) is be=\r\ntter than using different networks. Do you think \n&gt; &gt; this in general is a =\r\ngood idea? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
