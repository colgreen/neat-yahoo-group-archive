It&#39;s just as likely to pick an insignificant\ncombination of indicators that appeared during the event and either miss\nthe next occurance, or miss interpret other events as a new occurance.\n\nYou need a lot of occurances before predictions are solid.\n\n&gt; But do you want to wait around for (possibly) years to make relatively \n&gt; few big &#39;bets&#39; (high risk, eggs in one basket scenario), or do you want\n&gt; a system that makes more frequent smaller bets? (Trading being a form\n&gt; of betting). \n\nI certainly want fluidity due to the reasons I&#39;ve specified. I&#39;ve even\nlooked at day trading, but that didn&#39;t pan out. Now I have a new data\nsource and I might give it another shot. I haven&#39;t studied day trading\nextensively, do you think it&#39;s more or less predictable than intra-day\ntrading?\n\n&gt; Now it would be nice to have a system quietly looking out for\n&gt; those big bet scenario&#39;s 24/7 just to highlight them so you can make an\n&gt; informed judgement whether to act, but I see this as being a completely\n&gt; seperate system to one that looks for short term trades.\n\nI don&#39;t dispute that, and I think it would be possible to hand-code a\nstrategy that flags such a situation more succesfully than using AI to\nevolve it. I&#39;d say that a human analyzing the situation _could_ come up\nwith something useful from one (or ten) data point(s), wheras AI would\njust as likely be fooled.\n\nIn the end, you&#39;ll have to decide whether to follow the event indication\nor not...\n\n&gt; Many smaller \n&gt; trades seems intuitively safer, if the system makes a loss, it does so \n&gt; gradually and you can very calmly choose to stop trading, re-evaluate \n&gt; your position, rethink the prediction model, etc.\n\nYep, too true.\n\n&gt; I definitely see overfitting as being a problem because the only way to\n&gt; reduce it is to test against larger test data sets (thus slowing \n&gt; evaluation), even then one big gain on one data set could skew a\n&gt; fitness score. \n\nOh, yeah. My tests when I used profit as the fitness function, over ten\nyears, there&#39;d be a few wildly profitable years then a number of years\nthat did worse than a buy and hold strategy. Clearly, that&#39;s not useful in\na real life situation. Even a few months of non-profitability will make\nmost investors back out of a system, even if it would have been profitable\non the longer term. Therefore, the longest period of unprofitablility is\nan in important indicator. Max drawdown (lowest low after a previous high)\nis also significant for the same reason.\n\nConsider a system that first goes up 150% and then down 75% - you&#39;re still\nup 75% and that&#39;s great, right? Not really, what if you jumped on the\nsystem just at the 150% peak, then you&#39;d only get the 75% drawdown. You\nwouldn&#39;t trade that system for long.\n\n&gt; I had considered that a network with a confidence output that it\n&gt; keeps low most of the time, and which only goes high when it&#39;s very\n&gt; sure \n&gt; of making profit would be a good network. A sort of &quot;if you aint got \n&gt; anything interesting to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot; approach to \n&gt; prediction :)  But I can definitely see how overfitting might put the \n&gt; dampers on this idea, beside which it goes against my comments in the \n&gt; previous paragraph - few trades = bad.\n\nYes, and confidence is relevant when you&#39;re predicting prices, but it&#39;s\nnot relevant when the system decides whether to own or not, because it&#39;s\ninherent. If the system isn&#39;t sure, it reduces the &quot;want to own&quot; rating.\n\n&gt; Whatever approaches folks try, I personally absolutely stand by the \n&gt; concept of some form of confidence factor. Another idea that crops up\n&gt; is \n&gt; to try and reduce a stock&#39;s price history to underlying frequency \n&gt; elements (function regression), and as you yourself know (Mattias) NEAT\n&gt; can do function regression quite well, but I just don&#39;t see this\n&gt; working \n&gt; for something as complex and fluid as the stock market.\n\nI agree. I tried predicting stock prices one or two days down the line and\nthe performance was aweful. One issue I have with the concept of\npredicting future prices is that it&#39;s very limiting. My system says &quot;I\nwant to own&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to own&quot;. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s spotted a long\nterm, medium term or short term oppurtunity! But if I train a system to\npredict tomorrows price, it can&#39;t possibly come up with a mid to long term\nstrategy.\n\n&gt; There will \n&gt; always be unpredictable external influences and chaotic movements of \n&gt; price that cannot be predicted, and for these scenarios a confidence \n&gt; output can just say &#39;dunno&#39;, and that to me is a completely accetable \n&gt; response.\n\nTo clarify, do you agree that my output contains implicit confidence values?\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
