I believe the \nESP versio=\r\nn may in turn have come even from a package before ESP \n(like SANE for exam=\r\nple).  In any case, I don&#39;t recall the original \nsource for the code, but a=\r\ns you can see it has been passed down for a \nfew generations of systems, wh=\r\nich is actually a good thing to make \ncomparisons consistent.  \n\nUnfortunat=\r\nely I therefore do not know the explanation for the missing \nterm.  It is l=\r\nikely that Jean-Baptiste&#39;s explanation is correct.  In \nany case, I think t=\r\nhe important thing is that the domain code is \nconsistent among systems bei=\r\nng compared.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G.
