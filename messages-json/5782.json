Genome.SpecieIdx was not being\nset upon allocation.\n   Added debug assertion to check specieIdx is correctly set following\nspeciation.\n\n\n * FIX/MOD: Network visualisation: Layout logic failed when there were\nlarge numbers of neurons in\n   a layout layer such that the gap between them was less than 0.5 of\na pixel, and thus got rounded down to 0,\n   positioning all nodes in that layer at the same coordinates.\n\n\n * FIX/MOD: Ensure ID generators are set accordingly when loading\ngenomes using a pre-existing genome factory.\n\n"}}
