I&#39;m a PhD student at UT (Ken is one of my\n&gt; officemates). Nate Kohl and I have done a lot of research applying\n&gt; neuroevolution to the SoccerBots domain over the past couple years.  If\n&gt; anyone is planning to work in this domain, they might be interested in\n&gt; checking out our papers on the subject:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/shimon/school.html\n&gt;\n&gt; We also have a journal paper (not yet published) that discusses some\n&gt; coevolutionary approaches, which I&#39;d be happy to send to anyone who&#39;s\n&gt; interested.  All this work was done with ESP and not NEAT so obviously its\n&gt; relevance in somewhat limited.  But it does describe the input and output\n&gt; representations that we found useful.  It focuses primarily on the issue\nof\n&gt; task decomposition: how to break a hard task like robot soccer into\nsmaller\n&gt; pieces that our learning algorithms can tackle.\n&gt;\n&gt; From doing this research I have become convinced that trying to learn\n&gt; monolithic controllers for soccer players is completely infeasible using\n&gt; current methods.  I would strongly recommend that anyone who works in this\n&gt; domain consider using some of the decomposition approaches we describe in\n&gt; the papers or even developing your own.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please don&#39;t hesitate to drop me a line if you want to discuss any\n&gt; Soccerbots-related issues.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Shimon\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 27, 2004 9:31 AM\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Soccerbots\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My name is German Viscuso and I would like to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; introduce myself to the group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; members.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi German...welcome to the group. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a degree in Computer Science and I &#39;m now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; researching neuroevolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques for application in the robotic soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; domain. I&#39;m planning to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apply NEAT to evolve a full team of players\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [*](using a robot soccer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simulator).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do you plan to do work solely in simulation, or at\n&gt; &gt; some point upload ANN controllers into physical\n&gt; &gt; hardware?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly enough, Philip and I decided to go ahead\n&gt; &gt; and integrate a robot control domain into the Java\n&gt; &gt; implementation of NEAT we&#39;re working on, and we went\n&gt; &gt; with Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~trb/TeamBots/Domains/SoccerBots/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s part of the Teambots package (which includes\n&gt; &gt; other robot control domains, such as foraging).  It\n&gt; &gt; was primarily architected for hand-coded controllers,\n&gt; &gt; and was not especially suited for evolving ANN\n&gt; &gt; controllers, but we&#39;ve already adapted it for that\n&gt; &gt; purpose (I&#39;ve already done a couple of test runs with\n&gt; &gt; it).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It simulates the small robot competition of Robocup,\n&gt; &gt; played on a ping-pong table sized area with an orange\n&gt; &gt; golf ball as the &quot;soccer ball&quot;.  It supports teams of\n&gt; &gt; up to 5 players, and teams can either be homogenous\n&gt; &gt; (all use the same controller), or heterogenous (the\n&gt; &gt; goalie can have a different controller than a\n&gt; &gt; forward).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If this sounds like a good testbed for the kind of\n&gt; &gt; stuff you want to do, let me know.  We&#39;d be more than\n&gt; &gt; happy to share our implementation.  If not, good\n&gt; &gt; luck...and keep us up-to-date on your progress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [*] It is considered a very difficult task to fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolve a team that can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; play the whole game of soccer (not only subtasks)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I seriously think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complexification can help me here. I&#39;m still not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sure if I should evolve the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; team from sensors to actuators or use some of my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predefined movement\n&gt; &gt; &gt; primitives to accelerate the task.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Soccerbots robots have an array of sensors which\n&gt; &gt; return 2d vectors to various objects on the field.\n&gt; &gt; Each has a method (e.g., getBall()) that returns a\n&gt; &gt; vector object, which contains both the x and y\n&gt; &gt; coordinates of the sensed object, and distance and\n&gt; &gt; angle in radians to the object.  There are methods\n&gt; &gt; that return position of both goals and each player.\n&gt; &gt; For my test implementation, I&#39;m inputting the sensor\n&gt; &gt; information for the ball, friendly goal, opponent\n&gt; &gt; goal, closest teammate, and closest opponent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are only three actuators in Soccerbots:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --Set heading in radians.\n&gt; &gt; --Set speed (from 0 m/s to 3 m/s)\n&gt; &gt; --Kick the ball\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Currently I&#39;m just using the first actuator.  Speed is\n&gt; &gt; clamped at max and the kick actuator is in repeat mode\n&gt; &gt; (basically always kicking).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since each sensor reading is essentially two inputs\n&gt; &gt; (angle and distance), and I&#39;m inputting information\n&gt; &gt; about five objects every timestep, there are 11 total\n&gt; &gt; inputs (including a bias node) and 1 output.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve implemented runs which evolve the ANNs directly\n&gt; &gt; against hand-coded AIs that came with the Soccerbots\n&gt; &gt; package (there are about 20, of various skill levels).\n&gt; &gt;  Within the next couple of days we&#39;ll have it set up\n&gt; &gt; for coevolutionary runs as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, it&#39;s nice to hear there&#39;s crossover in\n&gt; &gt; interest in this domain.  Anybody else have\n&gt; &gt; experiences or thoughts on robot control domains?\n&gt; &gt; Robot soccer?
