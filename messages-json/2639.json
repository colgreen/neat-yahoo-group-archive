I&#39;m now going to vary the ones that do\nhave an effect a bit further, to try and find a rough\noptimum.  Just to improve the speed of further\nexperiments.\n\n&gt; Are you considering a writeup similar to what Colin\n&gt; has put up about \n&gt; SharpNEAT and some of his experiments?  They aren&#39;t\n&gt; academic \n&gt; publications, but they are easy to read, include\n&gt; text and figures, \n&gt; and reveal to the reader the key issues.  It would\n&gt; be great to have  \n&gt; a reference like that for SLEAT.\n\nI am.  I also have a promise of assistance from a\ncouple of tame accademics, so I can write it up\nproperly...\n\n&gt; Also, I haven&#39;t spent much time in the TTT world; \n&gt; can people remind \n&gt; me how good 94.8% is?  How is PPS measured again? \n&gt; Is that the same \n&gt; measure as in past research such as Derek and\n&gt; Philip&#39;s ANJI results?\n\nNo.  PPS was the system I invented for myself a while\nback.  It works by feeding the player every possible\nboard and assessing their response against a full\nknowledge fo the game tree.  Thus if a win is\npossible, they score 1.0 for picking any move that\nevenually leads to a win.  Optionally they score less\nfor a move that leads to a stalemate (partial\nsuccess).  Also optionally, illegal moves attract -ve\nscores.\n\nI&#39;m acutally using the &quot;normalised&quot; verison of PPS,\nwhcih treats all rotations/reflections of the same\nboard as a single enantiomer.\n\n   Ian\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\n"}}
