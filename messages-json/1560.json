I was going to \ngo with an evolving (arbitrary) labels approach, rather than an innovation \nnumbers, but they are not very different really.\n\n\tSome GP systems do use speciation (and in fact I would say they have tried \na wider variety of approaches than the TWEANN community, possibly because \nthey have had less success :)).\n\n\tThe GP field suffers a bit from clashing ideologies, e.g. there are 1/2 \ndoz competing GP approaches out there and not all the practitioners see eye \nto eye.\n\n\tDoing a NEAT-style GP would be neet.  You have to define your domain a \nlittle, however.  ANN&#39;s only ever map floats onto floats and the only big \nstrategic choice in how to do it is the recurrent/non-recurrent \nquestion.  This is a great advantage, because it means all ANN experiments \nare broadly comparable, which leads to a solid theoretical and intuitive \ngrounding for the field as a whole.\n\n\tGP, in contrast, has more major tactical choices than there are people to \nmake them.  You can have:\n\t- variables, or not,\n\t- data typing, or not,\n\t\t- casts or no casts\n\t- subroutines, or not,\n\t- indirect representations, or not,\n\t- maths operators (+, *, ...), logic operators (AND, OR), conditionals \n(IF, SELECT), trig, stats, ...\n\t- loops or no loops,\n\t- fixed constants, or evolving constants,\n\t- binary tree, mixed binary/unary, full N-ary\n\n\tetc etc\n\n\tNow, all that said, I think the case we&#39;re considering here is very simple:\n\t- all values are float\n\t- only arithmetic\n\t- no advanced features\n\n\tIs that right?  If so then it&#39;s a good experiment, but it is important to \nnote that it only scratches the surface of what GP *could* do (not that \nit&#39;s very successful when it does, most successful applications tend to be \nin this area).\n\n\tIan\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
