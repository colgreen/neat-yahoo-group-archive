One of the requirments of this project is quite =\r\na \nstrong AI Module.\nI had been intending to use a Neural Network for a whi=\r\nle, and when I \nsay NEAT had been used in a Torque game already, I thought =\r\nit would \nbe fairly straight forward to use it.\n\nThe rtNEAT code itself wor=\r\nks fine, and gives me what I&#39;m assuming is \nthe correct output. However, be=\r\ncause NEAT doenst process per tick, it \nwill freeze torque while it works, =\r\nand then resume torque. This \nobviously wont work.\n\nI have read the help do=\r\ncs, and they say to look at pole2_realtime_loop\n(). \nI am having difficulty=\r\n however with supplying the arguments for the \nrealtime loop: &quot;Population *=\r\npop, CartPole *thecart&quot;. They are created \nin *pole2_test_realtime(), and p=\r\nassed to the pole2_realtime_loop, \nwhich works fine in the traditional impl=\r\nementation.\n\nHowever, I need to call pole2_testrealtime from my game loop, =\r\nand so, \nneed a way to access the *pop and *thecart parameters. I have trie=\r\nd \ndeclaring the Population and CartPole objects at the top of \nexperiments=\r\n.cpp, as static, extern, trying to use a get and set \nmethod, everything I =\r\ncan think of really, but I still cant access the \n*pop and *theCart objects=\r\n from my realtime loop, so I cant call \npole2_realtimeloop() every tick.\n\nU=\r\nltimately, I wont be using the pole2 experiment in my game, but I \nthought =\r\nthat would be a good place to start, instead of jumping in at \nthe deep end=\r\n so to speak. \n\nI&#39;d appreciate any help on this matter, thanks,\nJack.\n\n\n\n"}}
