So although it&#39;s nice to\nhave the &#39;buy this on a...&#39; option available, I see that as a\nsecondary sales channel. I think you need a more prominent link to a\nmerchandise page that has a a few pre-selected images that work well\non T&#39;s and mugs etc. So if I&#39;m surfing for T-Shirts I can go straight\nto the merchandising page and see some good T-shirt designs right away\nwithout being put off by pages of design that don&#39;t work - as a surfer\nI may not have any clue what picbreeder is, just that it came up on a\nT-shirt search and &quot;oooh, those look cool&quot;.\n\nJust a thought. In general I think the site works really well and is\nwell put together.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
