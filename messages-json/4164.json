I am currently running experiments with different ratios of\naddNodeProb to DemolishNodeProb to see what effect that has both on node\nnumber and fitness.\n\nA few questions/replies below:\n\n&gt; One issue with bloat that is easy to overlook is that the population\n&gt; contains a range of network sizes and therefore the maximum size of a\n&gt; network in the population is not necessarily a measure of &quot;bloat&quot;\n&gt; because other species may contain significantly smaller networks.\n&gt; What you probably want to check is that a healthy range is being\n&gt; maintained rather than simply trying to prevent anything from getting big.\n\nI was referring to the number of nodes in the generation champion. The task\nis pretty simple (it does not require hidden nodes), yet they ramp up about\na hidden node every 2.5 generations, which seems overly fast to me. Does it\nto you?  \n\n&gt; In general, there is good reason to grow networks if fitness is not\n&gt; going up because the algorithm has no way of knowing what is necessary\n&gt; to improve.  It might need more structure, or it might simply need to\n&gt; find a better set of weights.  Therefore, it is sensible for it to try\n&gt; both: If you are stagnating, keep growing at one end of the spectrum,\n&gt; but also don&#39;t lose your little guys in case they turn out sufficient.\n&gt;  In other words, a stagnant population should gradually grow in its\n&gt; range of sizes, not putting all its eggs in one basket.\n\nInteresting point. I guess I should be looking at min number of nodes in the\npopulation, and see if that is growing fast as well.\n\n&gt; For populations that are not stagnant, it makes sense for them to\n&gt; display less growth in general, because they are succeeding in their\n&gt; current weight space.  I&#39;d guess your more recent experiment is\n&gt; undergoing periods of stagnation, which would explain why you see more\n&gt; growth.\n\nAre you saying that NEAT has a built-in mechanism such that the node number\nwill increase during times of fitness stagnation, and that the rate of\nhidden node growth is less when fitness is improving? What mechanisms bring\nthis about?\n \nThanks,\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
