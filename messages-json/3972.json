It \nis\n&gt; not NEAT, the only useful feature I am usi=\r\nng of NEAT is the history\n&gt; marks.  This new technology let me simulate 30 =\r\nmillions on neurons \nper\n&gt; second in a standard PC!!!! The main application=\r\n where I have used\n&gt; this technology is in Artificial Vision. I have solved=\r\n a problem for\n&gt; the automotive sector where it is the only solution in the=\r\n world. \nNow,\n&gt; I am researching a new problem I hope to beat soon (electro=\r\nnic\n&gt; component sector). \n&gt; \n&gt; LSTM was a step in this technology, although=\r\n I don&#39;t use it, however\n&gt; it showed me the importance to have a structured=\r\n temporal memory in \na\n&gt; neuronal network.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Germ=E1n Bravo=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; -- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; German,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You did have a good idea.
