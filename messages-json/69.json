Sort of like an coevolutionary\n&gt; embodiment thing. The\n&gt; way I see it, it could be set up as a simple kind of\n&gt; coevolution: one\n&gt; population of entities (DNA strings) and a\n&gt; population of developmental\n&gt; rule sets. \n\nWhy would they need to be logically decoupled?  The\nDNA string could could contain instructions for\nbuilding particular structures, and developmental rule\nsets, right?\n\n&gt; This is along the lines of some of\n&gt; DeJong&#39;s and also Ficici&#39;s\n&gt; work over at Brandeis (coevolving teacher/learner\n&gt; pairs).\n\nNot familiar with this work, but I&#39;ll head on over to\nCiteSeer and have a look. \n\n&gt; This dichotomy is really important in biology, i.e.,\n&gt; DNA is almost\n&gt; completely useless information without the\n&gt; developmental system that it is\n&gt; paired with. And the two definately evolved\n&gt; together.\n\nBut the DNA encodes for the developmental system in\nresides in, doesn&#39;t it?  I guess I don&#39;t see a clear\ndichotomy...maybe you could elaborate.\n \n&gt; Personally, I&#39;d love to do a PhD thesis on this idea\n&gt; if I can get into a\n&gt; good graduate school.\n\nYou&#39;re a senior at UT now?  Where are you thinking of\napplying to grad school?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
