This analysis is particularly interesting b=\r\necause it reveals geometric properties of connectivity patterns that are co=\r\nrrelated to good generalization.  In particular, what we found is that the =\r\nsmoothness of a connectivity pattern is correlated to the generality of its=\r\n play, which you can see for yourself in the paper.  \n\nI think this result =\r\nis interesting because smoothness is itself a geometric property.  In other=\r\n words, the only efficient way to describe a smooth pattern is to describe =\r\nit within some geometry.  If it is true that geometric smoothness is a gene=\r\nrally important property of topographic connectivity patterns, then it sugg=\r\nests that approaches outside indirect encoding, including outside of evolut=\r\nionary computation, face a daunting challenge with generalization because t=\r\nhey have no way to express graceful gradation and regularity across a geome=\r\ntry.\n\nAt the same time, it gives some deeper insight into why HyperNEAT is =\r\nperforming so well in this domain and where it can be expected to excel in =\r\ngeneral.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
