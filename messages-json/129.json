That ANN will soon be eliminated from the\n&gt; population.  Usually, in the beginning, that happens\n&gt; to most of the ANNs, but hopefully not all of them.\n&gt; \n\nBut learning what is legal and what it illegal can put\nan extra strain on the already difficult problem.  For example,\na network that is doing quite well at the game yet occasionally\nmaking illegal moves would be killed off, even if it is the\nonly network with such a high level ogf skill.  \n\nUsually when I deal with this type of thing I just make\nit so that no output can be illegal.  For example,\nin Go I consider an illegal move attempt by the network\nto be a requested pass.  That way a network that is otherwise\ngood can still get its due credit, and might even learn\nto utilize its &quot;criminal tendencies&quot; to make rational decisions.\nFor example, although the Go network does have a pass output,\nit may find it easier to instead pass by trying to place a piece\non an already-occupied square.  Who is to say this is a bad\nway to communicate a pass if it gets the job done?  The point is to\ngive the network as many opportunities to communicate valid moves\nas possible.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
