These interpolations you have listed here are generally for\n&gt; &gt; interpolation between pixels when zooming in*.  Zooming-out most commonly\n&gt; &gt; works by averaging pixels in an area.  I would not normally think of it as\n&gt; &gt; expensive, but I guess it depends whether you have to recalculate it over\n&gt; &gt; and over...\n&gt;\n&gt;All of our scale transformations are zooming out.  And, we do have to\n&gt;calculate it over and over since the eye is constantly able to move,\n&gt;rotate, and zoom.  Area averaging winds up taking about twice as long\n&gt;as bilinear, but bilinear is very choppy and loses a lot of\n&gt;information.  I think our networks are each performing somewhere on\n&gt;the order of 100-200 steps per image and about 20 images per\n&gt;generation (is that right, Derek?)\n\nRight, I was trying to establish whether your area origins and rotations \nwere arbitrary.  That does give you a significant averaging overhead.  Out \nof interest, how do you handle pixels on the edge of the area?\n\nI still don&#39;t see how bilinear is appropriate, but there may be another \nemail I didn&#39;t read yet...\n\n&gt; &gt; How about providing the net with Min(area) and Max(area)?  When you get\n&gt; &gt; down to a single pixel, they are the same.\n&gt;\n&gt;It does have a min zoom factor.  It can not zoom out any farther than\n&gt;it taked to see the entire surface.  So, for example, if the eye size\n&gt;is 5x5 and the surface size is 50x50, the zoom factor will be between\n&gt;100% (zoomed all the way in, it sees a 5x5 area of the raw surface)\n&gt;and 10% (zoomed all the way out, it sees a &quot;blurred&quot; 50x50 area).\n\nSorry, I was unclear.  I meant supply it with the minimum and maximum pixel \nvalues from the area it is looking at.  Or even build a little histogram of \nthe pixel value distribution and provide that.\n\n&gt; &gt; Is the area always square?  (and it so, why? :)\n&gt;\n&gt;Square is all we&#39;ve done so far, but it should support rectangular areas.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is it axis aligned?\n&gt;\n&gt;What do you mean by &quot;axis aligned&quot;?.  We allow rotations in increments\n&gt;smaller than 90 degrees, if that&#39;s what you mean.\n\nThat&#39;s what I meant, thanks.\n\n         Ian\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
