The game has already been solved, but \nif a version of NEAT can be applied to evolved neural networks that \ncan play a strong game of 15x15 Gomoku, we will have learned a great \ndeal about how to approach higher input/output domains.\n\nDerek\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Chris Christenson &lt;cc57@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok... but, you were talking about tic tac toe\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Derek James [mailto:blue5432@y...] \n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 30, 2004 1:33 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: RE: [neat] Applying NEAT to Tic-Tac-Toe\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Chris Christenson &lt;cc57@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Maybe I am off-base here, but why don&#39;t you use a\n&gt; &gt; neural network to act\n&gt; &gt; as the evaluation function in conjunction with a\n&gt; &gt; MinMax.
