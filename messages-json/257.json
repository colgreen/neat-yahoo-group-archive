I just wanted to point out that\nnatural biological evolution is directed by numerous\nobjectives, too numerous to enumerate!  Broadly, an\norganism seeks food, safety from predators, safety\nfrom micro-pathogens, shelter, thermo-regulation,\nrecovery from damage or illness, reproductive\nopportunity, strategy for maturation of young, and so\non.  Each of those in turn has complications within\nit.\nSo we may conclude that evolution is a process that\ncan well handle multiple objectives.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
