Because r=\r\necent work has shown that phenotypic/behavioral diversity is more effective=\r\n than genotypic diversity, many people may be switching to phenotypic diver=\r\nsity and abandoning genomic diversity: this work suggests that both may be =\r\nimportant. For example, mutations that affect a representation deeply may i=\r\nnitially hurt the organism&#39;s ability to do something behaviorally different=\r\n/interesting, for the same reason that such mutations hurts fitness (e.g. t=\r\nhey cripple the organism). Protecting that innovation for a while may thus =\r\npay off. \n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t read your paper yet. But following your argumentat=\r\nion, when profound differences in the genetic code have also a relatively l=\r\narge influence on the phenotype, protecting the phenotypic/behavioral diver=\r\nsity should do the job!? \n&gt; \n\nI would add a lot more caveats to that statem=\r\nent, but I think the spirit is right. If mutations tend to cause changes th=\r\nat are initially deleterious, but that may recover to even higher fitnesses=\r\n than the pre-mutation fitness if allowed time for fine tuning, that is whe=\r\nn protection will pay off. My guess is that deep changes to a representatio=\r\nn fall into that category. My paper shows that evolution on its own (at lea=\r\nst in our model) does not naturally protect such mutations, and that they a=\r\nre thus rare. Evolution instead typically makes improvements via shallow, s=\r\nurface-level mutations that do not change representation, but instead add n=\r\new functionality onto the existing system. That results in a collection of =\r\nhacks, instead of elegant, evolvable representations. \n\n&gt; &gt; In other words,=\r\n because selection will quickly work to eliminate deep changes, we should p=\r\nrobably protect them for a while if we want to see better representations e=\r\nmerge. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering, whether it could be beneficial to protect phe=\r\nnotypic diversity in CPPNs (e.g. in HyperNEAT). Instead of measuring the si=\r\nmilarity of the genomes, the similarity of the produced patterns could be u=\r\nsed to determine which individuals belong to which species. The idea is tha=\r\nt relatively similar genomes can nevertheless produce differing patterns. S=\r\neparating them would allow to better exploit the potential of the same gene=\r\ntic code. \n&gt; \n\nThat is a good idea, and one I have heard others (including =\r\nJean-Baptiste Mouret) suggest. The way I think about it is that there are t=\r\nhree aspects to an organism (at least, in systems with generative encodings=\r\n like HyperNEAT): the genome, the phenotype (ANN), and the behavior. It wou=\r\nld probably help to encourage diversity in all three, assuming two things: =\r\n(1) you have the computational resources to afford doing so, and (2) your a=\r\nlgorithm does not perform worse with additional objectives. Unfortunately, =\r\n(1) is not always true, and (2) seems to be false, even with our best multi=\r\n-objective algorithms (e.g. NSGA-II). So, in practice, it becomes an empiri=\r\ncal and often case-by-case question as to what type of diversity to encoura=\r\nge. I hope that more people conduct studies comparing the benefits includin=\r\ng/excluding each of these three different types of diversity, so we as a fi=\r\neld can begin to get an empirical and general understanding of how benefici=\r\nal their inclusion is. \n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nVisiting Scientist\nCorne=\r\nll University\njeffclune@...\njeffclune.com\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Martin \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
