I guess one difference is that there was no selection operation;=\r\n the &quot;offspring&quot; was created without me needing to mate.  So it seems like =\r\na sort of less greedy form of selection in which you can pass on your genes=\r\n without succeeding at finding a mate or even performing reproduction.  Yet=\r\n is it anything over and above less greedy evolution?  For example, would i=\r\nt be much different if we just relaxed the criteria of selection?  I guess =\r\nI&#39;m not sure if the implications are really fundamental or just technical, =\r\nthat is, if it somehow changes what is possible to discover or if it just m=\r\neans it happens in a different way than was presumed in some cases.\n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;R&quot; &lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is =\r\nan interesting article.\n&gt; http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527441.50=\r\n0-horizontal-and-vertical-the-evolution-of-evolution.html?full=3Dtrue&print=\r\n=3Dtrue\n&gt; \n&gt; It talks essentially about the process that gave rise to the e=\r\nvolutionary algorithm and protein synthesis machinery.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if you=\r\n could use something like it to tweak or build an evolutionary algorithm?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; What do you guys think?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
