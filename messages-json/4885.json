We can potentially improve the documentatio=\r\nn based on your comments (and a tutorial is a good idea), but first I want =\r\nto understand which &quot;comment-less examples&quot; you are referring to.\n\nNote tha=\r\nt several experiments with complete source code are available in two existi=\r\nng HyperNEAT releases of which I am aware.  These and a variety of publicat=\r\nions from several groups are linked from the HyperNEAT Users Page, which al=\r\nso provides a brief introduction:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/Hy=\r\nperNEAT.html\n\nI understand you may have already been through this site and =\r\nits associated software and papers, but I wanted to point it out in case yo=\r\nu had not been aware of it.\n\nWe want to make the algorithm as accessible as=\r\n possible so your comments are appreciated.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Can anyone please recommend some =\r\nHyperNEAT documentation, a tutorial, diagram, some clue, or anything that d=\r\noes not mean reverse engineering the comment-less examples ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!
