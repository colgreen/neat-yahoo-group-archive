I copy-pasted =\r\nthe settings file (.ga, .app etc and the xor folder) to my current working =\r\ndirectory (to the root of the project folder). To run the XOR experiment I =\r\ncopy pasted the code in the MSENEATPredictionEngine class to the class wher=\r\ne my main function is. \n\nI passed the absolute address string of the xor_ne=\r\nat.ga file as an argument.\n\nThen it only says Build Successfull, and that&#39;s=\r\n it nothing else happens...\n\nWhen I debug it exits from the line of:\nChromo=\r\nsome chromo =3D (Chromosome) this.readObject(aiSource);\n\nI took a look at r=\r\neadObject(source) function, it&#39;s trying to read from a file called xor/xor_=\r\nneat_ga.ser, but there is no such file in the files I downloaded. I looked =\r\nat the configuration page for an example value it says: org.neat4j.neat.nn.=\r\ncore.learning.GALearnable. So I changed AI_SOURCE value with that one, but =\r\nno luck:-(\n\nSome help to start with that framework will be appreciated...\nT=\r\nhank you.\n\n\n"}}
