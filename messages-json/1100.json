I can tell you that people have in the past used \nneuroevolution to evolve a robotic arm, so it is most likely \npossible.  I need to find the reference, but I know it has been done \nwith a system before NEAT existed.  It sounds like a realistic and \nrealizable application of NEAT.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Rohini Kumar BRP wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt;I am Rohini, new to this group. I am doing my MTech\n&gt; &gt;thesis on REACHING WITH A ROBOTIC MANUPULATOR WITH\n&gt; &gt;FEEDBACK, at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur\n&gt; &gt;(India).\n&gt; &gt;After going through your work (NEAT), I have a small\n&gt; &gt;query which is as below:\n&gt; &gt; Can NEAT evolve the required network for the robotic\n&gt; &gt;manupulator(2D) to reach any point in the space\n&gt; &gt;without collision? If yes please guide me.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you describe the problem in more detail? e.g. when you say \nthat \n&gt; the manipulator is 2D do you mean that the manipulator moves on an \nx,y \n&gt; axis and can pick up and drop objects in a 2D plane? Are there \nobjects \n&gt; of  differents shapes and sizes that need to be detected by the \nnetwork?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s possible NEAT could evolve a network for your problem but you \n&gt; really need to simulate the problem in code for a NEAT experiment. \nIs \n&gt; there existing simulation code you could use?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n"}}
