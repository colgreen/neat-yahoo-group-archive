Interesting\n&gt; stuff.  The basic approach to the &quot;roving eye&quot; makes\n&gt; sense...so does the way you implemented it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a couple of questions, though.\n&gt; \n&gt; What was the initial position of the eye at the\n&gt; beginning of its turn?  Did it begin where it was\n&gt; positioned at the end of the last turn, or does it\n&gt; always start from a set position (e.g., the center)?\n&gt; \n\nIt always started in the center, facing in the same direction.\n\n&gt; I notice that both the 5x5 and 7x7 roving eye players\n&gt; form a vertical border down the center of the board as\n&gt; effective strategies.  How would they react if the\n&gt; play from GnuGo was transformed rotationally?\n&gt; \n\nProbably it wouldn&#39;t react that well since it wasn&#39;t trained for that,\nbut I&#39;m not sure since on the other hand it can in principle handle\nrotational symmetry just by turning.\n\n&gt; Is it possible the eye players are just memorizing a\n&gt; sequence of moves against GnuGo?  GnuGo plays\n&gt; deterministically, right?  Is the roving eye robust\n&gt; enough to adapt if GnuGo plays slightly different from\n&gt; game to game (e.g., rotating the board, slightly\n&gt; randomizing its play)?\n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s basically only able to play against the deterministic strategy of\nGnugo.  You could call this memorization, though I think that&#39;s\nmisleading since it implies a sequence is being memorized.  Rather,\nwhat it really is doing is a kind of object recognition.  In other\nwords, it knows how to look at a board, and using its memory hold\nenough\ninformation to determine what state the board is in, and then place\nthe piece in the right position.  Such a methodology is not entirely\nbrittle, since it is somewhat heuristic.  In other words, it knows\nthings like if two black pieces are lined up next to each other, a\nthird should be placed in the same line (note I said things like this,\nnot necessarily this particular fact).  This pseudo-generality can be\nseen in\n figure 3, when the eye plays on a 7x7 board having never seen such a\nboard.  In that case, Gnugo&#39;s play is quite different from what it&#39;s\nseen before, yet it still manages to create a semi-contiguous line. \nThus, it is not purely memorizing a single move sequence.\n\nAnother point about what is *is* memorizing if anything: it is\nmemorizing the board states and the corresponding correct moves.  The\nboard states however can only be represented through recurrency.  But\nthe thing is, there is no way it has literally recorded all 30 or so\nboard states in a single game in its genome.  Rather, it has encoded a\nset of heuristics which map to correct play in the states encountered\nagainst Gnugo, so of course these heuristics are more general than\nspecific positions, and therefore can apply to games it hasn&#39;t seen.\n\nThat said, without doubt, this methodology is totally biased towards\nplaying Gnugo and only Gnugo.  But it is a proof concept, that a\nrather sophisticated set of heuristics learned on a 5x5 board can be\nused and maintained when moving up to 7x7.  It is not meant (as you\nunderstand) to imply this is how to get a general player.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve found, just experimenting with Tic-Tac-Toe, that\n&gt; ANNs evolved against deterministic players are very\n&gt; brittle.  Ones evolved against semi-random players\n&gt; tend to be more robust in general.  \n&gt; \n\nYes absolutely as I said it&#39;s not about general play.\n\n&gt; The roving eye networks were composed of 30 inputs and\n&gt; 5 outputs.  That means an initial minimal toplogy of\n&gt; 185 genes, correct?  (35 nodes + 150 connections.) \n\nActually if you look at section 4.3, a bunch of sensors started out\ndisconnected, and were connected in only through evolution when it was\nuseful.  I think 8 of the inputs (so 16 sensors) started out\ndisconnected, but the text gives the specifics.  So the initial\ntopology was more like 70 connections.\n\n&gt; You used a fairly low node mutation rate (0.0045) and\n&gt; an add-connection mutation rate of (0.1).  What were\n&gt; the sizes of some of your champion networks?  \n&gt; \n\nAs I mentioned in my message to Darren, I uploaded a picture of a\nwinning network that can be seen\nin the photos section.  It has 65 nodes and 368 connection genes (a\nfew of which were disabled).  Other solutions were the same order of\nmagnitude.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
