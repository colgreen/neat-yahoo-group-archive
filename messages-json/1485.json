But \n&gt;that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;not what an ANN does, does it?\n&gt;\n&gt;Why not?\n&gt;\n&gt;Isn&#39;t there a theorem somewhere demonstrating that a multi-layer ANN\n&gt;can approximate any continuous function?\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s true, and that&#39;s part of the reason I haven&#39;t given up...\n\nI made some tweaks to my NEAT implementation (trying to make sure every \nmutation produces a NEW topology rather than resurrecting a dead one) and \nintroduced a bug in the process.  Namely, it couldn&#39;t split nodes any more.  \nAll topological variations had to come from permutations of adding and \nremoving connections.  And all because of one little letter in the code.  \nDOH!  But that is why after thousands of topologies I wasn&#39;t making any \nprogress.  Still had no hidden nodes!\n\nAfter identifying and correcting that bug, I&#39;ve re-started the run.  I&#39;ve \ngot my fingers crossed.\n\n&gt;I&#39;m pretty interested in how your project is going, since we might be\n&gt;considering using a neural network to perform some sort of\n&gt;pre-processing on our images before identification by the eye.\n\nKeep in mind that my project seeks to do it dynamically.  That is, the \noutput doesn&#39;t depend just on the pixel inputs, it also depends on the \npositional parameters.  The same pixel inputs with vastly different \npositional parameters yeilds a vastly different output.\n\nSuccess in basic image enlargement is already proven.  I can point you to \npapers on the subject.  It has also been demonstrated for other kinds of \nimage processing.  So unless you also intend to employ some kind of \nnon-pixel inputs in your image processing, my project is (in its present \nform) irrelevant to you.  Heck, if I&#39;d have been willing to settle for a \nfixed enlargement scale, I&#39;d probably be done already.  :(\n\n&gt;Is anyone on the list familiar with binarization?  It&#39;s basically the\n&gt;process of converting all the greyscale values of a greyscale image to\n&gt;either black or white, in order to simplify, clarify, or sharpen an\n&gt;image for further processing.  It&#39;s used, for example, to distinguish\n&gt;foreground from background.\n&gt;\n&gt;This probably won&#39;t be much use for our current data set, but if we&#39;re\n&gt;processing more complicated images, especially those with low contrast\n&gt;or a lot of background noise, we may want to apply some sort of\n&gt;binarization technique before showing it to the ANN eye for\n&gt;identification.\n&gt;\n&gt;The simplest and crudest binarization function simply reads the value\n&gt;of each pixel, and if it&#39;s below a particular threshold value (e.g.\n&gt;177 out of 256 greyscale values), it sets the value to 0, and if it&#39;s\n&gt;above the threshold it sets it to 1.  More complicated functions take\n&gt;into consideration the contrast in a particular area and dynamically\n&gt;adjust the threshold accordingly.  For example, one technique uses a\n&gt;formula which calculates the threshold based on the mean pixel value\n&gt;and standard deviation for the 15x15 region around a given pixel.\n&gt;\n&gt;Such a function could be performed by a neural network, right?\n\nWhere your output is always in a fixed relationship to your inputs, yes.\n\n&gt;And such an approach is similar to what you&#39;re trying to achieve, isn&#39;t it?\n\nExcept for the positional parameters, yes.  It&#39;s those positional parameters \nthat greatly complicates things.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
