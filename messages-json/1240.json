I came up with a list of inputs e.g. page size,\nuptime, response time.... and then the fitness\nfunction would be based on the number of clicks users\nmake to go to a new page. I am a relative newbie and I\nwas going to base some of the design on the ai-junkie\nand smartsweepers.\nWhere the sweeper in this case would be the particular\nalgorithm used. However how would I apply an algorith\nthat is evolved. Let me rephrase. for example in the\nsmart sweepers, for each sweeper we can determine the\nproximity to a mine and therefore evolve a better\nbrain on the next iteration, but how do we know the\nresponse time for a search algorithm when there are\npossibly hundreds of pages with differeing response\ntimes? I am wondering if this type of problem has been\nsolved where it is not a one to one relationship, but\nmore of a contains relationship.\nThanks,\nRog\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
