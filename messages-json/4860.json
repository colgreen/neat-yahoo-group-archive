I have a few ideas I would like to try out, but I\n| would like to be able to compare them to the original research to\n| see if I can get any improvement.\n \n| I have two questions to ask of those of you who have tried\n|  recreating this:\n \nI have recreated it in a slightly different setup (the change were\nmade to simplify the implementation in my framework and the potential\nimplementation on a real robot). In my experience, the results were\neasy to reproduce and does not depends much on the details.\n\nFor details about my implementation, you can check the paper that I\nwill present at the IROS workshop (&quot;Exploring new horizons of\nEvolutionary Design of Robots&quot;, see the next message):\nhttp://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/papers/novelty_based_multiobjectivization.pdf\n\n| 1. How big is the area? I have got all of the internal &quot;walls&quot; in\n| place in scale to the total size of the map, however I would like to\n| get a rough idea of the width/height of the &quot;map&quot;. I understand that\n| this should all be relative, but without some sort of &quot;scale factor&quot;\n| for my map from the original I don&#39;t know what is a reasonable\n| amount of space for the agent to move etc. Currently my world is 120\n| x 115 units big, and the agent can move anywhere up to 2.5 units per\n| time period.\n \nMy hard map is 500x500 px, that are transformed into a 600x600 units\nmaze. The radius of my robot is 20 units. Each wheel can make up 2\nunits per time step and I used 1500 time-steps for the whole\nsimulation.\n\n\n| 2. I also am interested in how the outputs of the neural network are\n| interpreted. I know from the papers that there are two output\n| neurons, one for forward/backward and one for left/right. Currently\n| I am interpreting these as output &lt; 0.5 = turn left, output &gt; 0.5 =\n| turn right and the same for forward/backward. This is leading to a\n| pretty constant behaviour of moving in circles around the map,\n| always turning left - so I am wondering how other people have\n| interpreted the output result to get a more intelligent movement\n| pattern.\n\nI used a different robot than in the original paper. The main reason\nwas to have outputs similar to the ones you could use on a small\nmobile robot. I have two outputs: \n- speed of the right wheel\n- speed of the left wheel\n\nI can send you my source code in you think it can be useful. \n\nBest regards,\n-- \nJean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\nhttp://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\ntel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n\n"}}
