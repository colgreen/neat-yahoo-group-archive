We have graphical tools that lay\n&gt;out our raw chromosome XML in a spiral pattern, but\n&gt;while it looks kind of cool, it isn&#39;t very readable.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;So if we have a network, evolved with NEAT, that has\n&gt;10 input nodes, 10 output nodes, and 35 hidden nodes,\n&gt;with dozens of connections (self, recurrent, and\n&gt;forward), how does it make the most sense to:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;--Represent this phenotype in XML?\n&gt;--Graphically represent this phenotype?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNormally I would resist placing extra data into an XML dialect that \ncould be inferred from other data, it&#39;s effectibely redundant. However I \nunderstand it may be a pain to do complex logic in XSLT and as such I \nthink it&#39;s reasonable to define, say, an attribute on neuron tags such \nas hintLayer=&quot;1&quot;. Infact a number of different hint* attributes might be \nuseful for different types of representations. I think these sort of \n&#39;hint&#39; attributes should be defined as being optional though. We would \nwould then be able to take existing phenotype XML and pass it through a \nnetwork structure analysis tool - analysing the &#39;core&#39; XML and \nannotating it with hint* attributes. If you want to define a new type of \nvisualisation then just create your own hint* tags, update the tool and \nthe XML will still conform to the dialect definition (XSD).\n\n\n&gt;Should the neuron tags also include an attribute\n&gt;assigning them to a particular layer?  We use XSL to\n&gt;parse the XML into SVG, and in and of itself, XSL\n&gt;really isn&#39;t useful for determining layout logic. \n&gt;It&#39;s best to have the layout structure inherent in the\n&gt;XML.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHad you thought about the best way to determine the layer? I guess you \ncould calculate the shortest number of &#39;hops&#39; for each hidden neuron to \nan input neuron? Trouble is you might end up with all of the neurons in \nlayer 1 !!\n\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
