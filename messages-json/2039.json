At least for\n&gt; now to play with and to see what I can do.  I&#39;ll keep this group\n&gt; posted on any progress and/or package i come up with.\n\nI&#39;ve put up a release of my python-based extensible reusable etc genetic \nalgorithm framework. I made a stab at writing a readme file, but its \nprobably horribly incomplete. So if you have any questions please ask.\n\nNote that this does not contain a working NEAT implementation. It contains \nstubs for adding the NN code, and has a complexifying GRN that is based on \nNEAT. It ought to be trivial to add in a full NEAT implementation, though, \nI just haven&#39;t found the time to do it.\n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii/software.html\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
