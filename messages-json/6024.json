After readi=\r\nng numerous\npapers like this (including the one you point out) about the va=\r\nrious\nproperties of natural neurons and synapses and how they affect the\nor=\r\nganisation and behaviour of the network (eg how neurons and connections\nare=\r\n created, how connections change in efficacy, how connections decide\nwhere =\r\nto connect, etc), I get the feeling that these properties are far\nmore impo=\r\nrtant (in natural neural networks) than a precise (initial)\nconnection map =\r\n(i.e. where a genome encodes the topology and connection\nstrengths, either =\r\ndirectly (NEAT) or indirectly (HyperNEAT)). What seems\nmore important is th=\r\ne interplay of these properties of different types of\nneurons and synapses =\r\nthat allows the network to self-organise in such a way\nthat it performs the=\r\n required functions. The self-organisation creates the\ndetailed form and fu=\r\nnction of the brain (eg topology and connection\nstrengths). It seems more l=\r\nike natural genomes encode the neuron and\nsynapse types, and which regions =\r\nof the brain they go in, and the\nproperties of these neuron and synapse typ=\r\nes. I suspect there are still\nsome regions where the genome encodes, one wa=\r\ny or another, a fairly precise\ntopology (though even in this case the genom=\r\ne could make use of how the\nneurons and synapses self-organise).\n\nThere&#39;s s=\r\nome work on evolving networks that perform &quot;online adaptation&quot; in\ncontrol t=\r\nasks (eg controlling a differential-drive robot in a navigation\ntask), wher=\r\ne the initial connection weights are randomised and the genome\nonly encodes=\r\n the synaptic plasticity parameters, e.g. see &quot;Evolution of\nPlastic Neuroco=\r\nntrollers for Situated Agents&quot; and later work by Dario\nFloreano. The self-o=\r\nrganisation dynamics of the synaptic plasticity rules\n(and the inputs from =\r\nthe environment) determine the weights of the\nconnections.\n\nAs part of my c=\r\nurrent work I&#39;m planning on reproducing many of these\nproperties, including=\r\n synaptic transmission delays, in a neural network\nmodel to see how they af=\r\nfect the evolvability and capabilities of evolved\nnetworks performing onlin=\r\ne learning. I&#39;m planning on using HyperNEAT or a\nvariant like ES-HyperNEAT,=\r\n and am in the middle of implementing these kinds\nof properties in a neural=\r\n network model and creating a flexible HyperNEAT\nset-up to allow specifying=\r\n the parameters for models of these properties.\nThe motivation being that a=\r\n lot of these properties have been implicated in\nlearning processes in the =\r\nbrain.
