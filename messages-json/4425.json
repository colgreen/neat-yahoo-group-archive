Why grab all from just one?\n\nThis means that in PNEAT crossover does nothing, right? It will always grab\nthe substrate of parent1 or the substrate of parent2.  If I track parent and\noffspring fitness, 100% of the time the child has the exact same fitness as\none of the two parents.\n\nOn to HyperNEAT:\n\nI tracked the fitness of each parent and the resulting offspring. The odd\nthing is that the organisms that are crossed only (i.e. they are never\nmutated) have the *exact* same fitness of one of their parents 98.88% of the\ntime. In 20 runs, that was only 136 orgs out of 12257 that were crossed over\nand not mutated. That seems wrong, doesn&#39;t it? Why would these new links\nhave such a small impact? It turns out that this is because nearly every\ntime that there is an extra link that gets placed in the child, the parent\nthat donated that link is also the parent whose weights are being grabbed,\nmeaning that the crossover is only copying the parent (hence the same\nfitness). It seems to me that crossover should be much more disruptive, no?\n\n\nAs a final test, I did a set of hyperneat and pneat runs with the default\n&#39;MutateOnlyProbability&#39; parameter set to .25, so 25% of orgs never are\ncandidates for crossover. I then ran experimental treatments\nhyperneat-noCross and pneat-noCross where the MutateOnlyProbability\nparameter was set to 1, so no orgs were crossed over. Despite my comments\nabove, Hyperneat (with cross) did beat HyperNEAT-noCross, however the\ndifference was not tremendous (although it does seem to be statistically\nsignificant). For p-neat, the reverse was true. Nevertheless, this is not a\nperfect test of whether crossover pays dividends, because if crossover does\nnothing most of the time, and I increase MutateOnlyProbability from .25 to\n1, I have effectively raised the mutation rate (only 80% of crossed orgs are\nalso mutated).\n\nAre these the intended consequences of crossover, or am I missing something?\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
