Ultimately,\nthough, from what I read he is using a purely boolean approach to his activation mechanism (below\n&lt; 2 does not fire, &gt; 1 does fire).  Without smooth activation functions, it means the evolved\nnetwork by its nature must then create smoothness where it is needed IN THE CONNECTIVITY.  That\nseems very inefficient.\n\nIt is an interesting experiment.  I would have to see it perform over the long term to be\nconvinced the results were equavalent to using a smooth activation functions (i.e. sigmoidal).  I\njust don&#39;t think they are.  Human distinctions in reality of fuzzy.  Formal logic is just a small\nsubset of human intelligence.  And very few humans use formal logic.  And a pretty large number of\nthese produce &quot;valuable&quot; solutions to problems.\n\nThen the guy kind of lost me with his whole &quot;Terran/Artilect&quot; discussion at the end.  I was not\nprepared for that.  I then became all that much more suspicious he is just another &quot;over-the-top\ndreamer&quot;, scaling up a very simple view of logic as the basis for &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; - a\nway over-abused term.  :^)\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \tThis seems to be a nice mix of ANN, GA and CA, and he&#39;s doing it all in \n&gt; hardware...\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/papers/biomim.html\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan Badcoe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
