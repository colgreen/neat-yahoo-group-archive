I went back and rere=\r\nad the NEAT chapter from Mat Buckland&#39;s book &quot;AI Techniques for Game Progra=\r\nmming.&quot;\n\nThen it finally clicked.  m_vecInnovs contains the &quot;historical rec=\r\nord of ANY structural changes&quot; to all of the genes in the population of spe=\r\ncies.\n\nNow I have some specific questions about the Crossover Operator and =\r\nthe example in Figure 11.20. \n\nIn the case of the excess gene of the Parent=\r\n 2 (dad), Innovation 15, a link between node 3 and 9.  At the point when st=\r\nepping through each parents genes until the end of both is reached allowing=\r\n Link Gene 12 of Parent 1 (mum) to be compared to Link Gene 15.  \n\nThe If E=\r\nlse structure in the Cga:Crossover function results would be.\n\n    //the en=\r\nd of mum&#39;s genes have been reached\n    if ((curMum =3D=3D mum.EndOfGenes())=\r\n&&(curDad !=3D dad.EndOfGenes()))\n\n// if ( (TRUE) && (FALSE)) =3D FALSE Thi=\r\ns case not selected\n\n    //the end of dads&#39;s genes have been reached\n  else=\r\n if ((curDad =3D=3D dad.EndOfGenes())&&(curMum !=3D mum.EndOfGenes()))\n\n// =\r\nelse if ((TRUE) && (FALSE)) =3D FALSE This case not selected\n\n    //if mums=\r\n innovation number is less than dads\n    else if (curMum-&gt;InnovationID &lt; cu=\r\nrDad-&gt;InnovationID)\n//Because mums innovation number is less than dads, thi=\r\ns case is selected.\n\n   So even if dad is the fittest gene Gene 15 is not a=\r\ndded to the baby genes.  How then are the excess genes of the fittest paren=\r\nt inherited?\n\n\nAnother question.  If for example for the first genes in mum=\r\n and dad have the same innovation number the baby gene is randomly grabbed =\r\nfrom either parent.  But since the gene is disabled in one parent couldn&#39;t =\r\nthe resulting crossover phenotype have a disconnected node 1?\n\nHope this ma=\r\nkes sense.\n\nThanks\n\nRaymond\n\n\n\n\n"}}
