First of all sorry for my english, and \n&gt;i&#39;m a beginner in AI so this would be a stupid idea. :)\n&gt;Our brain grow in the first 3 years and after begin to decrease \n&gt;eliminating everything (connections and neurons) which are not used, \n&gt;isn&#39;t true?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNot quite correct. It used to be believed that all of the *neurons* were \nformed in the first few years, and you would then loose neurons for the \nrest of your life. I think that recent research has shown that new \nneurons are formed in certain areas of the brain (hippocampus I think) \nand can migrate to other nearby areas.\n\nConnections though are being created and lost all througout your life, \nthat is most likely how long term memory and new skills get encoded. I \nthink it would be fair to say that the bulk of neurons and connections \nare grown in the first few years of life though.\n\n&gt;so if I understand NEAT it&#39;s evolve considering also a smallest \n&gt;structure if it fitness than the other...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSpeciation allows us to evolve simple and complex networks together, \nyes. I think that is what you are asking :)\n\n&gt;but when we reach the task we could have a great topology...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;should be or not usefull implements a way in which the program try \n&gt;only to eliminate part of the structure?\n&gt;it will be a &quot;NEAT reverse&quot; trying to preserve the fitness...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhen we find a good network it might be very large, some of that \nstructure may be redundant, it might be a good idea to trim away some of \nthat excess structure.\n\nThis has been discussed on the list recently, check the &#39;Bloat&#39; thread. \nWe use the word Bloat to describe this excess structure. I have plans to \nbuild structure trimming into SharpNEAT .\n\nAlso Derek and Philip wrote a paper about using deletion mutations \nwithin NEAT. Using deletion mutations helps to keep structures trimmed. \nThe paper is in the FILES section of this group, the file is \nmodular-neat.ps.gz\n\nDerek, Philip, hope the presentation went well.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
