They might \ndiffer in being inserts vs deletes, or you might even consider mutations at \ndifferent locations to be different types.\n\n\tOK, now suppose that the population is in mid-evolve and I want to know \nthe most constructive ratio of the different types of mutation to \nattempt.  How do the following grab you.\n\n1) whenever a mutation happens, increment a counter corresponding to its \ntype and also note on the new individual what type of mutation produced it\n2) whenever an individual dies, decrement the counter corresponding to the \nmutation that produced it\n3) allocate attempted mutations proportionally to the current state of the \ncounters\n\n\tAs ever, I also generated a few variations on the idea:\n\n1a) not only store the latest mutations on an individual, but also store \n(and count) the total numbers of all mutations found in its ancestry (if \nyou have sex then you either need to count correctly whether a mutation was \npreserved in the crossover, or else average the numbers from each \nparent).  Now you are counting not just the last generation of successful \nmutations but the whole history of successful mutations\n\n1b) as 1a but just for the last N generations, not the whole of time\n\n1c) rather than incrementing the counters immediately, do it only after the \nnew individual passes some test (fitness, longevity, #offspring)\n\n2a) rather than decrementing the counters when an individual dies, do it \nonly when one dies too young (assuming you do not replace the whole \npopulation in every tick)\n\n3a) allocate attempted mutations according to the counters but using some \nfunction &quot;flatter&quot; than the raw counters.  So that rarely successful \nmutations become less common, but not too uncommon\n\n\tthoughts anyone?\n\n\tIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
