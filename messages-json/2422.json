The idea is that if the fitness\n&gt; function varies but there is some und=\r\nerlying theme that is conserved\n&gt; (such as symmetry) the organisms will nee=\r\nd to evolve to be able to\n&gt; represent that underlying theme efficiently eve=\r\nn though they can&#39;t\n&gt; rely on any particular instance of it.  This does imp=\r\nly that\n&gt; calamities can lead to robustness, but it appears than an importa=\r\nnt\n&gt; ingredient in such a system is an encoding that can encapsulate\n&gt; info=\r\nrmation about underlying themes, i.e. an indirect encoding.\n&gt; Here&#39;s the pa=\r\nper:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco05\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n\nI&#39;m sud=\r\ndenly reminded of something.  I read recently about some\nexperiments that w=\r\nere done with various metals in solution.  They\nwould let them bleed up som=\r\ne paper, and photograph the results. \nInterestingly enough, the results var=\r\nied with things you wouldn&#39;t\nexpect:  The postions of the sun and moon!  Th=\r\ne location of the sun\nand moon relative to the earth greatly influenced the=\r\n way the\nmolecules behaved.  Well, greatly is relative...\n\nPoint is, though=\r\n, that those molecules are a part of biological\nsystems.  Which means that =\r\nthey behave slightly differently depending\non the time of month.  There is,=\r\n in nature, a slowly cycling\n&#39;alteration&#39; of behavior at a chemical level. =\r\n That could easily\nexplain the anecdotally observed &#39;craziness&#39; that occurs=\r\n during a full\nmoon.\n\nSo perhaps this idea of altering the landscape might =\r\nbe a great\nidea...  It may be something that nature herself employs.  Small=\r\n,\nsubtle, but real.\n\nBrings me back to our discussion before, of having del=\r\niberate but\nsmall random perturbations in the network that forces it to dev=\r\nelop a\nmore robust solution to the problem...\n\n-- John\n--------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nJohn Arrowwood\nJohn (at) Hanlons Razor (dot)=\r\n com\n\n"}}
