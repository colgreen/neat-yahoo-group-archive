I think what Julian is referring to is much simpler. If you have a\n&gt; list of individuals sorted in best-first order, then an order-preserving\n&gt; sorting algorithm would prefer the older individuals over newer ones in the\n&gt; case of a tie. I think the hypothesis here is that if you have a big plateau\n&gt; then you should randomly pick between the older/newer individuals that are\n&gt; tying, because it allows the algorithm to spread out its search; even if it&#39;s\n&gt; effectively doing a random walk at that point. If the same individual keeps\n&gt; spawning children each generation (assuming a Gaussian mutation with a fixed\n&gt; sigma that&#39;s small relative to the plateau) then your search will potentially\n&gt; get stuck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n\n\n\n"}}
