I wrote\nall of the first several versions of the software. \nAfter the first year I let other people take it over.\nPerhaps you have come across Remi Coulom&#39;s doctoral\ndissertation?  A part of that consists of discussing\nan ANN based robot driver for the RARS races.\n\nAt that time I knew a little C++ and used that for\nRARS.  Mostly I wrote it the same as C, but I did\ndefine at least one class, maybe two.  But I didn&#39;t\ncontinue with C++ after that and eventually forgot it\nalmost completely.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
