In a purely feed-forward network, \nthe excitation at the inputs should propagate all the way through to the \noutputs.  In fact, in my definition of such a network, they *must* \npropagate through.  It may not be biologically correct?  But, \nalgorithmically, structurally, and graphically, it seems correct to me.\n\nGiven that, then how could such a network possibly have any memory (or \ntime delay)?\n\nThis type of network should be completely deterministic.  If you present \na set of inputs to it, you will always get the a specific set of outputs \n-- no matter how many times you present it, or in which order, etc.\n\nSince I don&#39;t question your experience, I&#39;ve tried to come up with how \nthis could have possibly worked.  The only thing that comes to my mind \nis this...\n\n... if you were doing the iterative-unordered network activation \nalgorithm (as used in Ken&#39;s original source code), then perhaps you \nweren&#39;t actually fully getting your inputs propagated through the entire \nnetwork?  Particularly larger, more complicated networks (similar to the \nsolutions you got).  This could especially be true if you were iterating \na fixed number of times (N).  [If you only update a network, in \narbitrary order, say 10 times, but have a network of large depth (say \n1000), then yah, I can see how the whole network would be time delayed.]\n\nIn this case, if your solution *required* recurrent connections, and you \nhad been completely (by definition) updating your forward only networks, \nthen NEAT could never converge.\n\nThat NEAT works in all of these cases reinforces the obvious (to us) \npower in these evolutionary methods.  They evolve not only to the \nproblem space, but also to our different algorithmic interpretations.\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
