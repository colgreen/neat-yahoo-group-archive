If you think of it as an organis=\r\nm,\n&gt; maybe.  If you think of it like a city, that is another situation all\n=\r\n&gt; together.  Think of how the organism as a whole serves as a haven for man=\r\ny\n&gt; specialized cells.  It creates an environment that allows the individua=\r\nl\n&gt; cells to thrive in an optimal environment for an extended lifetime.  Th=\r\ne\n&gt; organism as a whole manages to withstand environmental changes far bett=\r\ner\n&gt; than a single-celled organism can.\n&gt; \n\nThe problem with an organism-as=\r\n-a-city analogy is that ultimately the genes that encode the organism shoul=\r\ndn&#39;t care about how many cells there are in the resultant organism, or how =\r\nlong those cells live. The genes (what are ultimately replicated) don&#39;t dir=\r\nectly benefit from those factors.\n\nA selfish gene interested in its own pro=\r\npagation benefits only on the &#39;organism&#39; level: The organism is but a vehic=\r\nle for genes&#39; replication. That is, an organism with 1000 cells doesn&#39;t hav=\r\ne any innate advantage over one with 100 cells if both replicate at the sam=\r\ne rate (although in fact usually the 1000 cell organism, because it has mor=\r\ne cells, will usually replicate slower and require more resources in order =\r\nto do so). However, niches only reachable or most conducive to multicellula=\r\nrity (like the niche we inhabit) will support multicellular life even thoug=\r\nh their method of replication is both circuitous and inefficient (creates 1=\r\n000 cells to yield a single cycle of replication, which is possible with on=\r\nly one cell).\n\nI agree that more cells may allow for greater division of la=\r\nbor and ultimately greater capabilities. In nature, though, these greater c=\r\napabilities generally reduce replicator efficiency and increase environment=\r\nal dependence. Although you suggest multicellularity makes us more robust t=\r\no change, and certainly some adaptations increase our flexibility (human-le=\r\nvel intelligence, opposable thumbs), the niche exploited by most animals is=\r\n pretty fragile compared to that of bacteria. \n\nBacteria as a whole survive=\r\n in more diverse environments than animals (e.g. extremophiles that live in=\r\n volcanos or in extremely acidic conditions), and seem more robust to envir=\r\nonmental changes than more complex organisms (e.g. humans are able to extin=\r\nguish all sorts of mammals without even really trying to, yet struggle to v=\r\nanquish the simple HIV virus). Given a nuclear war, I would think bacteria =\r\nwould be in the least danger of extinction.\n\n&gt; I remember reading that the =\r\nbest models ever created for modeling traffic\n&gt; flow ended up being a model=\r\n of individual agents, each following a routine,\n&gt; obeying rules, being as =\r\noptimal as it knows how.  The combined behavior ends\n&gt; up being fairly accu=\r\nrate at modeling the behavior of the real world.\n&gt; Imagine that!  How much =\r\ntime did they waste trying to model it any other\n&gt; way?  You would think th=\r\nat it would have been self-evident that modeling it\n&gt; the way it really is =\r\nwould give the best results.\n&gt; \n\nI think your example may support abstracti=\r\non rather than the claim that the model is &quot;doing it the way it really is&quot;.=\r\n Such models did not require simulating human-level intelligence or modelli=\r\nng different aspects of a car engine, but abstracted away most of these det=\r\nails. The problem would not be tractable otherwise. This model distinguishe=\r\ns what factors are important (everyone simply tries to minimize time to get=\r\n to where they are going based on the local information available to them) =\r\nvs. unimportant (simulating a human brain, the proportion of diesel cars to=\r\n those using gasoline, etc.). While it may appear simple in retrospect, per=\r\nhaps many people thought more detailed models would initially be necessary.=\r\n I think our understanding of natural evolution has not yet isolated the fu=\r\nndamental vs incidental factors resulting in interesting open-ended complex=\r\nity growth.\n\n&gt; If the goal is to duplicate nature&#39;s success rates, without =\r\nnecessarily\n&gt; duplicating natures methods, we should probably seek to bette=\r\nr understand\n&gt; the relationship between the problem and the solution.  I pu=\r\nt forth that DNA\n&gt; is not just an arbitrary string of letters that have no =\r\nbearing on reality.\n&gt; That when there is no physical, biological impetus to=\r\n evolve, there is very\n&gt; little biological evolution.  That when there is a=\r\n strong need, evolution\n&gt; kicks into overdrive.  That the percentage of &quot;su=\r\nccessful&quot; or at least\n&gt; biologically viable mutations is way too high to be=\r\n attributable to random\n&gt; chance.  That there must be a mechanism at work t=\r\nhere that we have not\n&gt; identified yet.  That when we understand those prin=\r\nciples, we can probably\n&gt; employ them in a simulation that bears very littl=\r\ne resemblance to the real\n&gt; world, and still achieve open-ended and highly =\r\nsophisticated evolved\n&gt; solutions.  But we won&#39;t get there by randomness by=\r\n itself.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure if you are suggesting that there are some deep hi=\r\ndden feature of natural evolution (i.e. external guidance) or that there is=\r\n a drive towards greater *evolvability* in natural evolution, i.e. the abil=\r\nity of an organism to further evolve. A more evolvable organism exploits it=\r\ns evolved genetic architecture and developmental process to better funnel r=\r\nandom mutation into a greater range of viable phenotypic variation. \n\nIf it=\r\n is the latter, then I agree that evolvability may be an important factor i=\r\nn how evolution is able to discover astonishingly complex artifacts. I too =\r\nhope that we can discover the underlying mechanisms behind natural evolutio=\r\nn&#39;s creativity, and harness those principles by applying them in a domain-i=\r\nndependent way.\n\n\n"}}
