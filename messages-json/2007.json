A good professor can usually answer \nyour questions and point you in the right direction on research themes. \nThe most important thing about NNs is understanding the concepts, and the \ndifferences between network models (e.g. when would you use \ncascade-correlation, when would you use a SOM?), because once you have \nthat, the coding is generally very straightforward.\n\n-- Joe\n\nOn Sat, 25 Jun 2005, gongrichard wrote:\n\n&gt; I just graduated high school, I&#39;ve been very interested in neural nets\n&gt; for a while, but don&#39;t have the applied experience in the real world.\n&gt; I do know OOP C++ fairly well.
