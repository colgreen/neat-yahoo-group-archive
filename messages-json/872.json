Iterate until output stabilizes or N iterations \n&gt; have been performed. (N=10 or 100) \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Same as 1 but if it doesn&#39;t stabilize by N \n&gt; iterations set output to the maximally wrong value.\n&gt; \n&gt; For the XOR problem if I use the first method the best\n&gt; \n&gt; network tends to have this structure:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0       1        2\n&gt; &#92;       |       /\n&gt;  &#92;      |      /\n&gt;   &#92;     |     /\n&gt;    &#92;    |    /\n&gt;     &#92;   |   /\n&gt;      &#92;  |  /\n&gt;       &#92; | /\n&gt;        &#92;|/\n&gt;         3--&#92;\n&gt;         |  |\n&gt;         &#92;--/\n&gt; \n\nHi Karl,\n\nInterestingly I think this is the same structure I posted on the list not long \nago, but the output oscillated between high and low values and only gave the \ncorrect answer after exactly two iterations of the network. Anyway back to the \nquestion - very simply, if the network does not stabilize within N iterations \nthen my XOR experiment assigned a fitness of zero. \n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
