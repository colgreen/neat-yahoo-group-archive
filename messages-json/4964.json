This method works great with deterministic, static fitnes=\r\ns functions, but if you change the fitness during evolution as you are doin=\r\ng, you will have to change the code slightly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re using the Sing=\r\nleFilePopulationEvaluator, simply comment out lines 44 and 45 (if(g.Evaluat=\r\nionCount!=3D0) continue;).  If you&#39;re using the multi-threaded one the rele=\r\nvant code should already be commented out, but you can check on line 113 of=\r\n MultiThreadedPopulationEvaluator.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The best fitness in the Evolution=\r\nAlgorithm class is calculated based on the fitnesses of the current populat=\r\nion, so as long as you are reevaluating everything you shouldn&#39;t have to wo=\r\nrry about resetting that.  However If you are using my CommandLineEvolution=\r\n code, you will have to reset the maxFitness variable, otherwise it won&#39;t o=\r\nutput new genome XML until you beat the old maxFitness value.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel_kuppitz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right now I =\r\ntrain my network on a single set of input data. After reaching a predefined=\r\n fitness value I switch over to the next set of input data. When the fitnes=\r\ns is too low the training begins for this data and continues until the pred=\r\nefined fitness value is reached and so on.\n&gt; &gt; After a few iterations the n=\r\network produces perfect outputs on some sets of data. Consequently the best=\r\n fitness value is extremly high. When I now switch to a new set of data it&#39;=\r\ns nearly impossible to reach this fitness and so the best genome will never=\r\n change again, even if it performs really bad on different inputs.\n&gt; &gt; My i=\r\ndea was that I could reset the best fitness each time when I change the inp=\r\nut data. The data is changed within the EvaluateNetwork method; is there al=\r\nso a way to reset the best fitness from within this method? Or should I bet=\r\nter change the whole workflow?\n\n\n"}}
