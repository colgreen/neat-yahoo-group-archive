\n&gt; As far as I know, this is simply a CPPN t=\r\naking 2 points from the \n&gt; substrate space (connective CPPN) instead of onl=\r\ny one (spatial \nCPPN). \n&gt; The coordinates of this points in the substrate s=\r\npace are the \ninputs \n&gt; to this CPPN and the output is the weight/point int=\r\nensity. \n&gt; The topology between these inputs and the output node is evolved=\r\n \nwith \n&gt; the regular NEAT method. The evolved topology and the weights are=\r\n \nthe \n&gt; most important thing to consider. \n&gt; I guess this topology can cha=\r\nnge?

We can speculate on the right approach in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; case \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and =\r\nI have my hunches) but we won&#39;t know until we do some \n&gt; &gt; experiments \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and try ideas out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To give some of my thoughts, perhaps the=\r\n most obvious thing is \n&gt; &gt; similar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to what you suggest:  Have two s=\r\neparate input sets, one for \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;type A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; info&quot; and one for &quot;type=\r\n B info.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The way this would look is e.g. if A was 2D and B =\r\nwas 2D then \nthe \n&gt; &gt; CPPN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would have 4 inputs, 2 represent A source=\r\n nodes and 2 \n&gt; representing \n&gt; &gt; B \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soource nodes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then=\r\n, I would still have only one set of outputs.  I am still a \n&gt; &gt; little \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; unclear on why you say the outputs are from the second \n&gt; substrate?  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my understanding, this is still all one substrate, it&#39;s just =\r\n\nthat \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; collects inputs from two different sources.  But it ca=\r\nn still \n&gt; exist \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with only one set of outputs.  So if the outputs ar=\r\ne 2D, the \nCPPN \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have 2 more inputs representing the outpu=\r\nt area for a total of \n6 \n&gt; &gt; inputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and one output representing th=\r\ne weight of a connection in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If there wa=\r\ns a hidden layer you could have it exist in either \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ge=\r\nometry as A, the same geometry as B, or the same geometry as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\noutputs.  (For example by introducing a z dimension to any of \n&gt; &gt; these)  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or you could have each kind of hidden layer all at once.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Of course, as you note, there are a lot of ways to do something \n&gt; &gt; like=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this.  I think it will be a great issue to explore, but it may \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n require \n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with a very simple domain that isolates the issue =\r\n\n(i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orthogonal input types) so we can concentrate on that rather =\r\n\nthan \n&gt; &gt; on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific domain with its own complications.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; One other issue to note is that even if two sets of inputs are \nin \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; effect unrelated, it may not necessarily hurt antyhing to put \n&gt; them \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same geometry.  For example, they could be two separate \n=\r\n&gt; planes \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same cube.  On the face of it, it seems like th=\r\nat could \ncause \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems, but we don&#39;t yet know whether the situatio=\r\nn is that \n&gt; &gt; difficult \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to deal with in practice.  There could also=\r\n be hidden \n&gt; relationships \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are not obvious but still exploitab=\r\nle in a surprising way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Johnson&quot; \n&lt;thomas.j.johnson@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT folks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s the recommen=\r\nded strategy for handling inputs that \n&gt; &gt; represent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that are not geometrically related?
