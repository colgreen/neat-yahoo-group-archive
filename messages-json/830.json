Thus, if a connection evolves between \nnodes 3 and 4 in generation 25 and again in generation 50, those \nconnection will have the same innovation ID.\n\n2) Nodes created by replacing a connection with the same innovation \nID always receive the same connection ID.\n\nUnless I&#39;m mistaken Ken&#39;s implementation does something similar to \nthis, but the scope is only a single generation not the entire run.  \nSo, in my #1 example, those connections wuld get different innovation \nIDs, but another connection mutated between nodes 3 and 4 in \ngeneration 25 would get the same ID.\n\n\n"}}
