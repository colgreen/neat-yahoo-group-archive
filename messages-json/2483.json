I meant to \n&gt;explain this in the last mail, in fact it was the whole point of what \n&gt;I was saying, but I seem to have forgotten to include it...\n&gt;\n&gt;The type of slowdown I have is simply that improvements come at \n&gt;longer and longer intervals....\n&gt;\n&gt;e.g. its clearly a matter of diminishing returns, where the chance of \n&gt;finding additional structure:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) that solves some boards not previous solved, but,\n&gt;2) does not disrupt the workings of the existing systems\n&gt;\n&gt;         - gets lower and lower and lower...\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suppose though that evolution in general doesn&#39;t normally find perfect \nsolutions, just solutions that are good enough. When you have a very \norganic problem domain (finding food or something) then these 90% \nperfect solutions probably work out well, but when you have an \nartificial/rigid domain such as game playing or mimicking binary logic \nthen the last 10% is everything, and without it the solution is actually \nreally poor.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
