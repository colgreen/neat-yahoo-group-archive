When a\n&gt;connection is split, it&#39;s labeled depth=(parent1.depth+parent2.depth)/2.\n&gt;\n&gt;Since splitting connections is the only way to introduce new nodes, all\n&gt;nodes should be labeled by the depth they were created at.\n&gt;\n&gt;to prevent recurrent connecitons, don&#39;t connect a node to a node with a\n&gt;lower depth.\n&gt;\n&gt;Seems to work for me and executes in linear time?\n&gt;\n&gt;Am I missing something really complicated here?\n\nHi Mattias,\n\n         I don&#39;t think you are missing anything.  I think basically \nwe reached the conclusion that there are two families of algorithm for this:\n\n1) some sort of arbitrary, or average (as you do) or incremental (as \nI do) parameter is assigned to each node, and all connections formed \nmust obey the direction of this parameter (say lower to higher).\n\n2) analyse the network to see if recurrence is being formed and \nforbid the connection if it is not\n\nThe pros and cons are:\n\n(1) is faster than (2)\n\n(1) will not connect some valid topologies - I believe it can make \nany topology, but some of them in can not assemble from every valid precursor\n\n(2) leaves some &quot;conventions&quot; undefined, e.g. nodes which are neither \nup- nor down-stream of each other, these conventions can then get set \nincompatibly in different strains\n\nThese last two points define the difference between the two \napproaches.  (1) defines all conventions in advance, which means they \nwill always remain compatible, but limits some directions of \ngrowth.  (2) leaves some conventions unspecified, which allows any \nvalid direction of growth, but allows competing conventions to arise \nin different parts of the population.\n\nA third approach, might be to leave conventions undefined at first, \nbut then as soon as one individual defines one, copy that restriction \nacross the whole population...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
