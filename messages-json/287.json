The goal is to \nsteer an articial ant (red and black) over a mostly empty (white) \ntoroidal world where there is a trail of food (green). If the ant finds \na piece of food (a red square above), it&#39;s given a point. If it steps \nwithout finding any food (black), it simply wastes one of it&#39;s turns. \nWhen it&#39;s been allowed to run for a number of steps, it&#39;s killed off. \nThe fitness is the number of food pieces it has found.&quot;\n\nIt uses two inputs bias and &quot;food ahead&quot; - an indicator that detarmines \nif there is food ahead of the ant or not. It uses four outputs, \nMoveForward, TurnLeft, TurnRight and EatUnderneath. It picks the one \nthat firest &quot;hardest&quot;.\n\nThe successrate isn&#39;t quite there yet, but it does find perfect \nsolutions. GP solves this one quite easily, but in GP, it&#39;s much easier \nto solve the problem of an order list of instructions. As in &quot;under \nthese conditions, perform these instructions &quot;x,y,z&quot;. In GP, this is \ninherent in the system. NEAT has to evolve it.\n\nI kinda feel that the inputs/outputs aren&#39;t exactly fair to NEAT. Could \nanyone suggest some inputs/outputs that would suit NEAT better, but \nwouldn&#39;t violate the Artificial Ant premise?\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\nHere&#39;s a perfect solution (not that NEAT solves the problem with ONE \nhidden node)\n\nN 0 : Input (Value=1,00)\nN 1 : Input (Value=0,00)\nN 2 : Input (Value=0,00)\nN 3 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\nN 4 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-0,89)\nN 5 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\nN 6 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\nN 8 : Hidden (Sigmoid, Value=1,00)\n\nC 0 : 0 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-1,22)\nC 1 : 1 -&gt; 3 (Weight=0,62)\nC 2 : 2 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-3,62)\nC 3 : 0 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-1,12)\nC 4 : 1 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-6,15)\nC 5 : 2 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-0,08)\nC 6 : 0 -&gt; 5 (Weight=-3,47)\nC 7 : 1 -&gt; 5 (Weight=-7,94)\nC 8 : 2 -&gt; 5 (Weight=4,90)\nC 9 : 0 -&gt; 6 (Weight=-2,25)\nC 10 : 1 -&gt; 6 (Weight=0,01)\nC 11 : 2 -&gt; 6 (Weight=-1,40)\nC 17 : 0 -&gt; 8 (Weight=2,06)\nC 18 : 8 -&gt; 3 (Weight=2,05)\nC 60 : 5 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-3,87)\nC 586 : 4 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-1,71)\nC 619 : 3 -&gt; 4 (Weight=3,32)\nC 692 : 4 -&gt; 8 (Weight=-4,74)\n\n\n"}}
