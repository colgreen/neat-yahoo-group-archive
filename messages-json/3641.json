The result is usua=\r\nlly a higher fitness vector than the \n&gt; original organism output vector fit=\r\nness.\n&gt; \n&gt; One interpretation is to view the implementation as a transform =\r\nof \n&gt; the solution space (i.e. finding the best starting point which \nleads=\r\n \n&gt; to the best fitness). Pairing the local optimal fitness to the \n&gt; organ=\r\nism rather than the fitness associated with the organism \noutput \n&gt; vector.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another possibility is to re-write the organism genome such that \nthe=\r\n \n&gt; local optimal vector is it&#39;s new output, and assigning the local \n&gt; opt=\r\nimal fitness to the new substituted organism. But the problems \nof \n&gt; speci=\r\nes membership and gene markers are lost.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus the possibility of embed=\r\nding the local optimal genome as the \n&gt; recessive gene of the original orga=\r\nnism, would allow the species \n&gt; membership and gene markers to remain. At =\r\nleast until the current \n&gt; population has been evaluated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you hea=\r\nrd of any work involving re-writing the organism \ngenome \n&gt; during the eval=\r\nuation phase?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Andy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Der=\r\nek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Andy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not that I know of...mayb=\r\ne Ken knows of NEAT implementations of \n&gt; recessive genes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At one =\r\npoint with ANJI, we discussed going down this route. Since\n&gt; &gt; genes in NEA=\r\nT are traditionally monoploid (having only one set of\n&gt; &gt; genes), but we th=\r\nought about doing a diploid representation (two \n&gt; sets\n&gt; &gt; of genes, one f=\r\nrom each parent). You could then use \n&gt; dominant/recessive\n&gt; &gt; markers for =\r\ngenes to determine which ones are expressed. You \ncould\n&gt; &gt; also experiment=\r\n with blending, for example in connection weights,\n&gt; &gt; where there is neith=\r\ner a recessive nor dominant expression, but \nsome\n&gt; &gt; blended function of t=\r\nhe two (e.g. an average of the two). And if \nyou\n&gt; &gt; wanted to get really w=\r\neird, you could implement polyploidy, \nwhere \n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; individual has any=\r\n number of sets of genes (e.g. each individual \n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; have 10 parents=\r\n).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be interested to see some data from a direct comparison of =\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; implementation with and without recessive genes, so if you&#39;re \ngoing=\r\n \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; do it, let us know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Derek\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Nov 14, 2007 10=\r\n:11 AM, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHas there been any work to date on implementing recessive \ngenes \n&gt; in a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  NEAT genome?
