You can actuall=\r\ny use raw inputs and raw outputs. Your robot will probably have sensors to =\r\ndetect collision with a wall -- a bumper for instance -- at least if you wa=\r\nnt it to react to such a situation. &quot;Stalled against a wall&quot; can then easil=\r\ny be detected relative to &quot;going forward&quot; because of the value of such a se=\r\nnsor and then considered as different. \n\nWe have add very good results with=\r\n novelty search or behavioral diversity while using a discretized version o=\r\nf the stream of inputs and outputs (simply 0 if below min+range/2 and 1 oth=\r\nerwise) and the hamming distance to compute behavioral distances.

It does sound like you have a workable idea =\r\nfor integrating novelty search into competitive coevolution.  Of course, I&#39;=\r\nd be particularly careful on the way behavior is measured because it is the=\r\n key to identifying novelty.  One tip is to make sure you don&#39;t only includ=\r\ne raw outputs or raw inputs as part of the behavior characterization, becau=\r\nse what matters most is what an agent actually does, as opposed to what it =\r\nwants to do.  For example, if an agent spend 100 timesteps trying to run th=\r\nrough a wall, we would want to characterize its behavior as being stalled r=\r\nather than as moving forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, one of the big challenges in compe=\r\ntitive coevolution (and alife in general) is to create a domain that is ope=\r\nn-ended enough to support something interesting arising.  The robot duel wa=\r\ns my attempt to do that, but perhaps it could be enhanced to support more o=\r\npen-endedness, though I don&#39;t know how off-hand.  But the risk you always h=\r\nave in these domains is that even if you have a fantastic algorithmic setup=\r\n that in principle could discover amazing behaviors, it is always possible =\r\nthat the domain itself only supports a limited range of strategies.  For ex=\r\nample, it is hard to imagine strategies in the robot duel that go very far =\r\nbeyond the one shown here: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/re=\r\nsearch/robotmovies/clip8.gif  \n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, overall I think your idea =\r\ncan make a good experiment.  You mention that you need to write something u=\r\np for graduation - what degree are you working on?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ken,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think I get what you&#39;re saying about categorizing parasites (or=\r\n, their\n&gt; &gt; behavior) into classes. I&#39;m thinking in particular about the ro=\r\nbot duel from\n&gt; &gt; your paper &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary =\r\nComplexi=EF=AC=81cation&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Instead of categorizing the parasite behavior=\r\n, I was thinking break out\n&gt; &gt; meaningful classifications of sensor inputs.=\r\n Classification of behavior of\n&gt; &gt; the host would based on it&#39;s movement ve=\r\nctor and speed (moving away,\n&gt; &gt; towards, fast/slow, going after food, etc)=\r\n. Of course, this is a dynamic\n&gt; &gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So for each time t=\r\nhe classification of inputs changes, the behavior of the\n&gt; &gt; host is classi=\r\nfied and checked for novelty. These individual novelty\n&gt; &gt; measurements are=\r\n all added up at the end of the run, and divided by the\n&gt; &gt; number of class=\r\n of input changes to normalize things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as making it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, of course a reco=\r\nrd of\n&gt; &gt; who won is essentially a fitness measure, so there&#39;d have to be a=\r\n hybrid\n&gt; &gt; novelty/fitness in there somewhere, because measuring who won i=\r\ns not a\n&gt; &gt; novelty measure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a=\r\n lot of benefits to the table. My\n&gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is an=\r\n added parameter for population growth\n&gt; &gt; allowance for the host group. In=\r\nstead of a fitness function, a novelty\n&gt; &gt; metric is used (assuming one can=\r\n be made, obviously that&#39;s tricky). The host\n&gt; &gt; population remains the hos=\r\nts until their population has grown the specified\n&gt; &gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping th=\r\nat will encourage a nice broad range of strategies to\n&gt; &gt; be evaluated. Onc=\r\ne that max population % has been hit, a &quot;cataclysmic event&quot;\n&gt; &gt; occurs (cat=\r\naclysm-neat? rapture-neat? Harold Camping-neat?)  to wipe out the\n&gt; &gt; extra=\r\n population, and only the best performing hosts are kept, which would\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\ne how it integrates into the competition side of things. .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then th=\r\ne parasites and hosts flip. Essentially novelty is used to explore\n&gt; &gt; diff=\r\nering behaviors up until the cataclysmic event, then performance is used\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; to prune the population back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but if I=\r\n can\n&gt; &gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gonna give it a=\r\n whirl.\n&gt; &gt; Gotta write up something interesting to graduate I suppose.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Drew\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On=\r\n Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I just wanted to echo that I think combining novelty=\r\n search with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction between evolving agents is very interesting,=\r\n if only we can find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a way to characterize behavior generally enough =\r\nto overcome the inherent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noisiness of interaction. Of course, you hav=\r\ne clearly been thinking about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that, and it may be possible to make pr=\r\nogress following your line of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reasoning.
