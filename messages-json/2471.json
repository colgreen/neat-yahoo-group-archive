Admittedly it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;a huge step backwards in terms of the level of abstraction. Anyway lets\n&gt;&gt;keep the idea going...\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;Just a thought that you can always have two levels of abstraction \n&gt;here, a totally generic outer layer, where the Phenome is not assumed \n&gt;to take or return anything or exhibit any particular property except \n&gt;to be evaluatable by some Fitness class, and an inner level, which \n&gt;all you current stuff would fit in, where you have refined the \n&gt;interfaces that the Fitness and Phenome classes will use, but not yet \n&gt;what they use them for...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood idea. I&#39;ve read through the C# generics docs now which includes a \nfew usage scenarios, a comparison with C++ templates and a few words \nabout possible pitfalls. All I can do now is have a go and see what I \ncome up with. I have used C++ templates before but only for trivial \ncontainer class scenarios, and that was 5 years ago, but since then I \nhave missed not having templates available at times.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
