What would be your recommendations for the\n&gt;mean population complexity threshold for this experiment?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFirst we need to distinguish between the three different double pole \nexperiments as discussed in Ken&#39;s paper 1) double-pole, 2) double-pole \nwithout a velocity input and 3) as in 2 but with a modified fitness \nfunction that punishes rapid &#39;wiggling&#39; of the poles - which apparently \nis a way of cheating, although I suspect this is a symptom of the \nphysics model in use. Perhaps reducing the time increment and/or \nlimiting the maximum velocity of the cart would be another way of \nresolving this problem, I&#39;m not sure\n\nIf I remember correctly, solutions to 1 & 2  are typically evolved quite \nrapidly and therefore even with pruning switched on the complexity of \nthe population won&#39;t rise enough to trigger it. (3) on the other hand is \na trickier problem, but I&#39;ll have to check if pruning actually assists.\n\n&gt;We&#39;re probably going to end up duplicating double pole balancing in\n&gt;ANJI and trying a few different experiments, so we may have additional\n&gt;questions/issues.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSure, it&#39;s probably worth looking at both my double-pole source and \nKen&#39;s (originally from elsewhere as Ken pointed out recently) as I think \nI did a bit of cleaning up and possibly some optimisation. Syntactically \nthough the C++, Java and C# will be almost identical so porting is easy.\n\nI&#39;ll get back to you w.r.t. pruning in problem (3).\n\nColin\n\n"}}
