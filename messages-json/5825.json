Smart metering equipment records ene=\r\nrgy consumption data in regular intervals multiple times an hour, reporting=\r\n this data to a central system, usually located at a local public utility c=\r\nompany. Here, consumption data can be correlated and analyzed to detect ano=\r\nmalies like unusually high consumption. Goal of the GECCO 2012 Industrial C=\r\nhallenge is to develop accurate forecasting methods for electrical energy c=\r\nonsumption profiles. Accurate consumption profile forecasting enables intel=\r\nligent control of renewable energy source infrastructure, such as storage p=\r\nower plants, and therefore contributes to a smaller carbon footprint. Accur=\r\nate consumption profile forecasting also enables energy\nconsumers to accura=\r\ntely assess the return on investment of measures to\nincrease energy efficie=\r\nncy.\n\nHighlights of the GECCO 2011 Industrial Challenge include:\n\n- Interes=\r\nting Problem Domain: Forecasting energy consumption profiles based on smart=\r\n metering data offers a challenging yet manageable test case for modern tim=\r\ne series prediction methods.\n- Real-world Data: Multiple real quarter-hourl=\r\ny energy consumption time series are provided for training, testing, and as=\r\nsessing forecasting methods.\n- Direct Link to Industry: GreenPocket GmbH wi=\r\nll evaluate the winning submissions for real-world application and will be =\r\nin direct contact with the winning participants, who will keep all rights t=\r\no their forecasting systems.\n\nAbout GreenPocket\n\nGreenPocket provides pione=\r\nering software for smart metering and smart home solutions. Combining the\nb=\r\nest of the Internet with the new world of smart energy, GreenPocket enables=\r\n utility companies to\nsignificantly increase their customer&#39;s energy effici=\r\nency. Founded 2009, GreenPocket is Germany&#39;s leading\nsoftware provider for =\r\nconsumer-orientated smart energy software.\nImportant Dates and Contacts\n- C=\r\nhallenge Website: http://gociop.de/gecco-2012-industrial-challenge/\n- Chall=\r\nenge Submission Deadline: June 22, 2012\n- GECCO-2012 Conference: July 07-11=\r\n, 2012\n- Organizers: O.
