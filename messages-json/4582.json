For\nexample, I am assuming that e=\r\nither leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\npart of a coupled non-linear oscill=\r\nator, or is it somehow more\nappropriate for the neurons to be non-leaky?  I=\r\n guess I am curious why\nhaving a non-leaky neuron would be the most favorab=\r\nle choice in such a\nmodel, or whether it is somehow a matter of definition.=\r\n  \n\nAlso, what are the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n=\r\nthat would create this kind of system?\n\nIn my experience, the leaky neurons=\r\n also can produce oscillations\nreliably, but I am not sure if that is actua=\r\nlly anything different\nfrom what you are describing or just another instanc=\r\ne of the same\nphenomenon.\n\nThanks,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vino=\r\nd K. Valsalam&quot; &lt;vkv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting work!  I w=\r\nas also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; perform on this domain.  The v=\r\nideos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote wit=\r\nh Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\n&gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n&gt; \n&gt; With regard to the dis=\r\ncussion about generating oscillations, I used\n&gt; neither sine wave as input =\r\nnor leaky integrators.  Instead, neural\n&gt; network controllers with standard=\r\n sigmoid neurons were modularized to\n&gt; behave as coupled non-linear oscilla=\r\ntors (coupled cell systems).  As\n&gt; explained in the paper, and as Jean-Bapt=\r\niste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; post, such oscillators can produce synchrono=\r\nus and phase-related\n&gt; periodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits.  T=\r\nhey are easy to\n&gt; evolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, p=\r\nace, bound\n&gt; and trot for quadrupeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; With only minor adjustments to y=\r\nour setup, you can convert your\n&gt; substrate configuration to represent non-=\r\nlinear oscillators.  In fact,\n&gt; you would get a configuration similar to my=\r\n modular controllers by\n&gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint =\r\nangles and producing\n&gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs.  Hy=\r\nperNEAT would then\n&gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand=\r\n.  I think that\n&gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if success=\r\nful would\n&gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.  BTW, did you fin=\r\nd that\n&gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary=\r\n to\n&gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; \n&gt; Vinod\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
