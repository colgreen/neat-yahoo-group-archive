This sounds like a very interesting idea and I&#39;ll be\nin=\r\nterested to see the results.  In particular it answers the question\nI kept =\r\nrunning into: &quot;How can a CPPN create a structure of arbitrary\nsize?&quot;  I do =\r\nhave a few questions though.\n\n-When new cells are created, how are the assi=\r\ngned coordinates?  Do you\nkeep things between -1 and 1 or do you let them g=\r\nrow to any x,y?  I\nask because I always keep my substrates between -1 and 1=\r\n because the\nfunctions I use only have &quot;interesting&quot; behavior in those boun=\r\nds. \nIf you do keep them between -1 and 1 though, then it seems like you\nwo=\r\nuld have to keep shifting the cells around and it basically amounts\nto incr=\r\neasing the resolution of the substrate.\n\n-Do you get a sense that there is =\r\na benefit to building things this\nway?  I have a feeling that there are cer=\r\ntain patterns that are easier\nto encode in a developmental process, but I h=\r\nave a hard time actually\nthinking of any that a CPPN could not easily encod=\r\ne on its own.  You\nmention that it cuts down on the number of crappy phenot=\r\nypes, but I&#39;d\nguess that there are just as many crappy snapshot patterns as=\r\n there\nare developmental ones, and one would hope that fitness evaluation\nw=\r\nould take care of that in either case.\n\n-Do the cells influence each other =\r\nin anyway, other than dividing?\n\nThanks,\nDavid\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; Well m=\r\ny project is not finished yet, but here is something that I \n&gt; want to shar=\r\ne with the community. It is about using CPPNs to grow \n&gt; physical or basica=\r\nlly any kind of objects over time. \n&gt; \n&gt; The problem involved when using a =\r\nCPPN to describe a material, \n&gt; physical objects is this. There is no const=\r\nraint in the matter that \n&gt; is available to build an object. One CPPN can o=\r\nutput 100000000000 \n&gt; parts and another just one. All in the same genome co=\r\nmplexity. \n&gt; Inverted &quot;images&quot; of the CPPN output can lead to infinite buil=\r\nding of \n&gt; parts. And more, most objects may just be too bizzare, like a pa=\r\nttern \n&gt; of concentric circles. The search practitioner has to decide and \n=\r\n&gt; develop too hard things. Like the Alife domain, where you should \n&gt; disca=\r\nrd individuals that do not meet the requirements for something \n&gt; that is m=\r\neanigful. \n&gt; \n&gt; The idea I propose is that the phenotype can be built witho=\r\nut \n&gt; quieriyng at each possible coordinate. The CPPN does not have to be a=\r\n \n&gt; snapshot, &quot;printing&quot; an image on the phenotype surface. \n&gt; \n&gt; Consider =\r\na 2D grid where you have one cell (which I call &quot;the seed&quot;) \n&gt; at coordinat=\r\ne 0,0. The CPPN is then asked what to do with that cell. \n&gt; Should it divid=\r\ne, or change type/color/whatever? The CPPN is provided \n&gt; with geometric da=\r\nta, of course, that is the coordinates of the \n&gt; particular cell that is as=\r\nked and the time step of development time. \n&gt; After that, the CPPN is asked=\r\n again, but for those 2 cells, if the \n&gt; first one divides. And then for fo=\r\nur. And eight. etc... \n&gt; \n&gt; In effect, the CPPN instructs a mass of cells o=\r\nver time (TIME IS RE-\n&gt; INTRODUCED!) of how to develop. A cell divides in t=\r\nhis way. If it is \n&gt; not completely surounded by other cells, choose random=\r\nly a place \n&gt; where to put a new cell. The parent cell still retains its po=\r\nsition. \n&gt; The CPPN has the input of the current cell&#39;s position and time u=\r\nntil \n&gt; end of development. The development of the phenotype happens in \n&gt; =\r\ndiscrete time steps where all the cells are checked at once and then \n&gt; the=\r\n phenotype is replaced. \n&gt; \n&gt; During development time, objects of cells app=\r\near. I can confirm that \n&gt; these objects&#39;s shapes are directly related to t=\r\nhe functions used in \n&gt; the CPPNs. In fact, when I use sin(x) and sin(y) fo=\r\nr inputs, they are \n&gt; so.. cool! Like flowers and any kind of shapes. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Besides, there are no empty holes, and there is no shit like if you&#39;d \n&gt; t=\r\nry it with the snapshot approach. All objects are just made \n&gt; of &quot;matter&quot;.=\r\n They can be directly moved over a physical simulation or \n&gt; something like=\r\n this. \n&gt; \n&gt; This in fact brings the CPPN theory more closely to engeneerin=\r\ng \n&gt; applications and stuff. Also in Artificial Life. In fact my project \n&gt;=\r\n is dedicated to Alife mostly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Chervenski\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
