But several years ago I was asked \nwhether NEAT could run in a world with no overseer.  In other words, \ndoes NEAT require a &quot;global observer&quot; on top the the system to make \nsure everything happens correctly.  An example of a world without an \nobserver is one with a bunch of autonomous robots, each with their \nown genome and NN, but nothing else to decide anything about who \nshould mate with whom, how many offspring, etc..\n\nObviously, a world like that would not allow the usual NEAT \nalgorithm, or even rtNEAT, but the question was really about \nhistorical markings.  The person was making the point that the \nhistorical markings would totally fail in that scenario, because \nthere can be no global counters.  So the bots couldn&#39;t even mate \nwith a NEAT-like crossover.\n\nBut we noticed that there is a simple solution to that problem: Just \nassign totally random innovation numbers from a large range.  The \nchances that two genes get the same random number is low enough that \nit shouldn&#39;t be disruptive.  Genes could still be lined up by their \ninnovation numbers even though the numbers would no longer reflect \nhistorical order.  \n\nAnyway, the reason I mention it is because *that* system is what I&#39;d \nreally call &quot;arbitrary&quot; labeling.  I don&#39;t think it buys anything \nuseful in a normal global-observer scenario though.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ian Badcoe wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi Colin,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;At 11:54 02/10/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One notable problem was deciding on connection lengths, relative \nneuron\n&gt; &gt;&gt;positions for new genes etc. in relation to where all of the \ncurrent\n&gt; &gt;&gt;neurons are in the decoded network. If you get this wrong then \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;system performs a very inefficient search of the search space, \ne.g.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;always connecting to the &#39;outer&#39; neurons at the ends of the 1D \nspace.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;At the moment I am addressing that by limiting all fIDs to a \nrange of 0 - 1.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Also, for the boards, I start the system with the 4 build-in \nboards (mine, \n&gt; &gt;yours, empty, our-of-range) positioned evenly through the range \n(.125, \n&gt; &gt;.375, .625, .875) so I know there are no outrageously large \ngaps...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I think the problem grows with the size of the genome. As you \nbranch off \n&gt; (branch in 1D space?) into new areas of space it becomes more \ndifficult \n&gt; to think of a scheme that would result in attempts to connect into \nthose \n&gt; potentially far away areas that isn&#39;t also really bad at exploring \nlocal \n&gt; space. There&#39;s probably a really simple elegant solution. Oh and I \nwas \n&gt; never quite sure how many dimensions would work best, or in fact \nwhy I \n&gt; should use one continous space of N-dimensions at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;I can&#39;t say whether this works due to other problems with my set \nup, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt;it&#39;s definitely something I would like to get back to someday if \nI get time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         It&#39;s good to know that great minds continue to think \nalike :)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This is probably an indication that there is some underlying \nfundamental \n&gt; unified system that we are converging upon.... just kidding! \nActually \n&gt; I&#39;m glad you put a smiley on the end of that sentence.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;         This idea of offsetting the fIDs to give local \nconnections and \n&gt; &gt;modularity is one that I haven&#39;t considered so much.  I have \nconsidered a \n&gt; &gt;plan where nested data structures use multiple fIDs to identify \nthe \n&gt; &gt;separate parts.  e.g. if we have something roughtly equivalent to:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;struct Coord {\n&gt; &gt;         float x;\n&gt; &gt;         float y;\n&gt; &gt;         float z;\n&gt; &gt;};\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Then a fID on the outer item (the Coord) identifies it \nas a \n&gt; &gt;coordinate, and separate fIDs on the x, y and z identify them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Whether in this scheme you need fIDs for &quot;name&quot; as well \nas &quot;type&quot; \n&gt; &gt;I do not yet know (e.g. my_pos and your_pos are both &quot;coords&quot; but \nthat \n&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t mean no system would need to distinguish between them).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         I have gone into this in some detail in the Manifesto \nfor Evolving \n&gt; &gt;Agents.  I&#39;ve put that on hold for a while so I can work on \nSLEAT, but I \n&gt; &gt;still intend to finish it one day :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Just think of all the sidetracks as building up knowledge and code \nas a \n&gt; basis for the other stuff. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Ian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\t\t\n&gt; &gt;___________________________________________________________ \n&gt; &gt;To help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all \nnew Yahoo!
