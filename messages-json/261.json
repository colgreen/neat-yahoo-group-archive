I am a lurker\n&gt; and intend on using NEAT in the future.  For now, I\n&gt; am using simple feedforward networks making an\n&gt; evaluation of a board state with a ply management\n&gt; system.  I am replicating the experiments in the\n&gt; book Blondie24 by David Fogel.  I have developed a\n&gt; framework for playing &quot;generic&quot; perfect information\n&gt; non-random two player games.  My first\n&gt; implementation is obviously checkers.  My goal\n&gt; implemetation is Go.\n\nYou will spoil your lurker status with such well\nwritten posts! :)\n\nFogel&#39;s book is what inspired me to work on\nneuroevolution.\n\nI suppose your generic game player is in C++?\n\n&gt; My gut feel on your assertion is that I agree.  I\n&gt; sense that min/max (or some specialization of it\n&gt; like Alpha/Beta) will likely be present in more\n&gt; complex game playing ANNs.  It seems it would take\n&gt; an enormous amount of searching in a game space for\n&gt; a GA to have an ANN of any type converge to the\n&gt; min/max mechanism regardless of the ANN\n&gt; meta-architecture approach.  In fact, it seems more\n&gt; likely for an ANN using GA to attempt to use the\n&gt; pattern recognition approach many times before\n&gt; stumbling on a rudimentary version of min/max (it\n&gt; would require recurrent connections in the ANN and\n&gt; in unique combinations).\n\nA recurrent architecture, such as NEAT can create,\nmight be able to develop the equivalent of 1-ply\nlook-ahead, which would be adequate for tic-tac-toe. \nI think this is worth attempting, and would be an\nadvancement of the state-of-the-art. \n\n&gt; However, I do think that it is possible for ANNs to\n&gt; suggest moves at which to take a deeper look.  For\n&gt; example, in the domain of Go, there are way too many\n&gt; possible moves for even a full ply search of depth 2\n&gt; to yield any level of effectiveness.  The breadth of\n&gt; available &quot;legal&quot; moves in Go starts at 361 and\n&gt; stays above 100 for almost the entire game.  Worse,\n&gt; thanks to captures and Ko, the number of legal moves\n&gt; is not guaranteed to descend.\n\nThis is a very good idea!\n\nI strongly suggest staying away from full-board Go, at\nleast for the next decade.  If you want some chance of\nsuccess, I recommend 5x5 first-capture Go. \n(First-capture is the variation where the game ends if\nany stone or stones are captured.)  There are no KO&#39;s,\nand clearly finite length games, yet this game is\nchallenging.  (and you can move up to 7x7)\n\nConnect 4 seems like a good game to work on.  Many\npeople know it.  There are several websites where one\ncan play vs. a computer.  There are only 7 possible\nmoves per turn.  The games are much shorter than\nchess, checkers or Go.  Yet the game is far from\ntrivial.\n\n&gt; As such, some sort of mechanism to priortize looking\n&gt; at some subset of &quot;legal&quot; moves is essential (if you\n&gt; are familiar with Go, you could refer to the\n&gt; patterns described in &quot;Go Proverbs&quot;).  I suspect an\n&gt; ANN that specializes in small regional patterns will\n&gt; likely be able to be evolved that reduces the\n&gt; &quot;legal&quot; move set substantially.  Even then, it would\n&gt; need to reduce it to less than 3% FOR EACH PLY DEPTH\n&gt; to make a ply search depth of 6 or 8 even reasonable\n&gt; computationally.  That is one hell of an efficiency,\n&gt; +97% *accurate* reduction in legal moves.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the present time, I am sort of seeing an ANN\n&gt; sandwich; ANN #1 takes a set of all legal moves and\n&gt; prioritizes them.  A ply manager then recursively\n&gt; calls ANN #1 until it reaches a certain depth.  Then\n&gt; the ply manager presents the resultant board state\n&gt; to ANN #2 for a full board evaluation.  This cycle\n&gt; continues until a move is deemed most effective and\n&gt; then utilized.\n&gt; \n&gt; The way in which ANN #1 evolves (mutation and/or\n&gt; feedback on a fixed topology, direct encoding using\n&gt; NEAT, indirect encoding using many different types\n&gt; of topological techniques including NEAT) can be\n&gt; completely different from the way in which ANN #2\n&gt; evolves.  This produces a meta-GA GA approach; a GA\n&gt; for discovering the ideal GA techinique for each of\n&gt; the two ANNs.  As you can imagine, we now have a\n&gt; HUGE computational space.  And this assumes two ANNs\n&gt; and some form of the min-max algorithm.  And there\n&gt; are other &quot;techniques&quot; for capturing static patterns\n&gt; in a pattern matching DB that might be more\n&gt; efficient in the long run.\n\nUsing more than one ANN for an application makes good\nsense.  We now know that the mammalian brain is\norganized in many distince modules that communicate\nwith each other.  We can do that with ANNs.  In fact I\nhave run some experiments with two ANNs solving my\n4play puzzle.  (two 22 neuron ANNs instead of one 44\nneuron ANN).  First results were encouraging.  It is a\nway of substantially reducing the number of weights.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
