XOR is fully Perl based, and does a generation \nwith a population size of 100 at a rate of about 5-6 per second.  Fast \nenough to not bore me, anyway.\n\nI&#39;ve added more configurable items, and I&#39;ve tested it enough to make sure \nit behaves as I expected it to.  And it does.  Problem is, it doesn&#39;t solve \nXOR.  The best solution is structured as I would expect:  one hidden node.  \nThe output node is connected to all input and bias and hidden, and the \nhidden is connected to all input and bias.  00 returns 0.11, 01 and 10 \nreturn 0.99, but 11 returns 1.0!  ug...\n\nMaybe I am killing off the stagnant species too fast?  Or maybe I need to \nuse a non-linear penalty function...  have the penalty kick in as it nears \nthe end.  I&#39;ll do some more experimenting.\n\nIn the mean time, anybody have any tips for me?  Are there &#39;issues&#39; \nsurrounding XOR that I should know about?  Parameters that if aren&#39;t set \ncorrectly render it impossible to find a solution?\n\n\n\n"}}
