Although I prefer the shorthand\n&gt; &gt; version I&#39;m not /that/ bothered + it&#39;s a trivial change for me to do. If\n&gt; &gt; anyone else is going to want to try and generate SVG it looks like you\n&gt; &gt; will also currently have to change the &quot;bias&quot; to be an &quot;input&quot; and add\n&gt; &gt; your own hint-* attributes and a  [recurrent=&quot;false&quot;] attribute on each\n&gt; &gt; conenction. I&#39;ll look into optionally outputting this extra stuff from\n&gt; &gt; SharpNEAT and perhaps tying in an SVG viewer of some sort.\n&gt; \n&gt; We also do not have &lt;neurons&gt; and &lt;connections&gt; tags.  Each &lt;neuron&gt;\n&gt; and &lt;connection&gt; element is a direct child of &lt;network&gt;.\n\nYes, that&#39;s true.  Seems a little redundant to have both &lt;neurons&gt; and\n&lt;neuron&gt; tags.  Is there a particular reason why you structured it\nthat way, Colin?\n\n&gt; The recurrent tag should be optional - Derek can you verify that?\n\nRight...Colin did mention this.  If you leave the recurrent tag out,\nit still draws the network just fine.  In a previous version,\nrecurrent connections were drawn in a different color.  Now they&#39;re\nnot.  So it doesn&#39;t really make a difference.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
