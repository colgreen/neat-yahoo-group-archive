However, I question whether this is really \n&gt;a major problem in nature or NEAT?  Since crossover for the most \n&gt;part takes place in a single species, and two organisms in the same \n&gt;species more or less have the same set of genes, the issue of \n&gt;different building blocks being broken apart from the parents to the \n&gt;offspring seems overblown.  Of course, if a duck mated with a pig, \n&gt;it would be a huge problem to make sure the duck genes largely stuck \n&gt;together.  However, why is this such a concern when a duck mates \n&gt;with a duck?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree with what you&#39;re saying here, but consider this. We have a NEAT \ngenome that describes a network which we can break down into seperate \nsub-networks, each of which is useful in it&#39;s own right. How do we allow \nNEAT to exchange whole sub-networks and try out combinations unless we \nsomehow group genes within the genome. Nature groups genes by placing \nthem close together in the genome, and because crossover works on chunks \nof connected genes, those that are close together will most likely \nremain together after crossover - and not be split up.\n\nOn the other hand, the two parent genomes are so closely matched that \nthe alternative sequence we get from the other parent is almost the \nsame, which takes us back to your point. Yeh, more thinking required on \nthis one.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
