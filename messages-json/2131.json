I need to think \n&gt;about it also.  I like the idea of keeping away from places that \n&gt;already got stuck.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nRegarding this point:\n\n&gt;The problem is how do we ensure we generate new genomes \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;that are sufficiently different enough from the dead species to go and \n&gt;explore new areas of the search space? \n&gt;\nIf we solve this problem then we might not have to explicitly avoid \nspecific points in the fitness space, since the new genomes hopefully \nhave enough distance from the local peaks to not get trapped again.\n\nOne other thought, if you avoid specific points/areas then you may still \nend up with a bunch of genomes around the edge of these points/areas if \nthey were previously on a climb to a peak, because you still have the \npeak in the fitness space but you prevent genomes from approaching it. \nIt&#39;s like a ring fence around the peak and as such is not necessarily \nmuch better than just the peak - unless you perhaps gradually increase \nthe areas of the ring fence, by e.g. increasing the compatibility \nthreshold with the dead species that define the areas.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
