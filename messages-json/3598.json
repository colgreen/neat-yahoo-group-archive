Of \ncourse this is don=\r\ne by NEAT.\nWhen the error limit I preset was somewhat bigger say 0.1, the \n=\r\nprogram worked well, and gave results very quickly. But when I \nimproved th=\r\ne limit to be 0.01 or even smaller, the program became \nunbearably slow, wh=\r\nile the fitness curve was not as I had expected \nbut to go down and down th=\r\nrough, and finally fluctuated near a value \nfar from optimum.\nI am using MA=\r\nTLAB_NEAT, by modifying the XOR_EXPERIMENT. I have \nchanged the fitness fun=\r\nction to 1/(1+rmse)(Thanks to Emyr James), \nwhere rmse is the root mean squ=\r\nare error which measures the agreement \nof output with output pattern, it i=\r\ns computed by concerning every row \nof the output, just as the original pro=\r\ngram does. The program uses \nsigmoidal function as its activation function.=\r\n In my first several \nexperiments, I forgot to modify the gain scale factor=\r\n, which was 4.9 \noriginally, surely to be in favour of classification, but =\r\nnot proper \nin an output pattern randomly distributed between -1 and 1. Aft=\r\ner \nhaving studied the possible weights, I used 0.84 as the gain scale \nfac=\r\ntor. Of course I had scaled the sigmoidal function outputs to be  \n[-1,1](T=\r\nhanks to Stephen Waits).\nHave I forgotten something? Until now I have mainl=\r\ny experimented \nunder one-column output, even this will take hundreds of ge=\r\nnerations, \nbut only to find stuck in the end, and this happens when I have=\r\n just \nchanged the error limit from 0.1 to 0.01. Is that common? I have als=\r\no \ntried the intended three-column output pattern several times, but the \nr=\r\nesults were terrible, maybe require thousands of generations to get \nan ans=\r\nwer, or maybe not.\nI have read through Ken&#39;s doctoral paper, but it&#39;s too a=\r\nbstract, and \nI found no solution to what I have encountered. Actually the =\r\nproblem \nI am working on has already been resolved by BP network, with 28 \n=\r\nhidden nodes. I only want to find a simpler and more efficient \nnetwork, so=\r\n I turned to NEAT.\nBut now I can go no further, could you tell me why? Mayb=\r\ne the \noriginal code of XOR_EXPERIMENT is basically unable to solve a \nprob=\r\nlem other than classification? Or have I messed up something?\n\n\n"}}
