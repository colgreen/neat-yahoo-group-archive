Just one small additional thought:  what do we mean by \n&quot;dimensions&quot; in the search space?\n\n\tExample, suppose we&#39;re doing some vision processing and by whatever means \nwe arrive at a good solution.  Then we analyze the solution and we discover \nthat, although it contains 1000 neurones, they are actually 10 copies(*) of \nthe same 90-neurone structure (say an edge-detector) and a control network \nlinking them together(**).  That&#39;s not really anything like as large a \nsolution-space as it looked before the analysis, for two reasons:\n\n(* or 10 &quot;iso-neural&quot; networks, e.g. not copies but functionally \nequivalent....)\n\n(** current systems are unlikely to produce this, see below)\n\n1) The 10 copies of the edge detector are 10 copies of the same set of \ndimensions, and thus a sub-space with 10-fold less dimensions than it \noriginally appeared\n\n2) The edge-detector and the control network are (arguably) not in the same \nsearch-space -- they are &quot;orthogonal&quot;.  e.g. the modularity of the problem \nonly requires them to respect the same &quot;interface&quot; connections, if does not \nrequired the edge-detector internal works to be finely tuned to match the \ncontrol network.  Or, to put it another way, any functional edge detector \nwould work with any functional control network.\n\n\tStronger examples of modularity producing orthogonality can easily be \ndreamed up.  Consider the case of N sub-nets, each evolved to recognize a \ndifferent input class, and a control net which just checks for which \nsub-net is reporting the highest confidence.  There is no dependency(***) \nbetween the sub-nets.  (Their internal dependencies are (i) report their \nconfidence on a connection to the control net, (ii) the input data format.)\n\n(*** dependency is the opposite of orthogonality)\n\n\tHowever, one cannot expect a homogeneous evolution procedure to just \nhappen to produce orthogonal modules.  You need a modular evolution system:\n\n\t(slowest) mutate modularity\n\t(medium) try topologies within each module\n\t(fastest) play with the weights in each module\n\n\t- as people have begun to tinker with.\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
