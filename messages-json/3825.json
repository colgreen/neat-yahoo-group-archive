This is \nconsistent \n=\r\n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; my own experiences with NEAT, in instances in which the fitness=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; evaluation was computationally non-trivial (i.e. most useful real-\n&gt; =\r\nworld \n&gt; &gt; problems).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Prior posts have outlined various useful lib=\r\nraries applicable to \n&gt; &gt; implementation of a history functionality w/ NEAT=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
