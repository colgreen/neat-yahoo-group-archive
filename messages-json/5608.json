On the other hand, while you point out that in nature we don&#39;t have =\r\nsuch large turnover, another big difference in NE (and evolutionary algorit=\r\nhms in general) compared to nature is that a large percentage of offspring =\r\nin NE are generally hopelessly defective mutants (even taking miscarriages =\r\ninto account).  So you could argue that the tradition high selectivity goes=\r\n hand in hand with the high rate of defective mutations.\n\nStill, it is poss=\r\nible that what appears &quot;defective&quot; is a stepping stone to something that is=\r\n useful, so perhaps keeping it may help theoretically.  Yet my intuition ab=\r\nout this issue is fuzzy because the defective mutants are usually not so di=\r\nfferent from their parents genetically.  Usually what is happening is that =\r\nthey had the misfortune of moving slightly off a local optimum in a particu=\r\nlarly dangerous direction.  In that view, they may not be that helpful beca=\r\nuse the probability of going to the next promising stepping stone/local opt=\r\nimum from them is hardly different than the probability of getting there fr=\r\nom their genetic siblings with higher fitness, since they are so closely re=\r\nlated anyway.  Even if a high level of diversity allows some defective offs=\r\npring to drift far away from their parents over generations, because such d=\r\nrift is not really a byproduct of fitness, you could have gotten equally fa=\r\nr away faster just with a higher mutation rate, so it&#39;s a complicated issue=\r\n.\n\nIn general I tend to think that some kinds of diversity is better than o=\r\nthers.  In a sense, if you are unique yet have low fitness, it is worth thi=\r\nnking about what justifies investment in your reproduction.  I would say th=\r\nere are three major possible justifications in the case of low fitness: (1)=\r\n If your ANN is topologically novel then it might hold out the promise of b=\r\netter performance if we gave it time to optimize.  (2) If your phenotypic b=\r\nehavior is novel, then your neural functionality might present new capabili=\r\nties that we should explore further.  (3) If your weights are radically dif=\r\nferent from any we&#39;ve seen before, perhaps we should spend a little time wa=\r\nndering around your neck of the search space in case there is something int=\r\neresting there.  However, the one type of diversity that might not be so us=\r\neful is if you are genetically and structurally very similar to your parent=\r\ns and your performance is very low (and not low in a unique way).  In that =\r\ncase, the argument for investing in your future is less convincing.\n\nOf cou=\r\nrse, empirical results speak for themselves, and healthy diversity is a mat=\r\nter of degree, but these considerations hopefully at least give some useful=\r\n perspective that could help give context to an investigation of why raisin=\r\ng the cutoff to 80% might be helping in some cases.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Back in April I outl=\r\nined an idea for maintaining broad diversity\n&gt; within a population which I =\r\nconsider to be a generalisation on novelty\n&gt; search. I&#39;m still working on t=\r\nhat front in order to try and get some\n&gt; expeimental results to back up (or=\r\n refute) the idea. In the mean time\n&gt; though while working on a test proble=\r\nm it occurred to me that there&#39;s\n&gt; a very easy change we perhaps should all=\r\n be making in our existing\n&gt; NEAT code, and that is to select genomes from =\r\na larger proportion of\n&gt; the population. Withn NEAT we tend to think of spe=\r\nciation with fitness\n&gt; sharing as the principle mechanism for maintaining d=\r\niversity, which it\n&gt; does do. But if at each generation we keep, say, the t=\r\nop 20% of each\n&gt; species (elitism) and also select from that same 20% then =\r\nwe&#39;re giving\n&gt; up a futher source of diversity within each species. (20% is=\r\n the\n&gt; default in SharpNEAT but I think similar values are generally used i=\r\nn\n&gt; most NEAT based work).\n&gt; \n&gt; If we think about populations in the natura=\r\nl world then they have a\n&gt; much lower turnover rate where some small propor=\r\ntion die and are\n&gt; replaced each year. Of course if you pick a longer perio=\r\nd of time the\n&gt; turnover rate per unit of time is higher, but the point is =\r\nthat there\n&gt; is a more continuous and slow &#39;turnover&#39; in populations, and t=\r\nhis\n&gt; allows diverse set of genomes to create offspring over and over again=\r\n\n&gt; despite having relatively low fitness. It&#39;s a balance between faster\n&gt; a=\r\npproach to local optima (and potnetially gettign stuck) and takign a\n&gt; broa=\r\nder slower approach taking in a broader region of the search\n&gt; space.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI still think there&#39;s additional merit in breaking the region down in\n&gt; sub=\r\n-regions and balancing the diversity evenly, hence I will be\n&gt; pursuing tha=\r\nt idea, but for now many of us can improve diversity in\n&gt; our searches by t=\r\nweaking some config settings. I tried this with a\n&gt; deceptive task that req=\r\nuired an ANN to both balance a pole but also to\n&gt; swing it up from a positi=\r\non where the pole is pointing straight down.\n&gt; It&#39;s quite tricky combining =\r\nthe fitness from these two seperate tasks\n&gt; and increasing the elitism and =\r\nselection proportions substantially\n&gt; does seem to help in this instance (e=\r\n.g. I tried 80%).\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
