How many generations did\nyou run, what was your pop size, and did you get a chance to look at\nthe winning structure at all?  One thing that&#39;s also always useful to\ncheck is that the number of species is reasonable over the run...huge\nexplosions of species, or lack of species, can indicate a problem.\n\nCan you give a little more info on what you mean by &quot;amalgamate\nmatching innovations per generation?&quot;  I thought you meant refreshing\nthe recorded list of innovation numbers each generation, but then when\nyou ask whether I do this in the initial population as well, I&#39;m not\nsure what you mean?  In the initial population, every individual has\nthe same exact (minimal) structure, and hence every individual has the\nsame exact innovation numbers on each matching link.  So hopefully I\ncan answer your question better after I get a better understanding of\nwhat you mean.\n\nAs far as elitism, keep in mind each species should have its best\nmember copied (as opposed to only the best in the population).  It\ndefinitely should make a positive difference in performance, assuming\nyour species are not too small.  Also, you should probably be using a\ndynamic speciation threshold if you are running more than 50\ngenerations or so.  If you don&#39;t know how to do this, let me know.\n\nOn more question, is your prey domain animated so you can watch the\nsolutions?\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; As some of you will be aware I have been working on a C#\nimplementation \n&gt; of NEAT (which I have deciced to name SharpNEAT). The final pieces\nof \n&gt; the core code were put in place today and although I really should\nunit \n&gt; test some of the latest code I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to\nfire it \n&gt; up using a prey capture domain I had coded for a previous EANN\nproject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Results?  so far so good - the prey capture domain is based on the\none \n&gt; described in the 1996 paper &quot;Incremental Evolution of Complex\nGeneral \n&gt; Behavior&quot; (Faustino Gomez, Risto Miikkulainen). Basically the task \n&gt; difficulty can be increased by giving the prey a varying number of\nhead \n&gt; starts (0 to 4) and then gradually increasing it&#39;s speed from 0.0 to\n1.0 \n&gt; moves per domain time-slice.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal task is to solve 4, 1.0   (4 initial moves and a speed of\n1.0). \n&gt; Previously the most difficult task I was able to solve was 4, 0.3.  \n&gt; Things kind of ground to a halt after that. Using the new NEAT \n&gt; implementation is so far giving better results - so far it has\n&#39;solved&#39; \n&gt; 4, 0.8.  The best network currently passes 75/100 tests on 4, 1.0. \nNot \n&gt; a bad start.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just added in code to amalgamate matching innovations per \n&gt; generation (as Ken mentions in the competitive coevolution paper).\nKen, \n&gt; I wonder - do you amalgamate matching structures in your initial \n&gt; populations too? it would make sense to, currently I don&#39;t.\n&gt; \n&gt; One remaining significant thing I&#39;m not doing is elitist selection\n- my \n&gt; evolution algorithm is currently a pure roulette wheel selection.\nSo \n&gt; this will likely improve things when I change it.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there you go. I will spend some time unit testing / tweaking and \n&gt; hopefully I will have the 4, 1.0 test solved this week and I can\nmove \n&gt; onto some visualisation and/or XML stuff maybe.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
