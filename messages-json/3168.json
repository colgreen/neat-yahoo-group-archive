In many problems this cannot be correct.  So this adds a \nconstraint that the evolution must encompass, possibly only with difficulty.\n\n\tHOWEVER, one aspect to biological system that might mitigate this, \nand which most ANN implementations do not attempt to reproduce, is \nthat biological systems are not purely step-wise.\n\n\te.g. the inside of a single ANN neurone might do something like this:\n\nOutput = ActivationFunction(LastSum);\nLastSum = Sum(Inputs, Weights);\n\n\tThe unbiological aspect to this is that it is totally stepwise, \nthere is no leakage of state from LastSum in frame N to LastSum in \nframe N + 1.  Biological systems have this leakage in both +ve and -ve forms:\n\n+ve - the triggering (biological activation is all or nothing) of a \nneuron is an integration over time, say:\n\nOutput = ActivationFunction(LastSum);\nLastSum = (Sum(Inputs, Weights) + LastSum) / 2.0;\t\t// or adjust the \nrate of decay to suit yourself, or evolve it\n\n-ve - biological neurons have a &quot;refactory period&quot; after firing \nduring which they cannot fire again, thus:\n\nOutput = Output * 0.9 + ActivationFunction(LastSum, Output) * 0.1;\t// \nsecond input to ActivationFunction is inhibitory\nLastSum = Sum(Inputs, Weights);\n\n\tThe first of these has the effect of making processing a \ntime-average, which could smooth out minor differences in signal \ntravel times.  The latter allows saturated systems to continue \nfunctioning (as does down-regulation, another bio-feature we don&#39;t \ntend to use) but to some extent we get that by using a sigmoid \ninstead of a all or nothing.\n\n\tNote that a standard recurrent NEAT implementation can achieve the \nfirst case all on its own, whoever, with a single recurrent link from \na neuron&#39;s output back to its input.\n\n\tIan\n\n\n-- \nNo virus found in this outgoing message.\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.\nVersion: 7.5.446 / Virus Database: 269.5.1/764 - Release Date: 17/04/2007 04:43\n\n\n\n"}}
