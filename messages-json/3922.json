In\n particular, I&#39;d like to ask you if you know who did this before we\n (me, Faustino Gomez, Juergen Schmidhuber) did. Because the algorithm\n we are presenting in this paper is so simple someone must have come up\n with it before, it&#39;s just that our literature search has been\n fruitless.\n\n The basic idea is to combine hillclimbing (1+1 evolution strategy) of\n network topologies, with hillclimbing of network weights, but at a\n faster timescale. So after each (&quot;global&quot;) topology mutation, we\n search (&quot;local&quot;) weight space for a number of steps (e.g. 50), and\n only accepts the global mutation if the fitness after local search is\n higher than before the global mutation. The reason we do this is that\n global mutations are so often disruptive. Yes, this is the same idea\n as &quot;innovation protection&quot; in NEAT, but here we&#39;re boiling it down a\n bare minimum.\n\n We tried two versions of a moderately difficult control task: one with\n a set of 7 carefully selected inputs to the neural network, and one\n with 15 not-so-carefully-selected inputs to the network. We found\n that, when compared to simple hillclimbing in weight space, or to\n climbing weights and topologies at the same time, performed slightly\n better on the small-input  version of the problem problem. On the\n big-input version, the difference was dramatic, in that using\n different timescales was really the only way to solve the problem!\n (Incidentally, learning topology at the &quot;local&quot; level and weights at\n the &quot;global&quot; level worked just as well.)\n\n The paper is here:\n http://julian.togelius.com/Togelius2008Learning.pdf\n\n Again, this is so obvious that someone must have done this before. The\n literature search only pointed us to attempts to combine topology\n evolution with backpropagation, which is related but not the same\n thing. We submitted the paper to WCCI (and had it accepted) in the\n hope that the reviewers would know, but that they didn&#39;t. So now I\n wonder if anyone of you might know. It would be good to know about\n this before go on with further experiments...\n\n Grateful for any suggestions\n Julian\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
