I&#39;ve been tinkering with\nI=\r\nan&#39;s method all morning trying to get the right parameters and\nconditions f=\r\nor raising and lowering the speciation threshold, but\nnothing worked to my =\r\nsatisfaction. If I set a target of 10 species, I\ncould not get the threshol=\r\nd to decrease slow enough to prevent jumps\nfrom like 3 to 17 species within=\r\n one generation. And once you have too\nmany species, it&#39;s very hard to get =\r\nrid of them. That&#39;s because\nincreasing the threshold only makes the first s=\r\npecie in line get\nalmost all offspring assigned to it as they can suddenly =\r\nall be\nmatched to it&#39;s representative (because the threshold is too high).\n=\r\n\nSo finally I have come up with a method that will always ensure that\nthere=\r\n are never more than the target amount of species and that all\nchromosomes =\r\nare distributed amoung the species as well as possible.\nFirstly, I always k=\r\neep the species sorted by size. This is cheap to\nmaintain if you compare th=\r\ne size of the specie you have just added a\nnew chromosome to with the speci=\r\ne next in line and swap them (and if\nnecessary keep swapping) if the first =\r\nhas become bigger. (It does not\nappear to be necessary to re-sort the speci=\r\nes after removing all unfit\nchromosomes before adding the offspring to main=\r\ntain a good\ndistribution.) Secondly, when a new chromosome cannot be matche=\r\ns with\nany specie and we already have the target amount of species, I set t=\r\nhe\nspeciation threshold to the smallest distance between the new\nchromosome=\r\n and any specie (the value of which, of course, I was\nalready keeping track=\r\n of while trying to find a suitable specie). Or\nthat minimum distance + 0.0=\r\n01 if distances need to be strictly smaller\nthan the theshold, like in ANJI=\r\n. Then I add the new chromosome to the\nspecie in which it now fits. Finally=\r\n, you can even set the initial\nspeciation threshold to zero to get and keep=\r\n the target amount of\nspecies from the first generation on.\n\nI have not sea=\r\nrched to see if others before me have already come up\nwith this method too,=\r\n but I hope anyone who was struggling with the\nsame problem can benefit fro=\r\nm it. :)\n\nBas\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; The large variation inteh distribution of genomes among sp=\r\necies is \n&gt; something that is expected if the fitness of the species also v=\r\naries a \n&gt; lot - the fittest species will be the largest in size. So mayeb =\r\nthis is \n&gt; actually normal, it depends on the relative fitness of your spec=\r\nies.\n&gt; \n&gt; The complexity of the population will rise steadily and will ther=\r\nefore \n&gt; normally require the threshold to rise steadily also to keep the n=\r\number \n&gt; of species constant. If the number of species is continually to hi=\r\ngh \n&gt; then this indicates that the threshold isn;t able to rise fast enough=\r\n. \n&gt; First though I would recommend starting your experiment with a higher =\r\n\n&gt; initial threshold, that way the threshold won&#39;t be playing catch-up \n&gt; r=\r\night from the start. If later on the # of species starts to rise again \n&gt; t=\r\nhen you probably need to increase the delta from 0.3.\n&gt; \n&gt; In SharpNEAT I u=\r\nse a delta of 0.1, but this then starts to increase if \n&gt; the number of spe=\r\ncies does not fall within defined limits. Think of\nthis \n&gt; as accelerating =\r\nthe change in threshold. This can have the effect of \n&gt; overshooting the id=\r\neal value if the threshold was way out to start\nwith, \n&gt; but this shouldn&#39;t=\r\n happen if the initial value is set correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
