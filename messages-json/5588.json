It does sound like you=\r\n\n&gt; have a workable idea for integrating novelty search into competitive\n&gt; c=\r\noevolution. Of course, I&#39;d be particularly careful on the way behavior is\n&gt;=\r\n measured because it is the key to identifying novelty. One tip is to make\n=\r\n&gt; sure you don&#39;t only include raw outputs or raw inputs as part of the\n&gt; be=\r\nhavior characterization, because what matters most is what an agent\n&gt; actua=\r\nlly does, as opposed to what it wants to do. For example, if an agent\n&gt; spe=\r\nnd 100 timesteps trying to run through a wall, we would want to\n&gt; character=\r\nize its behavior as being stalled rather than as moving forward.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Al=\r\nso, one of the big challenges in competitive coevolution (and alife in\n&gt; ge=\r\nneral) is to create a domain that is open-ended enough to support\n&gt; somethi=\r\nng interesting arising. The robot duel was my attempt to do that, but\n&gt; per=\r\nhaps it could be enhanced to support more open-endedness, though I don&#39;t\n&gt; =\r\nknow how off-hand. But the risk you always have in these domains is that\n&gt; =\r\neven if you have a fantastic algorithmic setup that in principle could\n&gt; di=\r\nscover amazing behaviors, it is always possible that the domain itself\n&gt; on=\r\nly supports a limited range of strategies. For example, it is hard to\n&gt; ima=\r\ngine strategies in the robot duel that go very far beyond the one shown\n&gt; h=\r\nere:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/research/robotmovies/c=\r\nlip8.gif\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any case, overall I think your idea can make a good exp=\r\neriment.

Of course, this is a\n&gt; dynamic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; So for each time the classification of inputs changes, the behavior of\n=\r\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; host is classified and checked for novelty. These individual no=\r\nvelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; measurements are all added up at the end of the run, and divide=\r\nd by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; number of class of input changes to normalize things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as making it real &quot;compet=\r\nitive coevolution&quot;, of course a record\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who won is essentially a =\r\nfitness measure, so there&#39;d have to be a\n&gt; hybrid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty/fitness in =\r\nthere somewhere, because measuring who won is not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty measure.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a lot of benefits to the ta=\r\nble. My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is an added parameter for pop=\r\nulation\n&gt; growth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowance for the host group. Instead of a fitness f=\r\nunction, a novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metric is used (assuming one can be made, obviousl=\r\ny that&#39;s tricky). The\n&gt; host\n&gt; &gt; &gt; population remains the hosts until their=\r\n population has grown the\n&gt; specified\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping that will en=\r\ncourage a nice broad range of strategies\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be evaluated. Once that=\r\n max population % has been hit, a &quot;cataclysmic\n&gt; event&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs (catac=\r\nlysm-neat? rapture-neat?

It does s=\r\nound like you have a workable idea for integrating novelty search into comp=\r\netitive coevolution.  Of course, I&#39;d be particularly careful on the way=\r\n behavior is measured because it is the key to identifying novelty.  One ti=\r\np is to make sure you don&#39;t only include raw outputs or raw inputs as p=\r\nart of the behavior characterization, because what matters most is what an =\r\nagent actually does, as opposed to what it wants to do.  For example, if an=\r\n agent spend 100 timesteps trying to run through a wall, we would want to c=\r\nharacterize its behavior as being stalled rather than as moving forward.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Also, one of the big challenges in competitive coevoluti=\r\non (and alife in general) is to create a domain that is open-ended enough t=\r\no support something interesting arising.  The robot duel was my attempt to =\r\ndo that, but perhaps it could be enhanced to support more open-endedness, t=\r\nhough I don&#39;t know how off-hand.  But the risk you always have in these=\r\n domains is that even if you have a fantastic algorithmic setup that in pri=\r\nnciple could discover amazing behaviors, it is always possible that the dom=\r\nain itself only supports a limited range of strategies.  For example, it is=\r\n hard to imagine strategies in the robot duel that go very far beyond the o=\r\nne shown here: &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/us=\r\ners/nn/pages/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.c=\r\ns.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; In any case, overall I think your idea can make a good experiment.=\r\n  You mention that you need to write something up for graduation - what deg=\r\nree are you working on?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;, Drew Kirkpatrick &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ken,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think I get what you&#39;re=\r\n saying about categorizing parasites (or, their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; behavior) int=\r\no classes.

Of course, this is a dynamic&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; environment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So for each time the c=\r\nlassification of inputs changes, the behavior of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; host is =\r\nclassified and checked for novelty. These individual novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmeasurements are all added up at the end of the run, and divided by the&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; number of class of input changes to normalize things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As=\r\n far as making it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, of course a rec=\r\nord of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; who won is essentially a fitness measure, so there&#39=\r\n;d have to be a hybrid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; novelty/fitness in there somewhere, be=\r\ncause measuring who won is not a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; novelty measure.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a lot of benefits to =\r\nthe table. My&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is an added par=\r\nameter for population growth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; allowance for the host group. In=\r\nstead of a fitness function, a novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; metric is used (assumi=\r\nng one can be made, obviously that&#39;s tricky). The host&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; po=\r\npulation remains the hosts until their population has grown the specified&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping that will encourage a nice broad range =\r\nof strategies to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be evaluated.

Essentially no=\r\nvelty is used to explore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; differing behaviors up until the cat=\r\naclysmic event, then performance is used&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to prune the populat=\r\nion back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, =\r\nbut if I can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I=\r\n&#39;m gonna give it a whirl.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gotta write up something intere=\r\nsting to graduate I suppose.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts woul=\r\nd be greatly appreciated.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Drew&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I just wanted to echo that I =\r\nthink combining novelty search with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction between =\r\nevolving agents is very interesting, if only we can find&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n a way to characterize behavior generally enough to overcome the inherent&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noisiness of interaction.
