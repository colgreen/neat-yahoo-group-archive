If not, is this something that the group would find useful?\n\nIf you&#39;re meaning code interfaces then yeh, sharpneat has an\nIExperiment interface, see:\n\nhttp://sharpneat.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sharpneat/trunk/src/SharpNeatLib/Experiments/IExperiment.cs?revision=6&view=markup\n\nWith traditional NEAT there is not really any point in having more\nthan one bias input so I chose to fix it to node 0, hence that is\nassumed to always be present and isn&#39;t defined by IExperiment.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
