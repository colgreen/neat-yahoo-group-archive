However, I generall=\r\ny recommend not having more than one of each kind.  For example, Gaussian i=\r\ns symmetric and Abs is also symmetric, so I would go without the Abs. Sine =\r\nand cosine are also similar.    Also, a low-frequency sine wave may not be =\r\nmuch different from a signed sigmoid.  The issue is whether we are just thr=\r\nowing a ton of stuff into the mix for no principled reason.\n\nI also agree t=\r\nhat something like an unbounded linear function can have unintended consequ=\r\nences.  \n\nMy guess is that even sigmoids and Gaussians alone can work well,=\r\n although it&#39;s just a hunch. \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Gree=\r\nn &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wondering what are curren=\r\ntly considered to be the standard set of\n&gt; CPPN activation functions.
