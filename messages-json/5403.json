We already tried most of the problems supplied with HyperNEAT, but mos=\r\nt of them proved to be either too simple (near-optimal fitness within a few=\r\n generations) or too expensive to run (one run can take hours). In this con=\r\ntext a run is a complete run of HyperNEAT with n generations, not the evalu=\r\nation of 1 generation. We cut back on the number of generations (default is=\r\n 300), so problems that take 30-45 minutes for a whole run are also ok.\n\n\nO=\r\nur interest lies only in using our tool to tune the parameters, so we won&#39;t=\r\n use the source code of the experiments for anything other than parameter t=\r\nuning and we will hand our results (e.g. parameters and best performance) b=\r\nack to you in exchange for letting us use your work (provided we got to tun=\r\ning your problem). As a result of this work, we hope to be able to release =\r\nvalidated tuning software for use with HyperNEAT.\n\nRegards,\nJan van der Lug=\r\nt\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
