The beauty of a\n&gt; source control system is that you do not have to take time out someday\n&gt; to merge bits of the other releases into the main code, anybody could\n&gt; instead apply patches against the main release or release patches\n&gt; anywhere.\n\nI have been thinking about whether to use CVS or SVN. I really like\nthe support for these repositories in Eclipse (www.eclipse.org), and\neven if you make it very restricted access it can still be useful to\nsee detailed revision histories for files. It&#39;s another level of\ntransparency (after providing the source code) that can aid in using\nthe codebase and confirming/finding bugs.\n\nIn general I think the bug reporting system in sourceforge is the\nideal place to be reporting bugs and/or suggesting small patches. The\nonly alternative is to open up CVS to anyone who asks and who wants to\nsubmit a patch, which may lead to chaos. It&#39;s probably a moot point\nfor SharpNeat given that there aren&#39;t more than a handful of people a\nyear wanting to submit a patch - but the possibility exists of the\ncodebase getting out of control.\n\nThe other aspect I&#39;m fuzzy on is CVS/SVN support in MS Visual Studio\nor SharpDevelop. Actually the more I use Eclipse the more my opinion\nof VS lessens. Right now I&#39;m torn between using the .Net framework\nwhich I prefer over the Java SDK, and the poor (by comparison) IDE&#39;s\nin the .Net world. Although I haven&#39;t seen Visual Studio 2008 yet -\nbut I&#39;m not holding my breath for any major improvements!\n\nI was wondering what current users (user?) of SharpNeat would think\nabout switching to a Java code base - David I know you&#39;re doing CPPN\nstuff, would a switch to Java be a major issue for your work? I guess\nyou could continue on the existing code base anyway. Also IKVM\n(www.ikvm.net) allows you to use Java frameworks in a .Net environment\n- my only concern there though is there will be a slight loss of\nperformance (but not that much).\n\nOh and the other issue is that of support for generics/templates. Both\nJava and .Net have this now but in the Java world generics are still\njust language level constructs - they are not supported in the VM and\nhence there is no performance benefit(e.g. from avoidance of\nboxing/unboxing of value types), only a coding efficiency/compactness\nbenefit. I understand this issue is being considered in the Java\nworld, but it&#39;s not here now, today.\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
