However, as you probably k=\r\nnow from talking to me I prefer not to call novelty &quot;objective-driven&quot; so I=\r\n wouldn&#39;t organize the table this way.  Of course, much of this discussion =\r\nis just about words and semantics, so there may not be a definitive right a=\r\nnd wrong, but I think drawing a distinction between objective-driven search=\r\nes on the one hand and non-objective searches (including novelty) on the ot=\r\nher is useful.\n\nFrom my perspective, I think of an objective-driven search =\r\nas one that is aiming at a particular area of the search space (which we wo=\r\nuld call the &quot;objective&quot;).  That cannot be said for novelty because it is n=\r\not aiming anywhere in particular.  Your table does attempt to draw this dis=\r\ntinction with the word &quot;implicit&quot; for novelty, but I think it&#39;s not even an=\r\n implicit objective because it&#39;s not aiming at anything in particular, impl=\r\nicitly or explicitly.  \n\nSo in this way of thinking about it, I&#39;d also say =\r\nthat artificial life domains generally are not objective either, because th=\r\ney are not aiming at any particular area of the search space.  And the same=\r\n can be said for natural evolution and Picbreeder as a whole.  While it is =\r\ntrue in such systems that there is still selection, I would call the select=\r\nive pressure in those cases a &quot;constraint&quot; rather than an objective.  For e=\r\nxample, novelty is a &quot;constraint&quot; on search, but as long as you are relativ=\r\nely novel, you will likely reproduce.  So you have a constraint without an =\r\nobjective.\n\nThe idea that some evolution is &quot;biased&quot; by some partial object=\r\nive pressure (like Avida) in my view would put it somewhere on the continuu=\r\nm between objective and non-objective search.  So I think it&#39;s fair to thin=\r\nk of it as a continuum between objective and non-objective with two extreme=\r\ns. \n\nBut whether or not it is environment-driven I think is a less importan=\r\nt issue than whether it is objective or non-objective.  It&#39;s true that envi=\r\nronment-driven search tends to be more non-objective (like nature), but it&#39;=\r\ns possible that the environment is set up in such a way that it is like hav=\r\ning an objective.\n\nBut I think maybe more interesting than any of this is t=\r\nhat when it comes to true open-ended innovation there are still other very =\r\nimportant ingredients that none of these terms capture.  So for example bei=\r\nng non-objective may be necessary but not sufficient for a true open-ended =\r\ncomplexity explosion.  That&#39;s one reason that many (or perhaps all) alife w=\r\nords so far fail to live up to nature.  So I think in reality as the critic=\r\nal factors that enable open-ended evolution become better understood this c=\r\nlassification scheme will expand to have new dimensions, regardless of whic=\r\nh scheme we agree on at present.  Those new dimensions will likely also cha=\r\nnge much of the basis for this type of discussion because they will split s=\r\nystems into different categories (along the new dimensions) that under pres=\r\nent schemes would be considered to be within the same category.\n\nken\n\n\nI th=\r\nink the issue of whether it is &quot;environment-driven&quot; or\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Nicolas Bredeche &lt;nekonaute@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand=\r\n that this short discussion about target-based vs.\n&gt; non-target-based evolu=\r\ntion may grow a bit off-topic, but I would love to\n&gt; take this discussion a=\r\n little further about the difference btw\n&gt; objective-driven and environment=\r\n-driven evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; (...)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m also not sure whether it&#39;s reall=\r\ny accurate to say Avida is &quot;not\n&gt; &gt; target-based.&quot; It&#39;s true that it&#39;s not =\r\nas explicit as a single simple\n&gt; &gt; objective function, but the fact that th=\r\nere are several logical operations\n&gt; &gt; that explicitly give an advantage to=\r\n organisms that execute them actually\n&gt; &gt; does create a form of objective-d=\r\nriven pressure. In other words, the\n&gt; &gt; creativity of evolution in Avida wi=\r\nth such a priori human-defined rewards\n&gt; &gt; is to some extent hampered by th=\r\ne need to stay competitive on those\n&gt; &gt; arbitrary objectives. So I&#39;d expect=\r\n it to be closer to objective search\n&gt; &gt; (when used in that mode) than non-=\r\nobjective search, though somewhere on the\n&gt; &gt; continuum between them. I als=\r\no understand that Avida as a platform doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; have to be run with those=\r\n rewards, but if I understand correctly they are\n&gt; &gt; traditional and used i=\r\nn this particular paper as well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I agree with you. Avida is l=\r\nikely more towards non-objective search than\n&gt; &gt; target-based search, but p=\r\nrobably not by that much. You&#39;d likely get a\n&gt; &gt; stronger argument from Cha=\r\nrles Ofria about it being more open-ended, but\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always thought that=\r\n Avida (and all alife simulations) are still rather\n&gt; &gt; target-based. That&#39;=\r\ns why I don&#39;t put too much stock in the argument that\n&gt; &gt; not having an exp=\r\nlicit fitness function makes some alife simulations more\n&gt; &gt; interesting: I=\r\n usually think they do have an explicit fitness function,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s just a c=\r\nomplicated one that we don&#39;t understand as much as others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  (...)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; It seems to me that one additional property must be taken into account\n&gt; =\r\nabout how the selection pressure is actually applied. On the one hand,\n&gt; se=\r\nlection can be implemented as an user-defined metric used to compare and\n&gt; =\r\nrank individuals for selection/replacement, which is the classical way in\n&gt;=\r\n Evolutionary Robotics/Algorithms (incl. novelty search, ie. an explicit\n&gt; =\r\nfunction formulating an implicit objective - though of course the search\n&gt; =\r\nfor novelty looks a lot like modelling the red queen). On the other hand,\n&gt;=\r\n selection can result from environmental pressure as it is the case with\n&gt; =\r\nTIERRA (and to less extent, to AVIDA, IMHO), where selection/replacement\n&gt; =\r\ndoes not depend on a performance value to be computed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with yo=\r\nu both as AVIDA seems to stand inbetween as a performance\n&gt; measure is actu=\r\nally computed (the metabolic function) but is not directly\n&gt; used for selec=\r\ntion/replacement. On the contraty, I always had the\n&gt; impression that TIERR=\r\nA was something more on the side of &quot;true&quot; natural\n&gt; selection, environment=\r\n-driven instead of target-based. Of course,\n&gt; minimizing program size in TI=\r\nERRA may be seen as the objective, but it is\n&gt; not explicitly formulated co=\r\nmpared to AVIDA&#39;s metabolic functions which\n&gt; directly impact the duplicati=\r\non success (if i am not mistaken, as i am not\n&gt; an AVIDA practitionner).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In a recent paper co-authored with Jean-Marc Montanier (presented at the=\r\n\n&gt; EPS workshop at ALIFE 2012), we summarized some work on environment-driv=\r\nen\n&gt; evolutionary adaptation of swarm of epucks robots done in the Symbrion=\r\n\n&gt; swarm/modular robotic project, and we faced the problem as to where our =\r\nown\n&gt; work stands. We came up with some sort of (imperfect) classification =\r\nas we\n&gt; tried to position our own work wrt. traditional Evolutionary Roboti=\r\ncs (ER),\n&gt; Embodied Evolution (EE), ALIFE simulation about evolution (ALIFE=\r\n). I just\n&gt; extracted an up-to-date image of the table from the paper so yo=\r\nu may find\n&gt; it easily: check it\n&gt; here&lt;http://www.lri.fr/%7Ebredeche/pub/t=\r\nable-EPS2012.jpg&gt;(EDEA is our\n&gt; own method, forget it if you wish, it is no=\r\nt the point here).\n&gt; Of course, this is not meant as a definitive table as =\r\nfrontiers are\n&gt; somewhat blurred, as with the position of novelty search (w=\r\nhich is also\n&gt; environment-driven in some way, but still explicitly formula=\r\nted) or AVIDA&#39;s\n&gt; metabolic function (which also makes AVIDA task-driven). =\r\nI&#39;d be curious if\n&gt; some of you have some feedback to provide on this globa=\r\nl classification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Nicolas\n&gt; \n&gt; ps:  btw, i really enjoyed=\r\n reading your paper Jeff, inspiring and clearly\n&gt; written, as always :-)\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
