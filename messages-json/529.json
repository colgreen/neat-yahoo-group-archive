We have graphical tools that lay\nout our raw chromosome XML in a spiral pattern, but\nwhile it looks kind of cool, it isn&#39;t very readable.\n\nSo if we have a network, evolved with NEAT, that has\n10 input nodes, 10 output nodes, and 35 hidden nodes,\nwith dozens of connections (self, recurrent, and\nforward), how does it make the most sense to:\n\n--Represent this phenotype in XML?\n--Graphically represent this phenotype?\n\nHere&#39;s a current sample of our XML:\n\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;7&quot; type=&quot;HIDDEN&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;OUT&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src-id=&quot;0&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.3731676929130425&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;5&quot; src-id=&quot;1&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-1.208831769841949&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;connection id=&quot;6&quot; src-id=&quot;2&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\nweight=&quot;-0.853548931074944&quot;/&gt;\n\nShould the neuron tags also include an attribute\nassigning them to a particular layer?  We use XSL to\nparse the XML into SVG, and in and of itself, XSL\nreally isn&#39;t useful for determining layout logic. \nIt&#39;s best to have the layout structure inherent in the\nXML.\n\nThoughts?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
