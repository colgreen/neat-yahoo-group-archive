The \n&gt;actual weight is the sum of all of them.  The first number is the one that \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI like the idea John. I was thinking of something similar whereby \nconnection weights get stiffer or more rigid with age. So new \nconnections would be mutated over the full range of possible values, but \nolder connections that have stood the test of time would not be \nperturbed at all. I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t a new idea but it&#39;s certainly \nworth trying it out with NEAT. I am thinking of implementing a simple \nversion of the connection rigidity idea by just setting a &#39;fixed&#39; bit \nfollowing a pruning phase. The idea being that any structure that \nsurvived pruning has proved itself to be useful and should not be \nperturbed any more.\n\nIf multiple weight values are used as you suggest, then I see that as \nlaying down strata, the earlier layers of which are older and more rigid \nthan the younger layers. I have an old paper here that discusses this \nconcept (or something very similar if my memory serves) in the context \nof networks that can fall-back to functionality that was learned earlier \nin life by ignoring the younger strata. In some ways it could be \nequivalent to mood in biological brains - people are better or worse at \ncertain tasks depending on mood - mood could partly the effect of \nchemicals that switch neurons into a state where they use only the older \nconnections and not the newer ones, or perhaps biological axons actually \nhave strata of some kind.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
