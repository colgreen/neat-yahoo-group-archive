Bloat is a term from\n&gt; &gt; Genetic Programming that referred to the accumulation of\nextraneous\n&gt; &gt; structure over the *entire population* that didn&#39;t help improve\n&gt; &gt; fitness.  In general they were looking at a situaton where\neveryone\n&gt; &gt; was getting bigger for no good reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, this is something we&#39;ve discussed before, and I&#39;m not sure\nwe&#39;re\n&gt; going to come to a consensus on the issue.  But I&#39;d argue that\n&quot;bloat&quot;\n&gt; is an appropriate term to use if the *average* complexity of the\n&gt; population is increasing unnecessarily.\n&gt; \n&gt; You say that I was only describing a situation where the mutation\n&gt; rates are too high.  Well, wouldn&#39;t you term that bloat?  If you\ntake\n&gt; a simple problem and apply NEAT to it, and have two runs, one where\n&gt; the mutation rates are double the other, NEAT will still solve the\n&gt; problem.  By the end of both runs, there will be a range of\n&gt; complexity, as you describe.  There will be complex networks and\n&gt; simple networks.  But in the run with doubled mutation rates, both\nthe\n&gt; *average* complexity and the complexity of the champion will be\n&gt; unnecessarily higher.\n&gt; \n&gt; You would consider this bloat, wouldn&#39;t you? \n&gt; \n\nWell sure I agree that is bloat, but it&#39;s only bloating because you\nare adding structure faster than it can be evaluated.  In other words,\nobviously there is some too-high structure mutation rate after which\nNEAT can&#39;t absorb structure and test it fast enough to keep up.  In\nthat case, every species will grow and you will get bloat, and the\nbest the system can hope to do is keep the structure from screwing up\nexisting functionality.\n\nBut if you have a reasonable structural mutation rate, then NEAT will\nexhibit the dynamic I talked about: expanding the range of\ncomplexities in order to keep its options open.  That is not bloat in\nmy book, and is an appropriate response to stagnation.  \n\nIf you aren&#39;t sure what I mean by reasonable rate, it means that\nstructure is added slowly enough that it is still possible to find in\nany generation enough genomes that have not had structure added so\nthat in the next generation the probability of two genomes with newly\nintroduced structure mating is low enough that all the offspring are\nnot products of such matings.  In other words, there&#39;s time for NEAT\nto evaluate new structure&#39;s fitness effects before it starts\npercolating through the whole population.\n\n&gt; &gt; In other words,\n&gt; &gt; addings more and more neurons during stagnation is creating space\n&gt; &gt; for discovery, not tacking on an unalterable piece of junk.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it could be tacking on an awful lot of superflous structure that\n&gt; is slowing down your search, couldn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n\nAgain, it&#39;s kind of loaded to call it &quot;superfluous.&quot;  You are assuming\nwhat you&#39;re trying to prove in a way.  That extra structure may be\nnecessary, as Colin&#39;s been saying.  But I also wonder if it slows\nanything down anyway.  In general the performance of anything\nsurviving in NEAT that has more structure is in the ballpark of the\nperformance of things with less structure.  In other words, you don&#39;t\nend up keeping around extra structure that severely cripples\nperformance.  So where are you seeing the slowdown?  You are in\nhigher-dimensional space, but it&#39;s a partially optimized part of that\nspace that performs as well as the lower-dimensional solution.  It may\neven be *faster* to optimize in the larger space since there are now\nmore degrees of freedom.  In other words, if search is stuck in\nlow-dimensional space, even if a tiny little solution area exists\nthere, it may be faster to just go ahead and add more structure to\nwork with, at least at the same time as keeping around your smaller\ncandidates.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
