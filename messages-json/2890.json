It is an introduction to\n&gt; neural networks, GAs, and using the two together.  It&#39;s also a good\n&gt; introduction to thinking about how to represent problems and solve them with\n&gt; NNs and/or GA approaches.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/13/06, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am seeking a recommendation for the equivalent of a neural networks for\n&gt;&gt; dummies book. I have been doing grad research in evolutionary computation\n&gt;&gt; for three and a half years now at MSU on the Avida system. I have worked\n&gt;&gt; with alife and GAs but have not yet done any real work in neural nets. I\n&gt;&gt; would like to use generative representations (e.g. L-systems) to evolve\n&gt;&gt; neural nets for my dissertation, however, so I need to ramp up on neural\n&gt;&gt; nets.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For the next three weeks I will be in Africa and would like to use any\n&gt;&gt; free\n&gt;&gt; time there to learn as much as I can about neural nets. Is there any book\n&gt;&gt; that you recommend I take? I won&#39;t have nearly any internet access, and\n&gt;&gt; will\n&gt;&gt; often not have my computer, so it would be good if the book does not\n&gt;&gt; require\n&gt;&gt; either of those.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I also think better in sentences than equations, so a book that emphasizes\n&gt;&gt; more of an intuitive logical explanation rather than mathematical\n&gt;&gt; formulation (when possible) would be ideal.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; And, of course, I have put off buying this to the last second so I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; have time to order it online...but do have a Borders nearby and the many\n&gt;&gt; University book shops.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Given all those qualifications, I&#39;m probably out of luck. But I figured if\n&gt;&gt; there was something good out there this group would know of it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Any recommendations you have would be much appreciated.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab\n&gt;&gt; jclune@... &lt;jclune%40msu.edu&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 517.214.1060 (cell)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
