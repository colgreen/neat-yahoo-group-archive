It appeared to evolve better walk=\r\ners faster than than the traditional fitness function with a much smaller p=\r\nopulation size (I used 150 down from the default 4000). However I was still=\r\n unable to evolve a natural &quot;human&quot; looking walk under either the novelty o=\r\nr the traditional fitness function.\n\n    Watching the best found solutions =\r\nreminded me of watching someone trying to walk underwater, or bounce-walkin=\r\ng on the moon which leads me to this question: The model has several consta=\r\nnts for friction, density and uses a default &quot;SetMassFromShapes&quot; function f=\r\nor the various walker body parts.  Is it reasonable to add extra outputs to=\r\n Neat to find optimal values for these various constants, before running th=\r\ne actual walking simulation?\n\nI have posted the Novelty search source code =\r\nin an attachment over on the SharpNeat forum, with some notes:\n\nhttps://gro=\r\nups.google.com/forum/?hl=3Den&fromgroups#!forum/sharpneat\n\n--\nKeith\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www=\r\n.youtube.com/watch?v=3DKMy2zRN4d38\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope to check the code into SVN s=\r\noon, there are also a few fixes\n&gt; that have been submitted to the SVN repos=\r\nitory recently, some fairly\n&gt; significant, e.g. the prey capture domain was=\r\n effectively completely\n&gt; broken (it works a lot better now!). Will aim to =\r\nmake package up a new\n&gt; SharpNEAT release 7zip soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the wal=\r\nker, any advice on improving the fitness function?\n&gt; This one has stop cond=\r\nitions for when one or both of the feet are too\n&gt; high, the torso height go=\r\nes below a threshold or any of the the joint\n&gt; angles go beyond 90 degrees.=\r\n Ideally I&#39;d like to avoid these and make\n&gt; it more open ended (and punish =\r\nfor applied torque to get efficient\n&gt; walkers) but the reality was that tha=\r\nt didn&#39;t seem to work very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
