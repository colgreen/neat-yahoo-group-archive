That is, a n=\r\new object that arises through a mutation is  \n&gt; immediately connected up to=\r\n other objects at many different levels \nin  \n&gt; the hierarchy because its c=\r\nonnecting via a predefined interface. \nThis  \n&gt; is achieved implicitly, wit=\r\nhout the need for a bunch of mutations  \n&gt; connecting up each node explicit=\r\nly.\n&gt; \n\nSounds like it could be good or bad.  On the one hand, it makes the=\r\n \nrelationships among multiple objects immediately accessible to \nevolution=\r\n.  On the other hand, it means that as soon as an object is \nintroduced it =\r\nis hooked up to a litany of random dependencies.  \nBecause of the combinato=\r\nrial complexity of multiple interdepencies, \nI would guess that such a sudd=\r\nen ballooning of relationships could \nhamstring evolution just as much as i=\r\nt could help it.  \n\nIt&#39;s a bit related the theory behind starting simply in=\r\n NEAT:  While \nit may turn out that you need a lot of structure to do what =\r\nyou \nwant, you don&#39;t necessarily want to start out with all that \nstructure=\r\n at the get-go because none of it is justified by a single \nfitness evaluat=\r\nion.  The same may be true, perhaps, with implicit \nconnectivity.\n\n&gt; To me =\r\nit seems like this approach has merit, although it is \nobviously  \n&gt; a litt=\r\nle counter-intuitive: Why should we sacrifice fine-grained  \n&gt; control for =\r\nthis weird idea of &quot;implicit similarity&quot; based on  \n&gt; interfaces? But actua=\r\nlly it turns out to be quite powerful, at \nleast  \n&gt; for complex domains li=\r\nke othello.\n&gt; \n\nIf I understand correctly what you&#39;ve done it is to show th=\r\nat your \nindirect encoding, which does in part leverage this kind of implic=\r\nit \nconnectivity, outperforms regular NEAT in Othello.  \n\nFrom that, I&#39;m no=\r\nt sure if you can zero in on a particular aspect of \nthe indirect encoding =\r\nand say that it is this aspect that is \ncritical to the power of indirect e=\r\nncoding in general.  Even if you \ncould prove that one particular property =\r\nof a specific encoding \nhelped it outperform NEAT, that does not imply that=\r\n a completely \ndifferent alternative encoding could not do just as well or =\r\nbetter \nwhile leaving out entirely the particular feature you found to be \n=\r\nimportant.  \n\nLike you said, to get past intuitions what&#39;s really needed is=\r\n just \ncomparisons among different indirect encodings.\n\n&gt; The next step I t=\r\nhink is to compare these approaches side by side  \n&gt; across a bunch of doma=\r\nins to see where they differ. I think there \nis  \n&gt; a lot of room here to d=\r\nevelop a robust theory of representation  \n&gt; design in evolutionary search.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I should point out that actually carrying out all the comparisons \nan=\r\nd  \n&gt; theorizing necessary here is probably going to constitute the bulk \no=\r\nf  \n&gt; my PhD dissertation, so watch this space for future developments.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; These are obviously subtle issues that merit more research, \nsince I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; am speaking only from intuition.  It&#39;s a really interesting \ntopic.\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\ne can talk about this more in Hawaii in a couple days :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Definitely, I=\r\n&#39;m looking forward to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s great, sounds like it will be great=\r\n dissertation!\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
