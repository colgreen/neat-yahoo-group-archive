I&#39;ve been working on \npoker\n&gt; AI in my spare time for the last 3 year=\r\ns.  I&#39;ve looked at a lot of \nthe\n&gt; Alberta group&#39;s work and talked to most =\r\nof them at last year&#39;s AAAI\n&gt; competition.\n&gt; \n&gt; My general plan is to use K=\r\nB-NEAT and a set of controllers + \nvariables\n&gt; to evolve a network for rapi=\r\nd player modeling and exploitation in\n&gt; limit (and possibly no-limit) Hold =\r\nEm.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of the knowledge in poker is very explicit with little\n&gt; exc=\r\neptions.  For instance, &quot;cap with the nut flush&quot; (i.e. never \nstop\n&gt; raisin=\r\ng) is a perfect example of a piece of advice that works in \n80%\n&gt; of cases,=\r\n but certain situations, like the board being paired,\n&gt; invalidate that adv=\r\nice.  I hope to help kick-start the learning\n&gt; process by developing a fair=\r\nly in-depth set of advice rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; My bot will also deviate from the nor=\r\nmal approach of game_state -&gt;\n&gt; atomic action (e.g., fold/call/raise).  Ins=\r\ntead I&#39;m going to have \nthe\n&gt; bot select a &quot;play&quot; at the start of each roun=\r\nd.  I define a play \nas a\n&gt; set of betting actions that handle any case in =\r\nthe current round.  \nAn\n&gt; example post-flop play (from first position) woul=\r\nd be\n&gt; Check-Raise-Call.  Here, there is no way that the bot could ever \nre=\r\nach\n&gt; a situation where it doesn&#39;t know what to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I chose to use pla=\r\nys for two reasons.  First, they simplify the \ninput\n&gt; to the network as yo=\r\nu do not have to consider the sequence of \nbets. \n&gt; Second, I believe that =\r\nmost (non-novice) human players actually \nuse a\n&gt; similar--or even higher l=\r\nevel-- model when playing.  For instance,\n&gt; good players no-limit players (=\r\nand to a lesser extent, limit \nplayers)\n&gt; will often play a single hand in =\r\na loose fashion (usually \nattempting a\n&gt; large bluff), hoping that the next=\r\n hand will give them a similar\n&gt; situation but with a legitimate hand.  In =\r\nsuch cases, players are\n&gt; actually planning on making the bluffs and subseq=\r\nuent big hands \nwell\n&gt; ahead of time.  The evidence for this should be the =\r\nspeed with \nwhich\n&gt; most limit ring games are played.  As the stakes rise, =\r\nthe speed of\n&gt; the game tends to increase, as players create more abstract =\r\nplays.\n&gt; \n&gt; The inputs for my networks will be broken down into three main\n=\r\n&gt; categories: betting, stats, and history.  Betting will simply be a\n&gt; repr=\r\nesenation of the previous rounds&#39; bet history.  Stats will\n&gt; encompass thin=\r\ngs like hand strength vs a random player, flush draw\n&gt; probability, etc.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; History will be a set of player statistics broken into 3\n&gt; sub-categorie=\r\ns: total, previous hand, and a variable range.  The\n&gt; statistics for each c=\r\nategory will all be the same, with only the\n&gt; sample size varying.  Total w=\r\nill encompass the entire play history \nof\n&gt; the opponent.  Previous hand wi=\r\nll look only at the previous hand. \n&gt; Variable range will use the play over=\r\n the previous N hands (where \nN &lt;\n&gt; 30).  This way I hope to be able to mod=\r\nel players that quickly \nchange\n&gt; their play.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Is there a way I can use multiple networks per individual in the\n&gt; =\r\npopulation?  I.e., I want to have a separate network for each \nround,\n&gt; sin=\r\nce there are different inputs (cards, bets) for each successive\n&gt; round.  I=\r\n have considered making one monolithic network and using\n&gt; extra nodes to r=\r\nepresent on/off status of the round-specific data, \nbut\n&gt; I feel like that =\r\nwould add a lot of needless noise to the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This is related t=\r\no 1, but is there any way to also encorporate\n&gt; other variables in my evolu=\r\ntion parameters?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Is there any code available for the KB-NEAT so I c=\r\nan \nincorporate my\n&gt; custom advice?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone is interested in a mo=\r\nre detailed description of the \ninputs,\n&gt; let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
