I would have expected after\n&gt; your results that you would be skeptical even of the adaptive schemes\n&gt; (e.g. ones that change parameters deterministically, i.e. without\n&gt; evolution, like CMA-ES).  After all, both self-adaptive\n&gt; and adaptive schemes are heuristic.  I don&#39;t know why one type of\n&gt; heuristic should be vastly superior to another simply because it is\n&gt; deterministic?  They both face the same ultimate problem that they are\n&gt; trying to optimize meta-parameters in the midst of searching for the\n&gt; solution within the domain itself.  My understanding of your results\n&gt; was that the reason the self-adaptive heuristic fails is not so much\n&gt; because of the &quot;self&quot; part, but rather because of the interaction\n&gt; between meta-optimization and optimization at the same time, as well\n&gt; as the vastness of the meta-search.  That pitfall would seem to apply\n&gt; equally in deterministic adaptation.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Julian pointed out, if evolution is getting sucked into a local\n&gt; optimum, the CMA-ES can actually exacerbate this problem even more by\n&gt; computing the right distribution of mutations to be even more likely\n&gt; to head into the trap.  That would seem to be an instance of the same\n&gt; problem that you are observing with self-adaptation.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I am curious why you feel the self-adaptive schemes are more\n&gt; vulnerable than the adaptive ones?\n\nThat is a good question Ken. I think the problem is that evolution is\nshort-sighted. It looks for what produces the highest average fitness in the\nshort term, not in the long term. Some other heuristics can avoid this\nproblem by explicitly focusing on the long term, which is why I do not rule\nout all possible adaptive heuristics. For example, it is probably a good\nidea to keep the mutation rate high for most of the run, and then lower it\nat the end of the run to do some fine tuning. Something similar (a gradual\nreduction) has been proven to be optimal for the counting ones problem.\n\nWhen I said that adaptive heuristics can provide improvements if you do them\nright, the emphasis should have been on the &#39;IF you do them right.&#39; Of\ncourse, it is hard to do it right, and I am in no way advocating that I know\nof a way to do it right.\n\nI do not know enough about CMA-ES to comment intelligently on the technique.\nHowever, from what little I know I agree with your instincts that CMA-ES\nseems greedy and will thus accelerate into the trap. That, of course, raises\nthe question of why they work at all. My instincts tell me that it will &#39;do\nbetter&#39; in the short term, but not in the long term. Unfortunately, my\nignorance of this field prevents me from having much basis for that\nsupposition. Maybe others on this list can point us to some papers where\nCMA-ES has been introduced and shown to lead to improvements.  For you\nCMA-ES fans out there, why doesn&#39;t CMA-ES run into the problems I uncover in\nmy paper?\n\nBut to return to the general question: some heuristics, like the simple one\nI propose above, could explicitly focus on the long term and thus avoid the\ntension between short-term and long-term gains. If they do that correctly\n(which is hard), they should be able to do better.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n\n\n"}}
