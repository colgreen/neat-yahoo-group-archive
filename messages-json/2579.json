My tactics is for them to learn\nfrom each other so they will learn different strategies as oppose to\nplaying against myself and only learn one kind of strategy. Maybe sounds\na bit strange but i think i&#39;ll get a better results this way. Just have\nto wait and see\n\nRamin \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; djames@... 03/21/06 10:41 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;\nHi Ramin,\n\nJust to clarify...which board game is this?\n\nDo you want to play human vs. evolved player?  Or evolved player vs.\nsome\nother AI?\n\nDerek\n\nOn 3/21/06, Ramin Lessani &lt;kcy42rl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have used NEAT to build a board player. Now after thousands of\n&gt; generations I have a champion chromosom but I don&#39;t know how to use\nthat\n&gt; champion in ANJI so one can play against it to see is she a real\n&gt; champion or not. If anyone can direct me how to use my champion and\nplay\n&gt; against it, I would highly appreciate it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
