Consequently, several researchers used Genetic Algorithms to evolve\npartial aspects of neural networks, such as the weights, the thresholds, and\nthe network architecture. Indeed, over the last decade many systems have\nbeen developed that perform total network induction. In this work it is\nshown how the chromosomes of Gene Expression Programming can be modified so\nthat a complete neural network, including the architecture, the weights and\nthresholds, could be totally encoded in a linear chromosome. It is also\nshown how this chromosomal organization allows the training/adaptation of\nthe network using the evolutionary mechanisms of selection and modification,\nthus providing an approach to the automatic design of neural networks. The\nworkings and performance of this new algorithm are tested on the\n6-multiplexer and on the classical exclusive-or problems.\n\n------------------\n\n\tDoes that sound at all familiar?\n\n\tIan\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
