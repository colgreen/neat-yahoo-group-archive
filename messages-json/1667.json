One concern I&#39;ve had with SharpNEAT \nso far is that it takes far more generations to solve XOR (on average) \nwhen compared to the figures reported by others. Therefore I wanted to \nsee if this could be attributed to a poor choice of parameters on my \npart or whether it might be something more fundamental.\n\nSo far I have found a set of parameters that find a solution about twice \nas fast as before. So the # of gens required has gone from about 280 to \nabout 150. This is still high compared to other&#39;s reports, but it does \ndemonstrate that the meta-algorithm is working to some degree.\n\nI have also wrapped up the meta-algorithm work in a rudimentary GUI that \ncan be used to track progress, select which parameters you wish to \nsearch and define a seed NeatParameters object that acts as the starting \npoint for the search.\n\nTo keep it simple I have so far only searched on one parameter at a \ntime, the theory being that with such a simple search space I can keep \nthe population size low - thus keeping duration of searches down. Some \nparameters can also effect evaluation duration a lot, so I have avoided \nthese so far.\n\nSo basically it&#39;s so far so good. I don&#39;t expect the parameters that are \nfound for XOR to be applicable to most other problems, since XOR is an \nartificially small and simple problem to solve, but it will still be \ninteresting to see how much certain parameters effect a search. So far I \nhave found that the rate of asexual reproduction works best at about 90% \n(50/50 before), and that the weight range is best at +-7.5 (+-5 before) \nthis latter figure also effects the range of values used when creating \nnew connections and also the initial population, therefore by increasing \nthe range while keepig the same activation function, the function has \neffectively been steepened towards being a step function.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
