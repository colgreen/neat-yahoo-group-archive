Do you think some are more or less\n&gt; important?\n\nHey Tyler. :)\n\nThese inputs are all good, and I would personally\nthink they&#39;d all be important.  But unless the agent\nis always going to be walking in a predictable,\nuniform environment (which I assume it is not),\nthere&#39;s going to need to be some form of input\ndescribing the external environment.  Your agent is\neffectively blind and deaf, and could probably be\ntrained to move across an even surface, but locomotion\nrequires information about the path ahead, or else\nit&#39;s going to walk off cliffs and fall down a lot.\n\nI&#39;d also be more concerned about your fitness function\nwith complex behaviors like walking (or jumping\nwithout falling down).  With jumping and standing,\nyou&#39;re simply using the average vertical position of\nthe head over time to determine fitness...is this\ncorrect?\n\nAnd with walking, are you simply measuring movement in\na given horizontal direction?\n\nHow hard is it to manually program one of your agents\nto walk or jump?  Have you done this?  If so, it might\nbe interesting to evolve neural network controllers\nthat best mimic the movements of the preprogrammed\nones, to at least give them a certain level of\nproficiency that can then be built upon.\n\nOr, with walking, you could take the approach humans\nuse.  The fitness function could be a result of\nhorizontal movement, while keeping the center of mass\nwithin a given range.  Agents that fall down could be\n&quot;picked back up&quot;, just as human infants are, so that a\ngiven fitness evaluation is not necessarily over once\nthe agent falls down.\n\nAnyway...just some suggestions.  It&#39;s a cool domain,\nand I look forward to seeing how it comes along, and\nmaybe playing around with it a bit as well.\n\nDerek\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
