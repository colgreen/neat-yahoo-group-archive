(sorry I know that sounds like a totally loaded\n&gt;  question now, but I&#39;m genuinely interested in hearing your opinion --\n&gt;  I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on the UCT literature for a while and its\n&gt;  hard to see the world without UCT-colored glasses anymore :P)\n\nHey Joe...yeah, it&#39;s a loaded question, but I&#39;ll give it a shot. :)\n\nMy current perspective on how humans (and to a lesser extent other\nspecies) are able to flexibly learn a wide range of novel cognitive\ntasks has to do with their ability to encode invariant representations\nof spatio-temporal patterns, and once acquired, use those encodings to\nrecognize, generate, and predict sequences. I think this general\nperspective helps frame how people can learn to play tennis, speak\nChinese, play the piano, and master games like Go.\n\nMy understanding of UCT is that it is a method of pruning the search\ntree for Monte Carlo methods, but in the end you&#39;re still talking\nabout a brute force search of child nodes in a tree, right? I was\nwondering how MoGo dealt with simple iterative or repeating patterns\nthat arise in Go, like Ko fights and ladders. For those who don&#39;t\nknow, ladders are simple repeating structures that arise in the game\nthat many amateurs can instantly recognize, but which tree-search\nmethods perform extremely poorly at. I think the reason for this is\nthat a human can readily learn an invariant representation of a simple\npattern and recognize and predict the outcome regardless of\norientation or size of the board.\n\nA quick scan of the Computer Go discussion group on the issue makes it\nsound like this is a reasonably correct assessment, and that\nprogrammers generally include some kind of ad hoc mechanism for coping\nwith things like ladders. This explains why MoGo can do reasonably\nwell when powered by a supercomputer in playing on a 9x9 board, since\nstructures like ladders are limited in size.\n\nSo my criticism of an algorithm like MoGo would probably boil down to\n&quot;Where is its representation of a ladder?&quot; And if that representation\nis not at all part of its core algorithm, that&#39;s where my skepticism\nenters that the methodology will not scale very well, either to larger\nGo boards or to other domains. I think the ability to encode and\nemploy invariant representations of patterns is the root of the\nproblem, and the whole class of MC methods seems in the spirit of\ntraditional AI approaches which I just don&#39;t think are going to do the\njob.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
