It would be interesting to run the search in pruning mode to trim \naway the &#39;chaff&#39;, thus revealing the functional parts of the champion \nnetwork for examination. Is the switching occuring how we would expect \nor not? Actually it will be easier to examine the network evolved for a \n3-multiplexer first, which BTW is a problem that was solved in a couple \nof mins when I tried it.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;What is your fitness function like?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs you might expect really. I loop over each of the 2^6=64 test cases, \napply the inputs adjusted so that true=0.9 and false=0.1, then interpret \nthe output as false for &lt;0.5 and true for &gt;=0.5. For 11 multiplexer \nthere are of course 2^11=2048 test cases, which makes for an inherently \nslower eval function even before you consider the extra complexity \nrequired. Thus 20-multiplexer probably isn&#39;t a viable domain work on. \nBut I think the point is proved - that NEAT can evolve a multiplexer.\n\n&gt;&gt;I think this domain was also related to the image processing that John\n&gt;&gt;Arrowood was working on. I think that the switching ability was a\n&gt;&gt;sub-task of what John was trying to achieve.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I thought that the way John posed the problem required complexity \n&gt;_equivalent_ to several hefty multiplexers within the network, and I was \n&gt;therefore using it as an example of how hard the problem was, and how \n&gt;modularity might relate.  Possibly evolution could have found approaches \n&gt;that did not require this complexity, but I thought the problem was really \n&gt;that hard.  If it had proven possible to evolve a solution, then of course \n&gt;there is no guarantee it would have actually used multiplexers.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think John also posed a sub-task that was equivalent to or very \nsimilar to the single multiplexer task. I think it was the averaging of \nnumbers from a given rectangle in a 3x3 grid that I&#39;m thinking of. \nCertainly I think it&#39;s interesting to identify sub-tasks like this and \nfocus in on them. So for instance, in the case of vector cross product, \nmultiplcation features heavily, and performing multiplication turned out \nto be quite difficult to evolve by itself. This then leads us into \nmodifying the ANN model so that NEAT is better able to solve these \nfundamental problems, which hopefully leads to success on higher level \nproblems.\n\nSwitching I would expect to feature in nets evolved for Tic-Tac-Toe, \nswitching the chosen output square depending on the inputs(populated \nsquares). Thus I might try TTT using co-evolution before I modify the \nANN model based on the activation function discussion we had a while ago.\n\n&gt;&gt;I&#39;m going to try the more difficult 11-multiplexer now, that&#39;s 3 address\n&gt;&gt;lines and 8 data lines.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nI&#39;m still tweaking the parameters on this one. I have a net that \ncorrectly responds to 2039 of the 2048 test cases, but that search ran \nfor 34 hours before I stopped it. It was still improving slowly so it \nmight have got there eventually. Stay tuned.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Go for it.  Or how about evolving an indirect representation for a general \n&gt;N + 2^N multiplexer?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nerr\n\n&gt;Should have had a &quot;:-)&quot; on that.\n&gt;\nYes, I did wonder how I was supposed to arrange the i/o connections on \nthat one - not for long though :)\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
