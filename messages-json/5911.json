But my point is more a=\r\nbout how a regularity (or irregularity) was *preserved* as opposed to how i=\r\nt was *achieved*. No matter how a particular organizational principle comes=\r\n about (now I&#39;m being more careful to avoid suggesting it&#39;s more or less re=\r\ngular than before), the problem is that there is no reason for evolution to=\r\n reward and thereby preserve it in an objective setting when it&#39;s first dis=\r\ncovered.  So whether or not bilateral symmetry comes from a reduction in re=\r\ngularity or an increase in regularity, if the first bilaterally symmetric i=\r\nndividual does not look very close to the final objective (and it most like=\r\nly does not) then it is likely to be selected out and lost by an objective-=\r\ndriven search.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is now going to be slightly off-topic, but I would=\r\n like to add the following thoughts to your response: \n&gt; I also see the pro=\r\nblem that certain organizational principles (OPs) are hard to establish whe=\r\nn their advantage becomes only apparent in the long run (if at all). Nevert=\r\nheless, I think that the starting position of an evolutionary process can f=\r\nacilitate or prevent the emergence of certain OPs. For example, starting wi=\r\nth radial symmetry, I could imagine that the amount of possibilities to red=\r\nuce symmetry offers far more chances to establish asymmetric patterns than =\r\nthe reduction from an asymmetric structure to a symmetric one. \n&gt; \n&gt; Martin=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;re right that the currently-established OPs will bias the =\r\nsearch towards or away from discovering certain kinds of OPs in the future.=\r\n   But that&#39;s really a property of encoding bias (as opposed to a result of=\r\n selective pressure).  That&#39;s why encodings like CPPNs or other indirect en=\r\ncodings are important, because they make certain chains of OPs more easy to=\r\n establish.  But whether a particular statement is true, like whether it&#39;s =\r\nmore likely to go radial-&gt;bilateral than totally-asymmetric-&gt;bilateral, wil=\r\nl depend a lot on the mathematical properties of the encoding.  So you real=\r\nly have to reason it out in terms of a particular encoding, like CPPNs, as =\r\nopposed to only based evolutionary history observed in nature, though in so=\r\nme cases the same reasoning would apply to both.\n\nken \n\n\n\n"}}
