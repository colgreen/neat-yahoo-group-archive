These are different kinds of \nconnections from usual no-delay connection, and would be considered \ndifferent than a no-delay connection even connecting the same \nnodes.  But Mattias was saying (and maybe he will add to this) that \npreliminary experiments with the ant domain seem to show a real \nbenefit from time delays.  \n\nAnother possibility is to have different activation functions beyond \nsigmoid, like gaussian, multiplication, addition, etc...  It is \npossible this would expand the ability of NEAT to approximate \ncomplex functions.  At least in Mattias&#39; symbolic regression, it&#39;s \nclear they help.  I&#39;m not sure if they help in control tasks, but it \ncould be interesting to play with.  I&#39;ve been asked about this \nbefore, but Mattias&#39; work is the first that actually shows how these \ncan help.\n\nGiving NEAT extra pieces to put together can be beneficial, or it \ncan unnecesarily add to the search space, but at least in some cases \nit looks like a good idea and it&#39;s something to consider if you&#39;re \nplaying with your own NEAT-based system.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
