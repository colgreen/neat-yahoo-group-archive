If there are small variations in initial state (x)\nfor each run then the terminal states will vary. If all terminal\nstates are similar (clustered) then the number of possible future\nstates for init state x is low, otherwise it is high(er). So it&#39;s a\nrelative and approximate metric rather than an absolute one.\n\nAny state which has lots of diverse terminal states is low entropy and\nhas the maximum number of future states (or pathways, or future\nhistories), e.g. a broken mirror is high entropy and does not have an\nunbroken mirror in it&#39;s set of possible terminal states.\n\nSo in our case I figure we would make a number of offspring and we\nwould evaluate each one by running multiple monte carlo sims, and we\nwould assign fitness based on the above &#39;maximum future possibilities&#39;\nmetric.\n\nOr I may have the wrong end of the stick entirely :)\n\nThoughts?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
