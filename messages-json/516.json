In \n&gt; complex terrains there is a very likely possibility\n&gt; that you could get \n&gt; stuck in a dead-end of sorts. To solve this problem\n&gt; you either need a \n&gt; rough predetermined route or perhaps some kind of\n&gt; maze searching \n&gt; technique, so e.g. if you find yourself in a\n&gt; dead-end you backtrack, and \n&gt; try another route from some previously traversed\n&gt; point. This isn&#39;t an \n&gt; area I have knowledge of but I would imagine that\n&gt; this could be a tricky \n&gt; problem for ANNs to solve alone. \n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nIf the obstacles are so numerous and arranged so as to\nform something like a maze, then the problem becomes\nmore difficult.  I have been assuming that there is\nenough open space that there is no need to head away\nfrom the target.  The ANN would head in the general\ndirection of the target, turning enough to avoid\nobstacles.  \n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
