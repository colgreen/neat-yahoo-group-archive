But I think \ninteractive evolution has a lot of potential in the future.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m wondering, are your networks recurrent, in which case \nthe order in which you present coordinates would matter in a kind of \nstrange way?  \n\nAn idea your project brought to my mind was maybe a &quot;roving eye&quot;-\nlike artist could be evolved: It could start out in the middle and \njust decide on its own which directions to draw in and how much ink \nto drop at each step.  You could feed it coordinates as well, but it \nwould decide on the order it to visit them.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;mattias@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s cool...elaborate, if you would!\n&gt; \n&gt; Certainly;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not the first genetic art evolver, I think Karl Simms was \nfirst,\n&gt; though Richard Dawkins did some early work. It&#39;s not even my first \ngenetic\n&gt; art evolver, it&#39;s like my third or something.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I feed the neural network with the coordinates of each \npixel and\n&gt; let the network output the shade of that pixel.\n&gt; \n&gt; The user clicks on the picture that he likes and hits &quot;New \nGeneration&quot;. A\n&gt; new batch of images is created using the fitness specified by the \nuser.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the user clicks on may images, they may be crossed over in a \nfew of the\n&gt; next generation images.\n&gt; \n&gt; This program violates a few of the NEAT advantages;\n&gt;  * It doesn&#39;t use species (there&#39;d be not point)\n&gt;  * It doesn&#39;t start minimally (that would be dull)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve put up a version here;\n&gt; http://www.CambrianLabs.com/Mattias/DelphiNEAT/File/GeneticArt.zip\n&gt; \n&gt; Be warned, it&#39;s very rough and you can&#39;t save nor load images. So \nif you\n&gt; evolve the best image ever, man, it&#39;s gone!\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias\n\n\n\n\n"}}
