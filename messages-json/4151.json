The code is a mix of Python and C++, but there is\n&gt; a &quot;pure python&quot; ve=\r\nrsion of the InF and some C++ bindings.

I have a few\n&gt; &gt; questions regarding their implementation, as well as sp=\r\nike-time\n&gt; &gt; dependent plasticity (STDP).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve got almost 400 memb=\r\ners now in the group...anybody have any\n&gt; &gt; experience implementing these t=\r\nhings?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
