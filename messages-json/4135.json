I also saw the\nhumanoid =\r\nshuffle backwards.  It does seem easier to do that than go\nforwards.  \n\nMy =\r\nguess is that the behavior characterization of final (x,y,z)\nprobably confl=\r\nates too many behaviors.  The trick in walking is in\noscillation, so the pr=\r\noper stepping stone needs to have some ability\nto oscillate, regardless of =\r\nwhere its head ends up.  I&#39;d also guess\nthat the substrate also could be si=\r\nmplified.  I believe that it is\nallowing so much recurrence that it is very=\r\n difficult to produce a\nstable system.\n\nYou know what would be cool is if y=\r\nou could specify the behavior\ncharacterization yourself as the user, like i=\r\nf the program provided\nall the possible state variables and you could selec=\r\nt what to include\nin the characterization.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey I am glad that =\r\nyou like that stuff, it was around in my computer \n&gt; a whole week but I dec=\r\nided to upload a binary just before a day. Let \n&gt; me explain the details be=\r\nhind it. As you are probably familiar with \n&gt; the other NEVH shit this code=\r\n does the same but uses another NEAT \n&gt; implememtation and novelty search. =\r\n(steady state evolution). \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen some dolls actually walking, but bac=\r\nkwards. Kind of weird. \n&gt; I guess it is the easier way, though :) \n&gt; The be=\r\nhavior characterization is (as Peter B proposed) the final XYZ \n&gt; location =\r\nof the head. The distance is simply the eucldian distance \n&gt; between those =\r\npoints. I agree that there are many options and I am \n&gt; trying out many dif=\r\nferent BCs (behavior characterizations). But this \n&gt; one works well. \n&gt; The=\r\n nodes in the substrate are arranged in a geometric way to reflect \n&gt; the b=\r\nody&#39;s geometry in space. Each output corresponds to a joint \n&gt; angle. Arms =\r\nand legs are placed symmetrically in the left and right \n&gt; sides. The head =\r\n(neck joint) is placed above them in the center. \n&gt; Outputs are drawn in gr=\r\neen. Inputs (head velocity) are drawn in red. \n&gt; Hidden nodes are drawn in =\r\nyellow. Ergh I see it is upside-down but \n&gt; HyperNEAT doesn&#39;t care about th=\r\nis anyway :) \n&gt; The 5th input to the CPPN is the distance from 0, 0 in node=\r\n-specific \n&gt; data and the distance between the 2 points when computing the =\r\nweight \n&gt; of the connection between 2 nodes. Just like in your paper, the s=\r\name \n&gt; bias. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosi=\r\no&quot; &lt;ddambro84@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I though=\r\nt it would be awhile\n&gt; &gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combine=\r\nd.  I ran it \n&gt; while I\n&gt; &gt; was working on other stuff for a bit over 50,00=\r\n0 evaluations, \n&gt; checking\n&gt; &gt; in on it periodically.  The behavioral diver=\r\nsity was really\n&gt; &gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby steps and =\r\nguys that \n&gt; were\n&gt; &gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them did &quot;the chair&quot;=\r\n), although \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; were still a good number of repeats, especially ne=\r\nar the end \n&gt; (falling\n&gt; &gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty common).  No one=\r\n that I saw had a \n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; walking gait, but I guess it&#39;s possible that =\r\none could have when I\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an option to bro=\r\nwse the archive. \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; curious about a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t min=\r\nd sharing:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -What did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems like=\r\n there are a\n&gt; &gt; number of viable options here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -What do the nodes=\r\n on the substrate mean, and are they just on a \n&gt; flat\n&gt; &gt; plane?  I used y=\r\nour older version when it was first released, and \n&gt; if I\n&gt; &gt; remember righ=\r\nt the two on the left are inputs and the stuff on the\n&gt; &gt; right is various =\r\njoints, but I wanted to make sure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Similarly, what do you use as =\r\nthe 5th input on the CPPN?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This email message is a notificatio=\r\nn to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of =\r\nthe neat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   File        : /novelty_nevh.rar \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Description=\r\n : Novelty Search applied to evolving HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; leaky-integrator substr=\r\nates controlling a 3D humanoid model.
