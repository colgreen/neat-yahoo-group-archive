I am engaded in three main projects \nright now:\n\n1) We are developing a video game based on neuroevolution.  It&#39;s \npretty exciting since there&#39;s never been a game like this before. \nYou can see a preliminary concept of the game at:\n\nhttp://gamedev.ic2.org/tiki-index.php?page=LegionsOfInfluence \n\nThis game will involve real-time (steady-state) evolution. In other \nwords it will not be generational, but rather the worst network will \nbe replaced with the best in real-time as the game is being played.\nThus for this game I am re-writing the main NEAT epoch loop for real-\ntime, which changes some of the equations. For example, the \noffspring assignments of generational evolution have to be replaced \nwith probabilities.  Anyway, so this is a lot of programming and I \nam working with a development team on designing the game engine to \nbe compatible with NEAT.\n\n2) We have another project integrating NEAT with a sophisitcated \nautomobile driving simulator.  The simulator source code is quite \ncomplicated and wasn&#39;t designed for machine learning, so it&#39;s a \ntricky integration project.\n\n3) I have been working on Go with NEAT, although because of time \nconstraints I may need to stop for now.  But I&#39;ve been testing out \nnovel ways of using neural networks in Go.  NEAT can evolve NN&#39;s\nto defeat 5x5 gnugo, a public domain Go player, but the problem is \nit sort of memorizes how gnugo plays.  So I&#39;ve also been coevolving \nGo players to be more general.  But the more general ones are not \nvery strong.  Thus, I&#39;ve been combining coevolution with gnugo \nhoping for a mix of generality and strength.  \n\nSo basically integrating NEAT with the game engine, the driving \nsimulator, and gnugo, are all pretty extensive integration projects \nleaving me unfortunately little time to try other things.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
