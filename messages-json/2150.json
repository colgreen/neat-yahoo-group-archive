I \nsuppose these questions may have been asked before but I&#39;ve spend \nsometime searching through past messages with not much success.\n\n1. Why is it that if I create a network with 10 input nodes and 1 \noutput nodes, when I use the newwork viewer application is show the \nnetwork as haveing 11 input nodes?\n\n2. I&#39;ve created an experiment where most test require a simple \nnetwork in order to get the right answer.  However, a few of the \ntests require a more complex solution.  What seems to be happening \nis that the searching process quickly finds the simple network but \nwhich achieves about 94% of the fitness but never finds a network \nthat fits the complete solution.  I think a solution should be \npossible as the inputs are logically created.  I think the more \nspecialised species are being wiped-out before they get the change \nto evolve properly.  What changes to my network parameters can I \nmake to increase the change of more complex networks?\n\nRegards\nChris Turner\n\n\n\n"}}
