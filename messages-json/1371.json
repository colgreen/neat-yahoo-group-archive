My inputs are always in the range of +/- 1, \n&gt;centered\n&gt; &gt;around 0.  And it is always equally centered, such that it goes just as \n&gt;much\n&gt; &gt;above as below.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;NEAT, of course, captalizes on this fact.  By evolving networks that try\n&gt; &gt;their hardest to always return &#39;0&#39; as the output, they minimize their \n&gt;error.\n&gt; &gt;. . without actually solving the problem they were asked to solve.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What I need is a fitness function that penalizes for this.\n&gt;\n&gt;Can you not just make sure you include tests on plain-white and plain-black\n&gt;images in every generation?\n\n&gt;They presumably require outputs of +1 and -1 respectively?\n\nNo.  The inputs are scaled to represent the relative brightness of the input \npixels, not their actual brightness.  Thus, the network will see a \nparticular shape the same if it is nearly black as it will if it is gray, or \nif it is nearly white, or if it has high contrast or low contrast.\n\nFor example, compose an input image that consists of a linear gradient going \nfrom upper left to lower right.  Go from solid black to solid white.  The \nblack will be given to the network as -1, and the white will be 1.\n\nMake another that goes from black to gray.  Black will be given to the \nnetwork as -1.  Gray will be 1.  Same shape, same inputs, even though the \noriginal image is different.\n\nSame thing from gray to white.  Gray gets -1, white gets 1.  Every possible \nvariant of a simple gradient from upper left to lower right going from \ndarker to lighter will get the same exact inputs...unless the contrast \nwithin the sample is too small (less than 10% of total possible range).  In \nthat case, the inputs are merely centered around 0, and the min and max will \nbe something less than +/- 1.  The reason for that is to avoid amplifying \nminor noise in otherwise smooth areas of an image.\n\nSo, if I feed it all black, then the inputs will be all zeros.  If I feed it \nall white, the inputs will also be all zeros.  Not much value to that.\n\nYes, that does mean that the ouput has to be translated the reverse of how \nthe inputs were translated.  But that&#39;s easy enough.  And the group at HP \nwhose work I&#39;m most interested in duplicating did in fact compare their \nresults of translated inputs/outputs of various types with un-translated \nones.  While they all worked, the translation method described gave them the \nbest results, for what I would think are obvious reasons.  The network&#39;s job \nis easier!\n\n&gt;Or maybe the ability to do black and white should be the first part of your\n&gt;score function, even before averaging\n\nDon&#39;t think so, not in this case.\n\n\n\n"}}
