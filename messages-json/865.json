We can run 50 networks at the same time in real-time easily \n&gt;on a single processor.  Obviously at some huge network size things \n&gt;will start slowing down, but then again, what else can you do if a \n&gt;huge network is necessary to solve the task?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThere is also the possibility of implementing networks in hardware \nand/or distributing them over multiple processors if needs be. So if \nsomeone did evolve a network that helped significantly with some task \nthat had commercial worth but it was too slow on a general purpose CPU \nthen there are other options available. One relatively cheap method \nmight be to use FPGAs, I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ve read about these being used \nfor neural nets in the past - you can get FPGAs on a standard PCI card I \nbelieve.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
