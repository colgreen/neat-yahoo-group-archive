As a substitute for the loss of history I was\n&gt;thinking of storing the generation number at which a connection was \n&gt;created.\n\nI got to thinking, and decided I liked the idea of maintaining history.  So \nI&#39;m going to...literally.  I&#39;ll keep a list of genome changes that get \ncarried along with the genome as a separate &#39;history&#39; list.  Every change \ngets an entry in the list.  I&#39;ll even store entries for generation#/fitness \npairs.  When the experiment finishes, you should be able to use that history \nto recreate the entire history of the genome from the initial configuration \nto the final configuration.  Mostly for human use, of course.  NEAT itself \ndoesn&#39;t need it.\n\n(capturing some thoughts...let me know if you see anything wrong with these \nideas)\n\nWhen a new genome is created by mutation, I will copy the old genome first.  \nThat will include its history.  It will then get a new ID.  Which will get \nan entry in the history list (maybe?).  Then, for each change that is made \n(connection added, node added, weight changed), an entry is made in the \nhistory list for the organism.\n\nLikewise, for a crossover, I will start by copying the genome (and history) \nof the more fit parent.  I will create an entry that lists which genome it \nwas crossed with.  And for every change that is made as part of the \ncrossover, an entry is made.\n\nAs for elitism, they will get copied verbatim.  Even the ID will stay the \nsame.  Then I will add an entry in the history indicating that it was copied \nas an elite organism.  Maybe?  Probably redundant...if you see Gen#/Fitness \nentries one after another, you know it was passed from generation to \ngeneration unchanged.\n\n&gt;Anyway this only relates to connections, maintaining consistent neuron\n&gt;IDs seems trickier. When a neuron is added it splits a connection, that\n&gt;connection has a source and target neuron, but several other splits\n&gt;could have occured in the past between the same two neurons. How do I\n&gt;know which neuron my new neuron is equivalent to?\n\nI&#39;m not sure I follow you...  In order for the unique ID of a connection to \nbe the combination of the neuron ID&#39;s of the neurons it connects, it is \nassumed that the current neuron numbering scheme remain in place.\n\nSo perhaps you are thinking during the time you are creating the new neuron? \n  You want to reuse an innovation ID if you are splitting a connection that \nhas been split before, right?  That will impose limits on the way the \nstructure can be built.  But I&#39;m not sure the implications of it...let&#39;s \nsee:\n\nStart with one input, A, connected to one output, Z\nSplit A-Z and get A-B-Z\nRe-connect A-Z.  If you try to split that again, you can&#39;t.\nIf you split B-Z, you get B-C-Z, or A-B-C-Z total\nConnect A-C and split it, and you get A-D-C-Z, so B and D are siblings.\nSplit D-Z, and you get D-E-Z, and C and E are siblings.\n\nDrawing it out, it looks like it should work.  However, I suspect that there \nare structures you can&#39;t create that way.  For example, A-B-Z and A-C-Z \nwhere C and B are siblings.  The only way you could construct such a network \nwith this approach is to support removing nodes and/or connections.\n\nAt first, that sounds like it increases the search space.  But having even \nmore accurate identification of equivalent structures will actually narrow \nthe search.  Perhaps you have struck on &#39;the best of both worlds.&#39;\n\nI like it...I&#39;m going to do it.\n\nMy plan is to do XOR first, both a real XOR and a &#39;random fitness&#39; version.  \nSo when that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll let everybody know what the results of doing it \nthis way are, that way nobody else spends any time implementing a \npotentially dead-end avenue of research.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
