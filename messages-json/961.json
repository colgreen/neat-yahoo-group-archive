Ok so \nsometimes \n&gt; a new connection appears and it immediately increases the fitness \nof a \n&gt; genome - good. But whenever a neuron is added it can *never* be \n&gt; immediately beneficial because NEAT adds them in such a way as to \nmake \n&gt; them equivalent to the connection that was split. \n\n\nColin, I pretty much agree with your main point, but this point is \ntechnically not correct.  Adding a node *does* slightly change a \nconnection, because it changes it from linear to nonlinear, since a \nsigmoid (in the new node) is nonlinear.  Even a steepened sigmoid is \nnot equivalent to a line.  And that nonlinearity may in some cases \nactually increase fitness on its own.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
