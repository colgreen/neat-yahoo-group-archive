But sometimes it&#39;s valuable even to s=\r\nhow that\n&gt; something is possible - an &quot;existence proof&quot;. E.g., it could be =\r\nworth a\n&gt; paper to show that a particular paper could be represented by a n=\r\neural\n&gt; network. The paper could then describe the behaviour, the structure=\r\n of the\n&gt; network and (for completeness) the evolutionary method used to cr=\r\neate the\n&gt; network that displays this behaviour. Additional runs to verify =\r\nthat it can\n&gt; be done again might not actually add much to the paper, becau=\r\nse that&#39;s not\n&gt; what the paper is about. (They might also not be attempted =\r\nby the author\n&gt; because of the time it takes to run the experiment again, a=\r\nnd an impending\n&gt; deadline.)\n\nThat&#39;s a good point, and I can think of at le=\r\nast one very good paper off the top of my head that does that. [&quot;The Dynami=\r\ncs of Active Categorical Perception in an Evolved Model Agent&quot;, Beer (2003)=\r\n]. However, that was a good paper because it did an in-depth quantitative a=\r\nnalysis of the agent&#39;s behavior. Lacking a quantitative analysis of the beh=\r\navior, the paper would likely be left wanting because ANN structure almost =\r\nalways tells us nothing about the algorithm underlying the behavior.\n\n\n&gt; In=\r\n general, I believe that there are many possible ways of doing good\n&gt; resea=\r\nrch. The big problem with some papers is not that they don&#39;t follow\n&gt; some =\r\nparticular research methodology, rather that they are not clear about\n&gt; wha=\r\nt they are seeking to show.\n\nWell-put!\n\n\n&gt; Again, I agree to some extent. B=\r\nut you take for granted that what we are\n&gt; doing here is science. Much of w=\r\nhat gets published in Gecco, CEC, TEC etc\n&gt; is not really science but rathe=\r\nr engineering research, which can be good or\n&gt; bad. I think that comparing =\r\nmethods on some particular benchmark can be\n&gt; very valuable, but of course =\r\nit helps if the benchmark is relevant.\n\nAlso a good point. If the goal is t=\r\no &quot;make stuff,&quot; then methods papers with benchmarks make sense. However, be=\r\nnchmarks require a quantitative comparison, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any es=\r\ncaping quantitative comparisons one way or the other.\n\n\n"}}
