And in this field, it&#39;s\n&gt; especially unlikely that\n&gt; something is useful just because it&#39;s original,\n&gt; since there are a\n&gt; million mediocre variations of implementations that\n&gt; haven&#39;t been\n&gt; patented yet. \n\nExactly.  I think the initial conclusions you jumped\nto were just fine, Ken.\n\nHere&#39;s the patent:\n\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,424,961.WKU.&OS=PN/6,424,961&RS=PN/6,424,961\n\nUnder &quot;Summary of Invention&quot; we get:\n\n&quot;There is a long-felt need for an artificial neural\nnetwork that is more brain-like in architecture and\noperation so that the artificial neural network is\ncapable of learning from experience. \n\nThese and other needs are addressed by an adaptive\nintegration network, in which learning occurs during\nthe normal operation of the adaptive integration\nnetwork, and adaptive learning is promoted by\nincreasing the activity level of the adaptive\nintegration network.&quot;\n\nOkay.  As someone else on the list already said,\nsounds like he&#39;s patented Hebbian learning.\n\nBut more telling is his profile on a business venture\nentitled &quot;Emergent Minds&quot;:\n\nhttp://www.emergentminds.com/html/founders.html\n\n&quot;Francisco holds an A.B. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D.\nin Organismal and Evolutionary Biology, both from\nHarvard, and has three years of postdoctoral\nexperience at the Institute of Molecular Evolutionary\nGenetics. He is the author of fifteen publications in\ntopflight scientific journals, and his research has\nachieved international attention in the popular as\nwell as the scientific press and has been described in\nnumerous textbooks.&quot;\n\nAlthough there are no references or links to any of\nthese publications, and Citeseer and other on-line\nsearches turn up zilch.\n\nRight now I&#39;m viewing Ayala, his credentials, and his\nclaims with a very large dose of skepticism.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
