This was as fascinating as it was often.\n&gt;\n&gt; A phenomenon akin to tunnel-vision sometimes sets in in the  minds of &quot;experts&quot; where\n&gt; the context of their expertise rejects or  transforms the query into something\n&gt; more palatable to their context.   I see this often in my work.\n\n\nI guess we all suffer from a tunnel-vision effect to some degree.\nWhile I was working on the Netflix prize last year I did a lot of\nreading on the subject and it&#39;s really interesting to see how it has\nchanged the way I think about both new and old problems I encounter.\nIn the grand scheme of things Collaborative Filtering is a pretty\nniche subject, and yet underlying it is a bunch of maths/statistics\nthat gives better understanding of certain real world problems.  Now\nI&#39;d like to think that as I learn new stuff that my understanding of\neverything expands, but at the same time I suspect it might just be\nmoving a single narrow perspective around a bit :)\n\nThat said I wonder if some of these guys have ever thought about\nevolution outside the context of biology. Biology is a fascinating\nsubject but biology does not equal evolution. It&#39;s a fundamental\nphenomenon that gave rise to biology and lots of other things and I\nwonder if someone like Wolpert has ever really thought about that.\nYou see, if you&#39;re really that interested in evolution AND you have\nsome exposure to computers, well then you&#39;re going to at least have a\ntinker with EC aren&#39;t you? E.g. maybe just d/load an alife program\nwith a pretty GUI and just see what happens?\n\n\n\n&gt;  The fact that this tendency is reduced by  starting de novo or minimally is one of the\n&gt; particular strengths in  neuro-evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt; Learning to use these tools teaches us something not  only about the tools,\n&gt; but ourselves.\n\nNicely back on topic :)   Something I&#39;ve mentioned a few times before\nis how interesting it is to write a fitness function for a NEAT\nexperiment. They hardly ever work as you expect the first time because\nNEAT finds solutions you wouldn&#39;t expect -  NEAT is very good at\nfindings holes in a fitness schemes and &#39;cheating&#39;. It really forces\nyou to think about the problem you are /really/ trying to solve.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
