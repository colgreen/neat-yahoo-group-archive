I have used the \n&quot;spikey sphere&quot; of 26 vectors giving 26*26=676 test cases that I \ndescribed.  I assign each test case a max fitness of 1.0, basically I \ncompare the network&#39;s output with the expected result and total the \nerror for the three components (x,y and z). This gives me a value \nbetween 0 and 3 because my vectors are all length 1.0 and therefore each \ncomponent should be between 0 and 1. I then subtract that error from 3 \nand divide by 3 to give a fitness between 0 and 1 - did you get all that :)\n\nOne change I did make was to ensure that if the sign of the network&#39;s \noutput was different to the correct answer then I assigned a fitness of \n0 for that component, this makes sense to me because otherwise an answer \nthat is very close to the correct result but of the wrong sign is (I \nthink) not really such a good answer - the theory being that we want to \nget the sign right first and then worry about precision afterwards.\n\nUsing this scheme my current best after several short searches is 443 \nout of a maximum of 676.\n\nSo I guess this is in line with your observations - that it&#39;s quite a \ndeceptively tricky domain. I&#39;ll do some longer runs soon and maybe make \na few tweaks to the fitness evaluation scheme.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
