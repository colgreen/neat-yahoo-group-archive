Looping is needed to compute these\n&gt; kind of networks which can make them slow. :(\n\nBy this do you mean connections that connect from the output to the\ninput of a single neuron? If so I think this is similar to leaky\nintegrator neurons. So potentially it might be better to not attempt\nto evolve these types of connectivity, but to allow different types of\nneuron to be used.\n\n&gt; 2:\n&gt; Add memory of old activations of size N to each node in the Feed Forward\n&gt; network and allow genes to go from these old computed values. This kind of\n&gt; network does not contain any loops so it is as fast to compute as the Feed\n&gt; Forward network. super nice :)\n\nAgain, keeping some memory of past activations is sort of like leaky\nintegrators. It&#39;s not the same but it leaky-integrators might be a\nbetter solution depending on what you&#39;re trying to achieve. The same\ngoes for #4.\n\n\n&gt; One can also have two bit flags so one can choose if nodes with zero inputs, and nodes with zero outputs should be allowed to\n&gt; exist.\n\nI think those types of nodes are always going to be redundant. If some\nnode or sub-network has no inputs then its output will be constant,\ntherefore it&#39;s output can be represented more simply with a single\nconnection to the bias node.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
