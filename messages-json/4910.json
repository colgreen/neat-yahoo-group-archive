I&#39;ve been tossing around the idea in my head\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some time=\r\n of doing an implementation of NEAT in F#. For the\n&gt; &gt; uninitiated, F#\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; is MS&#39;s functional .NET solution to the manycore system. It is\n&gt; &gt; comp=\r\nletely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interoperable with C#/VB and can use the .NET framework. I&#39;m=\r\n still\n&gt; &gt; getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely ramped up on it but it seems like it =\r\nmight be very well\n&gt; &gt; suited to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT. I was wondering what people =\r\nthink about this. Waste of time?\n&gt; &gt; Maybe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT would be better sui=\r\nted to hadoop or something like that.
