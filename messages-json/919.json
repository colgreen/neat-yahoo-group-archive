What should be done is that species numbers get recorded\n&gt;such that they can be restored, and also the compat_thresh needs to be\n&gt;remembered in the case of dynamic thresholding.\n\nGood point.  I think I&#39;m confused about how speciation happens.  For some \nreason, I was under the impression that you assign every specimen to a \nspecies for every generation.  I wasn&#39;t aware that anything needed to be \nmaintained between generations.  Can you give me a link to a paper that \ndiscusses speciation in more detail?\n\n&gt;Otherwise, species\n&gt;will be renumbered on each generation, and you will forget what your\n&gt;threshold is.\n\nWhat effect does that have?\n\n&gt;So are you saying you intend to write NEAT in Perl or just modify an\n&gt;existing NEAT and connect it to Perl?\n\nEither way.  If I can use somebody else&#39;s NEAT as a command-line tool, that \nwould be my first choice.\n\n&gt;Either way it&#39;s an interesting\n&gt;idea, but is Perl fast enough to be the main body of NEAT?\n\nWasn&#39;t it you that argued that the NEAT part was usually only a small part \nof the CPU time of an experiment?  So even if it takes two or three times as \nlong to generate the next generation of a population, that doesn&#39;t add much \nto overall run time, does it?\n\nPerhaps I should ask:  How long DOES it take if, for example, you have a \nfairly large genome and a population of, say, 1000 individuals?  For your \nC++ code, that is.  If it does it in under a second, then I&#39;m sure Perl is \n&#39;fast enough.&#39;  If it takes more like a minute, then it may not be.  What&#39;s \nyour experience?\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
