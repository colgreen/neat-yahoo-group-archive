As you are experiencing, the \ninputs/outputs issue ca=\r\nn be prohibitive even with feature \nselection.  It is also possible that Hy=\r\nperNEAT could be useful \nbecause it does not care about the # inputs or out=\r\nputs (and can \npotentially exploit geometric regularities), but configuring=\r\n the \nsubstrate then becomes the challenge.\n\nAssuming all of that stuff is =\r\nset up well with whatever system, then \nnovelty search is a potentially win=\r\nning approach.  Yet as you point \nout there are some big questions there as=\r\n well.  In fact, we are \ncurrently trying to provide the best answers to th=\r\nese questions in \nongoing research, but some general principles might help =\r\nfor now: \n\nFirst, the archive in novelty search does not not need to contai=\r\nn \nevery point ever visited.  Therefore, it tends to grow much slower \nthan=\r\n the #of evaluations.  However, if it is indeed getting too big  \nthen it i=\r\ns not unreasonable to collapse some of the archive points, \nalthough there =\r\nis no standard method yet for how that should be \ndone.  But we have reason=\r\n to believe there will be effective and \nsimple ways to do that.\n\nSecond, t=\r\nhe issue of one individual looking different just because \nof a phase diffe=\r\nrence in effectivley the same behavior is \ncomplicated.  For certain phase =\r\ndisaparities, the two individuals \nwon&#39;t look all that different, but it is=\r\n true that at some \ndisparity, they may look very different.  Yet it is not=\r\n clear \nwhether that fact is actually problematic to the novelty search or =\r\n\nnot, because it would simply reward both types of behavior.  It is \npossib=\r\nle that the phase difference is a result of some useful \ngenotypic change, =\r\nwhich could make it a stepping stone to something \nbetter.  Or, it is possi=\r\nble that it is superfluous information and \nsimply takes some extra time ex=\r\nploring the area around the phase-\nshifted individual.  So it is hard to sa=\r\ny a priori whether it is a \nmajor concern.  We will have better answers to =\r\nsuch questions as the \ntechnique is further explored.\n\nHowever, I agree tha=\r\nt it would be nice to be able to say the two \nphase-shifted individuals are=\r\n largely the same if that is indeed \nwhat you want to say.  And for that, y=\r\nou would need a pattern-\nmatching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.=\r\ne. something more \nsophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  There ar=\r\ne certainly \nsuch metrics available.  However, it&#39;s important to recognize =\r\nthat \nit is not evident at this point that ignoring the phase shift is \nact=\r\nually better than taking it into consideration, because taking it \ninto con=\r\nsideration just means adding more information to the novelty \nlandscape.\n\nS=\r\no overall I think novelty search is a very promising direction to \ngo for s=\r\nuch problems, but it is still in the realm of research (i.e. \nthere is no e=\r\nxisting precedent), so it will involve considerable \ntrial and error to get=\r\n it right until all these issues are fleshed \nout more clearly.  Ultimately=\r\n, though, if our hypothesis about \nnovelty vs. fitness is correct, novelty =\r\nsearch may turn out to be \nthe *only* way to get certain highly complex typ=\r\nes of behavior to \nevolve in some domains, which is a sobering thought.  Bu=\r\nt if it is \ntrue, then there is not much to do other than try it.\n\nken\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \nfascinating\n&gt; =\r\nnew approach. For the past couple of months I&#39;ve been working on\n&gt; virtual =\r\ncreature controllers; specifically I have a ragdoll rig \nwhich\n&gt; I&#39;ve set u=\r\np in Breve Simulation Environment (available at\n&gt; http://spiderland.org )\n&gt;=\r\n This ragdoll is modelled after the one in Toribash, a free game \nwhich\n&gt; u=\r\nses the open dynamics engine for physics, like breve. \n&gt; \n&gt; So far a lot of=\r\n the results I&#39;ve been having discouraging; as Ken\n&gt; points out early on in=\r\n his latest paper, trying to make a walking\n&gt; biped usually results in it f=\r\nalling over perpetually. You can see \nsome\n&gt; WIP videos at my youtube page =\r\nhere:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/user/thehaircrow\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately, I would li=\r\nke to package AI&#39;s with the Toribash game so\n&gt; that they are fun to play ag=\r\nainst in single player- I think this \ngoal\n&gt; is attainable despite being di=\r\nfficult.\n&gt; Deception is a BIG problem here; if my fitness criteria is time\n=\r\n&gt; integrated distance from a goal, it encourages the behaviour of the\n&gt; &quot;To=\r\nri&quot; balancing in a stable configuration forever, rather than\n&gt; walking, whi=\r\nch is what I&#39;m trying to encourage. As there is 20 \njoints\n&gt; in this rig, I=\r\n am providing joint position and velocity information\n&gt; for each joint, as =\r\nwell as a bias, a sine-wave, the x, y, and z\n&gt; components linear velocity i=\r\nn the reference frame of the Tori&#39;s \nhead,\n&gt; and finally 3 variables which =\r\ncorrespond to the vertical, \nhorizontal\n&gt; and forward orientation of the to=\r\nri&#39;s head with respect to world\n&gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; The current experimental=\r\n configuration I am started out as a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; ragdoll control where neural =\r\nnet outputs correspond directly joint\n&gt; velocity; a tanh activation functio=\r\nn is used to allow positive and\n&gt; negative joint movement.\n&gt; I then remodel=\r\ned the experiment to perform as in the Toribash game;\n&gt; the net will receiv=\r\ne inputs (and effect joint movements) only \nevery 10\n&gt; time steps. More imp=\r\nortantly, I increased the amount of outputs \nfrom\n&gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40,=\r\n in order to accomodate the 4 possible joint\n&gt; actions which can occur on a=\r\n turn: holding, relaxing, extending, \nand\n&gt; flexing. \n&gt; \n&gt; Starting with a =\r\nfully connected net, that gives a staggeringly huge\n&gt; search space with ove=\r\nr 1000 connections. Due to the implementation,\n&gt; its prohibitively slow to =\r\nevolve large nets as the starting net can\n&gt; take up over 600mb of ram on th=\r\ne heap. Realizing this was a bit\n&gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature select=\r\nion and phased pruning.\n&gt; However, even with this, deception seems to preve=\r\nnt any useful\n&gt; behaviour; the Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI am using a python implementation of neat developed by Cesar Gomez\n&gt; under=\r\n the GPL, which is available at http://code.google.com/p/neat-\npython/\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n This implementation is a WIP and I&#39;ve already done a lot of tests\n&gt; trying=\r\n to incorporate the linear genome encoding taken from the \nEANT\n&gt; method. I=\r\n&#39;ve also been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in order to\n&gt; optimize weights b=\r\nut I haven&#39;t had much success meshing this with \nthe\n&gt; rest of the code yet=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later today when I am home I will post my source files for anyone \nw=\r\nho\n&gt; wishes to experiment with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \nrepresented\n&gt; a=\r\ns a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount of time\n&gt; steps th=\r\ne Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method proposed\n&gt; for the 2d ma=\r\nze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a new ending\n&gt; point then \n&gt; we a=\r\ndd that point to a list of discovered behaviours. This works \nwell\n&gt; (I ima=\r\ngine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of information to hold.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I want =\r\nto know is how I can compare the behaviour of 2 ragdoll\n&gt; controllers for n=\r\novelty; is there any compact encoding that would\n&gt; work? Since it often tak=\r\nes 25 000 seperate evaluations to get any\n&gt; useful behaviour out of this ri=\r\nght now, theres going to have to be\n&gt; some way to store 20k seperate behavi=\r\nours in some way that is fast \nand\n&gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has id=\r\nentical behaviour to another \nbut\n&gt; does things a couple of time steps late=\r\nr instead? Just comparing \nthe\n&gt; two behaviours it would appear that they w=\r\nere 100% unique, yet a \nhuman\n&gt; observer would instantly notice the similar=\r\nity in how they act.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
