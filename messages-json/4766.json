I would like to understand\nyour suggestions below more clearly, and your intuitions for them. Please\nsee my questions below.\n\n&gt; I would suggest putting such information in a centered locations in their own\n&gt; layers, or in other dimensions (as you suggest)\n\nHow do these two suggestions differ? When you suggest &#39;another layer&#39; isn&#39;t\nthat just shorthand for &#39;another dimension&#39;? For example, the only way you\ncan have two inputs with the same centering (e.g. X=0, Y=0) would be to have\nthem have different Z dimensions, which to me implies another layer (in the\ngeometric representation space).\n\nCan you give examples your suggestions so I can conceptualize them?\n\nMore importantly, why do you think centering the nodes but putting them in\ndifferent layers/dimensions is the right way to go (versus just putting them\nin their own area within the pre-existing dimensionality)?\n\n\n&gt;, and sticking with HyperNEAT\n&gt; overall.  It may work well actually to make things like health and ammo actual\n&gt; geometric dimensions.  However, you could also let them be single nodes that\n&gt; are alone in their own layers, or in parts of the input layer that are\n&gt; separated from the rest of it.\n&gt; \n\nI have basically the same questions here, as I don&#39;t get the difference\nbetween these suggestions.\n\nSorry if I am just not thinking of something obvious.\n\n-Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, tansey@... wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks for the clarification.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; As a follow-up, do you have any suggestions on how to handle mixed geometric\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; non-geometric data?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For instance, if you&#39;re evolving a bot for a FPS, you may have some geometric\n&gt;&gt; representation of the world. However, there may also be other relevant\n&gt;&gt; information like health or ammo. It seems like there are only three solutions\n&gt;&gt; right now:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 1. Use regular NEAT and lose the regularity of the world.\n&gt;&gt; 2. Use HyperNEAT and force the health and ammo information to be represented\n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; extra dimensions even though they can be handled by a single input node.\n&gt;&gt; 3. Evolve a HyperNEAT agent separately then use its input(s) as secondary\n&gt;&gt; input(s) to a regular NEAT controller.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Is there a fourth approach? Or is there generally a preference for one of the\n&gt;&gt; above three approaches?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Wesley\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Quoting Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Wesley, the main insight motivating r(x) is that it aligns the agent\n&gt;&gt;&gt; geometry\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the team geometry.  That is, the left side of the agent is on the same\n&gt;&gt;&gt; side of the agent as the left side of the team, which is how it usually\n&gt;&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be in the real world.  Nevertheless, you make a good point that the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; substrate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; could be 3D as an alternative.  There is nothing wrong with doing it that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; way\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and it does have its own advantages.  In fact, we have experimented with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; both\n&gt;&gt;&gt; approaches to laying out agents for multiagent learning (although only r(x)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is in the GECCO paper), and both are valid.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am working on a project that needs a substrate of more than 2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dimensions. Looking at David and Ken&#39;s GECCO&#39;08 paper, I would have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expected a 3d substrate for the heterogeneous agent experiment. Is there\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some insight I&#39;m missing behind using the special r(x) function rather\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than making a 3rd dimension?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wesley\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
