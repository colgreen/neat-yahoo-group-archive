This is probably one of =\r\n\nthose cases where there is no need for nondeterminism.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken, Faisal,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Following on from your suggestions Ken I was thinking that for\n&gt; somet=\r\nhing like moving towards a target it probably makes sense to \ntake\n&gt; N posi=\r\ntions equidistant from the target and also evenly spaced out\n&gt; around the c=\r\nircumference (spaced every 360/N degrees). In addition \nyou\n&gt; want to evalu=\r\nate how the agent responds when oriented differently\n&gt; relative to the targ=\r\net, so for each of the N positions perform\n&gt; multiple trials with the agent=\r\n oriented pointing towards, away \nfrom,\n&gt; at 90 degrees etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, =\r\nif the agent is egocentric then you don&#39;t really need the \nN\n&gt; trials space=\r\nd around a circumference - they will all amount to\n&gt; evaulating the same sc=\r\nenario. You may however want to perform \ntrials\n&gt; using  3 or 4 different (=\r\nand adjacent) starting poistions if the \nworld\n&gt; is a grid system because o=\r\nf the subtle sensory differences caused \nby\n&gt; aliasing.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do star=\r\nt out at a fixed distance then you can assign fitness\n&gt; based on how close =\r\nthe agent gets to the target within a fixed \namount\n&gt; of time - averaged ou=\r\nt for each of the different starting\n&gt; orientations. Does this seem reasona=\r\nble?\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
