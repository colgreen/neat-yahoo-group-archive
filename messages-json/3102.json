I a=\r\nm a little new to Linux so my makefiles\nmight be a little unusual but they =\r\nseem to work for me.\n\nThe executable takes an optional parameter that speci=\r\nfies a parameter\nfile otherwise it expects the parameters to be in a file c=\r\nalled params.ini\n\nThe actual time series that is being predicted should be =\r\nin a patterns\nfile (the name of this is specified in the parameters file). =\r\nThere is\na few examples in the &quot;/neatl/bin&quot; directory. They are pretty self=\r\n\nexplanatory all the columns of data except for the last are the input\ninto=\r\n the net. Input doesn&#39;t need to be scaled but output needs to be\nscaled to =\r\nbe within 0 and 1 (within the output range of the sigmoid).\nI usually load =\r\nmy data into a spreadsheet and scale it there. I also\nusually squash my dat=\r\na to be within the range of 0.25 to 0.75 to aid\nin learning.\n\nOnce the time=\r\n series is learned a Net should be dumped in the working\ndirectory. This ne=\r\nt can be loaded into the evaluator program which\nwill produce a space seper=\r\nated output file that you can load into a\nspreadsheet. So you can compare y=\r\nour networks predictions against the\ntrue values in the spreadsheet. I usua=\r\nlly load the data in Excel and\ngraph the two series to compare them.\n\nThere=\r\n is a lot more options but most of them are pretty self\nexplanatory if you =\r\ntake a peek at the code. Most are controlled via\nthe parameters file. With =\r\nthe exception of the quit early option\n(press q) and the dump best net earl=\r\ny option (press d).\n\nMy code is of course based on Matt Buckland&#39;s c++ impl=\r\nementation of\nKen Stanley&#39;s NEAT concept. With the addition of Agner Fog&#39;s =\r\nUniform\nrandom number generator and possibly some other code that I&#39;ve\ncann=\r\nibalized along the way.\n\nI&#39;ve started implementing code to increase the mut=\r\nation rate based on\nthe rate change of fitness. This can be found in the me=\r\nthod:\n\nvoid CController::adjustMutationRate()\n\nI am particularly interested=\r\n in feedback on this aspect. Though it is\nvery very rough right now.\n\nAny c=\r\nomments or angry requests to help compile my damn program :)\nPlease post in=\r\n the group and I will try to answer them when I have time.\n\nThanks,\n\nShane\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
