We try to be vigilant about t=\r\nhe accuracy of our formulas, so it&#39;s a surprise to us that those somehow sl=\r\nipped through with errors.  I hope it did not cause you or anyone else inco=\r\nnvenience.  Thank you very much for bringing that to our attention.\n\nTo rem=\r\nedy the mistake, we just now corrected the formula in both online versions =\r\nof these papers so from now on anyone who downloads them from eplex will ha=\r\nve the right formula, thanks to you.  \n\nNote that our HyperSharpNEAT source=\r\n code distribution did have the correct formula, so there is no problem wit=\r\nh the experiment if anyone downloaded it.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for po=\r\ninting out this inconsistency.  You&#39;re right that both papers managed to so=\r\nmehow list different but still incorrect fitness functions.  I actually use=\r\nd 1000r-Ttot to get the amount of time remaining since each trail was alloc=\r\nated 1000 time steps.  However, your fitness function makes perfect sense t=\r\noo, so I doubt choosing one or the other would significantly affect the res=\r\nults.\n&gt; \n&gt; David\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.s=\r\nimmerson@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had done an experiment in conju=\r\nction with the Torcs competition that Julian Togelius et al are running.  T=\r\nhe results were not that encouraging when compared with a standard NEAT exp=\r\neriment (maybe I need to sort out the geometry, though given the recent pap=\r\ner by Jeff, any geometry should work better than standard NEAT).  I impleme=\r\nnted David B. D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s Food Finder experiment and that worked just fine=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know you used this experiment in your alife 09 paper and I hav=\r\ne one question regarding the fitness function of this experiment.  First, t=\r\nhe algorithms are slightly different - could be typos or could be just diff=\r\nerent.  However, in both, they seem to reward (increasing fitness) bots tha=\r\nt take longer with the (Ttot * 1000r) or (Ttot / 1000r) terms of yours and =\r\nDavid&#39;s experiments. This seems at odds with the goal.  I have implemented =\r\n(1000r / Ttot) which after all food is found rewards quicker bots.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Maybe I have missed something or misunderstood.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\natt\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt, what kind of experiment is implemented in your hypern=\r\neat?
