Is there a hidden layer?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Wow Peter=\r\n, that is fast work!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, it was about a day of coding :) I even=\r\n applied it to the \nActive \n&gt; Vision system from ANJI (my own implementatio=\r\nn of it).. current \n&gt; results show that with HyperNEAT it learns actually b=\r\netter, and \nthe \n&gt; circular substrate configuration increases performance a=\r\nmong \n&gt; others. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Assigning node-centric values is a legitimate res=\r\nearch problem.  \n&gt; The \n&gt; &gt; simplest answer is that a CPPN can have more th=\r\nan a single \noutput.  \n&gt; &gt; There can be additional outputs for things like =\r\nbiases and \nlearning \n&gt; &gt; rates.  Each such property will then be patterned=\r\n across the \n&gt; substrate \n&gt; &gt; just like weights.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, the one =\r\nproblem that comes up with nodes is that node-\n&gt; centric \n&gt; &gt; properties ar=\r\ne overspecified by a 4D CPPN because nodes are \n&gt; specified \n&gt; &gt; by only tw=\r\no dimensions (that is, they are points in space rather \n&gt; than \n&gt; &gt; lines).=\r\n  Therefore, you have to set a convention for when to \nread \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; val=\r\nue of a node-centric output and assign it to a node.  For \n&gt; example, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nyou could say that the node at x1 y1 is set to the value of the \n&gt; node \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; output only when x2 y2 are both zero.  Of course there are many \n&gt; &gt; alte=\r\nrnative ways it could be done, but some convention must be \n&gt; set.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n will try to do the following.. the CPPN will have 2 more \noutputs, \n&gt; that=\r\n will specity the time constant and bias of THE SECOND node, \n&gt; (x2,y2) .. =\r\nI think this shouldn&#39;t hurt performance.. But I guess \nit \n&gt; will take some=\r\n trial and error. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
