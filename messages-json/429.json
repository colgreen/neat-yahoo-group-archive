It&#39;s true that the\n&gt; encoding that I used in\n&gt; my papers and software is direct, but (Derek can\n&gt; correctly me if I&#39;m\n&gt; wrong) I think Derek is anticipating in the future\n&gt; being able to\n&gt; change the encoding without having to write an\n&gt; entirely new system, \n&gt; thereby eventually getting indirect versions of\n&gt; NEAT.\n\nYes...that&#39;s exactly right.  It may be the case that\nin a variation of NEAT (like Joseph&#39;s) a single gene\nencodes for a group of neurons and connections, or\nencodes for a rule about how to construct a neural\nnetwork.  Or, as Ken pointed out, NEAT can\ntheoretically encode for phenotypes other than neural\nnetworks.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
