It&#39;s true it&#39;s practically verbatim the kind of thing I&#39;ve been =\r\ntalking about.  I love the sanctimonious voice of authority proclaiming, &quot;A=\r\n scientifically rigorous analysis must be given!&quot;  It sounds almost like a =\r\ndirective passed down from from the emperor of GECCO.

That&#39;s great that IEEE picked it up so fast, but I&#39;=\r\nm not surprised they like it. All the attention shows there&#39;s something int=\r\nuitively appealing that feels natural about this domain. Maybe it could als=\r\no succeed on Slashdot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks Ken. Since the IEEE post, t=\r\nhe video has gone viral (ish). NBC did a story on it (http://goo.gl/OJldm) =\r\nand it was on the front page of BuzzFeed, reddit/r/science, and even Youtub=\r\ne&#39;s &quot;most popular videos&quot; page. So far it&#39;s received 68,500 views in around=\r\n 48 hours. It&#39;s been fun to watch people get so excited about this sort of =\r\nwork. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It would be great if it got Slashdotted. I have been hoping=\r\n it might happen on its own, but if it doesn&#39;t we may try to submit somethi=\r\nng early next week. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also wanted to make a slightly more contr=\r\noversial point of praise, which I hope you don&#39;t mind, but one of my favori=\r\nte parts of the paper is this:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Because it is notoriously diff=\r\nicult to quantify attributes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as &quot;impressiveness&quot; and &quot;complexity=\r\n&quot;, we make no effort\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do so here. Instead, we attempt to visually r=\r\nepresent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the interesting diversity of morphologies and behaviors that=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolved once evolution was provided with more materials\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a =\r\nsophisticated encoding.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I really appreciated the open acknowl=\r\nedgment of the potential pretense of these kinds of measures. Given the rec=\r\nognition this paper is already receiving, it&#39;s nice to see that sometimes p=\r\neople can agree that something is interesting simply by looking at it rathe=\r\nr than through a mysterious quantification that no one really understands. =\r\n(Although of course that doesn&#39;t mean measuring something is always bad eit=\r\nher, but it does tend to be overemphasized in many cases.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank=\r\ns. I agree. But, as you&#39;ve said many times, reviewers don&#39;t like evaluating=\r\n subjective things on their own, and they lean on p-values and demand meani=\r\nngless quantitative comparisons because they are uncomfortable not having a=\r\nn excuse to accept/reject a paper. I love quantitative measures and p-value=\r\ns when they help, but I think it is unfortunate that many reviewers think t=\r\nhat they are *necessary* for publication. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I actually submitted an=\r\nother paper to GECCO that was rejected that was similar to this work in tha=\r\nt it showed interesting visual results, but did not attempt to force a quan=\r\ntification or experimental comparison that would have been uninformative. T=\r\nhe response? A rejection, with comments like this one:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;The paper =\r\nis grammatically well written, and organized. There are many illustrations =\r\nshowing the a variety of evolved results. They all look very impressive, an=\r\nd the system certainly seems to have promise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, there=\r\n is absolutely no empirical analysis included in the paper to support this =\r\nresearch. Therefore, this paper is not suitable for academic publication in=\r\n its current form. A scientifically rigorous analysis must be given, which =\r\nis expected for all scientific papers in evolutionary computation, and GECC=\r\nO in particular. Issues that must be addressed include: evolutionary perfor=\r\nmance; statistical likelihood of solution quality; effects of experimental =\r\nparameters; effects of target models; etc.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I read that I tho=\r\nught: &quot;This is exactly what Ken has been complaining about!&quot; It&#39;s everythin=\r\ng you&#39;ve been saying about reviewers distilled into one comment. They like =\r\nthe ideas and results, and thought the technical advance was impressive and=\r\n new, but because I didn&#39;t present numbers and p-values they rejected it. A=\r\npparently if I had fiddled with the parameters a bit and showed them plots =\r\nand p-vlaues=85which would not have shed any light on the main innovation o=\r\nf the paper=85then they would have had an excuse to accept the paper.

Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morph=\r\nologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to h=\r\nave hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased comp=\r\nlexity is that most work, including Sims&#39;, evolves morphologies composed of=\r\n rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design spa=\r\nce. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been ov=\r\nerly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we tes=\r\nt both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a pow=\r\nerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network =\r\n(CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve=\r\n faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear=\r\n more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more m=\r\naterials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased wi=\r\nth different cost functions without stifling performance, and that organism=\r\ns can be evolved at different levels of resolution. These findings suggest =\r\nthe ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a la=\r\nrge diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results su=\r\nggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPN-encoded soft, mu=\r\nlti-material robots with modern diversity-encouraging techniques could fina=\r\nlly enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than =\r\nthose produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As always,=\r\n please let me know if you have any comments or questions!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n PS.
