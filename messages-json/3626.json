Every individual running its own evolution.. Nah, this is too\n&gt; computationally expensive. I think just human trial-and-error should\n&gt; be enough :) \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psyphiroth.nebu&quot; &lt;psyphiroth.nebu@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Well, do I have to use a GA to determine the appropriate parameters?\n&gt;&gt; I think the network stucture is noly related to output, no matter\n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt; input, is that right? My output pattern is a three column matrix\n&gt; which \n&gt;&gt; has a data range of [-1,1], do you think what parameter values I\n&gt; should \n&gt;&gt; use?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hm. It is hard to tell you why, but.. maybe the population size\n&gt; is \n&gt;&gt;&gt; too small? If the population size is too small and there are many\n&gt;&gt;&gt; species, there is not enough room for mating, I mean the mating\n&gt; pool \n&gt;&gt;&gt; is too small and the space is not searched very efficiently.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
