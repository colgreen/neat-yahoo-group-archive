If there&#39;s some existing code out there, I would probably\n&gt;&gt; just use that but I&#39;d really love to see a Perl NEAT module on CPAN\n&gt;&gt; and would be interested in contributing somehow to help that happen.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have an attempt at a Moose-based version but am only about 60-70%\n&gt;&gt; there working from the windows c++ version. Moose might have too much\n&gt;&gt; overhead but I thought it would be convenient and both easier to\n&gt;&gt; maintain and extend. I&#39;m still something of a Moose noob but it seems\n&gt;&gt; like a good fit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for any information.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ben\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
