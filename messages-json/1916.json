The cat has 16 inputs:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;0-3: Distance to walls in U,R,D,L\n&gt;&gt;4-7: Proximity to mouse in U,R,D,L (-1.0 for no sight)\n&gt;&gt;8-11: Direction heading of mouse is: U,R,D,L (-1.0 or +1.0)\n&gt;&gt;12-15: Measure of how long since walking on tiles in U,R,D,L\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The cat can only see through LOS.  There are five outputs of the cat:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;0 - Move Up\n&gt;&gt;1 - Move Right\n&gt;&gt;2 - Move Down\n&gt;&gt;3 - Move Left\n&gt;&gt;4 - Make Sound\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Are the directions absolute or relative to the cat; i.e., do they map\n&gt;more to north, south, east, west, or to forward, left, right, and\n&gt;backward?  It sounds like the former.  Not sure how much it matters,\n&gt;but that would be a difference between your representation and many\n&gt;other predator/prey representations I&#39;ve seen.  Colin, what was your\n&gt;representation like?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAhh yes, this is another good point. Mine were absolute, that is, the \nagent could not rotate. It has been suggested here before, and it makes \nsense to me, that using an ego-centric agent effectively makes for a \nsimpler problem. This is because an absolute/fixed agent must learn \nbehaviour such as &#39;see mouse, move toward mouse&#39; independently for each \ndirection, but if instead we have &#39;rotate until mouse is ahead&#39; and \n&#39;move toward mouse&#39;, then the agent only has to learn two behaviours \nwhich will work for all of the directions.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how this will effect the ability to memorize where the \nmouse was last seen, since when rotating in physical space the agent \nwill have to perform an equivalent counter-rotation in it&#39;s memory in \norder to maintain the memory of direction correctly. Is this a \nsignificantly more difficult task than the simple recurrent connections \nthat make up the memory of direction in the &#39;fixed&#39; agent?\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
