If they are consonant, they produce a\n&gt; s=\r\ntrong, positive emotion.  If they are dissonant, it produces a \nstrong\n&gt; ne=\r\ngative emotion.  If my theory is correct, it would actually be\n&gt; fairly eas=\r\ny to produce a computer that can experience emotions, \nalbeit\n&gt; ones unique=\r\n to itself.  Easy, that is, once you figure out how to\n&gt; convert the sensor=\r\ny data into a wave function, and how to create\n&gt; memory that works in terms=\r\n of that wave function, and which produces\n&gt; expectations in terms of that =\r\nwave function.
