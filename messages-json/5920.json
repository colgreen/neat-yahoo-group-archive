Jeff&#39;s\npaper shows that, for one=\r\n reason or another, HyperNEAT can exploit\nrandomised geometries, which (I t=\r\nhink) means relationships that exist\nbetween inputs that are not correlated=\r\n in the substrate input geometry. In\nother words, all that is required is t=\r\nhat two inputs (or outputs) are\ncorrelated in some way, they don&#39;t need to =\r\nbe placed next to each other (or\nin some other geometric pattern) in the in=\r\nput/output substrate geometry,\nfor HyperNEAT to exploit the correlations (a=\r\nt least better than FT-NEAT\ncan).

We show that you can simply compare the\n&gt; performance of HyperNEA=\r\nT with the geometrically arranged inputs and then\n&gt; compare it to runs with=\r\n HyperNEAT where you randomize the geometric\n&gt; locations of the inputs. Any=\r\n performance advantage (averaged over many\n&gt; runs) in the geometrically arr=\r\nanged input space runs vs. the randomized\n&gt; runs reveals the extent to whic=\r\nh those geometric relationships help.\n&gt;\n&gt; More to your point, as Ken mentio=\r\nned, I also found that HyperNEAT\n&gt; outcompetes a direct encoding control (F=\r\nixed Topology-NEAT) even when\n&gt; inputs are randomized. That performance gai=\r\nn can either be interpreted as a\n&gt; benefit of generative encodings vs. dire=\r\nct encodings, or it could be that\n&gt; HyperNEAT learns to map its inputs into=\r\n a geometric arrangement in the\n&gt; hidden layer, and then exploits that geom=\r\netry in the hidden layer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Either way, the results suggest that even if =\r\nyou don&#39;t have a good idea\n&gt; for how to geometrically arrange the inputs, H=\r\nyperNEAT will still do better\n&gt; than direct controls. None of that, of cour=\r\nse, answers whether ES-HyperNEAT\n&gt; is better than NonES-HyperNEAT uniquely =\r\nin such situations, aside from the\n&gt; general differences between the two al=\r\ngorithms.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;\n&gt; Visitin=\r\ng Scientist\n&gt; Cornell University\n&gt; jeffclune@...\n&gt; jeffclune.com\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; On Oct 17, 2012, at 8:44 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Oliver, even though the individual depicted in the &quot;Unified Approa=\r\nch&quot;\n&gt; paper does not appear to reflect the symmetry of its inputs and outpu=\r\nts, my\n&gt; guess is that it still benefits from the fact there is some geomet=\r\nry to\n&gt; them.
