As long as you have a decent XML library.\n\nYes...that&#39;s the idea.  If we can all get on the same\npage, we&#39;d easily be able to share XML data, load each\nother&#39;s populations into our implementations, etc.\n \n&gt; Are the XSL style sheets included with your\n&gt; distribution? \n\nYes.  Right now we&#39;ve got five different types of\nstyle sheets:\n\n--One that converts chromosome XML into a spiral\nlayout of the network\n--One that converts network XML into a traditional\nlayer-based layout of the network\n--One that generates a fitness graph from run XML\n--One that generates the # of species in each\ngeneration throughout a run, from run XML\n--A couple that generate the board, pieces, and move\nnumbers for Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku\n\nThese are all part of the distribution.  And in the\nrun.xml, we&#39;ve embedded a reference to the fitness\ngraph XSL style sheet, so that if you open run.xml in\nyour browser during a run, it dynamically refreshes\nthe browser and redraws the SVG output every few\nseconds, so you can see the fitness progress of the\nrun.\n\nAnd speaking of our distribution, we&#39;ve registered on\nSourceForge, and we trying to finally get it uploaded\nto our CVS repository there.  We&#39;ll have a website to\nlink to soon as well.  But anyone who&#39;s interested in\ntaking a look at the rough code, just e-mail me or\nPhilip and we&#39;ll be happy to send it your way. \n\n&gt; I started out using XML to represent the all of the\n&gt; data from a single\n&gt; run, but it turned out to be really bulky. I didn&#39;t\n&gt; even consider piping\n&gt; that information directly into SVG though...\n\nWell, we still would like to be able to persist every\nchromosome from every run...and yeah, that gets very\nbulky very quick.  We looked at some opensource native\nXML databases, but haven&#39;t really bothered with it\nlately.  We&#39;ll probably end up using a SQL database,\nthough.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
