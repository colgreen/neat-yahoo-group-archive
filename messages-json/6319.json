For example, there\n&gt; is a large b=\r\nody of intrinsic motivation/artificial curiosity/developmental\n&gt; robotics w=\r\norks, which instantiate a diversifying search over an agent&#39;s\n&gt; lifetime (i=\r\nnstead of over evolutionary time), like Schmidhuber&#39;s artificial\n&gt; curiosit=\r\ny (http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/interest.html) or Oudeyer&#39;s\n&gt; intelligent a=\r\ndaptive curiosity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, there are some EAs that create many inter-link=\r\ned objectives that\n&gt; allow more complex behaviors to evolve, like the toolb=\r\nox algorithm (\n&gt; http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/AP-Complexity.p=\r\ndf), or a similar\n&gt; experiment in Avida, where evolving complex features re=\r\nquire evolving\n&gt; simpler ones first (\n&gt; http://www.nature.com/nature/journa=\r\nl/v423/n6936/abs/nature01568.html).\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea of multi-objectivization i=\r\ns also related, where in addition to\n&gt; the objective of interest, additiona=\r\nl helper objectives are simultaneously\n&gt; optimized in hopes of making the d=\r\nesired objective more achievable.\n&gt; Jean-Baptiste and Stephane have had som=\r\ne impressive results with using\n&gt; behavioral diversity as a helper objectiv=\r\ne to evolve complex behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is also a large body of open-ended =\r\nevolution research in the alife\n&gt; community that shares with novelty search=\r\n similar goals and inspiration\n&gt; (although with less engineering-focus). Th=\r\ne goal here is to basically set\n&gt; up a simple world where nonspecific compl=\r\nex adaptive behaviors will emerge\n&gt; on their own.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose the under=\r\nlying current that relates all these varied methods is\n&gt; that they are not =\r\ndriven by a single overarching objective. Many take into\n&gt; account that app=\r\nroaching a desired ambitious objective directly is likely\n&gt; to fail, and ap=\r\nproach that objective obliquely or try to identify likely\n&gt; stepping stones=\r\n. Another common thread is the desire to get much more out\n&gt; of a system th=\r\nan you put directly into it.
