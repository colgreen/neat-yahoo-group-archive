This explains why I&#39;m getting \n89 \n&gt; &gt; as a best fitness but I don&#39;t understand why the output signal \nis \n&gt; &gt; not different for each of the 10 calls to SequenceTest.  The \n&gt; &gt; XorEvaluator has more than one pass through the network with \n&gt; &gt; different parameters and doesn&#39;t suffer from the same problem.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can any of you more experienced NEAT users see what I am doing \nwrong \n&gt; &gt; here?\n&gt; \n&gt; I managed to solve the problem.  I made the assumption that as the \n&gt; output signal is between 0 and 1, that the input signals should \nalso \n&gt; be beween 0 and 1.  This is why I divided the number by 10 when \n&gt; setting the value.\n&gt; \n&gt; After removing the divide by 10, the network learned to reach 100 \n&gt; fitness which is what I wanted to achieve.  The only thing still \n&gt; puzzling me is that I&#39;m not sure that I understand why there is a \n&gt; different between dividing the input signal by 10 and not dividing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris Turner\n\n\n\n"}}
