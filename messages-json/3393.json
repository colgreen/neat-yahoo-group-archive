Per=\r\nhaps I should tweak the NEAT parameters or the set of \nactivation functions=\r\n? \n\n- I suggest using a 3D substrate space, where the inputs are located \no=\r\nn a plane, in a grid configuration, and the hidden and outputs are \non sepa=\r\nrate planes behind it. This way is possible to avoid the \nproblem of decidi=\r\nng where to put the hidden and output neurons in a \n2D substrate space.\n\n- =\r\nThe input resoluton has to be extremely high in order to handle \nfingerprin=\r\nts correctly. Something like 100x100 grayscale or above. \nStarting at a low=\r\ner resolution and increasing node density will not \nhelp much, since at the=\r\n lower resolution the fingerprint gets dizzy \nand even a human cannot say w=\r\nhat is it :)\n\n- Such a high resolution means that there should be some very=\r\n good \noptimization method, in order to construct the substrates as quickly=\r\n \nas possible. \n\n- The fitness function should be more complex than just &quot;t=\r\nhis is the \nimage/this is not the image&quot;.. But I can&#39;t think of it.. Do you=\r\n have \nany suggestions? Perhaps something like &quot;I am 10% sure that this is =\r\n\nthe image&quot;? \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstan=\r\nley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, this made me realize, HyperNEAT could potenti=\r\nally be good \n&gt; for fingerprint recognition/classification since it can dea=\r\nl with \n&gt; high resolution inputs and can also do a good job perceiving \n&gt; r=\r\negularities, which means that it can potentially learn to identify \n&gt; an im=\r\nportant feature even if that feature is not always in the same \n&gt; place.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_cherv=\r\nenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know something about this topic, that can be usefi=\r\nl. A \n&gt; fingerprint \n&gt; &gt; is characterized by specific points in it, called =\r\n&quot;minutia&quot;.

Recognizi=\r\nng the general theme, an \nark, \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; whorl and so on? \n&gt; &gt; I believe yo=\r\nu can use neural networks for this, and NEAT in \n&gt; &gt; particular. There are =\r\nsimple visual recognition applications \nbuilt \n&gt; &gt; with NEAT, perhaps you s=\r\nhould check out &quot;ActiveVision.zip&quot; in the \n&gt; &gt; files section, it is in C/C+=\r\n+ and has HyperNEAT implemented, too. \n&gt; &gt; It is very similar to the one in=\r\n ANJI. It is actually just the \n&gt; &gt; same :) This is a good starting point.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But if you want to stick to ANJI for your project, I don&#39;t know, \nI \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; personally hate Java. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Jason Gauci&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Alfin Rusli&quot; &lt;alfin_rusli@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was browsing ar=\r\nound to find a library that can help me with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FINGERPRINT CLASSIFIC=\r\nATION and then I found ANJI.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone have ever tried to use=\r\n ANJI for the same purpose?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am hoping that some=\r\nbody can guide me how to use ANJI to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fingerprint classification=\r\n...
