I have the HyperNEAT code\n&gt; implemented, it&#39;s actually very simple. The problem is that even the\n&gt; HyperNEAT Tic-Tac-Toe player still sucks, and I was kind of implicitly\n&gt; promising a near-optimal player next. It&#39;s funny how sometimes simple\n&gt; domains turn out to be so difficult. If I don&#39;t come up with anything in\n&gt; a few days, I&#39;ll write it up anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be happy to hear suggestions from the group on better ways to\n&gt; coevolve a better player. I&#39;ve been toying around with dual populations\n&gt; where one is O and the other is X, similar to the host-parasite setup I\n&gt; posted at the end of part 2, but no luck so far. The only other ideas I\n&gt; have left are to drastically increase the population size or to add in\n&gt; an optimal opponent with random noise like Fogel did originally. I\n&gt; hesitate to do the latter though, as coevolution is generally a more\n&gt; elegant solution.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n\n"}}
