He had an &quot;eye&quot; move over a\n&gt;shape to identify the shape.  I thought he had uploaded his\n&gt;experiments.cpp file to the files section, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be\n&gt;there now.\n\nIt is still there, in the Files section (shaperecog.zip, at the bottom of\nthe list), and it gave me very good results. I did explain in some detail\nhow the experiment worked in an earlier post: I&#39;ll fish it out if anyone\nwants to see it.\n\nI have done some more fiddling with NEAT since then, incidentally. I had a\nfew goes at seeing if I could get NEAT to evolve a net which could look at a\nsequence of numbers and then generate a program in a simple programming\nlanguage to generate that sequence. Results have not been very promising,\nmainly because I&#39;ve found it difficult to give the network a smooth learning\ncurve. Making improvements early on seems to require quite a leap of\ncomplexity, and I&#39;m not sure how to solve it. I&#39;ll go into more detail\nseparately if anyone&#39;s curious.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
