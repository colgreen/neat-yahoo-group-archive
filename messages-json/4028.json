There are two fundamental things associated wit=\r\nh \nany substrate in 2D/3D. These are node presence and node density. In \nfa=\r\nct, skip the first, it just.. it can be thought of as spatial CPPN \noutput =\r\nwhere the output means the overall node density at that place. \nAnd if the =\r\noutput there is less than 0.2, there are no nodes (sounds \nfamiliar? :)). \n=\r\n\nSo the same connective CPPN is actually capable of representing its \nown s=\r\nubstrate. But this approach would generate too big substrates. \nEven the mo=\r\nst simple CPPNs are able to generate a substrate with \n1000s of nodes and n=\r\now imagine how many connections there could be. \nAnd this is for the simple=\r\nst (!) CPPN. That sounds like a huge waste \nof computational effort, doesn&#39;=\r\nt it? ;) \n\nSo what is needed is a way to restrict the substrate complexity =\r\nfor \nsmall CPPNs. Of course more complex CPPNs can be allowed to generate \n=\r\nmore complex/dense substrates. \n\nThis is actually just like complexificatio=\r\nn. First the major concepts \nare established on a substrate with very low r=\r\nesolution and as the \nCPPNs complexify, the substrate becomes more complex.=\r\n In fact each \nCPPN will generate a substrate based on its complexity (say,=\r\n \nnum_nodes+num_links). Oh I think I mentioned that. \n\nWhat I am thinking i=\r\ns, if we actually allow substrates to evolve, \ndoes this mean that humans c=\r\nannot inject that priory geometric \nknowledge any more? Or only for the inp=\r\nuts/outputs? \n\nIt essentialy becomes like.. like just a good indirect encod=\r\ning. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Hello-\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of you have said that it would be nice if the substrate=\r\n \nconfiguration\n&gt; of HyperNEAT was not pre-defined. What elements of it do =\r\nyou think \nare\n&gt; important to evolve?\n&gt; \n&gt; I can think of at least three op=\r\ntions (am I missing any?)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) The number of hidden layers\n&gt; 2) The numb=\r\ner of hidden nodes per layer\n&gt; 3) The geometric placement of the nodes in e=\r\nvery layer\n&gt; \n&gt; If you think all of them are important, how would you prior=\r\nitize \nthem? In\n&gt; what order would you prefer researchers tackled them? I a=\r\nm just \ncurious what\n&gt; different people think about these questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Universit=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
