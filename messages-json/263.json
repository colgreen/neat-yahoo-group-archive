I have\ntaken note of some of the recommendations. So I will\ngo ahead and set something up and we can make changes\nfrom there. One question I did have though was, how do\nwe want to upload documentation to this site?\nDo we want anyone/everyone to be able to upload ( so\nwe do it via a web interface) Or do we want to log\ninto unix machine and ftp it?  What do you recommend?\nThanks\nRog\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo! Photos - easier uploading and sharing.\nhttp://photos.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
