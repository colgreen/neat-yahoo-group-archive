If you just keep a counter for nodes and a separate \ncounter for connections, everything is taken care of.   You can keep \na list of innovations as well if you want the same connection or \nnode to get the same innovation number in a separate mutation.  None \nof this is very expensive.\n\nThere is the one slight problem of crossover when having two \nconnections with different numbers connecting the same nodes in \ndifferent genomes.  But this is easily taken care of just by \nchecking during crossover if there is already a connection between \nthe two nodes so you don&#39;t have more than one.\n\nThe idea of a massive superhistory, such as John proposes below, \nsounds very expensive in terms of space.  You realize these \npopulations take up a lot of room so if you plan to keep track of \neverything that ever happened and everyone it happened to, that&#39;s a \nvery large record.  It would have to be kept on disk.  On the other \nhand if you have the space, I suppose why not do it.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;From: Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I kind of like the idea. As a substitute for the loss of history \nI was\n&gt; &gt;thinking of storing the generation number at which a connection \nwas \n&gt; &gt;created.\n&gt; \n&gt; I got to thinking, and decided I liked the idea of maintaining \nhistory.  So \n&gt; I&#39;m going to...literally.  I&#39;ll keep a list of genome changes that \nget \n&gt; carried along with the genome as a separate &#39;history&#39; list.  Every \nchange \n&gt; gets an entry in the list.  I&#39;ll even store entries for \ngeneration#/fitness \n&gt; pairs.  When the experiment finishes, you should be able to use \nthat history \n&gt; to recreate the entire history of the genome from the initial \nconfiguration \n&gt; to the final configuration.  Mostly for human use, of course.  \nNEAT itself \n&gt; doesn&#39;t need it.\n&gt; \n&gt; (capturing some thoughts...let me know if you see anything wrong \nwith these \n&gt; ideas)\n&gt; \n&gt; When a new genome is created by mutation, I will copy the old \ngenome first.  \n&gt; That will include its history.  It will then get a new ID.  Which \nwill get \n&gt; an entry in the history list (maybe?).  Then, for each change that \nis made \n&gt; (connection added, node added, weight changed), an entry is made \nin the \n&gt; history list for the organism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Likewise, for a crossover, I will start by copying the genome (and \nhistory) \n&gt; of the more fit parent.  I will create an entry that lists which \ngenome it \n&gt; was crossed with.  And for every change that is made as part of \nthe \n&gt; crossover, an entry is made.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for elitism, they will get copied verbatim.  Even the ID will \nstay the \n&gt; same.  Then I will add an entry in the history indicating that it \nwas copied \n&gt; as an elite organism.  Maybe?  Probably redundant...if you see \nGen#/Fitness \n&gt; entries one after another, you know it was passed from generation \nto \n&gt; generation unchanged.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Anyway this only relates to connections, maintaining consistent \nneuron\n&gt; &gt;IDs seems trickier. When a neuron is added it splits a \nconnection, that\n&gt; &gt;connection has a source and target neuron, but several other \nsplits\n&gt; &gt;could have occured in the past between the same two neurons. How \ndo I\n&gt; &gt;know which neuron my new neuron is equivalent to?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow you...  In order for the unique ID of a \nconnection to \n&gt; be the combination of the neuron ID&#39;s of the neurons it connects, \nit is \n&gt; assumed that the current neuron numbering scheme remain in place.\n&gt; \n&gt; So perhaps you are thinking during the time you are creating the \nnew neuron? \n&gt;   You want to reuse an innovation ID if you are splitting a \nconnection that \n&gt; has been split before, right?  That will impose limits on the way \nthe \n&gt; structure can be built.  But I&#39;m not sure the implications of \nit...let&#39;s \n&gt; see:\n&gt; \n&gt; Start with one input, A, connected to one output, Z\n&gt; Split A-Z and get A-B-Z\n&gt; Re-connect A-Z.  If you try to split that again, you can&#39;t.\n&gt; If you split B-Z, you get B-C-Z, or A-B-C-Z total\n&gt; Connect A-C and split it, and you get A-D-C-Z, so B and D are \nsiblings.\n&gt; Split D-Z, and you get D-E-Z, and C and E are siblings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Drawing it out, it looks like it should work.  However, I suspect \nthat there \n&gt; are structures you can&#39;t create that way.  For example, A-B-Z and \nA-C-Z \n&gt; where C and B are siblings.  The only way you could construct such \na network \n&gt; with this approach is to support removing nodes and/or connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first, that sounds like it increases the search space.  But \nhaving even \n&gt; more accurate identification of equivalent structures will \nactually narrow \n&gt; the search.  Perhaps you have struck on &#39;the best of both worlds.&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; I like it...I&#39;m going to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; My plan is to do XOR first, both a real XOR and a &#39;random fitness&#39; \nversion.  \n&gt; So when that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll let everybody know what the results of \ndoing it \n&gt; this way are, that way nobody else spends any time implementing a \n&gt; potentially dead-end avenue of research.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
