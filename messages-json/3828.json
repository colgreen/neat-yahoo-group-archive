It&#39;s a pretty complicated topic but I think the \n&gt; fu=\r\nndamental issue is that evolutionary computation is effective in \n&gt; part be=\r\ncause it avoids trying to excplicitly assign credit to the \n&gt; separate part=\r\ns of a solution.  So when we move to trying to extract \n&gt; explicit informat=\r\nion about what belongs with what, we are somewhat \n&gt; undoing this implicit =\r\nappeal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, the idea that solutions need some kind of modula=\r\nrity \n&gt; or at least a pattern behind them makes sense.  It&#39;s just the \n&gt; ap=\r\nproach that is the tricky issue.  Have you taken a look at \n&gt; HyperNEAT?
