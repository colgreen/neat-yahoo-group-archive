I would like to understa=\r\nnd\n&gt; your suggestions below more clearly, and your intuitions for them. Ple=\r\nase\n&gt; see my questions below.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would suggest putting such informati=\r\non in a centered locations in their own\n&gt; &gt; layers, or in other dimensions =\r\n(as you suggest)\n&gt; \n&gt; How do these two suggestions differ? When you suggest=\r\n &#39;another layer&#39; isn&#39;t\n&gt; that just shorthand for &#39;another dimension&#39;? For e=\r\nxample, the only way you\n&gt; can have two inputs with the same centering (e.g=\r\n. X=3D0, Y=3D0) would be to have\n&gt; them have different Z dimensions, which =\r\nto me implies another layer (in the\n&gt; geometric representation space).\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Can you give examples your suggestions so I can conceptualize them?\n&gt; \n\nJe=\r\nff, I didn&#39;t explain what I meant very clearly.  By another layer, I meant =\r\na single node that is placed at e.g. a new Z position.  By a dimension, I m=\r\neant a set of nodes placed at a new Z dimension.  For example, something li=\r\nke &quot;health&quot; could be a single node whose activation level represents health=\r\n.  Or you could have five nodes that represent, &quot;poor health,&quot; &quot;not feeling=\r\n good,&quot; &quot;medium health,&quot; etc.  So you could actually turn the data of inter=\r\nest in to a geometric dimension in the substrate.\n\n&gt; More importantly, why =\r\ndo you think centering the nodes but putting them in\n&gt; different layers/dim=\r\nensions is the right way to go (versus just putting them\n&gt; in their own are=\r\na within the pre-existing dimensionality)?\n&gt; \n\nIf you put an arbitrary node=\r\n in a pre-existing area, it implies that somehow the value of that node is =\r\nrelated to the values of the nodes in the surrounding area.  For example, i=\r\nf you have a bunch of knee angles in one row and then &quot;health&quot; in the same =\r\nrow, it implies that health should be treated somehow like a knee angle, wh=\r\nen there is actually no clear connection between health and knee angles.  T=\r\nhe geometry is like a language for describing what is related to what.  So =\r\nseparated something unrelated into a new layer seems like a better idea.\n\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;, and sticking with HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; overall.  It may work well actually =\r\nto make things like health and ammo actual\n&gt; &gt; geometric dimensions.  Howev=\r\ner, you could also let them be single nodes that\n&gt; &gt; are alone in their own=\r\n layers, or in parts of the input layer that are\n&gt; &gt; separated from the res=\r\nt of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have basically the same questions here, as I don&#39;t get=\r\n the difference\n&gt; between these suggestions.\n&gt; \n\nI think I meant basically =\r\nthe same thing here, except I was giving a specific example.  \n\nken\n\n&gt; Sorr=\r\ny if I am just not thinking of something obvious.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, tansey@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; T=\r\nhanks for the clarification.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; As a follow-up, do you have any sug=\r\ngestions on how to handle mixed geometric\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; non-geometric data?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; For instance, if you&#39;re evolving a bot for a FPS, you may have =\r\nsome geometric\n&gt; &gt;&gt; representation of the world. However, there may also be=\r\n other relevant\n&gt; &gt;&gt; information like health or ammo. It seems like there a=\r\nre only three solutions\n&gt; &gt;&gt; right now:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Use regular NEAT and =\r\nlose the regularity of the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Use HyperNEAT and force the healt=\r\nh and ammo information to be represented\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; extra dimensions even=\r\n though they can be handled by a single input node.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. Evolve a HyperN=\r\nEAT agent separately then use its input(s) as secondary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; input(s) to a =\r\nregular NEAT controller.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there a fourth approach?

That is, the left side of the agent is =\r\non the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; side of the agent as the left side of the team, which is =\r\nhow it usually\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; be in the real world.  Nevertheless, you m=\r\nake a good point that the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; substrate\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; could be 3D as an alternati=\r\nve.  There is nothing wrong with doing it that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; way\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and it does =\r\nhave its own advantages.  In fact, we have experimented with\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; both\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; approaches to laying out agents for multiagent learning (although only r=\r\n(x)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is in the GECCO paper), and both are valid.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am working on a project that needs a=\r\n substrate of more than 2\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dimensions.
