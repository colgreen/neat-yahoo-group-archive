Parameters sho=\r\nuld be  \n&gt; explained in detail, for example: Which impact has the parameter=\r\n  \n&gt; Treshold, which impact has WeightRange, etc.? How are the values for  =\r\n\n&gt; each parameter determined, what is taken into account when you set  \n&gt; t=\r\nhe values? There are so many unanswered questions for those who are  \n&gt; new=\r\n to HyperNEAT and I think most people (including me) have a  \n&gt; really grea=\r\nt interest in this topic, but not the time to read (and  \n&gt; understand) all=\r\n the technical papers. So any tutorial should target  \n&gt; beginners and expl=\r\nain things that have become self-evident for  \n&gt; intermediates.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think=\r\n one such &quot;official&quot; tutorial that explains every step in  \n&gt; detail should=\r\n be enough, more will surely follow from the growing  \n&gt; community.\n&gt;\n&gt; Che=\r\ners,\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Andrei, which version of HyperNEAT are you interested in an=\r\nd what  \n&gt; references have you looked at so far? We can potentially improve=\r\n the  \n&gt; documentation based on your comments (and a tutorial is a good  \n&gt;=\r\n idea), but first I want to understand which &quot;comment-less examples&quot;  \n&gt; yo=\r\nu are referring to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note that several experiments with complete sou=\r\nrce code are  \n&gt; available in two existing HyperNEAT releases of which I am=\r\n aware.  \n&gt; These and a variety of publications from several groups are lin=\r\nked  \n&gt; from the HyperNEAT Users Page, which also provides a brief  \n&gt; intr=\r\noduction:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I understand you may have already been through this site and its  \n&gt; as=\r\nsociated software and papers, but I wanted to point it out in case  \n&gt; you =\r\nhad not been aware of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We want to make the algorithm as accessib=\r\nle as possible so your  \n&gt; comments are appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrei&quot; &lt;andrei.rusu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can a=\r\nnyone please recommend some HyperNEAT documentation, a  \n&gt; tutorial, diagra=\r\nm, some clue, or anything that does not mean reverse  \n&gt; engineering the co=\r\nmment-less examples ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
