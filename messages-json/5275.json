Lugt&quot; &lt;janlugt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Jan van =\r\nder Lugt and I am doing some exploratory work together\n&gt; with Evert Haasdij=\r\nk on the parameters used by HyperNEAT (version 2.6). One\n&gt; of my concerns i=\r\ns the ranges for the parameters used by HyperNEAT. Some of\n&gt; them were quit=\r\ne easy to figure out (e.g. the probabilities), but for others\n&gt; I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne the slightest clue about a sensible range. Below are the\n&gt; parameters and=\r\n my ideas about sensible ranges:\n&gt; \n&gt; PopulationSize 120.0 [positive int]\n&gt;=\r\n MaxGenerations 600.0 [positive int]\n\n&gt; DisjointCoefficient 2.0 [?]\n&gt; Exces=\r\nsCoefficient 2.0 [?]\n&gt; WeightDifferenceCoefficient 1.0 [?]\n\nThese are the s=\r\ntandard NEAT compatibility coefficients for the compatibility equation the =\r\ndetermines how far apart two individuals are for the purposes of speciation=\r\n.  In general, the question is how many gene differences are worth an avera=\r\nge distance of 1.0 in weights.  The numbers above say that an average diffe=\r\nrence of 1.0 in weights is like having two genes not shared between the two=\r\n individuals.  That is pretty reasonable.\n\n&gt; FitnessCoefficient 0.0 [?]\n\n&gt; =\r\nCompatibilityThreshold 6.0 [?]\n\nThis parameter relates to the coefficients =\r\nabove.  It can be thought of as, how many genes not shared does it take for=\r\n individuals to be considered in a different species.  However, it is only =\r\nrelevant at the start because the next parameter lets it change.\n\n&gt; Compati=\r\nbilityModifier 0.3 [?]\n\nThis number means the threshold changes at a rate o=\r\nf 0.3 per generation, which is reasonable.  It does not change if the Speci=\r\nesSize Target is already met.\n\n&gt; SpeciesSizeTarget 8.0 1 &lt; x &lt; PopulationSi=\r\nze\n\n&gt; DropoffAge 15.0 [?, probably generations?]\n\nYes, in 15 generations a =\r\nspecies will be penalized if it is not making progress.\n\n&gt; AgeSignificance =\r\n1.0 [?]\n\n&gt; SurvivalThreshold 0.2 [?]\n\nOnly the top 20% of each species is a=\r\nllowed to reproduce.  Controls greediness within species.\n\n&gt; MutateAddNodeP=\r\nrobability 0.03 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateAddLinkProbability 0.05 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; Mutat=\r\neDemolishLinkProbability 0.00 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateLinkWeightsProbability 0.8 =\r\n[0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateOnlyProbability 0.25 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateLinkProbability 0.=\r\n1 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; AllowAddNodeToRecurrentConnection 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; SmallestSpe=\r\nciesSizeWithElitism 5.0 1 &lt; x &lt; PopulationSize\n&gt; MutateSpeciesChampionProba=\r\nbility 0.0 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutationPower 2.5 [?]\n\nMutations of weight go up to =\r\n2.5 in a single mutation.  You wouldn&#39;t want it over 5.0 or so.\n\n&gt; AdultLin=\r\nkAge 18.0 [?]\n&gt; AllowRecurrentConnections 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; AllowSelfRecurren=\r\ntConnections 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ForceCopyGenerationChampion 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; Li=\r\nnkGeneMinimumWeightForPhentoype 0.0 [?, spelling error?]\n&gt; GenerationDumpMo=\r\ndulo 10.0 [?]\n&gt; RandomSeed -1.0 [positive int, -1 for random]\n&gt; ExtraActiva=\r\ntionFunctions 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; AddBiasToHiddenNodes 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; SignedAc=\r\ntivation 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ExtraActivationUpdates 9.0 [?]\n&gt; OnlyGaussianHidde=\r\nnNodes 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ExperimentType 15.0 [0, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16=\r\n, 24, 26]\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone can (partially) complete this list, I would be ver=\r\ny grateful! I\n&gt; don&#39;t need detailed explanations for each parameter, just s=\r\nome sensible\n&gt; ranges (ideally not too big) where good values might lie.\n&gt; =\r\n\n\nJason Gauci should also be able to comment on other variables that I didn=\r\n&#39;t cover.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
