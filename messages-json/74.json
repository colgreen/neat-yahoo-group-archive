At the outset, DNA will be small, rule sets will be small, and they\nwould complexify incrementally.\n\n&gt; If that&#39;s it, I take it the main innovation here is not always\n&gt; starting from a single canonical symbol?  It does sound interesting.\n\nThe resulting phenotype, probably, will still start out as one &quot;cell&quot; or\nwhatever is analogous in NNs. Then the developmental system will read\nthrough the genetic information in that cell, interpret it according to\nits rules, and perform whatever operations, until the end of the\ndevelopment phase.\n\nI haven&#39;t really worked any of this out, its just an idea floating around\nmy notes.\n\nThe interesting aspect, I think, is the decoupling of the &quot;hardware&quot; for\ndevelopment (embryogenic system), and the &quot;software&quot; (genetic data).\nMost of the work I&#39;ve looked at has the developmental system encoded\nin the genetic information and applied to a basic phenotype.\n\nThough truly this really can&#39;t be called an innovation since biology has\nbeen doing it much longer than I have.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
