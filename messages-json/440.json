The problem is\n&gt;that you are going to come up against considerable noise if you start\n&gt;taking different random samples.  Of course, in the limit evolution\n&gt;can theoretically sort through that noise, but in practice a great\n&gt;deal of noise can be insurmountable.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDefinitely agree with this. If you don&#39;t compare against a stable set of \nsamples then some genomes will receive a good evaluation by chance (and \nvisa versa). This then will send the search down misleading avenues thus \ndecreasing the efficiency of the search, which is precisely what you&#39;re \ntrying to avoid!\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
