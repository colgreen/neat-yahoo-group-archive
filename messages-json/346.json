Of all the defs they had there this\nseemed the most applicable:\n\n&quot;Change in the genetic composition of a population during successive\ngenerations, as a result of natural selection acting on the genetic variation\namong individuals, and resulting in the development of new species.&quot;\n\nMost of the other definiions included some form of &quot;change for the better&quot; or\n&quot;increasing complexity&quot;, so it sounds like it implies something more than\nrandom change.\n\n&gt; Granted,\n&gt; there are cases where there is only random selection,\n&gt; and hence genetic drift is the only source of gene\n&gt; frequency change\n\nIt&#39;s a trivial point, but is random selection still selection?  Is there any\ndifference between not having a fitness function, and having a random fitness function?\n\n=====\n----------\nPhilip D.
