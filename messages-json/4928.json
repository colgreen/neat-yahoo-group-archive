NERO isn&#39;t build with HyperNEAT, but I think my questions target Hyper=\r\nNEAT as well as NEAT.\n\nConsider 9 stages:\n\nNetwork is ...\n\n  1: quite good =\r\nin task #1\n  2: really good in task #1\n  3: perfect in task #1\n  4: quite g=\r\nood in task #2\n  5: really good in task #2\n  6: perfect in task #2\n  7: qui=\r\nte good in task #1 and #2\n  8: really good in task #1 and #2\n  9: perfect i=\r\nn task #1 and #2\n\nObviously I&#39;ll begin with stage 1, but what&#39;s next? Shoul=\r\nd I continue to train my network in this task (continue with stage 2) or sh=\r\nould I switch to the next task (stage 4/7) and come back to stage 2 later.\n=\r\nThe next question is: How should I calculate the fitness when the network i=\r\ns trained in task #2.  Should solutions for task #2 be rewarded higher than=\r\n those for task #1 (stage 4) or should solutions for task #1 still get the =\r\nsame reward as in stage 1 (stage 7)?\n\nMaybe there&#39;s no general answer to my=\r\n questions, but what&#39;s the best practice? What makes sense, what does not?\n=\r\n\nCheers,\nDaniel\n\n\n"}}
