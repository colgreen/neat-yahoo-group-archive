Are you saying that there is\n&gt; no fitness function?\n&gt; If fitness evaluation were random, then no, there is\n&gt; not really anything\n&gt; you can call &quot;evolution&quot; There is genetic drift, but\n&gt; its basically\n&gt; brownian motion around the centroid of the starting\n&gt; genetic material\n&gt; (depending on how you structure crossover and\n&gt; mutations).\n\nWell actually the most widely-accepted definition of\nevolution is simply a change in the frequency of genes\nin a population.  Evolution is not inherently\ndirectional; it is simply change.\n\nAnd change could easily be demonstrated in NEAT\nwithout a fitness function.  Given a population of 100\nindividuals, 20% could simply be randomly selected to\nproduce offspring via the NEAT mating method, which\nwould then be subject to NEAT&#39;s mutation operators,\nrefilling the population to its original size.  20%\ncould then be randomly selected to survive into the\nnext generation...and so on.\n\nEven with no fitness function, the population will\nevolve.  That is, the gene frequencies of the final\ngeneration will be different from the original\npopulation (just how different will depend on\nparameter settings, such as mutation rates).\n\nAnd that&#39;s all evolution is.  No intent.  No\ndirection.\n\nOf course, for our purposes, we want the change to go\nin a particular direction, to optimize a particular\nbehavior or set of behaviors, and we try to tailor a\nfitness function that we think best captures the\nfeatures of those behaviors.  We&#39;re interested in\ndirectional change.\n\nBut strictly speaking, biological evolution is not.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
