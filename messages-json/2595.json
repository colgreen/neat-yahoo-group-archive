Because a local minimum can easily now be large enough to \nswallow a whole population.\n\n\tCrossover gives you parallel exploration of loosely linked parts of \nthe problem.  e.g. if one is trying to evolve a &quot;splat nerdler&quot; then \ncrossover provides a way to combine &quot;splat-47&quot;, &quot;splat-48&quot; and \n&quot;splat-26385&quot; with &quot;nerdler-A&quot;, &quot;nerdler-B&quot; and \n&quot;nerdler-XP-professional&quot; without having to evolve all 9 combinations \nindividually.\n\n\tOTOH we may need fully functional modularity before we can see the \nreal power of that...\n\n\tLocal minima may be less of a problem than we think, \nhowever.  Intuitively, people think of the fitness landscape as just \nthat, a landscape.  With all of 2.5 dimensions.  Typical fitness \nspaces are 10, 100, or even 10,000 dimensional.  And it seems to me \nthat one feature of these highly dimensional spaces is that there is \nmuch less chance of there actually being a minimum than in our \ndimnsionally-challenged world.\n\n\tConsider, to be a minimum, a point must be up-hill in _every_ \ndirection you can step away from it.  Lets say that in 2D there are 8 \ndirections you can step away from a point, so with simple stats we \ncould say that the chance of any point on the surface being a minimum \nis 1 in 256...\n\n\tIn 3D there are 26 ways to step away from a point means chance of \nminimum is 1 in 2^26 = 1 in 67,000,000-ish\n\n\tIn 10 D, there are 2 ^ 59048 ways to step away from a point.  And my \nwindows calculator confidently assert that that leaves the chance at \n1 in 1.6564714947473066827641241827646e+17775 (dunno whether to \nbelieve it be the take home message is &quot;1 in big&quot;).\n\n\tAnd that&#39;s before even considering crossover, whose whole effect is \nto increase the number of ways of leaving a point, so...\n\n\tWhat we begin to see here is that the numbers involved in these \nsearches are so vast, that it is quite possible to imagine that a \npopulation could pause for ages in an apparent local minimum, when \nthere actually is a path of improvements away from its current \nlocation, it just takes a very long time before any mutations hit \nthat path, because the path is something silly like 1 / 2^1000 of the \ntotal possible local points...\n\n\tHuman intuition fails here, because we cannot imagine standing in a \nlandscape where there is so much sheer &quot;angle&quot; around us that we \ncannot merely cast an eye over it and immediately see which way is \ndown (up... , better).\n\n\tBut in higher dimensions that is exactly the sort of thing that can \nhappen.  There can be as much space _adjoining_ one point as we would \nusually think of as finding on a whole landscape...\n\n\tFood for thought.\n\n\t\tIan\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
