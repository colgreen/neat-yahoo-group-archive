That appears to\nbe a strength, but to my mind only because the the dimensionality of the\nmaze is severely limited. If the search was to be conducted in a 8\ndimensional maze instead, NFF would fill up it&#39;s &quot;previous novel solution&quot;\nrepository real fast but still be getting nowhere.\n\nKen, you state that since the agent has a limited amount of time to live,\nsearching of dead area will end quickly since evolution will only search\nfor a limited time in any one direction. This is true, except that if\nthere are one more dimension, the area (volume actually) to search is\nradically increased. And if there are two more dimensions, the area\n(what&#39;s the name for m^4?) positively explodes. Thus even searching\nrelatively close to the starting position will result in vast amounts of\ntests. And without any indication which route is better, searching of this\nhypercube (in the 4 dimension example) would go on for a very long time.\nAny tangent would be equally viable, no matter whether they be actually\nbetter or not.\n\nI&#39;m not saying a regular fitness function would perform better, it would\nfail miserably just as well. This simply isn&#39;t a problem that evolution is\nwell adapted to solving - if there is no series of small incremental steps\nthat bring you measurably (measured via fitness) closer to the goal, then\nyou&#39;re toast. Small reversals in fitness can be handled by none-elitist\nmethods (speciation etc), but not large ones.\n\nProblem 2, closing doorways that cannot be opened;\nI&#39;d guess that the one time out of 40 that the NFF failed, it started\nearly to investigate a deep alley in the maze that brought it very close\nto the actual goal, but then the population shifted away from that alley\nand investigated another part of the maze instead. At that point, that\nparticular alley is blocked for further investigation - there&#39;s a big gulf\nof no fitness improvements to traverse that&#39;s simply so deep that nothing\ncan make it across (evolve across) without being killed off due to the\nfact that that part of the novelty space had already been investigated\n(partially, but that&#39;s unknowable to the NFF). \n\nTo explain it in a simpler scenario. Say you have two corridors, one\nleading left for 8 units and one leading right for 16 units, where the\ngoal actually is. Evolution starts going right (actually towards the goal,\nbut that&#39;s invisible to the MFF) and it reaches 10 units, when it randomly\ndiscovers a nice area to the left to investigate. All resources are\nshifted to the left area but that way lies a dead end. At that point, when\nthe dead end is reached, evolution is stuck with the fact that there is\nabsolutely NO fitness gradient to climb at all, because further evolution\nto the left is penalized because the area has been exhaustively searched,\nand to the right, there&#39;s a great gulf of also searched area, beyond which\nthe goal lies.\n\nThe larger the maze and the more of these limiting doorways there are, the\ngreater the chance that one of them will be blocked off by prematurely\nshifting focus.\n\nSorry to be such a downer, raining on your parade and all that. There\nmight be situations where this method works wonders, but to be a panacea,\nfurther thinking is, to my mind, required.\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
