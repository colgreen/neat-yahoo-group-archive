As you may have gathered from my \nother posts, I&#39;m interesting in anything that combines evolving components \ninto modular frameworks.\n\n\tI&#39;m a bit puzzled about how the networks placed stones.  If the game \nconsisted of placing 5 stones, was the network reset between placing one \nstone and the next?  Or were the 5 placed stones just the 5 highest outputs \ntaken from a single evaluation of the framework?\n\n\tPresumably placed stones appeared as 1&#39;s or -1&#39;s in the input just like \nthe setup ones?  Since the latter can be used for scoring, but the former \nnot, how did the networks distinguish between them?  (obviously this would \nonly matter if the stones were placed one at a time)\n\n\tIf a stone could be placed touching two of the originals, how did that score?\n\n\tI assume that the mapping of board-locations to inputs is entirely \nanonymous.  e.g. there&#39;s nothing in the system that provides any hint that \n(1,2) is close to (2,2) or that (1,2) and (2,2) have the same relationship \nas (2,4) and (3,4)...  Presumably with the framework&lt;-&gt;module mapping, you \nhope to see reuse of the same module on different areas of the board.  If I \nam right in my assumption just here, then this would require multiple \ncoordinated mutations (to map the inputs to another area of the same \nshape).  Isn&#39;t that putting rather a low-probability obstacle in the \nway?  Did you do any analysis to reveal reuse where the same module is \nmapped in the same way to different locations?  e.g. Fixed width font \nrequired, numbers represent the position of a network&#39;s inputs on the board:\n\n-1---\n243--\n-5---\n-----\n-----\n\ntranslated:\n\n-----\n--1--\n-243-\n--5--\n-----\n\nand/or rotated:\n\n-2---\n541--\n-3---\n-----\n-----\n\n\tDid you consider letting the framework specify that one network&#39;s input be \ntaken from another&#39;s outputs?  I can&#39;t remember now whether you were \npermitting recurrence in the networks.  Even if you were, you would \nprobably want to forbid it _between_ networks, but feeding one networks \noutput into another would allow one network to encapsulate a low-level \nconcept (like &quot;stone is isolated&quot;) and be used by a higher-level \nnetwork.  Actually, this is probably more advanced than required by your game.\n\n\tIan B\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
