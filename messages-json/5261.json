This\nis a fully functional release that is made available i=\r\nn order to\nhighlight any defects before issuing the code as an official ver=\r\nsion\n2.0\n\nFeatures:\n   * Parallel execution. Concurrent genome decoding and=\r\n genome\nevaluation, also concurrent speciation by k-means clustering.\nImple=\r\nmented using Parallel Extensions (built-in to .Net 4, available\nas a separa=\r\nte library for compiling within Mono).\n   * Support for both NEAT and Hyper=\r\nNEAT/CPPNs.\n   * Generic framework classes with high level of abstraction a=\r\nnd\ntherefore flexibility and reusability in both NEAT and non-NEAT\nprojects=\r\n.\n   * Flexible XML configuration.\n   * XML IO for genomes and populations.=\r\n\n   * Problem domains -\n         o Logical XOR.\n         o Binary 3-multipl=\r\nexer, 6-multiplexer & 11-multiplexer.\n         o Function regression - sin(=\r\nx), sin(x^2) & multiplication\n(with visualization).\n         o Boxes Visual=\r\n Discrimination (with visualization). (see\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publicat=\r\nions/2009/stanley.alife09.html)\n         o Prey Capture (with visualization=\r\n).\n         o Single Pole Balancing\n         o Double Pole Balancing (and v=\r\nariants)\n\n   * Speciation by k-means clustering (Single thread and parallel=\r\n\nversions). To my knowledge this is the first NEAT implementation to\nuse th=\r\nis approach and as such this code is experimental. Results so\nfar have been=\r\n positive.\n   * Complexity Regulation (previously known as phased pruning).=\r\n\n   * GUI for modifying experiment parameters, controlling the\nexecution of=\r\n the evolution algorithm and visualization of genomes and\nproblem domains.\n=\r\n\n\nCheers,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
