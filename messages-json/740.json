The reason for this is that it is easier to search in \n&gt; small spaces.  \n\nRight...but if networks in your final generation contain redundant \nor unnecessary topology, then those features have been accumulating \nthroughout the search.  Thus, the search has been less efficient \nthan it could have been, right?\n\n&gt; Search is the big deal here, i.e. can you find what you need in a\n&gt; practical amount of time?   For that, topology matters *throughout \n&gt; the\n&gt; run*.  And not because a large topology takes more time to execute,\n&gt; but rather because a large topology means a high-dimensional search\n&gt; space, which means more search will be necessary. \n\nWell, both are an issue, aren&#39;t they?  And both are unwanted.  I \nfully understand that intermediate topologies are just as important \nas final ones.  The point is, it seems highly unlikely that if you \nhave a network in the final generation that has 30% useless \ntopology, that all that unnecessary topology was mutated in the last \ncouple of generations.  It was accruing *throughout* the run, so \nthis does affect the overall performance of the run.\n\nSo it seems to me that you can&#39;t logically separate the end result \nfrom the evolving topologies.  If there&#39;s waste at the end, there \nwas waste throughout.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
