Consequently, several researchers used Genetic Algorithms to\n&gt;evolve\n&gt; &gt; partial aspects of neural networks, such as the weights, the\n&gt;thresholds, and\n&gt; &gt; the network architecture. Indeed, over the last decade many\n&gt;systems have\n&gt; &gt; been developed that perform total network induction. In this work\n&gt;it is\n&gt; &gt; shown how the chromosomes of Gene Expression Programming can be\n&gt;modified so\n&gt; &gt; that a complete neural network, including the architecture, the\n&gt;weights and\n&gt; &gt; thresholds, could be totally encoded in a linear chromosome. It is\n&gt;also\n&gt; &gt; shown how this chromosomal organization allows the\n&gt;training/adaptation of\n&gt; &gt; the network using the evolutionary mechanisms of selection and\n&gt;modification,\n&gt; &gt; thus providing an approach to the automatic design of neural\n&gt;networks. The\n&gt; &gt; workings and performance of this new algorithm are tested on the\n&gt; &gt; 6-multiplexer and on the classical exclusive-or problems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Does that sound at all familiar?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Ian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms -\n&gt; &gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
