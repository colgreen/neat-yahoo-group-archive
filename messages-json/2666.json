My evaluation routine is\ncompletely consistent -- I have 500 test cases with expected results 0 or 1\nand my fitness per individual is 1 - (abs(expectedValue - outputValue)) so\nthe best possible fitness is 500.\n\nI do not expect you to debug this but in case it does catch your interest I\nhave included the relevant files.

For example, the\nattributes might be\nSNP locations and the values are either 1, 2, or 3 meaning homozygous\nallele1,\nheterozygous allele1 and allele2, and homozygous allele2 respectively.\nDatafile url is relative to the location of the SharpNeat.exe\nfile.&lt;/description&gt;\n\t&lt;assemblyUrl&gt;SharpNeatExperiments.dll&lt;/assemblyUrl&gt;\n\t&lt;typeName&gt;SharpNeatLib.Experiments.GenotypeToPhenotypeExperiment&lt;/typeName&gt;\n\t&lt;experimentParameters&gt;\n\t\t&lt;dataFileRelativePath&gt;GenotypeToPhenotypeExperiment/Atrial\nfibrillation.txt\n\t\t&lt;/dataFileRelativePath&gt;\n\t&lt;/experimentParameters&gt;\n&lt;/experiment&gt;\n\nThe attachments are two zipped folders: one is the src files which belongs\nin src/Experiments/SharpNEATExperiments and the other is the dataFile which\nshould be placed in the same  folder as the SharpNEAT.exe\n\n\nI will let you know if I figure out how the most fit species is being lost.\n\nThanks,\n\nPeter\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com]On Behalf Of Colin\nGreen\nSent: Thursday, July 13, 2006 6:01 PM\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [neat] Loss of most fit species in SharpNEAT?\n\n\npetervermont wrote:\n\n&gt;I have noticed that my best fitness sometimes declines.\n&gt;\n&gt;While I can sort of understand this if I have enabled &#39;pruning&#39;, it\n&gt;also occurs even when I disable pruning.\n&gt;\n&gt;I suspected that in long runs, my most fit individual was stagnant and\n&gt;stopped improving its fitness and therefore was being killed when\n&gt;&#39;Species Dropoff Age&#39; was exceeded. To counteract this, I set the\n&gt;Species Dropoff age to an absurdly large number to effectively disable\n&gt;it but the most fit individual still was eventually killed and my best\n&gt;fitness declined.\n&gt;\n&gt;Since I have the very nice feature &#39;Save Genome On Improvement&#39;\n&gt;enabled I guess I don&#39;t mind terribly since clearing out species which\n&gt;have stopped improving makes way for other explorations.\n&gt;\n&gt;Have other people noticed this? Do you consider a bug or a feature?\n&gt;How could I avoid this if I chose to?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nOk two points to start with:\n\n1) SharpNEAT will always preserve the species with the best genome, even\nif it has reached the drop-off age.\n2) Pruning isn&#39;t really a factor, if pruning away structure results in\nall of the offspring being less fit then the elite genomes will survive\nthrough to the next generation. This combined with point (1) means that\nelite genomes can survive indefinitely if necessary and therefore you\nshould not see the best fitness fall.\n\nThere is however one scenario I know of that can result in the best\nfitness falling, and that is if an inconsistent evaluation scheme is\nbeing used. In fact I&#39;m running just such an experiment right now - I\nhave some share/stock trading data and I evaluate genomes (each\nrepresenting a trading strategy) over the data, this normally means that\na genome will always give exactly the same fitness score. However, in\norder to improve robustness of the evolved genomes I introduce some\nnoise into the trading data, this means that a given genome&#39;s fitness\ncan actually change from generation to generation. So typically the best\ngenome will be re-evaulated over and over again and may give slightly\ndifferent results each time. Now if that varation is large enough then\nanother genome (or species) may temporarily become the best, causing the\nprevious champ to be lost - or in the case of a species the species&#39; age\nmay now be tested against the drop-off threshold causing the whole\nspecies to be culled.\n\nYou can alleviate this problem by maintaining an average score for each\ngenome as they are re-evaluated. I currently do this and although it\ndoesn;t rpevent the best fitness from falling it does help. You can\nfurther allieviate the problem by configuring sharpneat to preserve a\nlarge proportion of each species on each generation, this is the\n&#39;elitism proportion&#39; setting on the second tab page.\n\nThese aren&#39;t 100% solutions but I find them acceptible for my own\nexperiments right now. In fact I don&#39;t even adjust the elitism\nproportion, but maybe you want to try it.\n\nIf you think about the natural world then the problem is lesser because\npopulations sizes are (normally) so much larger, so good combinations of\ngenomes are going to be surving out there somewhere in some\nsub-population. Also disabling genes rather than deleting them might\nalso help, that way any good combinations are more likely to re-emerge\nin the future. I think Ken&#39;s NEAT disabled genes but I took the very\nsimple approach of deleting them.\n\nI hope some of that helps,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006D_01C6A73F.DEF25700\r\nContent-Type: application/x-zip-compressed;\n\tname=&quot;GenotypeToPhenotype.zip&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;GenotypeToPhenotype.zip&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006D_01C6A73F.DEF25700\r\nContent-Type: application/x-zip-compressed;\n\tname=&quot;GenotypeToPhenotypeExperiment.zip&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;GenotypeToPhenotypeExperiment.zip&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006D_01C6A73F.DEF25700--\r\n\n"}}
