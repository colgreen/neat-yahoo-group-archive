Repeat\n&gt; until you get a champion that consistently gets 100% on the 100 test\n&gt; samples. \n\nWell, that&#39;s similar to what we&#39;re trying.  We evolve a population\nwhere there&#39;s an indivudal that gets 100% on a small evaluation\nset...then we halve the population and double the evaluation set. \nWe&#39;ve tried it a bit this weekend, and it does seem to be working\nreasonably well.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
