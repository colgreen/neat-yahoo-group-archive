His version was pretty much feature-complete as of last  \n&gt; summer, though I haven&#39;t heard anything from him in a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve personally coded up a very general NEAT framework in python, but  \n&gt; I never got around to adding the module for neural networks. My goal  \n&gt; was basically to abstract away all of the GA code so I could focus on  \n&gt; different representations (of which I&#39;ve written several, including a  \n&gt; complexifying GRN, which is similar to NEAT). Anyway if you&#39;re  \n&gt; interested, the code is fairly well commented (compared to my last  \n&gt; endeavor :P), and I have stubs completed for adding the remaining  \n&gt; NEAT bits as a representation, so basically all you&#39;d have to do is  \n&gt; code up the neural network side. I could also write up a blurb about  \n&gt; how to add a new representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway message me if you&#39;re interested; it might be easier than  \n&gt; starting from scratch.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jul 5, 2005, at 5:27 PM, Thomas B wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I came across mention of Karl Lewin and his work, but his links such\n&gt; &gt; as http://www.wooleyrhino.com/pyn.html are down.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas B&quot; &lt;tomb@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking for NEAT implemented in Python.
