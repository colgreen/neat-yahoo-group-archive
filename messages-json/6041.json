I think you raise a very interesting que=\r\nstion about the degree of regularity in these creatures. Of course, I don&#39;t=\r\n speak for the authors but one thing I&#39;m sure you also noticed is the compl=\r\netely disorganized and amorphous directly-encoded individual in figure 7.  =\r\nCompared to that, it&#39;s clear even here the CPPNs are having a significant o=\r\nrganizing effect on these overall morphologies.\n\nNevertheless, it&#39;s still a=\r\nn interesting question why these creatures aren&#39;t even more regular, so I w=\r\nanted to throw out a hypothesis:  It&#39;s speculation at this point, but I wou=\r\nld guess part of the effect seen here is the &quot;objective paradox&quot; caused by =\r\nrewarding them only for walking farther.  That kind of very explicit object=\r\nive encourages piecewise kind of improvement, i.e. if I add some idiosyncra=\r\ntic element to my body and it makes me just a bit faster, that element will=\r\n get rewarded and tacked on to my lineage forever.  In addition, if I disco=\r\nver some kind of overarching regularity like bilateral symmetry, it will no=\r\nt be retained unless it immediately significantly improves my gait.   So I&#39;=\r\nd speculate that you&#39;d see more regularity with some kind of behavioral and=\r\n/or morphological diversity pressure (like novelty search, novelty search w=\r\nith local competition, or some kind of multiobjectivization like MOLE) rath=\r\ner than just pushing only for faster and faster walkers, because diversity =\r\npressures can reward and hold onto overall changes in organization even if =\r\nthey don&#39;t immediately lead to improvements in ambulation.  Of course, the =\r\nauthors acknowledge this issue themselves in their discussion as well, so i=\r\nt&#39;s clearly already on their minds, but certainly interesting to look at in=\r\n the future.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek&quot; &lt;djames@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Congrats on the paper and the interest it&#39;s generated, Jeff. =\r\nCool stuff!\n&gt; I&#39;ve been focused on game development for mobile the last few=\r\n years, but\n&gt; I&#39;m dipping my feet back into evolutionary algorithms researc=\r\nh lately.\n&gt; I&#39;m also working on evolving virtual creatures (I&#39;m using jMonk=\r\neyEngine\n&gt; for my 3D graphics/physics engine and it&#39;s working quite well), =\r\nso this\n&gt; stuff has been on my mind a lot.\n&gt; I think using materials with d=\r\nifferent physical properties and a\n&gt; generative encoding are both significa=\r\nnt steps in advancing this line of\n&gt; research. However, I have to admit bei=\r\nng a little disappointed at the\n&gt; types of morphologies that you evolved. T=\r\nhe 2D products of CPPNs often\n&gt; exhibit a high degree of symmetry. Maybe it=\r\n&#39;s the camera angles on the\n&gt; videos, but I didn&#39;t see a very high degree o=\r\nf symmetry in your\n&gt; phenotypes. You say your CPPN implementation used Gaus=\r\nsian functions.\n&gt; Did you have many phenotypes that exhibited strong bilate=\r\nral symmetry?\n&gt; Most of the phenotypes you demo are very interesting, but t=\r\nhey seem like\n&gt; very cobbled, amorphous body plans, rather than individuals=\r\n that exhibit\n&gt; a high degree of symmetry and modularity. In many cases, th=\r\ney also seem\n&gt; top-heavy, with quite a few extra voxels that don&#39;t seem to =\r\nbe\n&gt; contributing much to the locomotion strategy.\n&gt; In your paper I don&#39;t =\r\nthink you come right out and say it explicitly,\n&gt; but you seem to imply tha=\r\nt your critters are more naturalistic than\n&gt; Sims&#39; or work since then. The =\r\nuse of pliable elements does lend to a\n&gt; perception of naturalism, but to m=\r\ne they honestly seem about as close to\n&gt; naturally-occurring organisms as m=\r\nost of Sims&#39;:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DJBgG_VSP7f8\n&gt; &lt;http://www.=\r\nyoutube.com/watch?v=3DJBgG_VSP7f8&gt;\n&gt; When I watch videos of his evolved mor=\r\nphologies, especially swimmers,\n&gt; they subjectively seem like primitive org=\r\nanisms, even though they&#39;re\n&gt; composed entirely of rigid body parts.\n&gt; I ho=\r\npe this isn&#39;t coming across as too negative...I do like the work and\n&gt; thin=\r\nk it is a great contribution.

One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity\n&gt; is t=\r\nhat most work, including Sims&#39;, evolves morphologies composed of\n&gt; rigid el=\r\nements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design\n&gt; space. A s=\r\necond hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have\n&gt; been overly =\r\nregular, not allowing complex regularities with variation.\n&gt; Here we test b=\r\noth hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple\n&gt; materials and a powe=\r\nrful generative encoding called a compositional\n&gt; pattern-producing network=\r\n (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion\n&gt; speed. We find that CPPNs evo=\r\nlve faster robots than a direct encoding\n&gt; and that the CPPN morphologies a=\r\nppear more natural. We also find that\n&gt; locomotion performance increases as=\r\n more materials are added, that\n&gt; diversity of form and behavior can be inc=\r\nreased with different cost\n&gt; functions without stifling performance, and th=\r\nat organisms can be\n&gt; evolved at different levels of resolution.  These fin=\r\ndings suggest the\n&gt; ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towar=\r\nds evolving a\n&gt; large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatur=\r\nes. Our\n&gt; results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of\n&gt;=\r\n CPPN-encoded soft, multi-material robots with modern\n&gt; diversity-encouragi=\r\nng techniques could finally enable the creation of\n&gt; creatures far more com=\r\nplex and interesting than those produced by Sims\n&gt; nearly twenty years ago.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As always, please let me know if you have any comments or question=\r\ns!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS.
