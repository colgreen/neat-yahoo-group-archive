I h=\r\nave been stalling on making the\n&gt; upgrades past breve 2.5 i.e. not really u=\r\nsing the new python\n&gt; capabilities, simply because Klein deprecated the dat=\r\na class. \n&gt; Progress has a way of dragging us forward!  What type of experi=\r\nments?\n&gt;  Are you the guys with the learning bipedal walker on you tube?\n&gt; =\r\nck\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G. Miguel&quot; &lt;cesar.gomes@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter B. and I have been doing some experiments with Breve using the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; NEAT-Python implementation. It&#39;s not a plugin, though. You have to set=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; up a fitness function that calls the Breve engine from the command\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n line and passes the chromosomes by argument. Once the Breve simulation\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n is finished, it returns the fitness for each individual.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So it&#39;s =\r\na two-step problem: first set-up your environment within\n&gt; &gt; Breve, as you&#39;=\r\nd do in a normal experiment; then you define a fitness\n&gt; &gt; function to load=\r\n that environment every time you need to evaluate the\n&gt; &gt; population. Think=\r\n of Breve as the &quot;evaluator&quot; and not part of NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a completely se=\r\nparated module.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you have interest, we can send you the code. It=\r\n only works in linux\n&gt; &gt; right now, given that you need to use some shell s=\r\ncripts. But I think\n&gt; &gt; it won&#39;t be hard to translate that into a bat file.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cesar\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 10, 2008 at 11:20 AM, Correy Allen Kow=\r\nall\n&gt; &gt; &lt;coolbeanskowall@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a NEAT or hyper=\r\nNEAT plugin for the breve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simulation engine?
