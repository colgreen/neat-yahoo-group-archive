It seems to me that the agents/robots wouldn&#39;t be able to\nperceive any difference between the two starting points.\n\nI&#39;m probably missing something simple, but the idea of halving the\nnumber of evaluations is attractive if there isn&#39;t much benefit to the\nsecond evaluation.\n\n\n-Drew\n\n"}}
