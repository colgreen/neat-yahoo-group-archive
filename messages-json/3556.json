The problem is that \nthere \n&gt;  are =\r\nso\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  many possible spurious correlations between good pictures \nand \n=\r\n&gt;  other\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  irrelevent factors that the classifier will not get the \nd=\r\neeper\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  concept of what makes a good picture.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  Yet I ag=\r\nree with John in the sense that there is extremely \nrich \n&gt;  and\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  un=\r\nusual data in the Picbreeder database that may be useful \nfor\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  somet=\r\nhing beyond Picbreeder itself.  I just think the right \nway \n&gt;  to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  =\r\nleverage it is tricky.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  The idea of complexity is also quite =\r\nmuddy.  Unfortunately, \nthe \n&gt;  word\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  means a lot of different thing=\r\ns.  In fact, perhaps the best \n&gt;  formal\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  definition (&quot;minimal descr=\r\niption length&quot;) is both proven\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  uncomputable in general and also doe=\r\ns not correlate to what \nis \n&gt;  meant\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  by the normal intuitive use o=\r\nf the word complexity with \nrespect \n&gt;  to\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  evolution.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;=\r\n  As evolutionary complexity goes up in the sense we usually \nmean \n&gt;  it,\n=\r\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  it is not just that the phenotype takes more bits to \ndescribe.\n&gt;  =\r\n&gt; &gt;  There is also a sense of organization, i.e. regularity, that \n&gt;  begin=\r\ns\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  to take hold.  That is in direct opposition with the idea of \n&gt;  =\r\nminimal\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  description length.  In fact, what we really want is some \n=\r\nkind of\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  partnership between complexity and organization.  \nUnfortun=\r\nately \n&gt;  that\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  introduces yet another mysterious word: organization=\r\n; it also\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  introduced a partnership between two seemingly opposing \n=\r\nforces.  \n&gt;  Yet\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  I think this muddiness and internal conflict is im=\r\nportant \n&gt;  because it\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  shows that this problem is extremely slipper=\r\ny.  It makes me \n&gt;  wonder\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  what is meant by &quot;doing well&quot; for humans=\r\n asked to select for\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  complexity.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  In any case, I do l=\r\nike the theme behind John&#39;s idea, but I \nthink\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  something more sophi=\r\nsitcated needs to be done to capture the \n&gt;  deeper\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  reasons that ce=\r\nrtain pictures are selected.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; In classical art there are &#39;rules&#39; =\r\nfor good works.  The rule of\n&gt;  &gt; thirds, for example.  Why do those rules =\r\nexist?  I would posit \nthat\n&gt;  &gt; those rules exist because of a mathematica=\r\nl relationship that \nexists\n&gt;  &gt; in how the signals travel around in our br=\r\nain.  I suspect that a\n&gt;  &gt; network COULD be developed that would be able t=\r\no identify the \npure\n&gt;  &gt; aesthetic merit of a particular image, because I =\r\nthink that at \nthat\n&gt;  &gt; level, aesthetics is a purely mathematical functio=\r\nn.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; That said, I think that it would be very unlikely to be able =\r\nto \nsay,\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;hey, that looks like a bunny rabbit that has been \n&gt;  borgif=\r\nied...cool!&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; Since our choice of what to breed for is based partly on =\r\n\naesthetics\n&gt;  &gt; and partly on the emotional tie to the objects that someth=\r\ning \n&gt;  reminds\n&gt;  &gt; us of, there is little chance that a controller networ=\r\nk could \n&gt;  totally\n&gt;  &gt; replace the human.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; But what if?  What i=\r\nf a controller could be evolved which \nlearned to\n&gt;  &gt; recognize good image=\r\n composition rules?  How might such a thing \n&gt;  extend\n&gt;  &gt; the usefulness =\r\nof PicBreeder in general?  What might it teach \nus?\n&gt;  &gt; What might it say =\r\nabout the limits of computer controls?  What \nmight\n&gt;  &gt; it say about US?  =\r\nIs there any merit at all to undertaking such \nan\n&gt;  &gt; experiment?  In my o=\r\npinion, there is.\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; -- John\n&gt;  \n&gt;  John, you argue persuasively fo=\r\nr your idea, and I can see the \n&gt;  appeal.  I would not dismiss the idea th=\r\nat there is the \npossibility \n&gt;  that a classifier could evolve that detect=\r\ns something surprising \n&gt;  about aesthetic value and thereby filters the se=\r\narch for \ninteresting \n&gt;  images.  It is an intoxicating idea and I would l=\r\nove to hear \nabout \n&gt;  and see the results of any such attempt.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Yet =\r\nlet me give you an idea about the origin of my skepticism.  \nI&#39;m \n&gt;  basica=\r\nlly jaded by the underwhelming results of past such \nefforts.  \n&gt;  For exam=\r\nple, a friend of mine tried to evolve a neural network to \n&gt;  detect good m=\r\nusic in a similar approach to yours.  I have heard \nof \n&gt;  other attempts l=\r\nike that one (usually they seem to be with \nmusic).  I \n&gt;  realize these st=\r\nories are only anecdotal, yet I draw a lesson \nfrom \n&gt;  them which shows th=\r\ne danger in such an approach:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Evolution likes to cheat and get by ea=\r\nsy.  If you want it to \nlearn \n&gt;  something deep and general, it tries to l=\r\nearn some cheap trick to \ndo \n&gt;  almost as well without having to deal with=\r\n the deep stuff.  In \nother \n&gt;  words, like lightning, it takes the path of=\r\n least resistance.  \nThe \n&gt;  problem with training to detect artistic quali=\r\nty is that there \nmay be \n&gt;  predominant correlations among pictures or son=\r\ngs that we deem \ngood \n&gt;  that are really not the reason they are good.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt;  For exampele, &quot;good&quot; songs may tend to have a lot of C notes, not \n&gt;  b=\r\necause C makes a good song, but rather because it happens to \nappear \n&gt;  a =\r\nlot in a particular genre, perhaps because it is the base note \nof \n&gt;  some=\r\n scale.  Thus, an evolved classifier will simply predict that \n&gt;  anything =\r\nwith a lot of C&#39;s is good, missing the deeper reasons \n&gt;  entirely.  Or, in=\r\n Picbreeder, you may notice if you look closely \nthat \n&gt;  many (though not =\r\nall) of the published images have some sort of \nsmall \n&gt;  circular formatio=\r\nn near their center.  For example this object \nmay be \n&gt;  a nose, an eye (i=\r\nn a profile), a cockpit window, an iris, a \nkeyhole, \n&gt;  a sun, a moon, a f=\r\ningernail, etc.  Therefore, a classifier would \ndo \n&gt;  well to learn to pre=\r\ndict that any picture with a small circle in \nthe \n&gt;  middle is good, again=\r\n missing the point.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I think the reason such projects have failed in =\r\nthe past is \nbecause \n&gt;  of just such spurious correlations.  The question =\r\nis how to push \n&gt;  evolution to learn the deeper meaning of &quot;good,&quot; which i=\r\ns so \n&gt;  profoundly slippery.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Nevertheless, I would not say it is a =\r\nlost cause.  Yet it is \n&gt;  certainly a grand challenge and will not succumb=\r\n easily.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  ken\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;      \n&gt;                        \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n=\r\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Moody friends.
