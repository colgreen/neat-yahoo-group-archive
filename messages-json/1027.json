I did some things \ndifferently than tradition, and I&#39;d like some feedback  on whether there are \nany obvious blunders to it...\n\nFirst, each network topology is a distinct species, period.\n\nSecond, I only form a maximum of one new topology per generation, period.  \nAnd then, only if there is room in the population for one.\n\n&quot;room&quot; is determined by how many are left after offspring allocation.  This \nis made possible by the fact that I have a very precise set of searches that \nare done within any given topology:\n\n1. best member passes on unchanged (elites)\n2. best member has its weights tweaked\n3. best member is crossed with 2nd best, and weights are averaged\n4. best member is crossed with 2nd best, and weights are randomly selected \nfrom one parent or the other\n5. 2nd best passes on unchanged (2nd elite)\n6. 2nd best has its weights tweaked\n7. 1st best is crossed with a random other, weights averaged\n8. 2nd best is crossed with a random other, weights averaged\n9. 1st best is crossed with a random other, weights chosen randomly from \nparents\n10. 2nd best crossed with random other, randomly\n11. all new weights are chosen at random\n\nIf, due to fitness sharing, only 5 offspring are allowed, it only gets the \nfirst 5.  If it should get 12, it still only gets 11, but there is room in \nthe population for searching more topology, and so a topological mutation is \nallowed.  One, for the whole population, chosen at random from the elites in \nthe population.\n\nThere is also a stagnation penalty.  When calculating fitness sharing, each \nspecies/topology is penalized 1% for every generation since the last time it \nimproved.  If it does improve, that penalty is not immediately removed, but \ncut in half.  That way, investment rises rapidly, but not all the way.\n\nThe idea is that since a species is a fixed topology, it can&#39;t get un-stuck \nby adding structure.  Adding structure creates new species.  So, as the \ntopology stagnates, the likelihood of making a breakthrough in that \nparticular structure diminishes.  Thus, our computational investment in it \ndiminishes.  As our investment in that species decreases, that makes \navailable more resources for more profitable avenues of searching.  But \nsince there is a limited number of slots per topology, eventually we will \nhave more available slots than we can use.  That&#39;s when structure gets \nadded.  When that happens, there is a 75% chance that the change will be the \naddition of a new connection.  20% chance of splitting an existing \nconnection.  And %5 chance of deleting an existing connection.\n\nThe idea is to thoroughly focus on weight adjustment to the exclusion of \ntopological variation so long as it is making headway.  Then to focus on \nconnectivity before layers.  And addition before deletion.\n\nLike I said, any obvious problems with this idea?  Any suggestions of \nspecific data that should be gathered to make sure the design works, besides \nability so solve a particular problem?\n\nThanks!\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
