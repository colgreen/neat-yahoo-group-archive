It&#39;s a useful piece of research and a very\nthorough paper!\n\nThere&#39;s a mention towards the end of the possibility of co-evolving\nindirect and direct encodings - I was having the same thought while\nreading, as that would essentially be a ensemble (a mini ensemble of two).\nTechnically we could do this with any encoding, e.g. maybe evolving *pairs*\nof NEAT genomes would be superior to single genomes (technically a single\n&#39;compound&#39; genome). But of course with the two very different encodings\nthere&#39;s the possibility that we might tap into the strengths of both such.\n\nThe poor performance of offset NEAT does seem to suggest that learning\ndirect encodings early can basically prevent the indirect encoding from\nfinding the regularities that are there, i.e. the direct encoding\nimmediately starts to obfuscate them (make the fitness landscape more\ncomplex to search), so it makes sense from that point of view that the\napproach has problems, and thus we can probably expect co-evolved genomes\nto exhibit the same problem.\n\nPerhaps though the indirect encodings could be scored separately, so two\nscores - one based on the indirect encoding genome only, and another for\nthe compound genome score. We then arrange genomes in a 2D cartesian grid\nwith one fitness along the X-axis, and compound fitness on the Y-Axis. We\ncan then define a &#39;final&#39; fitness score as the distance from the origin\ni.e. distance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nThis has the effect of selecting some genomes that have good indirect\nencodings when operating independently, but not when their direct encoding\nis applied. This allows the indirect encoding to evolve independently of\nthe direct encoding, but at some point if the combination works well then\nthat starts to get selected for, but it still competes for selection with\nthe indirect only encodings, such that &#39;branching off&#39; into evolving the\ncombined pairs is no longer a distinct event, it&#39;s just part of the search\nspace being explored.\n\nFurther, a weighting or scaling might be applied to the X-axis or the\nY-axis scores to assign some degree of precedence of preference to the\nindirect-only encoding fitness.\n\nMake sense?\n\nThanks again.\n\nColin\n\r\n--001a114504bad8a4e0054ba47c2a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thanks to Lucas and Jeff.
