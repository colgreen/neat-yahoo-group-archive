The idea that there are &quot;huge classes of\n&gt; problems where pure Novelty search will not work&quot; misses that it is a shock\n&gt; that it works in any serious domains at all!  Would you really expect a method\n&gt; that does not even know what it is looking for to solve *anything* better than\n&gt; fitness-based search?  Yet in fact we have been accumulating more and more\n&gt; domains where it does better.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, of course there are domains in which it will perform poorly.\n&gt; Yet the onus here should not be on novelty search, which does not purport to\n&gt; try to solve anything at all.  What I think is more interesting is the\n&gt; embarrassing result that fitness-based search is so inept against an algorithm\n&gt; that does not even know what it is looking for.  The whole thing is more of an\n&gt; indictment on the way we have been conducting search, and the way we have been\n&gt; interpreting learning algorithm results, than it is an endorsement of novelty\n&gt; search as the solution to all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, in the past, when fitness-NEAT attempts to solve a problem and\n&gt; fails, we would have said the problem is NEAT.  Yet when novelty-NEAT solves\n&gt; the same problem seamlessly, the lie of the original interpretation is\n&gt; revealed.  In fact, there are many negative results for many algorithms that\n&gt; we should be questioning in light of novelty search.  We have been assuming\n&gt; that the fitness-based paradigm *is* learning, when it is only a small sliver\n&gt; of what learning can be.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also do not think that expanding the maze 100 times would cause much\n&gt; problem, besides needing individual evaluations to last 100 times longer.  But\n&gt; the number of evaluations needed to evolve a solution would be about the same.\n&gt; Taking away the walls would cause it to need more evaluations, but I don&#39;t see\n&gt; it really causing a fundamental problem.  So I would dispute that it is as\n&gt; brittle as you say.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the insight I&#39;m raising is not about that anyway.  It&#39;s about the flaw in\n&gt; concluding too much from an attempt to optimize an objective about what a\n&gt; particular algorithm can accomplish.   If novelty might take longer without\n&gt; the walls, fitness will be even worse (longer time in deceptive traps).  In\n&gt; some sense, we are flirting with the futility of all of search.\n&gt; Novelty+fitness MOEA is likely a solution to some problems that neither one\n&gt; can solve alone, so it&#39;s a promising idea, but I think novelty search is\n&gt; significant for more than being a solution to something.  It is a symptom of a\n&gt; major interpretive problem that stretches back into EC history.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jean-Baptiste-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks for writing this paper. It is really interesting.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think it is particularly fascinating how well Novelty + Fitness\n&gt;&gt; Multiobjective competed with pure Novelty search on a problem designed to\n&gt;&gt; showcase the benefits of Novelty search.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My original instincts regarding Novelty search were that it was a great way\n&gt;&gt; to overcome deception, but that there are huge classes of problems where\n&gt;&gt; pure Novelty search will not work (e.g. take the problem you and the\n&gt;&gt; original novelty search paper used, make it 1000 times larger, and get rid\n&gt;&gt; of the bottom and left walls up to the first walls that jut in). I had\n&gt;&gt; thought that a combination of Novelty + Fitness would be able to handle such\n&gt;&gt; problems well, which your results strongly imply. Your paper suggests that\n&gt;&gt; you will conduct tests on such problems. Have you tried that yet? I look\n&gt;&gt; forward to seeing the results!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor &lt;mandor@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Tue, 11 Aug 2009 16:12:37 +0200\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] New paper &quot;Novelty-based multiobjectivization&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;         Hello,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I just finished a paper for the IROS&#39;09 workshop entitled &quot;Exploring\n&gt;&gt;&gt; New Horizons in Evolutionary Design of Robots&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; [http://www.isir.fr/evoderob]. It&#39;s about novelty search and, since we\n&gt;&gt;&gt; talked a lot about it on this mailing-list, it could interest some of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the paper:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/papers/novelty_based_multiobjectivizatio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pdf\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Abstract:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   Novelty search is a recent and promising approach to evolve\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   neuro-controllers, especially to drive robots. The main idea is to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   maximize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   However, abandoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   in many contexts. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   evolutionary algorithm is employed to reconcile novelty search with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   objective-based optimization by following a multiobjectivization\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   process. Several multiobjectivizations based on behavioral novelty\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   and on behavioral diversity are compared on a maze navigation\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   task. Results show that the multiobjectivizations is better at\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty search while keeping a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   comparable number of iterations to converge.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ((4&({*.(=+/))++/=3:)@([:,/0&,^:(i.3)@|:&quot;2^:2))&.&gt;@]^:(i.@[) &lt;#:3 6 2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
