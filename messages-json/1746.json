While it would certainly increase the number\n&gt; of generations needed\n&gt; &gt; to get something acceptable, it might also make a solution that is\n&gt; able to generalize. That\n&gt; &gt; is, it might make a solution where there isn&#39;t a pixel-feature\n&gt; correspondance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that&#39;s a totally valid approach and should be looked into.\n&gt; It may help a lot.  We just had results today suggesting that\n&gt; longer, more diverse training experiences lead to better\n&gt; generalization, which suggests that the more varied the examples,\n&gt; the better it generalizes.  That in turn suggests that adding some\n&gt; noise might help.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\nI hadn&#39;t actually read the &quot;Automobile Warning System&quot; portion of your\ndissertation, but I did so after Reuben&#39;s mention of it.  It&#39;s\ninteresting stuff.  But I did want to clarify.\n\nThis is the domain Reuben&#39;s referring to when he talks about the &quot;car\ndomain&quot;, correct?\n\nAnd according to the paper, you&#39;re not using video data, right?\n\nThe dissertation says:\n\n&quot;Using raw data provided by RARS, two kinds of sensor systems were\ndeveloped for this\nproject and provided as input to NEAT neural networks. First,\nrangefinder sensors project rays at several angles relative to the\ncar&#39;s heading to the edge of the road (figure 8.2). The rangefinders\ngive the car an indication of its position and heading relative to the\nsides of the road, and also of the curvature of the road.\n\nSecond, several simulated radar sensors detect other cars or obstacles\n(figure 8.3). The radar sensors are convenient for detecting discrete\nobjects by locating them inside of one of several slices that\nrepresent relative angles and positions. The radars return a value\nequivalent to the distance of the nearest car in each slice, or a\nmaximum value if there is no car.&quot;\n\nSo are the first type of sensors analogous to feedback from laser sensors?\n\nAnd it sounded from the first experiment, just learning to drive on an\nempty track, that only one track was used...is that correct?\n\nDoes RARS support randomization of track designs?  This is a type of\nnoise that could have been added to the environment.  You also talked\nhere about possibly adding noise to the controls, in this case the\ngas, brake, and steering.  I guess one could also artificially add\nnoise to the sensor data that the cars are receiving.  But none of\nthese were actually done, right?  Would you think any or all of them\nwould be effective?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
