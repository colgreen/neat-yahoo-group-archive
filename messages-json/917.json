Would it be possible/desirable ?\n&gt;\n\nDepends on what you mean.  Yes, I could make some complicated application \nfor managing connections and stuff.  But why?  A simple CGI script is far \neasier.  And just as effective.  I would still be able to have a client of \nchoice.  But the communication protocol then is already defined...http.  And \nthen I can leverage existing http communication libraries.\n\nThe reason for the command-line version of NEAT is specifically to support \nthat mode of operation.  A CGI script only lives for the duration of the \nrequest.  So, state of the experiment will have to be maintained on disk.  \nThat&#39;s easy enough.  And once it&#39;s ready, just hand it to NEAT to do the \nevolutionary part.  Clean, simple, effective. :)\n\n\n\n"}}
