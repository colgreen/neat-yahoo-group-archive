If I only activate the network once, then\n&gt; the mapping of current input to current output can only be\n&gt; very simple.  What I am thinking is that I pick a number of\n&gt; activations that corresponds to the approximate memory\n&gt; size that I am after, so that if I would like the network to\n&gt; remember the last 5 states, then I will relax the network by\n&gt; activating it 5 times for each input.  What&#39;s your opinion on\n&gt; this?\n\nI really think I have the answer you need, which is to let the \nnetwork tell you when its done &quot;thinking&quot;.   You do this by having \none additional output which is designated as a &quot;ready&quot; line.\n\nYou start with all outputs at zero.  As soon as the &quot;ready&quot; output is \nhigh, then you are done, and you take all of the other outputs as \nyour result.  High could be defined as &gt; .5.  I think this is a \ngeneral approach that applies to many problems.  Essentially, you are \nletting the nework tell you when it is done processing.  I have used \nthis approach in two programs, and it worked perfectly.\n\nMitchell Timin \nhttp:&#92;&#92;annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\n"}}
