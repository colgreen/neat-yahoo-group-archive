It&#39;s not a plugin, though. You have to set\nup a fitness function that calls the Breve engine from the command\nline and passes the chromosomes by argument. Once the Breve simulation\nis finished, it returns the fitness for each individual.\n\nSo it&#39;s a two-step problem: first set-up your environment within\nBreve, as you&#39;d do in a normal experiment; then you define a fitness\nfunction to load that environment every time you need to evaluate the\npopulation. Think of Breve as the &quot;evaluator&quot; and not part of NEAT.\nIt&#39;s a completely separated module.\n\nIf you have interest, we can send you the code. It only works in linux\nright now, given that you need to use some shell scripts. But I think\nit won&#39;t be hard to translate that into a bat file.\n\nCesar\n\nOn Thu, Jul 10, 2008 at 11:20 AM, Correy Allen Kowall\n&lt;coolbeanskowall@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Does anyone know of a NEAT or hyperNEAT plugin for the breve\n&gt; simulation engine?
