The survival of the fittest, crossover and mutation all \nhappen ins=\r\nide each species. I mean each species does it&#39;s own GA in \norder to optimiz=\r\ne its structure. Organisms compete within their own \nniches instead of with=\r\n the population at large. \nIf the growth is too slow, you can raise the mut=\r\nation probabilities. \nThere is always some trial and error involved when yo=\r\nu get to set the \nparameters of the system for the given problem. \nWell I a=\r\nm not familiar with MATLAB NEAT. Try using the C++ or Java \nversion instead=\r\n. It may not help much with the general problems of \ndeciding the mutation =\r\nrates and the target number of \nspecies/speciation importance factors, but =\r\nit should be way faster, \nat least the C++ code can be considered faster. \n=\r\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;psyphiroth.nebu&quot; &lt;psyphiroth.nebu@...=\r\n&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your advice, Peter. Could you explain how GA works=\r\n in \n&gt; NEAT? There is elitism in the program, I thought it would ensure \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; convergence of the algorithm, but it seems there are other \nmechanisms=\r\n \n&gt; that govern the process. Since the elites are preserved, why does \nthe =\r\n\n&gt; process still get stuck? And the networks have barely grown too \n&gt; large=\r\n, with an average number of hidden nodes less than 10 for \n&gt; several hundre=\r\nd generations. I think the algorithm optimizes too \n&gt; slowly, is there some=\r\n method to change this? I am under \nMATLAB_NEAT, \n&gt; and unfamiliar with pro=\r\ngramming languages other than C and java.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Check your specia=\r\ntion parameters and the importance factors for \n&gt; &gt; speciation. Sometimes t=\r\nhere are too many species, sometimes there \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; too few. The dropoff=\r\n age is important, too. The overall slow down \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; because the networ=\r\nks grow in size and the simpler species reach \n&gt; their \n&gt; &gt; dropoff age and=\r\n get killed of by NEAT. This is the explanation \nwhy \n&gt; &gt; the fitness drops=\r\n, too. You can have an absolute elitism where \nthe \n&gt; &gt; best species never =\r\nget killed, no matter how old it is. It seems \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; a fitness platea=\r\nu is being reached and NEAT finds it difficult to \n&gt; &gt; optimize in a high-d=\r\nimentional space, the smaller species already \n&gt; &gt; being dead and the more =\r\ncomplex are left.\n&gt; &gt; A possible thing to try is to implement a pruning mec=\r\nhanism. The \n&gt; &gt; phased pruning techniqe by Colin Green (found in SharpNEAT=\r\n) is \nthe \n&gt; &gt; one I recommend. This will improve the speed as well as the =\r\n\nquality \n&gt; &gt; of the overall search. With phased pruning, the lower dimenti=\r\nonal \n&gt; &gt; space is searched better. This helps finding the best starting \n&gt;=\r\n point \n&gt; &gt; for future generations. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
