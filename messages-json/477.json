But I&#39;m not sure I agree with &#39;greatly.&#39;  Yes, it is \nmore complicated.  However, having a fixed enlargement amount and fixed \noutput positions causes those &#39;parameters&#39; to be hard-coded into the \nstructure of the network itself.  Not just once, but once per output node.\n\nSo, this change will move those parameters out of the weights and into input \nnodes.  The complexity hasn&#39;t necessarily changed, just shifted position \nwithin the network...right? :)\n\n&gt;But on the other hand, as you pointed out,  it does make the network more \n&gt;minimal.\n\nYes, MUCH.\n\nAnd flexible, which is incredibly important to this particular problem.  To \nbe useful to anyone besides me, it would HAVE to be something other than a \nfixed enlargement factor.\n\n&gt;So it breaks one golden rule\n&gt;but adheres to another.  There&#39;s clearly a tradeoff there.  My opinion\n&gt;is that this is a very open question, and we really won&#39;t know how\n&gt;feasible this idea is until we try.\n\nThen I might as well try.  :)\n\n&gt;If you look in the NEAT FAQ, I actually made a similar suggestion in\n&gt;the games domain, i.e. instead of having outputs for every position on\n&gt;the board, you add the output nodes to the *inputs* and then query the\n&gt;network over the set of all board coordinates, and place a piece where\n&gt;the network responds most strongly:\n&gt;\n&gt;See &quot;How can NEAT &quot;start minimally&quot; in a high-input/high-output\n&gt;domain?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Notice in my idea I suggested actually having an input node for every\n&gt;coordinate on the board (as opposed to a 2-node coordinate system).\n&gt;This may seem like it isn&#39;t a gain but it is; note that a 10x10 net\n&gt;starts with 100 inputs, but if you move the 10 outputs to the input,\n&gt;you then have a 20x1 net, which only has 20 connections to begin\n&gt;with.\n&gt;My point is that this idea is a third option, though similar to your\n&gt;(John&#39;s) idea.\n&gt;\n&gt;As I said the utility of any of these ideas is unknown, but I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt;assume anything before we try them.  One thing that might make things\n&gt;tough with functions with query coordinates in the inputs is if they\n&gt;have a lot of XOR-like properties, because that would mean a lot of\n&gt;tricky plateaus in the fitness space, and a lot of waiting for the\n&gt;right node to appear.\n\nYes, I do expect a lot of waiting.  Which is why I&#39;m going to end up doing \nit in a distributed manner.  I&#39;ve got a number of computers at my disposal, \nI might as well put them to work.\n\nWhich brings me to my next question...\n\nSince I&#39;ll be using both Linux and Windows hosts for doing the fitness \nevaluations, I might as well do it on a cross-platform language.  Perl is \ntoo slow, however...\n\nIt was mentioned that Java is approaching the speed of execution of \noptimized C++.  Which JVMs do you guys recommend?\n\nThanks!\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nFrustrated with dial-up?
