Under the &#39;Instructions&#39; tab on the web page it says that \nthe submitted results will be compared to &quot;established statistical \nforecasting methods&quot; and then it lists the following techniques:\n\n    * Naï¿½ve\n    * Single, Linear, Seasonal & Dampened Trend Exponential Smoothing\n    * ARIMA-Methods\n\nSo does anyone know off-hand what types of data sets these techniques \ncan perform [good] predictions for, and therefore what type of data \nsource is likely being used for these competition data sets? E.g. is it \nmore likely to be, say, environmental readings such as temperature, \nriver flow rates, water oxygen levels, population levels, etc. where we \ncan expect some cyclic behaviour (through the seasons)?\n\nThe reason I ask is that my investigations into financial time series \ndata have lead me to believe you really need additional information to \npredict stock and indices price series with any sort of success, e.g. \nPrice/Earnings ratios, and even then such series will possess a large \namount of unpredictability caused by random events. I&#39;ll give it a try \nanyway but I think the chances of getting anything like good results \nwith my existing waveform generator experiment are much greater with \nsomething like cyclical environmental data rather than financial data \nthat, although cyclical in the very long term (like in decade \ntimescales), tends to be largely chaotic IMHO.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
