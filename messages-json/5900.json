You can&#39;t establish something like symmetry early in an object=\r\nive search because symmetry on its own looks nothing like the final objecti=\r\nve, even if theoretically it would be helpful in principle in finding it.  =\r\n\n\nAlthough I generally agree with this, I am wondering whether bilateral sy=\r\nmmetry is an appropriate example for it. For example, when evolution starts=\r\n with spherical symmetry, radial and bilateral symmetry more represent a re=\r\nduction of regularity. From this perspective evolutionary development *is* =\r\nabout adding irregularity to patterns rather than establishing regularity?!=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
