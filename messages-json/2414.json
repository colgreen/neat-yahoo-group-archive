The idea is that if the fitness \nfunction varies but there is=\r\n some underlying theme that is conserved \n(such as symmetry) the organisms =\r\nwill need to evolve to be able to \nrepresent that underlying theme efficien=\r\ntly even though they can&#39;t \nrely on any particular instance of it.  This do=\r\nes imply that \ncalamities can lead to robustness, but it appears than an im=\r\nportant \ningredient in such a system is an encoding that can encapsulate \ni=\r\nnformation about underlying themes, i.e. an indirect encoding.  \nHere&#39;s the=\r\n paper:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?reisinger:gecco05\n\nken\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2) Changing the fitness function. We choose a function based on \n=\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt;problem at hand, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a \ndiffer=\r\nent \n&gt; &gt;function. But often we come up with different ways of evaluating \nn=\r\netwoks \n&gt; &gt;for a given problem and we often have discussions about what is =\r\n\nthe best \n&gt; &gt;function. What if we were to code up a few of theses differen=\r\nt \nfunctions \n&gt; &gt;and allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This t=\r\nhen \ncould be \n&gt; &gt;something akin to an extinction event occuring in nature =\r\nand \nchanging \n&gt; &gt;the fitness landscape.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; .... or if your fu=\r\nnction has a bunch of measures that are weighted \nto \n&gt; give a final fitnes=\r\ns score you could just change the weighting \n&gt; occasionally.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
