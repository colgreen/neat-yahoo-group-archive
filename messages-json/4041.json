You bring up many interesting points.\n\nI agree that one of the most ch=\r\nallenging aspects of applying novelty\nsearch is coming up with an effective=\r\n behavioral characterization, but\nfor problems where fitness-based search f=\r\nails, the effort may be worth\nthe payoff of a potentially more powerful sea=\r\nrch.\n\nWhat you say about our choice of behavioral measure in the maze domai=\r\nn\nis true, it will conflate two navigators that end on the same point\nbut u=\r\nse different methods of locomotion to get there. And it is\ninteresting that=\r\n you brought that up, because this question of\nconflation and choice of beh=\r\navioral measure has been an area we have\nbeen further investigating. Unless=\r\n you *completely* characterize\nbehavior (i.e. the maze navigator&#39;s position=\r\n & angle over all time\nsteps), there will be some conflation -- the questio=\r\nn is whether for\nmany domains there is a level of conflation that is accept=\r\nable (or\neven beneficial).\n\nYour next point seems to be related, that to co=\r\nmpletely specify\nbehavior in a very complex domain may be very hard or even=\r\n infeasible.\nThis is true. However, it may be sufficient to use a succinct =\r\nsummary\nof behavior instead of trying to completely specify it (e.g. when\np=\r\nlaying a fixed opponent what is the end configuration of the board\nfor a ch=\r\neckers player). Once again, by using a summary of behavior\ninstead of a com=\r\nplete specification, conflation is introduced between\ndifferent individuals=\r\n that have different behaviors, but appear the\nsame to the behavioral measu=\r\nre.\n\nBehavioral distance is another tricky aspect, and we are looking into\n=\r\nways of doing it in a principled fashion for higher-dimensional\nbehavioral =\r\nspaces that have multiple types of information (e.g.\nintegrating heading in=\r\nformation along with Cartesian location of the \nnavigator).\n\nJoel\n\n--- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; H=\r\ni Joal and Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; This papers and the results presented there really tur=\r\nned my \n&gt; understandings for EC upside down. This kind of search is really =\r\n\n&gt; innovative concept that needs to be explored. But I have several \n&gt; ques=\r\ntions about it. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is obvious that you have to define what is a netwo=\r\nrk&#39;s behaviour \n&gt; in the task domain and find a way to measure distance bet=\r\nween two \n&gt; behaviours. I think this is the hardest part of setting up a no=\r\nvelty \n&gt; search. For example, in the task domain of maze navigation, you ca=\r\nn \n&gt; simply say that a robot&#39;s ending point is its behaviour, but I can \n&gt; =\r\nargue that this is not all, but the way the robot reaches this point \n&gt; can=\r\n also be considered a behaviour. For example the robot may go from \n&gt; point=\r\n A to point B straight forward, but it can reach the same point \n&gt; by going=\r\n forward and spinning. Your model will consider both as the \n&gt; same behavio=\r\nur while it is obvious the behaviours are different. \n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing is=\r\n that as the task becomes more complex, it is nearly \n&gt; impossible to defin=\r\ne what a behaviour *is* and how to measure \n&gt; distance between them. Consid=\r\ner the tennis playing robot. Or the \n&gt; checkers playing network. How can yo=\r\nu define the behaviour then? And \n&gt; more, how can you measure *distance* be=\r\ntween behaviours? It&#39;s like \n&gt; you have two persons that you know very well=\r\n and you try to say &quot;the \n&gt; distance between your behaviours is 56.1 units&quot;=\r\n... I don&#39;t say it is \n&gt; impossible, it is just too hard. \n&gt; \n&gt; The simples=\r\nt approach is to track the network&#39;s output pattern and \n&gt; have this as its=\r\n behaviour. But then a slight change will mean a \n&gt; different behaviour and=\r\n the algorithm will end up adding and adding \n&gt; more members to the pool, n=\r\nearly every new thing in fact, thus the \n&gt; algorithm will end up as a sligh=\r\ntly optimized version of exhaustive \n&gt; search. \n&gt; \n&gt; But it is really inter=\r\nesting to see novelty search combined with \n&gt; CPPN/HyperNEAT on tasks like =\r\nmy biped or just regular NEAT with \n&gt; novelty search on the cool demos I sa=\r\nw in DephiNEAT like the Hopper \n&gt; and the snake. \n&gt; \n&gt; By the way I support=\r\n the idea that novelty search should sometimes be \n&gt; biased with fitness-ba=\r\nsed search, once a good number of approximate \n&gt; solutions is found. Especi=\r\nally in domains where the search/behaviour \n&gt; space is vast. \n&gt; \n&gt; I believ=\r\ne that the search space that NEAT searches directly (the \n&gt; genotype space)=\r\n is much more big than the behaviour space, simply \n&gt; because many many dif=\r\nferent structures/weight configurations can \n&gt; represent the same exact beh=\r\naviour. The task domain can restrict the \n&gt; possible behaviours further, bu=\r\nt not in all task domains. But even if \n&gt; there are infinite possible behav=\r\niours in a space, novelty search is \n&gt; still better than random search beca=\r\nuse it searches explicitly for \n&gt; new behaviours, so new genomes that do th=\r\ne same thing will not be \n&gt; rewarded. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Joel Lehman and I are=\r\n excited to announce our new publication to\n&gt; &gt; appear in the Eleventh Inte=\r\nrnational Conference on Articifial Life\n&gt; &gt; (ALIFE XI), called &quot;Exploiting =\r\nOpen-Endedness to Solve Problems\n&gt; &gt; Through the Search for Novelty.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The paper is here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html#l=\r\nehman.alife08\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Direct link: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_a=\r\nlife08.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This paper is about a new kind of search (which works w=\r\nith NEAT) \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; abandons the longstanding notion in all of machine le=\r\narning that the\n&gt; &gt; gradient of search should be measured with respect to t=\r\nhe ultimate\n&gt; &gt; objective.  In other words, it entirely abandons objectives=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; thereby also abandons fitness functions as the impetus for search.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Yet remarkably, we still show that such an algorithm can perform\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n*better* than one that actually tries to achieve the objective!  I\n&gt; &gt; beli=\r\neve this strange result has fascinating implications for machine\n&gt; &gt; learni=\r\nng, artificial life, and even biology.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lately on this forum we hav=\r\ne often discussed the nagging problem \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; the fitness function ofte=\r\nn does not properly recognize or reward the\n&gt; &gt; stepping stones on the way =\r\nto the solution.  I went as far as\n&gt; &gt; suggesting that the fitness function=\r\n can become an *obstacle* to\n&gt; &gt; success (e.g. when we discussed creativity=\r\n in Picbreeder).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While this discussion was largely philosophical, =\r\nJoel Lehman and I\n&gt; &gt; decided to make it concrete and actually introduce an=\r\n algorithm that\n&gt; &gt; makes an automated evolutionary process in *any* domain=\r\n behave like\n&gt; &gt; humans in Picbreeder, that is, like open-ended evolution. =\r\n This\n&gt; &gt; approach is called &quot;novelty search.&quot;  The algorithm simply search=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; for behavior that is novel with respect to what has come before.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The benefit of this approach is that it is immune to deception \n&gt; bec=\r\nause\n&gt; &gt; it does not even try to achieve the objective.  I know it seems\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; strange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact it is far more\n&gt; &gt; =\r\neffective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive landscape \n&gt; than\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; fitness-based search.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In other words, what we are saying is t=\r\nhat to achieve some of the \n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; ambitious objectives we might have f=\r\nor evolution, we must abandon\n&gt; &gt; trying to explicitly achieve them.  To qu=\r\note from the end of our\n&gt; &gt; Discussion section:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;In summary, almos=\r\nt like a riddle, novelty search suggests\n&gt; &gt; a surprising new perspective o=\r\nn achievement: To achieve\n&gt; &gt; your highest goals, you must be willing to ab=\r\nandon them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe this lesson is true in practice and is ther=\r\nefore beyond a\n&gt; &gt; philosophical curiosity.  In fact, we are instinctively =\r\nfamiliar \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; it in life in general when people say things like &quot;You=\r\n are trying \n&gt; too\n&gt; &gt; hard&quot; or when we focus so much on something so far a=\r\nhead of us in \n&gt; life\n&gt; &gt; that we forget completely to solve the short term=\r\n problems that \n&gt; stand\n&gt; &gt; in our way.  It is no less true in evolution or=\r\n search in general.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For NEAT, novelty search should open up new op=\r\nportunities for\n&gt; &gt; discovery that were previously closed off to us.  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
