This is a very cool, and beautiful application of evoluti=\r\nonary computation. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to show portions of this vid=\r\neo to my Evolutionary Robotics class (and potentially in talks as well) as =\r\na nice application of EC. Would you mind sharing the video file or posting =\r\nit to youtube, where I can use keepvid.com to grab it? I may also be able t=\r\no use keepvid with a Vimeo link. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please also let me know what cite/cr=\r\nedit you&#39;d like me to provide when I show it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The portion of the vide=\r\no I am interested in is about 00:18 to 00:57. \n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with your rel=\r\nease. We&#39;re all rooting for your success. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Assistant Professor\n&gt; Computer Science\n&gt; University of Wyoming\n&gt; jclun=\r\ne@...\n&gt; jeffclune.com\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 17, 2013, at 1:38 AM, astral_projection_0=\r\n2  wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello NEAT community. We&#39;ve just released a NEAT-powered g=\r\name called Galactic Arms Race. Some of you may remember it from conferences=\r\n a few years back. We are now giving free Steam keys to the NEAT user group=\r\n and other academic communities. To obtain your free keys please message me=\r\n on Steam username &quot;Astral Projection&quot; or reply to this email. Let me know =\r\nhow many keys you would like for any family, friends, or fellow researchers=\r\n who might also be interested. Note the game is Windows only and requires a=\r\n Steam account.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you feel the game is worthy, we would appreciat=\r\ne a vote for our Greenlight Campaign: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles=\r\n/filedetails/?id=3D120872919\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those interested, all NEAT-relate=\r\nd research aspects of the game are listed on the GAR website: http://galact=\r\nicarmsrace.blogspot.com/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
