I will be starting a lab ther=\r\ne in January, and I would like to encourage readers of the NEAT email list =\r\nthat are interested to apply to join my lab. I will continue to work with H=\r\nyperNEAT, CPPNs, NEAT, neuroevolution, etc. in my new lab. One overarching =\r\nfocus will be on evolving large-scale, structurally organized neural networ=\r\nks (i.e. networks with millions of connections that are modular, regular, a=\r\nnd hierarchical). I am also interested in combining neuroevolution with lea=\r\nrning algorithms, including neuromodulation. In short, my lab will focus on=\r\n exactly the sorts of research topics we discuss on this list.  \n\nPlease al=\r\nso help me find talented students & postdocs by forwarding this email to th=\r\nose with similar interests. Thank you very much for your help.\n------------=\r\n---\nTwo fully funded Ph.D. positions are available in any of the following =\r\nareas, especially in combinations of them: evolving artificial intelligence=\r\n, neural networks, robotics, and deep learning. Postdoctoral positions are =\r\nalso available, but under different funding arrangements (please email jeff=\r\nclune@... for details). Positions ideally start January 2013, but a=\r\npplications will be reviewed until the positions are filled. \n\nI (Jeff Clun=\r\ne) am starting up a new lab at the University of Wyoming and am seeking two=\r\n people interested in earning a Ph.D. in computer science. The lab focus is=\r\n on evolving artificial intelligence by producing artificially intelligent =\r\nrobots, including physical robots and agents in simulated worlds, such as v=\r\nideo games. The lab will also study other bio-inspired AI techniques, such =\r\nas deep learning. Part of these efforts will involve investigating how evol=\r\nution produced the complex, intelligent, diverse life on this planet by try=\r\ning to computationally recreate it. Please see my website (http://JeffClune=\r\n.com) for example publications, press articles about the work, videos, etc.=\r\n Here are some keywords that describe related fields: evolutionary algorith=\r\nms (also known as genetic algorithms or evolutionary computation), neural n=\r\networks (including evolving neural networks, having them learn, deep learni=\r\nng, and computational neuroscience), robotics, artificial intelligence, and=\r\n research into the evolution of intelligence, complexity, evolvability, and=\r\n diversity.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the lab or would like more in=\r\nformation about the positions, please follow the instructions at http://jef=\r\nfclune.com/positionsAvailable.html\n\nThe University of Wyoming is located in=\r\n Laramie, a college town in the heart of the Rocky Mountain West. Nestled b=\r\netween two mountain ranges, Laramie has more than 300 days of sunshine a ye=\r\nar and is home to year-round outdoor activities including hiking, camping, =\r\nrock climbing, downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, fishing and mountain =\r\nbiking. Laramie is also near many of Colorado&#39;s major cities and university=\r\n communities (e.g. Fort Collins, Boulder, and Denver).  \n\nThe University of=\r\n Wyoming is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer. All qualified=\r\n applicants receive consideration for employment without regard to race, co=\r\nlor, religion, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, age, national origin,=\r\n disability, marital, veteran or any other legally protected status.\n\n\nBest=\r\n regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nVisiting Scientist\nCornell University\njeffclune@corne=\r\nll.edu\njeffclune.com\n\n\n"}}
