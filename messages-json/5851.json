Thanks Ken.\n\nRegarding the question right at the end about applying objective\nsearch once near a good solution. If we take the maze example, I would\nsay that once we have one (or a few) solutions that get through the\nmaze, we can run objective search to find robots that are faster\nand/or take more direct/efficient routes - because the paths followed\nby the robots produced by novelty might tend to wander around a bit.\n\nThis reminds me of Geoff Hinton&#39;s view of back propagation in his\ntalks on deep learning (which I may have mentioned before). Back prop\nis essentially gradient descent towards optimal connection weights,\nbut the error signal is so weaked after being propagated through only\na few layers, that the gradient is pretty much dwarfed by noise. Deep\nlearning solves the problem of finding weights in networks with many\nlayers and thus solves the problem of abstract recognition and\nmodelling. Once you have those weights you can run backprop to\noptimise the solution - and it works well in that role even when\napplied to nets with many layers.\n\nSo the original method that was the focus of much attention (backprop)\nbecame a stepping stone to a much stronger method, but remained as an\noptimisation to the new method. The basic goal and idea was there, but\nthe method is/was too direct in how it goes about finding the goal\nstates.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
