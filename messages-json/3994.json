Ju=\r\nst to be clear though, the actual r(x) function tells the CPPN\nwhere it is =\r\nwithin an agent, while it is the actual x value that\nallows for role differ=\r\nentiation. \n\nAs for method 1b, I actually tired it while doing preliminary\n=\r\nexperiments for the paper.  The results were not quite as good as the\nr(x) =\r\nmethod, which is why we chose to pursue r(x).  The reason for\ndifference is=\r\n that in the r(x) method, the x means both position\nwithin the team and pos=\r\nition within the world.  HyperNEAT can exploit\nthis by relating agent posit=\r\nion in the team to agent position in the\nworld.  For example agents on the =\r\nleft need to turn right to reach the\ncenter, and vice versa.  Using method =\r\n1b decouples the idea of team\nposition and world position, so it is more di=\r\nfficult, but not\nimpossible, for HyperNEAT to make these kind of discoverie=\r\ns.\n\nI am curious about method 2, it does seem a bit like &quot;naming&quot; the\nagent=\r\ns which has shown to be useful in multiagent scenarios.  It is a\nbit more t=\r\nhan that as the names have real meanings and are not\narbitrarily assigned. =\r\n  I would imagine, for HyperNEAT at least, that\nit would be more difficult =\r\nto find global patterns across agents with\nmethod 2, since the CPPN does no=\r\nt have access to that geometric\ninformation.\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Mattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;mattias@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s my u=\r\nnderstanding that the r(x) method (call it method 1a) is\nused to\n&gt; provide =\r\nthe genotype-&gt;phenotype conversion with the information required\n&gt; to produ=\r\nce different phenotypes for different starting positions, in\n&gt; effect, allo=\r\nwing the HyperNEAT framework to create different phenotypes\n&gt; for different=\r\n roles. This could alternatively have been done by\ninputing a\n&gt; fifth posot=\r\nion input node (making the five x1,y1,x2,y2 and Position,\ncall\n&gt; it method =\r\n1b), which would also have allowed the genotype-&gt;phenotype\n&gt; conversion to =\r\nimplement different phenotypes for different roles. \n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion was=\r\n simpler still, to implement the same phenotype for\neach\n&gt; position, but ad=\r\nding an input node (at the phenotype) specifying\nposition\n&gt; (call it method=\r\n 2). This input could be used to inhibit or excite the\n&gt; functioning of nod=\r\nes within the phenotype, depending on position. This\n&gt; would also allow rol=\r\nes to evolve, but using a different method.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a comprehensive invest=\r\nigation, which might be well beyond the\nscope of\n&gt; the research - the paper=\r\n did demonstrate a very successfull test, I&#39;d\n&gt; personally like to see all =\r\nthree methods implemented. 1a and 1b are very\n&gt; similar in reality and geno=\r\ntype-&gt;phenotype conversion has all the\n&gt; information required to switch bet=\r\nween 1a and 1b internally, though\n&gt; supplying the information explicitly as=\r\n per 1b _might_ be more powerful\n&gt; for evolving. \n&gt; \n&gt; with regards,\n&gt; matt=\r\nias\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt;\n&gt; To: ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2008 16:26:47 -0000\n&gt; Subject: [neat=\r\n] Re: Another New Paper:  Multiagent HyperNEAT\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just for the record, =\r\nand for the benefit of the group, isn&#39;t the &quot;r\n&gt; &gt; (x) method&quot; just a mecha=\r\nnism employed within the current \n&gt; &gt; infrastructure limitations, to map mu=\r\nltiple agents within the \n&gt; &gt; substraite and generalize the CPPN to the pre=\r\nsence of the multiple \n&gt; &gt; agents?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
