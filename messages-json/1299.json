In classification tasks, you need to train on a\nbroad representative range of examples that every individual sees. \nThen each individual receives a score reflecting their overall\nperformance on the training set.  That way, you are training for\ngeneralization.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hey group, \n&gt; I&#39;m having a terrible time searching the space for solving a cross\n&gt; product. \n&gt; \n&gt; Fitness is measured by giving it six inputs, one for x,y and z for\neach\n&gt; input vector, and then measuring the absolute error of each of the\nthree\n&gt; output components. \n&gt; \n&gt; Every individual is tested on two different cross products every\n&gt; generation. \n&gt; \n&gt; Every some number of generations ( I call ticks ) the cross product\n&gt; inputs are randomly generated, and the new correct cross product\n&gt; calculated. \n&gt; \n&gt; I limited the network size to 20 neurons, as I figure more than this\n&gt; would be bloat.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been plotting best fitness and average fitness, and it doesn&#39;t\nlook\n&gt; like it will ever converge on a solution (have run 4000\ngenerations, pop\n&gt; size 128). The algorithm does it&#39;s thing before I change the inputs,\n&gt; where the error starts off big, then gets small on an asymptotic\ncurve,\n&gt; but it exactly the same way, over and over, every time I change the\n&gt; inputs. The average fitness looks similar, but is generally moving\ndown\n&gt; from bad to worse. \n&gt; I think this should be a straight forward domain, as the math is\nonly\n&gt; six calculations. What am I doing wrong? \n&gt; \n&gt; chad\n\n\n"}}
