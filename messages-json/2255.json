That recurrent networks can represent any Turing \nmachine is about as practically useful as knowing that you can \ntheoretically build a fully-functioning computer out of water pipes \nand water.  The real question with respect to recurrent NN&#39;s is \nwhat&#39;s reasonably easy to find and represent, not what&#39;s \ntheoretically possible.  Also note that what&#39;s easy to find is not \nalways so much a property of the neural network alone as a property \nof the search process used to generate it combined with the type of \nneural network.  \n\nIn any case, my point is that it certainly merits long and deep \ndiscussion what can or cannot be done with a recurrent network, \nregardless of what is possible in theory, even if all things are \npossible in theory.  We are generally interested in practice, which \nis much more complicated, which is also why it&#39;s fun: There is a lot \nof room for creativity and in fact standard recurrent structures may \nindeed be more difficult to discover than other memory-based \nrealizations such as Hebbian networks.  For this reason, we should \nkeep an open mind.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;johncaloyannis&quot; &lt;johncaloyannis@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hello everybody\n&gt; \n&gt; I started dabbling in AI abouit twenty years ago on and off. For a\n&gt; while  I thought that genetic programming could be an avenue to \nfollow\n&gt; (Koza). However lately I came across the NEAT concept which I found\n&gt; fascinating since it combines the best of both worlds (neural \nnetworks\n&gt; + evolution).\n&gt; I have followed the discussions you guys have with interest. I \nthink\n&gt; that since the recurrent neural networks are intractable\n&gt; mathematically, apart from some very special cases (hopfield), one \ncan\n&gt; only speculate and experiment to learn things.\n&gt; Regarding the discussion about the recurrency question and what a \nRNN\n&gt; can or can not do there is a very interesting paper which proves \nthat\n&gt; there is a turing machine for every RNN and vice-versa. Since \nanything\n&gt; that is computable can be achieved with a turing machine so can it\n&gt; through an RNN. The trick is to find it :)\n&gt; http://www.uwasa.fi/stes/step96/step96/hyotyniemi1\n\n\n\n"}}
