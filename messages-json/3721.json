Here&#39;s the link to the download:\n\nhttp://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.bentley/evodebate.html\n\nKen asked: &quot;How is it possible for 30,000 human genes to encode the\nconnectivity of a 100 trillion-connection brain? And how is it\npossible for evolution to search a space of such astronomical\ncomplexity to discover such a structure?&quot;\n\nI was wondering what Ken thought of the answers to the question. I\nwasn&#39;t much impressed with them. Admittedly it&#39;s a difficult question,\nand the panel admitted that nobody really knows. Jones seemed to say\nthat there might be a lot more information in DNA than we&#39;re giving it\ncredit for, although he brought up Mandelbrot sets as examples of\ncomplicated patterns that can arise from very simple rules.\n\nWolpert didn&#39;t have much to say, though he seemed to say the answer\nmay lie in combinatorics. And Dawkins used the computer code analogy,\ntalking about the reuse of particular sections of code, which probably\ncame closest to providing a decent answer, but none of them seemed\nvery satisfactory to me.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
