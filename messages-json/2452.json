If I ask something that&#39;s terribly\nobvious or =\r\nthat has been researched to death before, please let me\nknow.\n\nNow, as to w=\r\nhat&#39;s in my mind.\n\nIn my current tests with sharpNeat, two relatively obvio=\r\nus things are\nconsistent:\n\n1) The higher the number of inputs and outputs, =\r\nthe longer the time\nthat the network takes to converge to an optimum, by sh=\r\neer virtue of\nthe connecting and weighing possibilities to try\n\n2) The more=\r\n complex the problem, the longer the time that the network\nwill take to con=\r\nverge to an optimum, and the higher the likelihood a\nneural net might not b=\r\ne able to converge to an optimum value\n\nThe first problem can be solved in =\r\nsome cases by applying a smaller\nnetwork to the values separetly.  For inst=\r\nance, to find out which out\nof 4 values is larger, we could\n\na) Create a ne=\r\ntwork with 4 inputs and 1 output, and attempt to train\nit to recognize the =\r\nlarger of four values, and apply it once, or\nb) Create a network with 2 inp=\r\nuts and 1 output, train to to recognize\nthe larger of those two values, and=\r\n a apply it several times (once for\ninputs 1-2, once for inputs 3-4, and on=\r\nce of the result of those)\n\nWhile it might seem a trivial example, in my te=\r\nsts case b converges\nextremely quickly, whereas case b takes forever and ne=\r\nver quites get\nit perfect.  Not only that, but a network that recognizes th=\r\ne larger\nbetween 2 values can be applied multiple times for N, so we don&#39;t\n=\r\nactually need the more complex version.\n\nThe second problem is a similar is=\r\nsue: a complex problem could be\nsolved by breaking it down into smaller pie=\r\nces, training a network to\nsolve each of thesen, and then apply the pieces =\r\nto the whole of the\nproblem.\n\nIf I can break down a problem into smaller pa=\r\nrts, I&#39;m more than happy\nto.   So, suppose we train the several sub-network=\r\ns, or even the\nsimpler case of just needing to apply a copy of the same net=\r\nwork\nmultiple times.  How do we glue them together?\n\nOne approach is, of co=\r\nurse, doing it programatically.  Calling the\nnets, evaluating the outputs, =\r\npassing them to other nets, etc.   Sure,\nthat approach works well for the M=\r\naximizer which we wish to apply\nmultiple times, but could get complicated w=\r\nhen you&#39;re growing a\nnetwork of dissimilar issues (like the second problem =\r\nabove).\n\nWhy not just connect these various neural networks as part of a hy=\r\nbrid\nneural net?  And if we&#39;re doing that, why not apply the same NEAT\ntech=\r\nnique to the this hybrid neural network?   The algorithm would\nprobably hav=\r\ne to be adapted so that it knows that the elements it\ncould randomly add or=\r\n remove are not only neurons but full networks,\nwith varying numbers of inp=\r\nuts and outputs, which need to be\nconnected.\n\nThis may be more trouble than=\r\n it&#39;s worth, or it could already have\nbeen done to death.   Any comments?\n\n=\r\n\n\nRicardo J. M=E9ndez\nhttp://ricardo.strangevistas.net/\n\n"}}
