The advantage of\n&gt; &gt;state vector storage would be in speed. \n&gt; Furthermore,\n&gt; &gt;for certain tasks there may be no way to modify the\n&gt; &gt;weights while solving the problem at hand.  (I\n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt;be wrong about that; I don&#39;t really understand how\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;weights would be modified during one trial of a\n&gt; card\n&gt; &gt;game.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Well exactly, which is why I like to think of weight\n&gt; changes as medium \n&gt; to long term memory and skill acquistion and short\n&gt; term (state) memory \n&gt; as just providing data to already acquired skills.\n\nI agree with your thinking about long & short term\nmemory, and where its stored in an ANN.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
