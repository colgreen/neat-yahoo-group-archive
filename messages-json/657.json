My name is Tyler Streeter.  I am a master&#39;s student \nin Human Computer Interaction at Iowa State University.  \n\nLast fall in an AI class I began working on a project that I called \nAutonomous Virtual Humans.  This involved creating a simulated human \nbody in a physical environment (using Open Dynamics Engine), \ncontrolling the human with a neural network, and training the neural \nnetwork to perform certain behaviors (standing and jumping) with a \ngenetic algorithm.  This page has more details about what I did last \nfall and what I&#39;m currently doing: \nwww.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/avh.html\n\nI stumbled upon NEAT a few months ago and decided to integrate it \ninto my project.  Here&#39;s a Windows executable of my latest version: \nwww.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/files/avh_4-19-04.zip\n\n(Note that I haven&#39;t done anything with file loading or saving yet.  \nSome of the fitness functions need some tweeking.  Actually, a LOT \nof things need some tweeking.  The posted version should just give \nyou a general idea of what I&#39;m trying to do.)\n\nI would love to get feedback from anyone who is interested (and has \na Windows machine; Linux version coming later, btw).  I am planning \nto continue this work as my master&#39;s thesis next year, so I will be \nworking on it for quite a while.\n\nThanks!\n\nTyler Streeter\n\n\n"}}
