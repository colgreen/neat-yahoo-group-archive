The inputs are current\n&gt; and last\n&gt; &gt; ball position (cartesian coordinates), robot position an rotation\n&gt; (for\n&gt; &gt; opponents too) and of course team players current wheel power. You\n&gt; may also\n&gt; &gt; query field bounds to the simulator (and you may set a predicted\n&gt; ball\n&gt; &gt; variable if you do the calculation yourself).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing to keep in mind about robots and robot simulators is that\n&gt; their inputs and outputs are not necessarily in a format that is\n&gt; natural or useful to an NN.  In many cases, it is worth converting\n&gt; from the coordinate system of the robot to an alternative coordinate\n&gt; system that is better for an NN.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, we have found that having two outputs for two wheel\n&gt; powers is not the best format for a neural network to express\n&gt; movements.  Rather, the best seems to be a single outputs for\n&gt; forward/back, and another for left/right.  So like this:\n&gt;\n&gt; Output 1:\n&gt; -1            0                1\n&gt; Backward   Don&#39;t Move          Forward\n&gt;\n&gt; Output 2:\n&gt; -1            0                1\n&gt; Left          Forward          Right\n&gt;\n&gt; So the move is a combination of the 2: move forward or backward\n&gt; and turn the requested angle.\n&gt;\n&gt; This coordinate frame can easily be converted into the left\n&gt; motor/right motor frame, so the right signals can be given to the\n&gt; robot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, cartesian coordinates are not necessarily the best.\n&gt; (Although you should try them to see if they do work)  But an\n&gt; alernative is to set up several radar sensors surrounding the\n&gt; robot and let the radars light up if e.g. the ball is within\n&gt; their arc of sensitivity (the closer the higher the activation).\n&gt; This may be more natural for the NN than cartesian coordinates.  If\n&gt; the simulator gives you cartesian coordinates, they can easily be\n&gt; converted in the more natural radar sensor format.\n&gt;\n&gt; These suggestions are not guaranteed to work best, but my main point\n&gt; is that you should try a variety of sensor/motor configurations and\n&gt; not assume that just because the simulator offers a particular\n&gt; configuration that that is necessarily the best for the NN.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of the main disadvantages for applying a neuroevolution\n&gt; technique with\n&gt; &gt; this simulator is that you can only run the simulator in real time\n&gt; (no\n&gt; &gt; offline fast non-graphic simulation available) so it should take a\n&gt; long time\n&gt; &gt; and patience.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This limitation could be a serious problem, for example if you need to\n&gt; run for hundreds or thousands of generations.  You may want to see if\n&gt; there is some way to hack the system to turn off the graphics.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
