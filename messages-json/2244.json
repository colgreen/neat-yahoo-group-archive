After a couple of days exploring your code, specifically\nthe OCR=\r\n experiment,  I want to complement you on the nice package you\nhave put tog=\r\nether.  Very professionally coded and commented.  I was\nparticularly impres=\r\nsed you went to the trouble to write alternate\nconstructors for many of the=\r\n classes. This level of quality is tough\nto maintain when working on a tool=\r\n primarily for one&#39;s own benefit or\nlearning.\n\nIt&#39;s been well over a year s=\r\nince I did anything serious with C# and\nit&#39;s nice to get back in tune &lt;wink=\r\n&gt; with the language.  Like you, I\nthink the MS team that designed the langu=\r\nage did a very good job of\ncleaning up C++ and the libraries and enjoy work=\r\ning in the C# environment.\n\nAlong with the SharpNEAT system, I downloaded t=\r\nhe handful of articles\non the site.  Have you written any &quot;user documentati=\r\non&quot; along the\nlines of &quot;Design Your Own Experiment&quot; or do I dive in and lea=\r\nrn by\nyour examples?\n\nThanks for all the work you have contributed.\n\nCarl S=\r\ntrange\n\n\n\n\n"}}
