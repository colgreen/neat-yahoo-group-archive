This game requires active use of\n&gt; &gt; memory during the game.  All of the previous ANNs\n&gt; that\n&gt; \n&gt; Very interesting work!  So how many generations is\n&gt; it\n&gt; taking?  Is it approaching perfect play or does it\n&gt; stagnate?\n&gt; It would be great to have a perfect concentration\n&gt; player\n&gt; in a net like this.\n\nThese are very preliminary results.  The results I\nreported were against a totally random opponent.  It\ntakes a few hundred generations to become clearly\nbetter.  With a population of 200 it was taking\nabout11 seconds per generation.  I have no idea how\nclose it is to being a perfect player; I would guess\nnot so close.  The average winning percentage of the\npopulation was about 80% when it always has the first\nmove.\n\nI just this evening got the dual population running. \nThey appear to be evolving against each other, but I\nhave no way of know how good they are!  The\nfirst-movers are winning about 60% of the games and\nthe 2nd movers about 40%.  They might all be playing\nnear-perfect games or all just about like random\nplayers.\n\nThat is an unforeseen problem with co-evolution; you\ncan&#39;t easily tell how they are doing if the evolve\ntogether.  I need to add some objective measure\nbecause I like to know what&#39;s happening.  I won&#39;t use\nthat for evolution, just for observation.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
