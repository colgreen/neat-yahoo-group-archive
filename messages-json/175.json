I still wonder why it needed 44 nodes,\n&gt; but perhaps that\n&gt; does make sense given all the possibilities.\n\nThey are interesting results.  It would be interesting\nto see how NEAT handles a game like Concentration. \nWe&#39;ve all got stuff we&#39;re working on, I suppose, but\nI&#39;ll keep it in mind down the road.  \n\n&gt; When do\n&gt; you need Hebbian\n&gt; connections to learn as opposed to only fixed-weight\n&gt; recurrent\n&gt; connections?  It isn&#39;t clear.  \n\nI did think the results of your paper were very\ninteresting.  The fixed-weight networks evolved better\nperformers more quickly, so the time to search for a\nsolution was smaller.  \n\nBut something I was curious about that I wasn&#39;t sure\nfrom the paper was the efficiency of individual\nnetworks.  You note how self-recurrency on the output\nnodes of the fixed-weight networks leads to an\nefficient way of implementing particular behavior,\nwhile the adaptive networks the behavior is driven\nmore by the hidden nodes, and is more holistic in\nnature.\n\nSince the fixed-weight networks took less time to\nevolve, I&#39;m assuming that the networks also had fewer\nnodes and connections than the adaptive ones.  Is this\na false assumption?  \n\nSince it&#39;s a real-time domain, the speed with which an\nindividual makes decisions is important.  So the time\nit takes for input signals to propagate through the\nnet and produce output is very important, isn&#39;t it?\n\n&gt; And what is the\n&gt; capacity of a\n&gt; fixed-weight recurrent network to remember\n&gt; information?\n\nYeah, that&#39;s a good question.  I believe Mitchell said\nthat he had poor results when starting out with a\n6-card game.  Do you plan to take another whack at a\nlarger domain, Mitchell?  I&#39;d be very interested to\nsee how things change as the problem scales up.\n\nDerek\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
