Lik=\r\ne one output connected to only one or a few inputs \ninstead of fully connec=\r\nted. This way evolution can choose to connect \nonly inputs that are necessa=\r\nry for high fitness. \nUsing subtractive mutations does help (using a mixtur=\r\ne of additive \nand subtractive mutations is a blended search), but is not n=\r\necessary \nfor FS-NEAT to work. In fact, using a fully connected starting ge=\r\nnome \nand subtractive mutations can be considered another form of feature \n=\r\nselection since this way evolution can cut off connections from the \nunnece=\r\nssary inputs. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zinoo4&quot; &lt;zinoo4@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,everyone & happy new year!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using neat for my proje=\r\nct\n&gt; and that&#39;s wonderful & very useful \n&gt; \n&gt; I have used rt-neat until now=\r\n,\n&gt; and now I want to use fs(feature selective) neat\n&gt; and i have heard rt-=\r\nneat support it\n&gt; \n&gt; How it support fs-neat?\n&gt; I have found next params\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;     mutate_toggle_enable_prob \n&gt;     mutate_gene_reenable_prob \n&gt;     mut=\r\nate_rem_link_prob \n&gt;     mutate_rem_link_percent \n&gt; in the rt-neat&#39;s parame=\r\nter file(param.ini)\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if  it is related to the FS-NEAT capabili=\r\nty,\n&gt;  and then if it is related,  how much figure(or range) is properly \n&gt;=\r\n needed for params?\n&gt; \n&gt; for example, \n&gt; mutate_toggle_enable_prob 0.2\n&gt; mu=\r\ntate_gene_reenable_prob 0.05\n&gt; mutate_rem_link_prob  0.1\n&gt; mutate_rem_link_=\r\npercent 0.1\n&gt; \n&gt; I really need your knowledge and advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; And, if abov=\r\ne parameter value is not related to fs-neat, \n&gt; i wonder what pamameter is =\r\nrelated to fs-neat capability.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please give answers, thank you for r=\r\neading.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
