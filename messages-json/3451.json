I \n&gt; also \n&gt; &gt; am not really sure what t=\r\nhe requirements really are for a fitness \n&gt; &gt; function, I couldn&#39;t locate a=\r\nny guidelines in the literature so I \n&gt; &gt; have just been using the sum of r=\r\newards over one 20 second trial.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was also wondering where in the=\r\n training does the value \nfunction \n&gt; &gt; converge over hundreds if not thous=\r\nands of episodes?
