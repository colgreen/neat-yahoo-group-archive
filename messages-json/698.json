Even this \nflailing body on the ground is alternating its legs, albeit in an \nunproductive way.  But how can that alternation be present at \ngeneration 0?  Obviously they somehow forced it that way.  I think \nit&#39;s pretty exciting because I doubt they have the same quality \nneuroevolution technology as NEAT, which suggests that the problem \nactually isn&#39;t that hard given the right constraints, which implies \nTyler could possibly evolve even more sophisticated behaviors than \nthese guys have.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wow, that&#39;s pretty nice!  Did you see the demo of their evolution:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.naturalmotion.com/pages/technology_hiw.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s very strange that it&#39;s walking well after only 20 \ngenerations.  \n&gt; It makes you wonder what constraints they put in there.  However, \nit \n&gt; does show this pursuit is feasible.  But it clearly needs the \nright \n&gt; joint controls, fitness function, and possible constraints.  For \n&gt; example, maybe it must be impossible for it to move both legs \n&gt; forward at the same time?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ai_junkie_dot_com&quot; &lt;fup@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I think you guys might be interested in taking a look at this:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.naturalmotion.com/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They have had considerable success with evolving human motion. \n&gt; There&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; not a lot to read but you&#39;ll enjoy watching the demos.\n\n\n"}}
