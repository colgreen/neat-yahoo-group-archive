Sort of\n&gt; obvious huh.\n&gt; - Biological organisms have no way of assessing\n&gt; genetic compatibility \n&gt; directly and therefore use phenotype as an indirect\n&gt; way of assessing \n&gt; this compatibility. After all, similar genotypes\n&gt; will normally result in \n&gt; similar phenotypes.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few points here:\n&gt; 1) I think I&#39;ve made this point before - we have a\n&gt; very limited amout of \n&gt; computational power to hand when compared to nature.\n&gt; Therefore if we can \n&gt; make shortcuts then we should do so. So, because we\n&gt; have direct access \n&gt; to the genomes we should then compare them directly\n&gt; if it makes sense to \n&gt; do so. There is no point simulating systems that\n&gt; came about to solve a \n&gt; problem that we (within simulations) do not have.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) As has been pointed out, nature&#39;s technique is by\n&gt; no means perfect. \n&gt; Consider predators that mimick some part of a prey&#39;s\n&gt; phenotype in order \n&gt; to pretend to be a potential mate, thus luring them\n&gt; into eating range \n&gt; :)  This can be a familiar (sexy) shape or the\n&gt; emitting of a pheromone, \n&gt; etc.  If nature had direct access to genomes then\n&gt; the poor old prey \n&gt; would be able to determine that the potential mate\n&gt; over there is in fact \n&gt; a predator, and to &#39;leg it&#39;(as we say in the UK)\n&gt; poste haste!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; So is this the full story? Does phenotype comparison\n&gt; have /any/ possible \n&gt; use within simulations? Or is it the case that the\n&gt; the only useful role \n&gt; of phenotype is in it&#39;s expression within an\n&gt; environment so that we can \n&gt; assess its fitness? I think it does have a use...\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider an indirect encoding under which a very\n&gt; small mutation DID give \n&gt; rise to a significant and beneficial change in the\n&gt; phenotype. We now \n&gt; have organisms that have almost identical genotype\n&gt; but a significantly \n&gt; different phenotype. For comic potential let&#39;s say\n&gt; this creature grew an \n&gt; extra eye on the back of it&#39;s head, and that this\n&gt; was quite good for \n&gt; spotting oncoming predators. In nature it is quite\n&gt; possible that \n&gt; creatures without this mutation (and perhaps even\n&gt; those with it) would \n&gt; see the &#39;mutants&#39; as being less desirable mates,\n&gt; because they do not \n&gt; meet the criteria for a good mate based upon what\n&gt; they know. This could \n&gt; actually be one way in which new species arise. The\n&gt; mutants, rejected by \n&gt; what they consider to be good mates, now mate with\n&gt; the next best \n&gt; thing... another mutant. Thus a rudamentary form of\n&gt; speciation has come \n&gt; about.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we were comparing genotypes then this speciation\n&gt; never would have \n&gt; occured. Was the speciation in this example actually\n&gt; useful? I think it \n&gt; was because it effectively focused a new\n&gt; evolutionary search around the \n&gt; mutation by forcing mutants to mate with each other.\n&gt; If the mutants \n&gt; continued to mate with non-mutatnts as normal then\n&gt; the mutation would \n&gt; still become dominant eventually through selection -\n&gt; but this would have \n&gt; occured at a slower rate.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I recon phenotype comparison can be useful over\n&gt; and above plain \n&gt; genome comparison. It&#39;s a bit of a concocted\n&gt; scenario but there it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether this is of any use within simulations is, I\n&gt; suspect,  yet \n&gt; another question for research. As Derek and Mitchell\n&gt; were (sort of) \n&gt; saying earlier, we need to pick-and-choose\n&gt; techniques employed by the \n&gt; biological world in order to obtain a balance\n&gt; between simplicity and \n&gt; efficacy with the limited computational resources we\n&gt; have to hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
