I think this may actually be the first \nnon \n&gt; neural net use of NEAT, unless Ken knows otherwise. I know he&#39;s \noften \n&gt; mentioned that the NEAT technique isn&#39;t constrained to just ANN&#39;s.\n&gt; \n\nActually a few non-neural things have been done, though they aren&#39;t \nwidely known. Stephanie Forrest at University of New Mexico had her \ngrad class evolve finite state automata with a subset of NEAT.  \nThere was a student at Michigan State who did a NEAT-like evolution \nof fuzzy controller logic.  A group in Brazil evolved RBF networks \nusing complexification, and a student in Romania evolved Bayesian \nnetworks using NEAT.  Finally, Nate Kohl, a Ph.D. student here at UT \nAustin, actually created a NEAT-based L-system indirect encoding \nevolution system for objects (not NNs), but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s \npursuing that anymore, though I thought it was a very cool system.\nI&#39;m probably forgetting some others.\n\nAnyway, the RETE stuff is totally new to me, and looks like a \npromising domain for NEAT.  I&#39;m kind of intererested, Greg, if you \ncould summarize a little how the RETE networks are currently built?  \nIs it by hand, or through some deterministic process?  And what are \nthe flaws with the current way of building them that NEAT might \novercome?  Do the RETE networks currently tend to be suboptimal in \nsome way?\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
