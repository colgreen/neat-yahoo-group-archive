Do you use plain tanh e.g. y=tanh(x) , or some \nvariation? The reason I ask is that while playing around with gnuplot I \nnoticed that tanh describes a sigmoid over the y range -1,1 whereas I \nhave been using functions with a y range of 0,1\n\nThe distinction is quite important because with a minimum of zero, \nnegative connection weights have the effect of damping other inputs, \ne.g. a large negative input signal will cancel out any other signals and \ngive an output of 0. That 0 can not then go on to activate further \nneurons. In contrast tanh will output -1, which is a signal that can go \non to have influence as it propagates through the network.\n\nI don&#39;t know enough to say whether this is bad or not, but it at least \nseems like an important distinction to make.\n\nAnyway I most often use the steepened sigmoid function from one of Ken&#39;s \npapers:\n\ny = 1/1+exp(-4.9*x))\n\nand this looks exactly the same as tanh after applying a bit of scaling \nand shifting:\n\ny = tanh(2.45*x)/2 + 0.5\n\nMy maths isn&#39;t great, but I would guess these can be proven to be \nmathematically equivalent.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
