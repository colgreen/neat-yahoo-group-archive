In other w=\r\nords, it entirely abandons objectives and\nthereby also abandons fitness fun=\r\nctions as the impetus for search. \nYet remarkably, we still show that such =\r\nan algorithm can perform\n*better* than one that actually tries to achieve t=\r\nhe objective!  I\nbelieve this strange result has fascinating implications f=\r\nor machine\nlearning, artificial life, and even biology.\n\nLately on this for=\r\num we have often discussed the nagging problem that\nthe fitness function of=\r\nten does not properly recognize or reward the\nstepping stones on the way to=\r\n the solution.  I went as far as\nsuggesting that the fitness function can b=\r\necome an *obstacle* to\nsuccess (e.g. when we discussed creativity in Picbre=\r\neder).\n\nWhile this discussion was largely philosophical, Joel Lehman and I\n=\r\ndecided to make it concrete and actually introduce an algorithm that\nmakes =\r\nan automated evolutionary process in *any* domain behave like\nhumans in Pic=\r\nbreeder, that is, like open-ended evolution.  This\napproach is called &quot;nove=\r\nlty search.&quot;  The algorithm simply searches\nfor behavior that is novel with=\r\n respect to what has come before.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that it =\r\nis immune to deception because\nit does not even try to achieve the objectiv=\r\ne.  I know it seems\nstrange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact i=\r\nt is far more\neffective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive lands=\r\ncape than\nfitness-based search.  \n\nIn other words, what we are saying is th=\r\nat to achieve some of the most\nambitious objectives we might have for evolu=\r\ntion, we must abandon\ntrying to explicitly achieve them.  To quote from the=\r\n end of our\nDiscussion section:\n\n&quot;In summary, almost like a riddle, novelty=\r\n search suggests\na surprising new perspective on achievement: To achieve\nyo=\r\nur highest goals, you must be willing to abandon them.&quot;\n\nI believe this les=\r\nson is true in practice and is therefore beyond a\nphilosophical curiosity. =\r\n In fact, we are instinctively familiar with\nit in life in general when peo=\r\nple say things like &quot;You are trying too\nhard&quot; or when we focus so much on s=\r\nomething so far ahead of us in life\nthat we forget completely to solve the =\r\nshort term problems that stand\nin our way.  It is no less true in evolution=\r\n or search in general.\n\nFor NEAT, novelty search should open up new opportu=\r\nnities for\ndiscovery that were previously closed off to us.  \n\nI look forwa=\r\nrd to hearing your thoughts on this work.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
