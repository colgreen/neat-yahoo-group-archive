This has necessitated \nmy =\r\nbacking-out the current implementation boundaries. A portion of \nthe materi=\r\nals supplied are a sharing of that work product in hopes \nthat it may be he=\r\nlpful to others.\n\nI am uncertain, but it appears that your reply presumes t=\r\nhat the flow \nof development of the shared HyperNEAT concept is one-way, wh=\r\nich \npresently is not the case. I am well aware of the benefit of an \nappro=\r\npriate and timely example. But no teacher, using your example, \nhas to conv=\r\nince his students to expend the effort required to \nunderstand. It is a pre=\r\n-requisite. Examples follow from demonstrated \neffort at understanding, and=\r\n are point specific. I merely stated that \nnecessity is an effective motiva=\r\ntor.\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason G&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nMaybe this is sophomoric, but I can&#39;t seem to understand your point \nof vie=\r\nw\n&gt; on this.  If everyone believed that the only compelling examples \nare s=\r\nimilar\n&gt; to their own problems, then everyone would walk around speaking hi=\r\ns \nor her\n&gt; own language. No one would be able to gain common understanding=\r\n, \nwhich is a\n&gt; necessity for progress.  Although it&#39;s true that one can on=\r\nly \ndisprove\n&gt; things with examples and never fully prove things, anyone wh=\r\no&#39;s \ntaught a\n&gt; school course, whether it is university or pre-kindergarten=\r\n, \nrecognizes the\n&gt; benefit of distilling information into it&#39;s important c=\r\nomponents.  \nThis is\n&gt; typically done by using an example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ironically =\r\nenough, maybe an example will explain what I mean:  \nLet&#39;s say\n&gt; that the f=\r\nirst papers on HyperNEAT involved using it as a \ndiscriminator in\n&gt; part of=\r\n a larger system (something which I am currently making good \nprogress\n&gt; in=\r\n), it becomes harder to both explain the HyperNEAT component of \nthe system=\r\n\n&gt; and to prove how large a part is has played in the overall design.  \nPeo=\r\nple\n&gt; who are not familiar with the larger system now have to understand \nt=\r\nhe\n&gt; entire system in order to fully appreciate HyperNEAT&#39;s role in that \ns=\r\nystem.\n&gt; For every person who accepts the result, there&#39;s a person who \narg=\r\nues either\n&gt; that HyperNEAT did not play a large enough role in the larger =\r\n\nsystem, or\n&gt; that the use of HyperNEAT is somehow limited to this system a=\r\nnd \nother\n&gt; systems just like it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that, in general, the use of=\r\n geometry in machine learning is\n&gt; something that hasn&#39;t been exploited unt=\r\nil now.  While people have \ntried to\n&gt; work around this by performing some =\r\nspatial preprocessing to the \ninput data\n&gt; before it enters the learning ag=\r\nent, no one has developed a \nlearning agent\n&gt; which inherently possesses th=\r\nis ability.  Now that we have a system \nwhich\n&gt; uses geometry, it becomes i=\r\nmportant for everyone to understand the \nsystem\n&gt; and to baseline their kno=\r\nwledge. There is no easier way to do this \nthan to\n&gt; show an example which =\r\nanyone can understand and recreate.  \nReproducibility\n&gt; is one of the most =\r\nimportant aspects of research.\n&gt; \n&gt; Examples aren&#39;t only seen in research. =\r\n If you look at people who \nsubmit\n&gt; bugs to GCC, they make it a point to e=\r\nxplain the GCC bug using an \nexample\n&gt; which is 10-15 lines of code, even i=\r\nf the bug something which is \nonly found\n&gt; in larger projects, like multipl=\r\ne inheritance with templates.  I&#39;m \nsure the\n&gt; bug submitter wasn&#39;t really =\r\ntrying to &quot;solve&quot; multiple inheritance \nwith\n&gt; templates, as you say, but i=\r\nt was more of a &quot;bump in the road&quot; \nwhich needed\n&gt; to be addressed with a s=\r\nimple example so it could be fixed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, with regards to the exp=\r\neriment in the GECCO paper, we \naren&#39;t all\n&gt; throwing our hats in the air b=\r\necause we solved the big-block little-\nblock\n&gt; problem in computer science.=\r\n  What we are doing now is laying down \nthe\n&gt; foundation so that in the nea=\r\nr future we can say &quot;If you want to \nunderstand\n&gt; how this works, check out=\r\n the GECCO 2007 paper which has an \nintroduction to\n&gt; HyperNEAT and an expe=\r\nriment&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, and this is purely my opinion, writing formalisms an=\r\nd \nclosures to\n&gt; find out the exact limitations of a system in flux seems l=\r\nike \ntrying to\n&gt; catch the wind in a bottle.  The more fruitful exercises i=\r\nnvolve \ndebate and\n&gt; understanding, two forces which are shifting those lim=\r\nitations \nconstantly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 5/21/07, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;   Jason,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In my experience, the only compelling examples are thos=\r\ne that are\n&gt; &gt; similar to the problems you are trying to solve.
