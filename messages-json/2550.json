Is it still running?\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n\nWell I had to kill it after a while because I discovered a bug in my \nexperimental speciation code.\n\nBut the population sizes did remain in a very reasonable range for as \nlong as I left it.\n\nSo I&#39;m doing another run now, I started it yesterday morning and its \nnearly up to 4,000,000 cycles...\n\nI&#39;ve made a &quot;SLEAT&quot; folder in the files section and put a couple of \ngraphs of it in there.  They may need a little explaining.  I&#39;m using \na prototype advanced speciation technique (oh, and I also use my \nEC-like &quot;variance&quot; parameter on all weights and FIDs, I don&#39;t know \nwhether it helps but it certainly doesn&#39;t seem to hinder anything...).\n\nSo the speciation works that I run the main species (fitness in red) \nuntil it stalls for 100,000 cycles (the side population appears as \nzeros on the graphs during this phase).  Then I take one individual, \nmutate it to pieces and use it to see the side population.  I then \nrun the side population until it stalls (the main population appears \nfrozen at its last value during this phase).  I then merge the two \npopulations (by one of several experimental techniques) overwrite the \nmain population with the result, scrap the side-population and return \nto the initial phase (exolving main).\n\nSo far it has reached about 91.7%, which is very good for two days \nprocessing (compared to my previous speeds).\n\nWhat I am thinking is, I will push this one for a little more to see \nif it can get much better, when I do think it&#39;s stalled, I will pull \nout the fittest individual and use it as a start-point for \ninvestigating further &quot;stall busting&quot; approaches.\n\nGetting back to bloat, I think I have demonstrated an important point \nhere, in that my previous &quot;keep everything&quot; breeding (e.g. the \n&quot;standard&quot; approach) was clearly never at equilibrium, and if you had \nseen these graphs for that (which you never could because it is so \nslow that we would all die of old-age waiting for them) the size \ncurve would look pretty much exponential...\n\nAs you see, this new approach is much better behaved, and wobbles up \nand down in what looks to me far more like a random walk than a \nheadlong charge towards infinity...\n\nI am also inclined to say that the system as I have it has a net \ndrive towards smaller individuals (look at the line of the purple and \nblue curves from 2.5 MCycles upwards) and that the individuals (i) \ngrow in size when it is discovering additions that make then fitter, \nbut, (ii) then slowly squeezes their existing fitness into a smaller \ngenomes when they are not finding any obvious additions.\n\nThere&#39;s a solid mathematical reason why the net drive is downwards, \nwhich I am aching to explain to you all.  Does anybody want to know?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
