In \nHyperNEAT the cross=\r\nover is different, there you actually do a regular \nNEAT evolution of netwo=\r\nrks that build other networks based on the \nsubstrate configuration. That i=\r\ns, you only mate and mutate the CPPNs. \nBut in the case you get lots of ind=\r\nividuals with equal fitness, I \nguess these individuals are clones. Perhaps=\r\n the code frequently \nchooses the same individuals for mating? You can try =\r\nto avoid this by \nintroducing a loop in which you try candidates for a &quot;fat=\r\nher&quot; that are \nnot compatible with the mother, that is, when their compatib=\r\nility \ndistance is 0.00, try again. There is another possibility, simply \ne=\r\nvery mutation disturbs the CPPN and therefore the produced network is \nchan=\r\nged in such a magnitude that is has no chance for survival and is \ndiscarde=\r\nd. Even though there is speciation. \n\nPeter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nJeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Does crossover do anythi=\r\nng in PNEAT and HyperNEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; PNEAT:\n&gt; If I am reading the code correctly=\r\n, during crossover, if the \nsubstrates are\n&gt; the same (i.e. all links have =\r\nthe same ID), which is always the case \nin\n&gt; P-NEAT, *all* of the link valu=\r\nes are taken from either parent1 or \nparent2.\n&gt; Isn&#39;t it more normal when c=\r\nrossing over to take some from parent1 \nand some\n&gt; from parent2? Why grab a=\r\nll from just one?\n&gt; \n&gt; This means that in PNEAT crossover does nothing, rig=\r\nht? It will \nalways grab\n&gt; the substrate of parent1 or the substrate of par=\r\nent2.  If I track \nparent and\n&gt; offspring fitness, 100% of the time the chi=\r\nld has the exact same \nfitness as\n&gt; one of the two parents.\n&gt; \n&gt; On to Hype=\r\nrNEAT:\n&gt; \n&gt; I tracked the fitness of each parent and the resulting offsprin=\r\ng. \nThe odd\n&gt; thing is that the organisms that are crossed only (i.e. they =\r\nare \nnever\n&gt; mutated) have the *exact* same fitness of one of their parents=\r\n \n98.88% of the\n&gt; time. In 20 runs, that was only 136 orgs out of 12257 tha=\r\nt were \ncrossed over\n&gt; and not mutated. That seems wrong, doesn&#39;t it? Why w=\r\nould these new \nlinks\n&gt; have such a small impact? It turns out that this is=\r\n because nearly \nevery\n&gt; time that there is an extra link that gets placed =\r\nin the child, the \nparent\n&gt; that donated that link is also the parent whose=\r\n weights are being \ngrabbed,\n&gt; meaning that the crossover is only copying t=\r\nhe parent (hence the \nsame\n&gt; fitness). It seems to me that crossover should=\r\n be much more \ndisruptive, no?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As a final test, I did a set of hype=\r\nrneat and pneat runs with the \ndefault\n&gt; &#39;MutateOnlyProbability&#39; parameter =\r\nset to .25, so 25% of orgs never \nare\n&gt; candidates for crossover. I then ra=\r\nn experimental treatments\n&gt; hyperneat-noCross and pneat-noCross where the M=\r\nutateOnlyProbability\n&gt; parameter was set to 1, so no orgs were crossed over=\r\n. Despite my \ncomments\n&gt; above, Hyperneat (with cross) did beat HyperNEAT-n=\r\noCross, however \nthe\n&gt; difference was not tremendous (although it does seem=\r\n to be \nstatistically\n&gt; significant). For p-neat, the reverse was true. Nev=\r\nertheless, this \nis not a\n&gt; perfect test of whether crossover pays dividend=\r\ns, because if \ncrossover does\n&gt; nothing most of the time, and I increase Mu=\r\ntateOnlyProbability from \n.25 to\n&gt; 1, I have effectively raised the mutatio=\r\nn rate (only 80% of crossed \norgs are\n&gt; also mutated).\n&gt; \n&gt; Are these the i=\r\nntended consequences of crossover, or am I missing \nsomething?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jc=\r\nlune@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
