It is &quot;alive&quot; for about 5 \ntimesteps, in o=\r\nrder to use some reccurence. \n\nI think about the rotation.. So, let&#39;s clear=\r\n things out. \nA point (X,Y) is rotated with angle (Aplha) to (X1, Y1).  \nTh=\r\nis is a function, taking 3 arguments and returning 2. \n\nx1=3D y*sin(alpha) =\r\n+ x*cos(alpha)\ny1=3D y*cos(alpha) - x*sin(alpha)\n\nI think this cannot be co=\r\nvered by a single neuron, but a cluster of \nneurons with sin() and cos() ac=\r\ntivation functions.. Am I right? \nLet&#39;s say that we have 2 inputs (x, y) an=\r\nd a bias node in the CPPN. \nFurther, we have 2 hidden nodes, one is &quot;sine&quot; =\r\nother is &quot;cosine&quot;. \nThese hidden nodes are both connected to the bias. The =\r\nbias here is \nour &quot;alpha&quot; value. \nThen, we can imagine how these nodes shou=\r\nld be connected to construct \nthis formula above. We need linear outputs, a=\r\nnd maybe some additional \nlinear nodes with multiplying summing functions (=\r\nto represent the \nmultiplications by x and y)... \n\nSimilar, translation can=\r\n be handled even easier. The main coordinate \nframes has to be connected to=\r\n 2 linear nodes, where an addition to a \nbias occurs in each. \n\nScaling is =\r\nin fact everywhere, since the weights of the connections \ncan be thought of=\r\n as scalars of the coordinate frames. \n\nSo, that were the 3 main transforma=\r\ntions.. :) \nBut the rotation seems hard to evolve.. And using linear nodes =\r\nand \nmultiplying summing functions (before the activation) is important.\n\nP=\r\neter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; - My current experiments with ActiveVision show that it is hard =\r\n\nto \n&gt; &gt; evolve substrates that recognize simple shapes that are randomly \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; rotated. Perhaps I should tweak the NEAT parameters or the set of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nactivation functions? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter, in the experiment you are describin=\r\ng, are you using a roving \neye \n&gt; or just inputting a whole image into the =\r\nsubstrate?  With \nHyperNEAT, it \n&gt; should be possible to do recognition tas=\r\nks without needing a roving \neye.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I believe rotational in=\r\nvariance is indeed an \nactivation \n&gt; function issue.  The problem is that y=\r\nou need to get the same \npattern \n&gt; of connects repeated in a rotating fash=\r\nion, so that they can \nrecognize \n&gt; rotated images.  This kind of rotation =\r\nis not a very natural \nbyproduct \n&gt; of the usual set of activation function=\r\ns.  I believe there is \nprobably \n&gt; a rotational activation function that w=\r\nould be quite helpful, but I \n&gt; have not resolved what function that should=\r\n be.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
