Certainly before the days of dedicated built-in FPUs \nfloating point math was painfully slow. But even in todays CPUs with \nhighly optimized FPUs I think that integer math executes faster than \nfloating point.  Coming up with an integer based activation function \nmight be a problem. In the paper I read one way was to use a load \ndifferent lines functions for diferent ranges of X and then a lookup \ntable for the sigma curve.\n\nEliminating the need to call trig functions in the activation function \nis itself another signifiant optimization.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
