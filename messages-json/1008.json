Ironically, a striking example of convergent\n&gt;cognitive evolution, if I ever saw one!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s certainly been a very active group just recently and I&#39;ve found it \nvery interesting and useful to have a group of like minded folks \nbouncing ideas around.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; [stuff about genome encodings]\n\nWell I actually started out by devising an indirect encoding based on a \ngenome with a tree structure. What I realised was, that without \nsomething to compare against I couldn&#39;t determine if the technique was \nbetter than the more simple direct encodings out there. So anyway, I \ncame to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to explore the \nlimits of direct encodings before moving on to the rather daunting task \nof devising and researching indirect encodings. I&#39;ve read the &#39;Taxonomy \nfor Artificial Embryogeny&#39; paper and definitely recommend you have a \nlook at it, I agree that indirect encodings are a very intersting area \nof research and that they represent what is probably THE single most \ninteresting (and challenging) problem in AI research today.\n\nActually, I don&#39;t know how others feel about this but I&#39;m sometimes \nslightly baffled at just how underdevelped this areas of AI research is \nand that some of this work wasn&#39;t done years ago!\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
