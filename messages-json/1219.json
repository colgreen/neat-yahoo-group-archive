How are you generating them?\n\nPerl module GD::Graph.  Works pretty well, and is pretty easy to use.\n\n&gt;There&#39;s a definite rise in the current fitness graph, seems to be\n&gt;levelling off at the momement though.\n\nYep.  That happened last time, too.  Then as the current champions become \nstagnant and die off, all that is left are the less fit members, and so the \nmax fitness graph could angle back downward for a time.\n\n\n\n"}}
