I wonder if some of you have thoughts as to\nthe kinds of domains that most benefit from such a process?  It&#39;s\ninteresting to see the experiments people have tried with NEAT, like\nMattias&#39; evolved gaits and Darren&#39;s eye.  But do you believe there is\nsome ultimate open-ended type of domain that is &quot;made for&quot;\ncomplexification?\n\nI tried to make the robot duel open ended in the sense I&#39;m talking\nabout.  But it isn&#39;t *truly* open ended...there is a point after which\nyou can&#39;t really do much better.  It is actually quite hard to think\nof domains that are totally open ended and support ever-increasing\ncomplexity.\n\nBoard games like Go are certainly complex enough to support extremely\ncomplex structures, so that might be one domain.  But are there more\nbiologically-inspired domains (like predator/prey) that can be truly\nopen ended?  Derek, Philip, and I talked a bit about this when we met\nat the AI Conference.  It is a pretty big question in artificial life:\nwhat is the definition of world that supports unbounded continual\nprogress?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
