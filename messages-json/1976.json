The broadcast was on channel 36 here \n&gt; at 4pm today.  In case you are curious about what we&#39;re like in \n&gt; person, or NERO (which is coming soon), here is a link with a video \n&gt; clip (click on the little camera icon):\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=3381601&nav=0s3caC93\n\nWell done Ken!  It&#39;s interesting to finally be able to put a voice and\nsome mannerisms to that picture of yours on your homepage.\n\n&gt; Keep in mind there was an hour-and-a-half interview spliced into 3 \n&gt; minutes of soundbites...so it&#39;s not exactly the way we said things.  \n&gt; However, all things considered, it&#39;s not bad.\n\nWould be nice if they let you edit it yourself, but that&#39;s probably\nnot too realistic for every news story that they do.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
