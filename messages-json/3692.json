The beauty of a\nsource control system is that you do not hav=\r\ne to take time out someday\nto merge bits of the other releases into the mai=\r\nn code, anybody could\ninstead apply patches against the main release or rel=\r\nease patches\nanywhere.\nNo problem that there isn&#39;t one at the moment of cou=\r\nrse, It was just\nto confirm so I didn&#39;t go off modifying an out of date ver=\r\nsion :)...\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; In response to the original question I think the sugg=\r\nestion given\nwas about\n&gt; right - override the population evaluator class be=\r\ning used\n&gt; (e.gSingleFilePopulationEvaluator) and get it to evaluate agains=\r\nt the\n&gt; validation\n&gt; cases and set the SearchCompleted flag when the valida=\r\ntion set\n&gt; fitness starts to fall (or falls for several generations in a ro=\r\nw,\nor falls\n&gt; below N% of the best validation score).\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the repos=\r\nitories, there is no central location for all\nvariations of\n&gt; SharpNEAT, bu=\r\nt then that&#39;s the beauty of open source in that you can\njust\n&gt; release your=\r\n own version without having to get the approval of the\noriginal\n&gt; author or=\r\n authors.

Or does anybody know if there =\r\nany Neat implementations/code\n&gt; &gt; &gt; snippets etc out there (SharpNeat or ot=\r\nherwise) that support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cross-validation?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I am fairly ne=\r\nw to NEAT, I begun by searching around for\nSharpNeat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and noticed that=\r\n there are at least three different implementations:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SourceForge, cod=\r\neplex and a version supporting HyperNeat/.NET\n2.0. Is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there by chance=\r\n a central CVS/Subversion repository coordinating\nthese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; together wher=\r\ne the SharpNeat project is maintained and/or the\npatches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for update v=\r\nersions available?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keith.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;petervermont&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;pandrews@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the recent thread &quot;New To NEAT - A few Newbie Ques=\r\ntions&quot;\nKen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What you do is evaluate each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ge=\r\nneration on the training set and test the champion of each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;generat=\r\nion on the validation set. When the validation scores\nstart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;going =\r\ndown, you stop evolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using SharpNEAT and am new t=\r\no all this so I would\nappreciate a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little more detail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I have implemented two interface, IExperiment and\nINetworkEvaluator.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither interface appears to have any concept of a generation\nor of a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; champion. It looks to me like I might want/need to subclass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; SingleFilePopulationEvaluator so that I can override\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EvaluatePopu=\r\nlation. I can then call the superclass&#39;\nEvaluatePopulation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and afte=\r\nr it completes do my validation testing on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm&#39;s=\r\n BestGenome. I was then thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that once I wished to stop evoluti=\r\non, I could set the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm SearchCompleted boolean. Fin=\r\nally, I can modify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SharpNeatGui&#39;s SearchThread to check the ea&#39;s Se=\r\narchCompleted\nflag so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the thread will stop.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am=\r\n I on the right track here?
