I have a few intuitions about them which you might \n&gt;like to argue with:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) They&#39;re big.  And for any really interesting question (like how to play \n&gt;chess) they&#39;re not big like the universe is big, they&#39;re _much_ larger than \n&gt;that.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAlso, quite often they have a lot more than 3 dimensions.\n\n&gt;3) Increased connectivity pulls points closer together and speeds evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;4) Increased connectivity increases the size of &quot;neighborhood&quot; around each \n&gt;point, and slows evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;5) So there&#39;s a trade-off between 3 and 4, which is problem dependent and \n&gt;nobody knows how to estimate the best compromise.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPutting my phased search hat on for a moment. Perhaps switching between \ndifferent types of mutation could be beneficial, the search could spend \ntime finding a local optimum in the current landscape, and then we \nchange the landscape to search for wdier solutions, if we find one then \nswitch back to searching for local solutions. This is a generalisation \nof course, you could have many different fitness landscape schemes to \nchoose from. So just periodically cycling through different schemes \nmight be better than any one scheme on it&#39;s own. One very rudamentary \nimplementation of this idea would be to periodically take a champion \ngenome from NEAT and to just perform weight mutation (no topology \nmutations), in order to find the optimal weights fro the current best \ntoplogy.\n\n&gt;         Again this brings home to me that any evolving software technique \n&gt;really needs functional, automatic modularity before it has any hope of \n&gt;breaking into the BIG problems.  Modularity entails a trade off very like \n&gt;(5) in that the presence of modularity increases the size of the overall \n&gt;search space (adding choices about how to define modules) but hugely \n&gt;decreases the size of the parts that are considered at one time (e.g. each \n&gt;modules fitness landscape is much, much smaller than the overall fitness \n&gt;landscape.).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIn the mean time it&#39;s a good idea to investigate the limits of direct \nencoding techniques such as NEAT. With a great many experiments and all \nideas exhausted research can them move on to modular or indirect \napproaches, using the best direct encoding technques as a benchmark.  I \nalso think that NEAT could form the core of an indirect encoding \ntechnique in the future, finding sub-solutions that can then be \nrecombined into larger solutions. I think I just walked into that trap \nof thinking in a &#39;divide and conquer&#39; / engineering manner again :)\n\nAnyway I have serious doubts about how well indirect techniques can work \nwithout much faster computers or at least enough money to buy computers \nfast enough. e.g. see \nhttp://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2004Jul/bch20040730026275.htm\n\nAnyone got $3.5 million to spare? :)\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
