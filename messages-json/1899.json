I have a couple of questions regarding the fitness penalty \nfor species that have gone past the dropoff_age point with no improvement.\n\nIn the C++ version of NEAT that I downloaded, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any \ncheck to see if the species being penalized is one of the top (if not *the* \ntop) performers.  The literature I&#39;ve read on NEAT says &quot;in order to prevent \nstagnation, the lowest performing species over N generations old [is] not \nallowed to reproduce&quot;.  I don&#39;t see any such checks for &quot;lowest performing \nspecies&quot;.  This leads into my second question.\n\nIf this is in fact the case, that no checks are made, then surely the \npopulation stagnancy check would not do much good, no?  The idea here seems \nto be not to allow any species to reproduce except for the top two if the \nentire population has not improved best fitness over N+5 generations (C++ \nversion again).  Surely, since the best species would have been sterile -5 \ngenerations ago, at this point, only allowing it and the one below it to \nreproduce won&#39;t have much more of an effect than allowing any species to \nreproduce.\n\nObviously I am missing something here, but I don&#39;t seem to be able to put my \nfinger on it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
