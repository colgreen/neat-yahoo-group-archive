Even if we had an\nartificial evolutionary model with indirect encoding\nand a relatively long and complex developmental phase\nbefore the phenotype was capable of eliciting the\ndesired behavior, those that didn&#39;t develop properly\nwould be weeded out.  \n\n&gt; I don&#39;t see this as a problem.  In principle,\n&gt; anything\n&gt; in nature could be theoretically mated as well.  We\n&gt; could line up the genes based on the best possible \n&gt; analysis and then construct a new genome based on\n&gt; the\n&gt; hybrid.  But usually hybrids between different\n&gt; species \n&gt; would have very low fitness (more likely no fitness\n&gt; at \n&gt; all).  The point is, where nature draws the line is \n&gt; itself arbitrary in the sense that it is just a side\n&gt; effect of a conglomeration of complex and\n&gt; happenstance \n&gt; factors that causes species to avoid each other.\n\nRight, which was all my basic point really was: that\nreal-world reproduction is based on phenotypic\ncompatibility.  \n\nYou&#39;re right that since all biological organisms use\nthe same DNA, just in different lengths and sequences,\nthey&#39;re as theoretically compatible as NEAT\nchromosomes.  We&#39;ve already done some of this\nartifical mating (spider silk genes spliced into cows\nso that their milk contains spider silk, jellyfish\ngenes into monkeys so that their fur glows in the\ndark).\n\n&gt; But physical morphology is a proxy for\n&gt; genetic compatibility.  In fact it is likely worse\n&gt; since it&#39;s only an estimate!  Nature doesn&#39;t have\n&gt; access \n&gt; to historical data on genes so it has to do its best\n&gt; with what it has.  \n\nBut it is nature&#39;s way of speciating, which as you\npoint out may not be optimal.  I&#39;d tend to agree.  \n\n&gt; I guess there is some room for debate.  But I doubt\n&gt; any biologist thinks a single amino acid mutation\n&gt; can\n&gt; create a new species that is both fit and\n&gt; genetically\n&gt; incompatible with humans.\n\nNo, I don&#39;t think anybody would argue that.  The\ndebate is over the relative impact that single\nmutations can have, either positively or negatively\naffecting fitness.  \n\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure.  If the phenotypoe is tolerant to\n&gt; mutation\n&gt; why not experiment with high mutation rates since it\n&gt; likely won&#39;t screw anything up?  But I think the\n&gt; question\n&gt; is open and a good question.\n\nI would tend to think that in indirect encoding\nschemes, measures that reduce the impact of single\nmutations would be more desirable.\n\nFor example, even in NEAT&#39;s direct encoding scheme,\nthe way you handle adding a neuron is deliberately\naimed at reducing the initial impact of the mutation,\nright?\n\nI would think this sort of thinking would be even more\nimportant in cases where a single mutation might\naffect the phenotype more profoundly.\n\n&gt; I looked into this once.  Miscarriages are not all\n&gt; caused\n&gt; by mutations, but those that are I believe are small\n&gt; percentage, but still they do exist.  \n\nAfter some informal poking around on the net, in\nhumans the rate of miscarriage for confirmed\npregancies seems to be between 10-20% (and there are\nmany miscarriages that occur well before women are\neven aware they&#39;re pregnant).\n\nOf those, a couple of different sources estimated that\n50-60% of miscarriages were due to genetic faults in\nthe developing embryo or miscombinations of\nchromosomal DNA between the sperm and egg.\n\n&gt; But what does\n&gt; this\n&gt; have to do with genetic compatibility?  The\n&gt; miscarriages\n&gt; aren&#39;t a new species.  They&#39;re just a nonfunctioning\n&gt; system.  Their genomes are still &quot;human&quot;.\n\nWhether that&#39;s true I think is a matter of some\ndebate, but they&#39;re obviously so unfit that they&#39;ll\nnever be potential mates, so as you indicate, the\npoint is moot.\n\n&gt; I agree.  It&#39;s will be interesting to experiment\n&gt; with\n&gt; different methods.  I don&#39;t mean to imply we\n&gt; shouldn&#39;t\n&gt; explore the way we compute thresholds and normalize\n&gt; for\n&gt; compatibility.  All I am saying is that these\n&gt; computations\n&gt; should be genotype-based.\n\nYeah, I tend to agree with you.  Nature doesn&#39;t work\nthis way, but I think this is most probably a case\nwhere it makes much more sense to diverge from\nreal-world analogy.\n\n&gt; Yes I follow you...way down the line maybe we can\n&gt; simulate the whole deal, down to the cells or even\n&gt; atoms.  Then we wouldn&#39;t have to do any speciation\n&gt; computations of our own.  Of course, what we would\n&gt; have to do would be far more complex and difficult.\n&gt; But who knows..maybe .someday...\n\nWe&#39;d only need to capture and simulate the features\nthat are necessary to achieve our goals, and I&#39;m not\nsure simulation down to the cellular or atomic level\nis necessary to do so.\n\nBut who knows? :)\n\n&gt; For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve taken graduate level\n&gt; neuroscience, \n&gt; graduate level biological evolution and development,\n&gt; (a.k.a. evodo),\n&gt; and several other courses on evolution.  But it\n&gt; would\n&gt; be cool if anyone else here has their own biological\n&gt; expertise\n&gt; as Derek is asking?\n\nMost of my education on such matters is informal, and\nI&#39;m guessing by the relative silence that most people\nhere are CS people, though they&#39;d have to have at\nleast some knowledge/interest in biology, evolution,\npsychology, and neuroscience to be here in the first\nplace.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
