The benefits of \nthat kind of=\r\n consistency could turn out quite useful in the future.\n\nAbout your idea re=\r\ngarding a NERO-like application with HyperNEAT- It \ncould be interesting an=\r\nd certainly it should be possible to raise the \nsensor resolution.  \n\nThe m=\r\nain question will be if NERO ends up benefiting from HyperNEAT.  \nIt may be=\r\n that regular NEAT is good enough to handle NERO effectively \nbecause NERO =\r\ncan be successful with only a few sensors.  Also, the \nmain regularity in N=\r\nERO is left/right symmetry.  It is true that \nHyperNEAT may be able to expl=\r\noit this regularity better than regular \nNEAT, but with only afew sensors, =\r\nthe difference in performance may \nnot be significant.\n\nOn the other hand, =\r\nthe difference could be significant especially \nconsidering that there are =\r\nmultiple types of sensors, i.e. friends, \nenemies, flags, walls, etc.  If t=\r\nhey could be all cleverly placed on \nthe substrate, it might lead to some n=\r\nice correlations.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;=\r\npetar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; An interesting thing to mention, yesterday=\r\n I was playing with my \n&gt; Humans experiment. I took a CPPN that produces a =\r\nCTRNN exhibiting \n&gt; a &quot;mexican wave&quot; behaviour. I scaled up the substrate t=\r\no \n&gt; approximately 200 hidden nodes. The &quot;mexican wave&quot; pattern was \n&gt; pres=\r\nerved! And more, even the direction of the wave was the same! \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hello, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was just thinking about NERO. I suddenly made the co=\r\nnnection \n&gt; between \n&gt; &gt; the sensor placements and the substrates for the r=\r\nobot experiment \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s paper. It is so similar. So I begin=\r\n to think.. What \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; NERO, but using HyperNEAT? The substrates ca=\r\nn be made \ngeometrically \n&gt; &gt; similar to the.. enivonment, you know what I =\r\nmean. \n&gt; &gt; I will try to implement a 2D version of something similar to \nNE=\r\nRO, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; with leaky integrator neurons, because there every node has=\r\n a \nbias \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to care about where to place the bias uni=\r\nt in the \n&gt; &gt; substrate. \n&gt; &gt; Besides, I have the following idea. During ev=\r\nolution, in the \nfirst \n&gt; &gt; generations (in the rtNEAT case, the first N mi=\r\nnutes of \nevolution), \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; substrates will be simple, with low node =\r\ncounts. Then, given a \n&gt; &gt; threshold (num. of generations/time), the progra=\r\nm will \n&gt; automatically \n&gt; &gt; scale up the substrate to a higher density. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions/ideas about that? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
