I certainly haven&#39;t heard about any \nsince the early 90&#39;s.\n\nWhen people want _serious_ computers these days, they look to \ngrid-computing in the style of SETI@Home.\n\nIf you can do that, and get popular, you can get 1,000,000s of times more \nCPU, but your job has to be dividable into appropriately sized chunks.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\nAt 08:42 22/06/2004, you wrote:\n&gt;Kenneth,\n&gt;\n&gt;     What sort of efforts are being pushed to try NEAT approaches on\n&gt;supercomputers?
