Technically, the output=\r\ns \nshould always be the highest layer in the network.  Therefore, by \ndoing=\r\n it the way it does in origianl NEAT, it avoids this \ninconsistency.\n\nIt&#39;s =\r\na good question though and worth some thought.  Others may have \ndiffering =\r\nviews.  I&#39;m not sure how other versions of NEAT handle \nthis issue.  \n\nken\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tansey4&quot; &lt;tansey4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; One more f=\r\nollow-up question about mutate_add_node.  When the method\n&gt; inserts the new=\r\n node and creates 2 new connections, why does the \nfirst\n&gt; link inherit the=\r\n recurrent flag and not the second link?\n&gt; \n&gt; The way I see it, you have 2 =\r\nnodes (A and B), and the chosen link\n&gt; between them is recurrent.  You inse=\r\nrt a new node (C) inbetween A \nand\n&gt; B, so now instead of the link being B-=\r\n&gt;A, it&#39;s B-&gt;C-&gt;A.  It seems \nlike\n&gt; you should label the C-&gt;A link as recur=\r\nrent.  Or does this not even\n&gt; matter?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;tansey4&quot; &lt;tansey4@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the resp=\r\nonse Ken.

The mutate_add_node \nmethod\n&gt; &gt; tries t=\r\no find an eligible link to insert a new node into.  To\n&gt; &gt; determine eligib=\r\nility, it looks at 2 criteria:\n&gt; &gt; 1. Is the link enabled\n&gt; &gt; 2. Is the inp=\r\nut node of the link a bias node\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why does criteria #2 exclude the l=\r\nink from having a node inserted\n&gt; into it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm let me try to recall the reasoning I had several years ago \nwhe=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote that function :) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, I should note that I=\r\n rarely ever use \nmutate_toggle_enable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (its probability is usually s=\r\net to zero in my runs).  I have \nfound \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it to be mainly just disrupti=\r\nve.

I am on the mu=\r\ntation operators and had a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about  Genome::mutate_to=\r\nggle_enable(int times).  When the \nmethod \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a gene to di=\r\nsable (if the gene is enabled), it does a check \nto see \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nt can do this without fragmenting the network.  The comment \nsays:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We need to make sure that another gene connects out of the \nin-\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; node\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because if not a section of network will break off and=\r\n \nbecome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; isolated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is does it only check=\r\n the in_nodes and not the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out_nodes?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  If we don&#39;t check out_=\r\nnodes, wouldn&#39;t it be possible for \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to become di=\r\nsconnected from the network?
