The first thing you need to decide\nis which version of NEAT to use, and it looks like\nJNEAT may be the best since JRobots wants a robot coded\nin Java.  However, you may also want to talk to Derek \nand Philip about their release shedule of their Java\nversion.\n\nNext, you need to figure out what the NN inputs and outputs\nshould be.  You need to decide how to translate the \ninput from the game into a nice(preferably small) \nset of NN inputs, and also how the outputs from the NN \nshould map to the control signals in the game.\n\nOnce you have that down, you are ready to start evolution\nin their simulator.  The hardest part will be integrating\nwhatever version of NEAT you choose into their simulator.\nHowever, it is well worth the effort since this is \ncertainly a good application of NEAT.\n\nken \n\n\n"}}
