I only wrote the toribash-esque=\r\n experiment\nand a few changes and features added to python-neat. The actual=\r\n\npython-neat backend is written by Cesar Gomez and is really terrific,\nas p=\r\nython has a certain elegance about it that makes it seem easier to\ngrasp. \n=\r\n\nIn order to get it to work you need to download the linux version of\nComma=\r\nnd Line Breve:\nhttp://www.spiderland.org/download.php\nThen unzip this in th=\r\ne breve_2.7.2/ directory:\nhttp://peter.berrington.googlepages.com/tori.7z\n\n=\r\nTo evolve, open a shell and navigate to the breve directory, then call\nthe =\r\nToriExp with python, like this:\npython tori/toriExp.py\nTo view the last bes=\r\nt individual, instead type this:\n./bin/breve tori/viewlastbest.py\n\nTheres a=\r\n HUGE amount of parameters for which I have no idea what the\ngood values ar=\r\ne. The creator of Toribash is giving me a description of\nhow his game works=\r\n but is not at all forthcoming with the specific\nimplementation details; I =\r\nsuppose he is reluctant to give away code\nfor something he makes money on, =\r\nbut it&#39;s frustrating as his game is\nactually very well balanced, allowing s=\r\nome very nimble and natural\nlooking acrobatics. Trial and error is probably=\r\n the only solution at\nthis stage.\n\nI encourage people to fool around with t=\r\nhis; I&#39;m a complete beginner\nto programming this kind of stuff and I&#39;ve got=\r\n a lot of really\nterrible code I&#39;m sure, so please submit any changes that =\r\nyou think\nwould make sense.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley=\r\n&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter, that&#39;s a good question and of course =\r\nlearning to control a \n&gt; virtual creature with novelty search is a complica=\r\nted issue (and an \n&gt; appealing idea as well). \n&gt; \n&gt; First, you have to deal=\r\n with all the representational and physical \n&gt; issues outside of novelty se=\r\narch, like how many inputs, how many \n&gt; outputs, and whether the body itsel=\r\nf is not physically flawed in \n&gt; some way (which is possible).  As you are =\r\nexperiencing, the \n&gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feat=\r\nure \n&gt; selection.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be useful \n&gt; be=\r\ncause it does not care about the # inputs or outputs (and can \n&gt; potentiall=\r\ny exploit geometric regularities), but configuring the \n&gt; substrate then be=\r\ncomes the challenge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assuming all of that stuff is set up well with wh=\r\natever system, then \n&gt; novelty search is a potentially winning approach.  Y=\r\net as you point \n&gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In fact=\r\n, we are \n&gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to these questions=\r\n in \n&gt; ongoing research, but some general principles might help for now: \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not not need to contain \n&gt; ev=\r\nery point ever visited.  Therefore, it tends to grow much slower \n&gt; than th=\r\ne #of evaluations.  However, if it is indeed getting too big  \n&gt; then it is=\r\n not unreasonable to collapse some of the archive points, \n&gt; although there=\r\n is no standard method yet for how that should be \n&gt; done.  But we have rea=\r\nson to believe there will be effective and \n&gt; simple ways to do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSecond, the issue of one individual looking different just because \n&gt; of a =\r\nphase difference in effectivley the same behavior is \n&gt; complicated.  For c=\r\nertain phase disaparities, the two individuals \n&gt; won&#39;t look all that diffe=\r\nrent, but it is true that at some \n&gt; disparity, they may look very differen=\r\nt.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; whether that fact is actually problematic to the=\r\n novelty search or \n&gt; not, because it would simply reward both types of beh=\r\navior.  It is \n&gt; possible that the phase difference is a result of some use=\r\nful \n&gt; genotypic change, which could make it a stepping stone to something =\r\n\n&gt; better.  Or, it is possible that it is superfluous information and \n&gt; si=\r\nmply takes some extra time exploring the area around the phase-\n&gt; shifted i=\r\nndividual.  So it is hard to say a priori whether it is a \n&gt; major concern.=\r\n  We will have better answers to such questions as the \n&gt; technique is furt=\r\nher explored.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I agree that it would be nice to be able to say=\r\n the two \n&gt; phase-shifted individuals are largely the same if that is indee=\r\nd \n&gt; what you want to say.  And for that, you would need a pattern-\n&gt; match=\r\ning metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. something more \n&gt; sophisiti=\r\ncated than simple Cartesian distance.  There are certainly \n&gt; such metrics =\r\navailable.  However, it&#39;s important to recognize that \n&gt; it is not evident =\r\nat this point that ignoring the phase shift is \n&gt; actually better than taki=\r\nng it into consideration, because taking it \n&gt; into consideration just mean=\r\ns adding more information to the novelty \n&gt; landscape.\n&gt; \n&gt; So overall I th=\r\nink novelty search is a very promising direction to \n&gt; go for such problems=\r\n, but it is still in the realm of research (i.e. \n&gt; there is no existing pr=\r\necedent), so it will involve considerable \n&gt; trial and error to get it righ=\r\nt until all these issues are fleshed \n&gt; out more clearly.  Ultimately, thou=\r\ngh, if our hypothesis about \n&gt; novelty vs. fitness is correct, novelty sear=\r\nch may turn out to be \n&gt; the *only* way to get certain highly complex types=\r\n of behavior to \n&gt; evolve in some domains, which is a sobering thought.  Bu=\r\nt if it is \n&gt; true, then there is not much to do other than try it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ke=\r\nn\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt;=\r\n fascinating\n&gt; &gt; new approach. For the past couple of months I&#39;ve been work=\r\ning on\n&gt; &gt; virtual creature controllers; specifically I have a ragdoll rig =\r\n\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve set up in Breve Simulation Environment (available at\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhttp://spiderland.org )\n&gt; &gt; This ragdoll is modelled after the one in Torib=\r\nash, a free game \n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; uses the open dynamics engine for physics, li=\r\nke breve. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So far a lot of the results I&#39;ve been having discouragi=\r\nng; as Ken\n&gt; &gt; points out early on in his latest paper, trying to make a wa=\r\nlking\n&gt; &gt; biped usually results in it falling over perpetually. You can see=\r\n \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; WIP videos at my youtube page here:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com=\r\n/user/thehaircrow\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ultimately, I would like to package AI&#39;s with th=\r\ne Toribash game so\n&gt; &gt; that they are fun to play against in single player- =\r\nI think this \n&gt; goal\n&gt; &gt; is attainable despite being difficult.\n&gt; &gt; Decepti=\r\non is a BIG problem here; if my fitness criteria is time\n&gt; &gt; integrated dis=\r\ntance from a goal, it encourages the behaviour of the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Tori&quot; balancing =\r\nin a stable configuration forever, rather than\n&gt; &gt; walking, which is what I=\r\n&#39;m trying to encourage. As there is 20 \n&gt; joints\n&gt; &gt; in this rig, I am prov=\r\niding joint position and velocity information\n&gt; &gt; for each joint, as well a=\r\ns a bias, a sine-wave, the x, y, and z\n&gt; &gt; components linear velocity in th=\r\ne reference frame of the Tori&#39;s \n&gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; and finally 3 variables which =\r\ncorrespond to the vertical, \n&gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt; and forward orientation of th=\r\ne tori&#39;s head with respect to world\n&gt; &gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; The current expe=\r\nrimental configuration I am started out as a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ragdoll control whe=\r\nre neural net outputs correspond directly joint\n&gt; &gt; velocity; a tanh activa=\r\ntion function is used to allow positive and\n&gt; &gt; negative joint movement.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I then remodeled the experiment to perform as in the Toribash game;\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe net will receive inputs (and effect joint movements) only \n&gt; every 10\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; time steps. More importantly, I increased the amount of outputs \n&gt; from\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40, in order to accomodate the 4 possible joint\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nactions which can occur on a turn: holding, relaxing, extending, \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n flexing. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that gives a stagg=\r\neringly huge\n&gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Due to the implem=\r\nentation,\n&gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large nets as the starting n=\r\net can\n&gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram on the heap. Realizing this was a bit\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature selection and phased pruning.\n&gt; &gt; How=\r\never, even with this, deception seems to prevent any useful\n&gt; &gt; behaviour; =\r\nthe Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am using a python i=\r\nmplementation of neat developed by Cesar Gomez\n&gt; &gt; under the GPL, which is =\r\navailable at http://code.google.com/p/neat-\n&gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This impleme=\r\nntation is a WIP and I&#39;ve already done a lot of tests\n&gt; &gt; trying to incorpo=\r\nrate the linear genome encoding taken from the \n&gt; EANT\n&gt; &gt; method. I&#39;ve als=\r\no been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in order to\n&gt; &gt; optimize weights but I =\r\nhaven&#39;t had much success meshing this with \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Later today when I am home I will post my source files for anyone=\r\n \n&gt; who\n&gt; &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; FINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n=\r\n&gt; represented\n&gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount=\r\n of time\n&gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method pro=\r\nposed\n&gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a new endi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of discovered behaviours=\r\n. This works \n&gt; well\n&gt; &gt; (I imagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of informa=\r\ntion to hold.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I can compare the behavio=\r\nur of 2 ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; is there any compact encoding =\r\nthat would\n&gt; &gt; work? Since it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluations to ge=\r\nt any\n&gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this right now, theres going to have to b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate behaviours in some way that is fast \n&gt;=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has identical behaviour to another=\r\n \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later instead? Just comparin=\r\ng \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; two behaviours it would appear that they were 100% unique, yet=\r\n a \n&gt; human\n&gt; &gt; observer would instantly notice the similarity in how they =\r\nact.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
