My guess is that\nthe population =\r\nwould never reach such an extreme dichotomy between\nspecies because specie =\r\n3 never would have gotten that large unless its\nfitness were dominating the=\r\n others - which in this case it is not. \nAlso, the species 1 and 2 likely w=\r\nould not be that small with such\ngood fitness.\n\n- Philip\n\nOn 8/19/05, Matt =\r\nSimmerson &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; Whilst calculating=\r\n the number of offspring for a valid (i.e. non\n&gt; extinct and size &gt; 0) spec=\r\nie, the count returns 0.  This is\n&gt; particularly prevalent in large species=\r\n where the adjusted fitness\n&gt; becomes quite small comapared with the rest o=\r\nf the other, and usually\n&gt; much less populous, species.\n&gt; \n&gt; This becomes e=\r\nven more marked if I boost young species fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I understa=\r\nnd, the offspring is calculated as follows.\n&gt; \n&gt; (av adjusted specie fitnes=\r\ns) / (total of all species av adjusted\n&gt; fitnesses) * Population size.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n For example, imagine we have 3 species. Specie_1 has 3 members av raw\n&gt; fi=\r\ntness 0.85, Specie_2 has 2 members av raw fitness 0.82 and Specie_3\n&gt; has 1=\r\n45 members with av raw fitness 0f 0.9.\n&gt; \n&gt; Specie_1(adj) =3D 0.85/3 =3D 0.=\r\n28333\n&gt; Specie_2(adj) =3D 0.82/2 =3D 0.41\n&gt; Specie_3(adj) =3D 0.9/145 =3D 0=\r\n.006\n&gt; \n&gt; Specie_1 then generates 61 offspring\n&gt; Specie_2 then generates 87=\r\n offspring\n&gt; Specie_3 then generates 2 offspring\n&gt; \n&gt; Not quite 0, but you =\r\nget the idea.  So even though the largest specie\n&gt; with has best average fi=\r\ntness, its population gets decimated.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand, that large species=\r\n need to get penalised, but this seems\n&gt; extreme and you are potentially lo=\r\nsing a lot of good gemomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ideas/correction/thoughts appreciated.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Ta\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
