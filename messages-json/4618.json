Turns out, some of these\n&gt; equations were very familiar=\r\n: the law of conservation of momentum, and\n&gt; Newton&#39;s second law of motion.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It&#39;s a powerful approach,&quot; said University of Michigan computer scien=\r\ntist\n&gt; Martha Pollack, with &quot;the potential to apply to any type of dynamica=\r\nl\n&gt; system.&quot; As possible fields of application, Pollack named environmental=\r\n\n&gt; systems, weather patterns, population genetics, cosmology and oceanograp=\r\nhy.\n&gt; =93\n&gt;\n&gt; Compared to laws likely to govern the brain or genome, the la=\r\nws of motion\n&gt; discovered by the program are extremely simple. But the prin=\r\nciples of Lipson\n&gt; and Schmidt&#39;s program should work at higher scales.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe researchers have already applied the program to recordings of\n&gt; individ=\r\nuals&#39; physiological states and their levels of metabolites, the\n&gt; cellular =\r\nproteins that collectively run our bodies but remain, molecule by\n&gt; molecul=\r\ne, largely uncharacterized =97 a perfect example of data lacking a\n&gt; theory=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Their results are still unpublished, but &quot;we&#39;ve found some interestin=\r\ng laws\n&gt; already, some laws that are not known,&quot; said Lipson. &quot;What we&#39;re w=\r\norking on\n&gt; now is the next step =97 ways in which we can try to explain th=\r\nese equations,\n&gt; correlate them with existing knowledge, try to break these=\r\n things down into\n&gt; components for which we have clues.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lipson likened=\r\n the quest to a &quot;detective story&quot; =97 a hint of the changing\n&gt; role of rese=\r\narchers in hybridized computer-human science. Programs produce\n&gt; sets of eq=\r\nuations =97 describing the role of rainfall on a desert plateau, or\n&gt; air p=\r\nollution in triggering asthma, or multitasking on cognitive function.\n&gt; Res=\r\nearchers test the equations, determine whether they&#39;re still incomplete\n&gt; o=\r\nr based on flawed data, use them to identify new questions, and apply them\n=\r\n&gt; to messy reality.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Human Genome Project, for example, produced a d=\r\nataset largely impervious\n&gt; to traditional analysis. The function of nearly=\r\n every gene depends on the\n&gt; function of other genes, which depend on still=\r\n more genes, which change with\n&gt; time and place. The same level of complexi=\r\nty confronts researchers studying\n&gt; the body&#39;s myriad proteins, the human b=\r\nrain and even ecosystems.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The rules are mathematical formulae that cap=\r\nture regularities in the\n&gt; system,&quot; said Pollack, &quot;but the scientist needs =\r\nto interpret those\n&gt; regularities. They need, for example, to explain&quot; why =\r\nan animal population\n&gt; is affected by changes in rainfall, and what might b=\r\ne done to protect it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Full Wired article: http://blog.wired.com/wiredsc=\r\nience/2009/04/newtonai.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Antoan\n&gt;\n&gt; __________ I=\r\nnformation from ESET Smart Security, version of virus signature\n&gt; database =\r\n3990 (20090406) __________\n&gt;\n&gt; The message was checked by ESET Smart Securi=\r\nty.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.eset.com\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928=\r\n Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nht=\r\ntp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
