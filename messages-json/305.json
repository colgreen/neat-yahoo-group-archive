Have \n&gt; &gt; you thought of having the line thickness\n&gt; &gt; proportional to the weight \n&gt; &gt; magnitude of connections (if svg allows that)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure SVG would allow that.  It&#39;s just another\n&gt; graphical format, a vector-based one.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the way JNEAT displays networks, right?\n&gt; \n\nYes I believe so. \n\n&gt; This leads me to another question: To what extent do\n&gt; you use graphical information to analyze results?  The\n&gt; use of graphing fitness throughout a run is obvious. \n&gt; Graphing the quantities of given numbers of\n&gt; individuals in species can be useful as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; But how often, and how do you use the graphical\n&gt; representation of the networks?  This is an open\n&gt; question to the group.  Also, Ken, I&#39;ve noticed in\n&gt; some of your papers you&#39;ve analyzed the functioning of\n&gt; the resultant network.  Was graphical output of the\n&gt; topologies useful for this?  Otherwise, how did you go\n&gt; about it?\n&gt; \n\nIn general you never need graphical information but it helps.\nFor example, if you look at the graph you can see which nodes\nare most highly connected, how many connections are recurrent,\nwhich inputs get used the most, etc.  You can use that to decide\nwhat parts to ablate (i.e. take out) or keep track of if you\nare trying to analyze functionality.  Also, I think species\nvisualizations (like in our EC paper) can be nice as well to\nunderstand the overall dynamics of the system.\n\nI&#39;d also be interested if anyone else has some novel ideas for\nusing graphics for analysis.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
