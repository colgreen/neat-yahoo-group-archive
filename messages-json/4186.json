As soon as someone gets bigger, he=\r\n starts\n&gt; &gt; mating with others and spreading the extra genes around. Theref=\r\nore,\n&gt; &gt; GP doesn&#39;t tend to keep a healthy range the way NEAT does. We\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nactually have built a version of GP-NEAT at EPlex (which has\n&gt; &gt; historical=\r\n markings and speciation, but with GP trees) that has very\n&gt; &gt; different bl=\r\noat characteristics than regular GP, as this argument\n&gt; &gt; would suggest.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds very interesting.  Would you mind sharing some of the\n=\r\nresults\n&gt; with us? Also, is the code publicly available for download?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nWesley, unfortunately GP-NEAT is not available for =\r\ndownload and we\ndon&#39;t have any publications released on it.  Adelein Rodrig=\r\nuez built\nit as part of her Masters project at UCF, and has since graduated=\r\n. \nBut I am hoping that we manage to get out a publication and at the\nsame =\r\ntime release the software at some point.  It just got pushed back\nby a few =\r\nother things, which is too bad since it&#39;s a nice piece of\nwork.  It&#39;s actua=\r\nlly very tricky to get real NEAT-like functionality\nworking with GP, but Ad=\r\nelein did it and it&#39;s really a new type of GP.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
