However, I&#39;m looking at trying to use NEAT to\nfind patterns=\r\n in time series data, as one would use fully recurrent\nnetworks for (In the=\r\nse, also known as Elmen networks, all of the\nhidden layer and output layer =\r\nvalues are &#39;propagated&#39; into the next\ntime step to give the network memory,=\r\n with full connectivity between\nall the input and previous nodes to the hid=\r\nden/output nodes).\n\nSuch a network should be possible to be generated by NE=\r\nAT, though I\nfigure that not every recurrent type problem needs a fully rec=\r\nurrent\nnetwork.  So I&#39;m trying to use NEAT to generate such, using the\nclas=\r\nsic delayed-XOR problem (such that the result of xor of the two\ncurrent inp=\r\nuts will be the actual output some time steps away).  Fully\nrecurrent netwo=\r\nrks can be trained to do this, but I want to generate a\nNEAT network that, =\r\nafter running through the fixed data series a\nnumber of relaxation times, t=\r\nhat the weights have already been trained\nthrough NEAT evolution such that =\r\nI don&#39;t have to perform additional\ntraining on the network.  \n\nHas anyone h=\r\nad any success directly in generating such recurrent\nnetworks?  I know my f=\r\nitnesses improve with time, but it takes a lot\nof generations (1000+ with a=\r\n 150 member population) to even see\nsomething, and even then, it&#39;s not anyw=\r\nhere close to what simple\nrecurrent training can provide.  (This may be als=\r\no related to my\nsecond question).\n\nThe other question I had was about conve=\r\nrgence times.  I&#39;m trying to\ntest my network on the normal XOR problem (non=\r\n-recurrent mode) and\nfind that it takes many more evolution generations for=\r\n the fitness to\nget to acceptable levels (based solely on the distance of e=\r\nxpected vs\nobserved output), exceptionaly more than listed in the NEAT pape=\r\nrs\n(500-1000 evolution steps as opposed to 10-30 steps) even when using\nwha=\r\nt I believe are the same values described by Kenneth in his papers.\n I&#39;ve t=\r\nried nearly every parameter, and the only one that I know I\nwant to keep lo=\r\nw is the new node probability to avoid excessive growth\nof the network.  An=\r\nyone have any pointers on what parameters are\ncritical to help with rapid c=\r\nonvergence on the best network?  Mind\nyou, it could still be something in m=\r\ny code which I&#39;ve been pounding\nthrough to try to find differences.\n\nAnothe=\r\nr related question is on the species comparison expression and\ntolerance.  =\r\nI tend to use N=3Dnumber of genes in largest species\nregardless of the case=\r\n, and for that I have to play with the tolerance\nas to get 5 or more specie=\r\ns in a population of 150.  Is there an ideal\naverage number of species that=\r\n you want to carry through in the\npopulation in order to take advantage of =\r\nNEAT&#39;s use of species?  And\nwhen do people move away from the &#39;typical&#39; val=\r\nues of the coefficients\n(1 and 1 for disjoint and excess elements, 0.4 for =\r\nweight difference\naverage)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
