And as I\nmyself have come across some solutions (to another problem posted\nearlier) that are equally as good but vary in network complexity\n(number of neurons and connections varied in order of tens), I must\nsay that 44 neurons might be just one possible solution. And that NEAT\nmight have missed a simpler solution earlier in the evolution process\ndue to some reason. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, If my above statements are correct, then what could be the\npossible reasons why NEAT missed the simpler solution/s? Was it\nbecause that we complexified at a rate higher than we should have? or\nwas it just because of the nature of evolutionary process itself? or\nwas it due to some other reason? \n&gt; and what can we do about it?\n&gt; \n\nI think in this experiment Mitchell did not use NEAT.  He just used a\nstandard fixed-sized fully-recurrent network.  I think that&#39;s why he\nuploaded the code for this experiment- so that someone on this group\nmight attempt it with NEAT.  It would definitely be interesting to see\nwhat NEAT would come up with.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
