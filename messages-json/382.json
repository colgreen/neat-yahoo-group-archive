(As an example the\nbelow quote is from John)\n\nIf you intend to let NEAT do this, please read this complete message,\nwhich contains important information on starting NEAT with some inputs\ndisconnected.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Input node &#39;a&#39; is connected with weight 1 to all output nodes &#39;a&#39;. \nSame for \n&gt; b, c, and d.  This corresponds exactly to a &#39;nearest neighbor&#39; or\n&#39;pixel \n&gt; enlargement&#39; algorithm.  The remaining input nodes are unconnected\nin the \n&gt; hopes that NEAT will decide for itself which nodes it needs and\nwhich it \n&gt; does not.  I expect it to ultimately connect to all of them, but\nwith how \n&gt; many hidden nodes? \n\nI want to let people on this group know that this is a good idea but\nyou should be aware that some versions of NEAT (including my own and\nUgo&#39;s JNEAT) require some slight modification to make this possible. \nThe reason for this is that NEAT was originally programmed to drop\nnodes during crossover that were not connected to anything.  Thus, if\nyou start NEAT with some inputs disconnected, they will end up getting\ndropped and lost!\n\nThe solution is simply to tell NEAT not to do this.  I have provided a\ndetailed explanation of how to get this working at:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html#disconnected\n\nwhich is now a newly added question in the NEAT FAQ on the Users page.\n\nAnyone who does try this and still  finds problems (such as nodes\nbeing lost over generations) please let me know.  I have personally\nimplemented genomes in this way (with some inputs disconnected) and\nfound NEAT successful at adding them as needed through new\nconnections, so I know it is possible.  In addition, Shimon Whiteson\n(who is my officemate here at UT) has implemented a sophisticated\nversion of this process in JNEAT, which Shimon called FS-NEAT or\n&quot;Feature Selective NEAT.&quot;\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
