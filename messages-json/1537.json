I guess I&#39;d better introduce myself...\n&gt;I have a degree in Physics from Cardiff (UK), did 3 years \n&gt;Postgraduate research into the computer simulation of Polymers where \n&gt;I started to become interested in Genetic Algorithms applied to the \n&gt;protein folding problem.\n&gt;\nI assume you&#39;ve seen the folding@home project then? Run from Stanford \nUni in he states I think. Impressive stuff.\n\n&gt; Since then I been working for a company \n&gt;providing end-to-end online betting systems for the major \n&gt;bookmakers,\n&gt;\nYeh, very much a growth industry I understand.\n\n&gt; but have continued to be intrested in AI techniques in \n&gt;my spare time. I started to get into using GA&#39;s to evolve neural \n&gt;nets after reading Fogel&#39;s Blondie24. My current pet project is \n&gt;trying to use those techniques to evolve a neural net to score stock \n&gt;graphs based on wether it thinks they are a buy, hold or sell. I \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSeems to be a common direction these days. Just last week I overheard a \ncolleague discussing possible ways of detecting patterns in stock data \nusing fourier transforms. I believe some banks already have automated \ntrading systems using some form of AI. The question is, how advanced are \nthey? and do they trade enough to effect the market and thus prevent \nothers from making money from the same techniques. It&#39;s possible that \nsomething like NEAT is more advanced than anything the banks have, and \nin actual fact I had earmarked a couple of weeks next month to look into \nthe issue. Shares (Stocks to our US cousins) are too volatile for my \nliking though, they tend to be driven by human psycholgy rather than \neconomic realities, at least in the short term. More &#39;predictable&#39; \nfinancial entities would probably be currency exchange rates, property \nprices, etc. They still exhibit complex complex patterns and \nrelationships but, IMO are more soundly rooted in economic reality.  \n\n&gt;started off with a very naieve GA and a fixed arbitrary net \n&gt;topology. I stumbled onto NEAT whilst doing some google searches and \n&gt;am now hoping to apply it to my get rich quick scheme :-) Feel free \n&gt;to contact me if you would like to discuss anything.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs far as I can tell, if you want to get rich quick then buy shares in \ninternet betting and cigarettes. Depressing, but true :)   On a serious \nnote, I had actually earmarked a couple of weeks next month to look into \nthis kind of stuff (probably currency exchange). So if you have any \nideas I&#39;d be happy to start up a discussion, either here or of-list if \nthe topic strays away from NEAT.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
