It\n&gt; turns out that\n&gt; implementing this is actually pretty difficult,\n&gt; because there is no\n&gt; standardized way to represent the larger graph of\n&gt; modules connecting to\n&gt; each other. So instead I opted to work with a\n&gt; simplified subset of\n&gt; module-chromosome bindings that would still be very\n&gt; powerful.\n\nYes, it is a difficult problem, but an interesting\none.  Philip and I were talking about possible\nrepresentations for this type of indirect encoding on\nthe way home from Austin last weekend.\n\nI was considering a mutation on a node that would\nreplace it with a subnet that has the same number\nincoming and outgoing connections.  For example, if\nthere were a node with two incoming connections and\none out going connections, it could be mutated and\nreplaced with a subnet with two incoming connections\nand one outgoing connections.  Subnets could be kept\nin pools, just as in your implementation of modular\nNEAT, starting simply, with standard NEAT mutation\noperators acting on them each generation.\n\nI was thinking that replacing a single node might\nreduce the impact of such a significant structural\nmutation, and it would allow such a mutation to occur\non any node in the network.\n\nDoes this sound plausible?\n\n&gt; It actually turns out that this kind of simplified\n&gt; binding is more useful\n&gt; (not to mention easier to search), because there few\n&gt; times when you need\n&gt; more complexity than a single hidden layer.\n\nYes, I can see the logic in that.\n\n&gt; Correct. Modules represent a complete path from a\n&gt; set of input neurons to\n&gt; a set of output neurons. There is some independent\n&gt; work by another one of\n&gt; Risto&#39;s students (Steetskamp) with SANE that\n&gt; actually show that SANE\n&gt; acting on any modular structure smaller than a\n&gt; single complete neuron is\n&gt; almost useless.\n\nI&#39;ll take his word for it. :)\n\n&gt; Yes, this semester I&#39;m going to do some theoretical\n&gt; work with it\n&gt; (incomplete-knowledge Pareto dominance in modules)\n&gt; based on some symbiotic\n&gt; composition ideas I read about (Richard Watson).\n&gt; Also I plan on applying\n&gt; it scalably large domains so I can get some real\n&gt; information about how\n&gt; feasible it a method it is.\n\nYeah...I remember thinking while I read your paper,\n&quot;He&#39;s arguing that this could be a powerful method for\nlarge-scale domains, but he&#39;s testing it on very small\nones!&quot; :)  I was wondering how it would perform with\nhigh input/output domains, and I&#39;m curious to read\nyour future stuff, as well as experiment with some of\nthese concepts myself.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
