(Which version of HyperNEAT is it, by the way?)  One idea with=\r\n large input sheets us it may be desirable to scale the inputs themselves. =\r\n For example, this paragraph is from http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/stanley=\r\n_alife09.pdf :\n\n&quot;When scaling, a potential problem is that if the same acti=\r\nvation level is used to indicate positive stimulus as at lower resolutions,=\r\n the total energy entering the substrate would increase as the substrate re=\r\nsolution increases for the same images, leading to oversaturation of the ta=\r\nrget field. In contrast, in the real world,\nthe number of photons that ente=\r\nr the eye is the same regardless of the density of photoreceptors. To accou=\r\nnt for this disparity, the input activation levels are scaled for larger su=\r\nbstrate resolutions proportionally to the difference in unit cell size.&quot;\n\nM=\r\nore generally, if you are experiencing saturation from areas other than the=\r\n input layer, it may indeed be desirable to normalize the incoming weights =\r\nto individual nodes so that they all add up to some constant number, meanin=\r\ng the incoming activation won&#39;t depend on the number of incoming connection=\r\ns.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, rob@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; This is really a n=\r\novices question, but having just started using HyperNEAT (as opposed to pla=\r\nin NEAT), I find that with the weight constaints used in the sample code (m=\r\nax 3.0, min 0.2), most nodes are being overloaded and driven hard in one di=\r\nrection or the other. The result is that, despite many generations of train=\r\ning, the single output never comes out of the saturated state of -1 or +1.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; My susbstrate has inputs arranged as 11 x 5, so the typical hidden lay=\r\ner nodes have 55 inputs. Is it usual to scale the maximum weight limit so a=\r\ns to constrain node input,such as dividing the weight limit by the number o=\r\nf nodes in the input layer of the substrate?\n&gt; \n&gt; There is, of course, the =\r\ndistinct possibility, that I have missed something, or some bug, in my codi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Rob Marsden\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
