If your add connection\n&gt; mutation rate is 0.02 and you&#39;ve got 100 individuals, and there are\n&gt; 100,000 possible places for a new connection to be added, there \nshould\n&gt; be a total of 2,000 new connections added.  Are you saying that \nonly\n&gt; 100 should be added, one for each individual?  And that if an\n&gt; individual has already had a connection added, then no add node\n&gt; mutations are allowed to act upon it (or vice versa if your add \nnode\n&gt; mutation operators are carried out first)?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not my understanding of how NEAT works.  Ken?\n&gt; \n\nAh, we may have hit on a reason for some of our disagreements!  The \nadd_connection mutation rate is the probability that an *individual \ngenome* might have a single connection added.  In other words, in a \npopulation of 100 individuals and a 0.02 rate, you would expect to \nget on average 2 new connections over the entire population in a \nsingle generation.\n\nIn addition, it is also true that only one add connection mutation \ncan happen to a single individual in a generation.\n\nIt seems to me that your interpetation was that the mutation rate is \non a &quot;per empty slot&quot; basis.  That&#39;s radically different than my \nNEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at all...is \nthat how ANJI has been working?\n\nBut anyway absolutely Colin is right: one structural mutation at a \ntime is the usual rule.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
