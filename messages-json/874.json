That&#39;s because\n&gt; no one tries to \n&gt; solve XOR with a recurrent network- they always use\n&gt; feedforward \n&gt; solutions.  It&#39;s kind of interesting that NEAT finds\n&gt; a recurrent \n&gt; solution, but it ruins comparisons with other\n&gt; methods since they \n&gt; don&#39;t have the ability to do that so it isn&#39;t really\n&gt; fair.  I \n&gt; disabled the addition of recurrent connections for\n&gt; my XOR \n&gt; experiments.\n\nIt&#39;s true that there is not much point to a recurrent\nANN that does XOR, but I did one anyway, just as a\ndemonstration.  You can see it operate by downloading\nthe VizANN package from the URL below.  (It&#39;s written\nin Python.)  It has two neurons.\n\nMy approach to the problem of how to know when the\ncomputation is finished is to use one output of the\nnet as a &quot;ready&quot; line.  You start with all outputs at\nzero.  As soon as the &quot;ready&quot; output is high, then you\nare done.  High could be defined as &gt; .5.  I think\nthis is a general approach that applies to many\nproblems.  Essentially, you are letting the nework\ntell you when it is done processing.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
