The new jour=\r\nnal paper is called, &quot;Compositional Pattern \nProducing Networks: A Novel Ab=\r\nstraction of Development,&quot; and is \navailable on the EPlex publications page=\r\n here (sure to be messed up \nby yahoo):\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?=\r\n\noption=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#stanley.gpem07\n\nOr yo=\r\nu can just go to the publications area of \nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu\nand scro=\r\nll down. Or my homepage under &quot;Journal Papers.&quot;\n\nThis paper significantly i=\r\nmproves upon the old tech report because \nit has been through a peer review=\r\n process that forced it to address \nthe big questions (some of which Ian ju=\r\nst raised).  \n\nSo even if you read &quot;Patterns Without Development,&quot; if you a=\r\nre \ninterested in CPPNs this may still be worth a read.   The paper \ntries =\r\nto make a serious, detailed argument for CPPNs as a valid \nabstraction of d=\r\nevelopment that is equal in power to other \nabstractions.\n\n(Of course, it&#39;s=\r\n a bit long at 36 pages, so if you want a shorter \nintro then &quot;Exploiting R=\r\negularity Without Development&quot; is a good \nchoice at only 8 pages.\n\nPlease n=\r\note that this paper is about CPPNs in general and not \nHyperNEAT, although =\r\nit briefly mentions how it will be extended to \nHyperNEAT in the discussion=\r\n section.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
