Originally, I was calculating \n&gt;stagnation by keeping track of the highest fitness value ever acheived for \n&gt;that topology.  However, since there is a certain amount of randomness to \n&gt;the fitness evaluation, there is a problem with that approach.  At one \n&gt;point, there may be an uncharacteristically high single fitness value.  For \n&gt;the next hundred generations it may be making steady progress without ever \n&gt;exceeding that single peak value.  Thus, it is deemed &#39;stagnant&#39; and killed \n&gt;off.  Oops!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, in my experience this is an often encountered problem. I&#39;ve \ntinkered with solutions similar to your&#39;s of averaraging past fitness \nscores, and although I&#39;ve never been entirely happy with it I think it&#39;s \nthe best way of solving the problem if no appropriate deterministic \nevaluation is available.\n\nActually I&#39;ve been quietly working on Tic-Tac-Toe, following in Derek \nand Philips footsteps, and this has come up again. I started out with \nmostly deterministic strategies for the opponents but the evolved NN&#39;s \nquickly take advantage of the fact that, say, a given strategy will \nalways make a certain move in a given scenario, so although the NN&#39;s \nachieve good scores quickly they aren&#39;t very good when playing against \nother opponents, e.g. me :)\n\nSo I thought maybe I should introduce an element of randomness, but then \nI encounter the problem of some NN&#39;s getting an unrepresenitive score \nthrough good or bad luck. Another ay of minimising this problem is to \nplay more games per evaluation, which has the same or similar effect as \naveraging scores from previous evals.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
