However, this set of inputs seems like it might\n&gt; be a little redundant.  The cat is also receiving input on its\n&gt; absolute position each time step as well, right?  Do the other\n&gt; papers use these sorts of inputs?\n\nI think these inputs will be necessary for the situations when the cat\nhas not seen the mouse yet and has no idea where to look.  This could\nbe used to give him a *vague* idea of where he has been before (to\navoid checking the same corridor 1000 times).\n\nNo, I have not seen these inputs used before.  But I have also not\nseen a prey capture scenario with restrictions on movement and sight\nlike this before, so I think it could prove a beneficial, and\nnecessary, addition.  I will be running the &#39;seek out&#39; behaviour test\nin the morning to see if these inputs prove useful.\n\nI changed the way they are measured: -1.0 means no tiles in that\ndirection to judge (in front of a wall).  0.0 means the cat was just\nthere and +1.0 means the cat has not been there in a very long time.\n\n&gt; My thinking was basically that the cat just might not be getting\n&gt; enough useful information as input upon which to act.\n&gt; Biologically, the longer an agent is exposed to stimuli, the\n&gt; stronger the impact, correct?  If I flash a card at you for 1\n&gt; second, it might be more difficult to identify or memorize the\n&gt; content than if I let you study it for 10 seconds.\n\n&gt; I was wondering if you basically disabled movement of both agents\n&gt; for the first 10 or so time steps, letting the cat see the mouse\n&gt; all that time before letting them move and letting the mouse move\n&gt; out of sight, that it might make a difference.  I don&#39;t know.\n\nThat is a *very* interesting idea.  If there is time at the end I will\ngo back and see if this has any affect.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
