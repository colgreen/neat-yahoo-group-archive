I\nam no=\r\nt sure I followed exactly how the CPPN would be connected to the\nneural net=\r\nwork?\n\nAs Peter mentioned, we have used the idea of CPPNs to represent\nconn=\r\nectivity patterns rather than the spatial patterns you saw in the\nCPPN pape=\r\nr.  These connectivity patterns can then be interpreted of\nneural network c=\r\nonnectivity patterns, which means you can evolve\nneural networks with regul=\r\narities in their connectivities.  There are\ncurrently four papers on this a=\r\npproach to evolving ANNs with CPPNs,\nwhich is called HyperNEAT.  Those pape=\r\nrs are available from my homepage\n\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/\n\nor fro=\r\nm EPlex publications:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html\n\nThe parti=\r\ncular papers are:\n\n-A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploiting Neural Netwo=\r\nrk Sensor and \nOutput Geometry\n\n-Generating Large-Scale Neural Networks Thr=\r\nough Discovering Geometric\nRegularities \n\n-A Case Study on the Critical Rol=\r\ne of Geometric Regularity in Machine\nLearning\n\n-Generative Encoding for Mul=\r\ntiagent Learning \n\nA longer journal paper on HyperNEAT is also forthcoming =\r\nin Artificial\nLife journal.\n\nBy the way, you can also interactively evolve =\r\nyour own CPPNs images\nonline at http://picbreeder.org\n\nBecause spatial patt=\r\nerns and connectivity patterns can represent just\nabout anything, there are=\r\n other potential applications of CPPNs beyond\nrepresenting ANNs, but curren=\r\ntly there is no publication of such an\napplication that I know of.  But it =\r\nwould be interesting to see more\nwork in that direction.\n\nken \n\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hyp=\r\nerNEAT uses CPPNs to build the neural network phenotypes (and \n&gt; evolves CP=\r\nPNs). I see this as an extension. There are about 3 or more \n&gt; papers on Hy=\r\nperNEAT. It should be interesting to you, though it is just \n&gt; one of all p=\r\nossible applications. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwi=\r\nst2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve just read through the paper Compos=\r\nitional Pattern Producing\n&gt; &gt; Networks: A Novel Abstraction of Development =\r\n- very interesting stuff.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Are there additional papers that extend=\r\n on this?  Currently what I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; seeing is based on visual representations=\r\n, but are there papers where\n&gt; &gt; this has been extended to pattern recognit=\r\nion or other fields?  My\n&gt; &gt; thought is that if a CPPN can capture importan=\r\nt spatial details that\n&gt; &gt; can then be evaluated by a standard NN, can the =\r\ntwo improve on pattern\n&gt; &gt; recognition tasks that have a relative spatial c=\r\nomponent -\n&gt; &gt; topological, geometric, higher dimensions...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Kirk\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
