This\n&gt; is a fully functional release that is made available in order to\n&gt; highlight any defects before issuing the code as an official version\n&gt; 2.0\n&gt; \n&gt; Features:\n&gt;    * Parallel execution. Concurrent genome decoding and genome\n&gt; evaluation, also concurrent speciation by k-means clustering.\n&gt; Implemented using Parallel Extensions (built-in to .Net 4, available\n&gt; as a separate library for compiling within Mono).\n&gt;    * Support for both NEAT and HyperNEAT/CPPNs.\n&gt;    * Generic framework classes with high level of abstraction and\n&gt; therefore flexibility and reusability in both NEAT and non-NEAT\n&gt; projects.\n&gt;    * Flexible XML configuration.\n&gt;    * XML IO for genomes and populations.\n&gt;    * Problem domains -\n&gt;          o Logical XOR.\n&gt;          o Binary 3-multiplexer, 6-multiplexer & 11-multiplexer.\n&gt;          o Function regression - sin(x), sin(x^2) & multiplication\n&gt; (with visualization).\n&gt;          o Boxes Visual Discrimination (with visualization). (see\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2009/stanley.alife09.html)\n&gt;          o Prey Capture (with visualization).\n&gt;          o Single Pole Balancing\n&gt;          o Double Pole Balancing (and variants)\n&gt; \n&gt;    * Speciation by k-means clustering (Single thread and parallel\n&gt; versions). To my knowledge this is the first NEAT implementation to\n&gt; use this approach and as such this code is experimental. Results so\n&gt; far have been positive.\n&gt;    * Complexity Regulation (previously known as phased pruning).\n&gt;    * GUI for modifying experiment parameters, controlling the\n&gt; execution of the evolution algorithm and visualization of genomes and\n&gt; problem domains.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
