In the examples used in the \nvarious p=\r\napers, the dimensionality of the substrate input and output \nnodes, as appl=\r\nied to the Hypercube inputs, were identical (i.e. x_in, \ny_in, x_out, y_out=\r\n). This simplifies the concept of distance. But the \nproblem could just as =\r\neasily have been: Do the two squares on the \nvisual field overlap? (yes/no)=\r\n. In this case, dimensionality of the \nsubstrate input and output nodes, as=\r\n applied to the Hypercube inputs, \nhave differing dimensionality, even thou=\r\ngh the answer is strongly \ndependent on proximity in the input visual field=\r\n. Any experience or \ncomments on this seemly more common general condition?=\r\n\n\nThanks,\n   Andy Carl \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;ks=\r\ntanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Andy, I&#39;d say this is a about right.  I elaborate a =\r\nbit below each \n&gt; part of your question:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jason or Ken,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    I am attemptin=\r\ng to understand the nature of inputs & outputs \nas \n&gt; &gt; applied to both the=\r\n Hypercube and substrate networks, without \nbeing \n&gt; &gt; limited to the geome=\r\ntric nature of the visual-based examples. The \n&gt; &gt; examples provided were h=\r\nelpful, but I am striving for a more \n&gt; general \n&gt; &gt; guideline for applicat=\r\nion to more general problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Would it be correct to say that:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (a) Substrate Network: Inputs & Outputs identified as typical to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; application of conventional NEAT to a problem of interest;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nis statement is correct although you might do things that you \nwould \n&gt; avo=\r\nid doing in conventional NEAT because HyperNEAT can deal with so \n&gt; many mo=\r\nre inputs and outputs.  So you might for example output a \nhigh \n&gt; resoluti=\r\non representation of your possible decisions, which is \n&gt; something you nor=\r\nmally wouldn&#39;t do in regular NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; (b) Hypercube Network: (i) Inputs=\r\n: Other descriptors/parameters \n&gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; geometric coordinates being a =\r\nsubset thereof), associated with a \n&gt; given \n&gt; &gt; substrate network node (i.=\r\ne. like a timestamp associated with a \n&gt; &gt; coordinate point comprising a tr=\r\najectory), mutually exclusive of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; descriptor/parameter expressly=\r\n identified in the substrate node, \n&gt; each \n&gt; &gt; being collected together an=\r\nd collectively identified as either \n&gt; a &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; or &quot;to&quot; terminator of =\r\na link between any two substrate nodes; and \n&gt; (ii) \n&gt; &gt; Output: Weight of =\r\nlink between the currently identified &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;to&quot; \n&gt; &gt; substrate nod=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think this characterizes it well, although there is even mo=\r\nre \n&gt; flexibility.  You can for example use additional outputs on the \nCPPN=\r\n \n&gt; to represent additional attributes of links and/or nodes.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The ti=\r\nmestamp idea is interesting- if I understand correctly it \nwould \n&gt; cause t=\r\nhe network to change over time in a deterministic way.  \n&gt; Although maybe I=\r\n&#39;m misunderstanding.  But certainly things like \nthat \n&gt; are possible.  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It&#39;s difficult to write an accurate general description of exactly \n&gt; wh=\r\nat goes in and comes out of the CPPN at this point because I have \n&gt; no dou=\r\nbt that at this early stage that new ideas are going to \nbroaden \n&gt; the pos=\r\nsibilities beyond what I am currently aware of.   But what \nyou \n&gt; said cap=\r\ntures it pretty well for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
