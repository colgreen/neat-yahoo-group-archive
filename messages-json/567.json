Xin Yao is a great speaker and a \n&gt;highly motivating and encouraging supervisor as well and yes it sure \n&gt;is very hard to catch him. I am currently writing a paper with him \n&gt;which of course deals with the group&#39;s favourite topic - \n&gt;neuroevolution, but from an ensemble learning perspective. \n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll second to Kennon&#39;s view on this MSc programme. It indeed is \n&gt;intellectually stimulating.\n&gt;\n&gt;cheers,\n&gt;Arjun\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Kennon, Arjun,\n\nEntirely coincental but I happen to be from Birmingham - or nearby now \nanyhow. Yeh, I was aware that there is an AI group there (Natural \nComputation is a much nicer term), though I&#39;ve never had any contact \nwith anyone in the group -  it does seem to have developed quite a bit \nsince I last checked it out. Xin Yao&#39;s 1999 paper &quot;Evolving Artificial \nNeural Networks&quot; was really the catalyst for me to have a go at an EANN \nproject instead of just thinking about it. Currently that means \ndeveloping my own version of NEAT in C# which I&#39;m keen to try against a \nrange of domains to get a feel for myself  just what NEAT (and similar \ntechniques) are capable of and what their limits are.\n\nAnyway it&#39;s interesting you guys are on this list. Are you or are any of \nyour colleagues actually working with NEAT? or are you just lurking? :)\n\nPerhaps I&#39;ll catch you off list since this is potentially straying \noff-topic somewhat.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
