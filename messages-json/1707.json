The only comment I had is the same one I had before, \nthat you do not define the &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; algorithm used in zooming \nthe images and the picture you show does not look like what I think of as \nnearest neighbour.  But I doubt that many in your audience will pick up on \nthat and I don&#39;t know whether it matters anyway...\n\n         In what sense is the image processing the bottleneck?  Is is \nbecause you have to zoom, translate and rotate the viewed portion of the \nimage in every evaluation frame?\n\n         Are you doing the image rot, tran, scale but spawning an \nimage-manipulation package in a  separate process?  If you are, then the \nprocess-spawn and associated file-accesses (load image, save image, \nmain-process load image...) will very probably be taking more time than the \nimage manipulation itself.  Writing your own (simple) image manipulation in \nC will cut the run-time hugely.  If you are already doing that then your \nproblem is more severe...\n\n         Could you consider treating your filled objects as a set algebraic \nrelationships (e.g. a triangle is the area where comparison to three line \nequations all return &quot;inside&quot; and a sphere is a radius test) so you could \nevaluate individual pixels as black or white at any level of zoom using a \nfew lines of algebra...\n\n         Ian B\n\nAt 19:17 07/11/2004, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt;Don&#39;t know if anyone else has had a chance to look at our paper, but\n&gt;we&#39;re still moving forward with this line of research and we had a\n&gt;general question we thought we&#39;d throw out to the group.\n&gt;\n&gt;We can evolve eyes that get in the upper 90s percentage-wise for\n&gt;identifying objects, but that last 2 or 3 percent is eluding us.  When\n&gt;evolving, we have a pop size of 100, and 30 randomized objects for\n&gt;evaluation.  But a best-evolved individual may have identifed all 30\n&gt;correctly, but when shown a test set of 100, for example, it will\n&gt;still miss two or three.  It seems like the evaluation set may be too\n&gt;small to generalize *all* possible randomizations.\n&gt;\n&gt;So we thought about increasing the evaluation set, but our image\n&gt;processing is our big bottleneck, and the more evaluations we add, the\n&gt;slower runs take.\n&gt;\n&gt;Does you think it makes sense to chop the pop size in half and up the\n&gt;evaluation set during evolution?  Or does anybody have any other\n&gt;ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
