One motiva=\r\ntion \nfor\n&gt; this competition is comparing strengths and weaknesses of vario=\r\nus \nCI\n&gt; techniques, such as temporal difference learning, neuroevolution, =\r\n\netc.\n&gt; Another motivation is just having a fun competition that is as \neas=\r\ny as\n&gt; possible to participate in, but still has some depth to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I t=\r\nhink NEAT could do very well on this problem, and interfacing it\n&gt; (especia=\r\nll one of the Java versions) to the competition code \nshould be\n&gt; quite sim=\r\nple. Is anyone up to the challenge?
