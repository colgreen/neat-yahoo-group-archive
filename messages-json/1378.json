My inputs are always in the range of +/- 1, centered \n&gt;around 0.  And it is always equally centered, such that it goes just as much \n&gt;above as below.\n&gt;\n&gt;NEAT, of course, captalizes on this fact.  By evolving networks that try \n&gt;their hardest to always return &#39;0&#39; as the output, they minimize their error. \n&gt;. . without actually solving the problem they were asked to solve.\n&gt;\n&gt;What I need is a fitness function that penalizes for this.\n&gt;\n&gt;I suppose I could keep track of the minimum and maximum of the activations \n&gt;and of the expected results.  The difference between the dynamic range of \n&gt;the expected vs. the dynamic range of the actual could be used to further \n&gt;penalize the network.  The bigger the difference in range, the higher the \n&gt;penalty.  Then, if it tries to optimize by always outputting 0, but the real \n&gt;dynamic range is +/-1 for a range of 2, then the penalty is 2, adding to the \n&gt;existing penalty of the average error, which hovers around 1/3.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re describing here John, sorry.\n\nI have an idea though, perhaps you could try a non-linear error function:\n\nHere is your current error function, where o is output and e is expected \nvalue, right?\n error = abs(o-e);\n\n\nHow about:\n error = abs(o-e) ^ 0.3\n\nThe error rises faster than the difference and maxes out when the \ndifference reaches 1.  An difference at or beyond 1 gets the maximum \npossible error.\n\n\nSome test cases, say you have two test images and for a particular \noutput you are expecting the values -0.8 and 0.8.\n\nHere is the error for different output values:\n\no = -0.8, error = 0+1 = 1\no = 0, error = 0.935 + 0.935 = 1.87\n\n\nSo now you value getting one of the test cases correct and one wrong, \nover getting them both halfway right.\n\nSome variation on this might work. Not that you might want to tweak the \nequation slightly - if I had used 0.5 instead of 0.8 in the example then \nyour problem re-appears, so you might want the function to max out earlier.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
