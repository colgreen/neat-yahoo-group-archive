FBM is a generalisation over normal\nbrownian motion, but both are random and as such inherently\nunpredictable.\n\nAs an example of how FBM can be misleading consider predicting traffic\nbased on a daily cycle. The prediction works well for a while and then\nsome random event sends your error score soaring, e.g. long term\nroadworks requiring a detour, natural disaster, traffic signal\nfailures perhaps caused by power outages (power consumption patterns\nare similar in nature to traffic levels). Of course strictly speaking\nsun spots also exhibit FBM - if you wait long enough the activity goes\noff the scale and ultimately reaches zero, and the regular patterns\nmay change periodically also.\n\nThe best &#39;primer&#39; on the subject I have encountered is the book &quot;The\nMisbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence&quot;, by\nBenoit Mandelbrot and Richard Hudson. Unlike Mandelbrot&#39;s other works\nit&#39;s a very easy read and extremely light on the formal maths but\nexplains FBM very well nontheless.\n\nI think a major point here is framing the problem correctly. E.g. we\n/can/ predict traffic and many other things under /normal/\ncircumstances but we have to acknowledge the critical importance of\nrare events; mitigating the effects of those may be better than\nrefining daily/weekly/yearly predictions. If I&#39;m a company operating a\ntoll road then I should put some significant thought into what big\nthings could go wrong rather than trying to refine daily/weekly/yearly\npredictions to better optimize my use of debt.\n\nApologies for drifting off-topic somewhat :)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
