Can we directly sense joint\nangles?  I&#39;m guessing not.  I think we probably deduce\nthat from our more direct &quot;force&quot; senses (i.e. sense\nof touch).  ...Not that that matters for this project.\n Of course, using simulated senses we (&quot;real&quot;) humans\ndon&#39;t have can help a simulated human.  However, I\nlike the idea of making simulated humans mimic real\nhumans as closely as possible since real humans seem\nto work pretty well.\n\nI think there&#39;s a term for the sense of &quot;knowing your\nlimbs&#39; positions, orientations, etc.&quot; is the\n&quot;proprioceptive system.&quot;  So maybe an artificial\nneural network could build this sort of mental model\ngiven some primitive input.\n\nAnother sense could be the vestibular system (the\ncircular tubes in our ears that help us sense angular\nvelocities).  That would be pretty simple to implement\nand seems like it would help.\n\nAnother big thing on my to-do list is a sense of\nsight.  The two main options I&#39;ve thought of are\nthese:\n\n1.  Ray-casting.  Shoot a grid of rays out from the\nface that each return the distance of the nearest\nintersection (i.e. distance sensors).  More rays could\nbe added throughout evolution.  I&#39;ve heard that such\nintersection testing in large quantities is pretty\nexpensive if the environment is complex.\n\n2.  Use some sort of image processing/computer vision.\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
