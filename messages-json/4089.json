Empty areas, now volumnes, would be sparsely filled (increased\nfrom area ^2 to volume ^3). \n\nThat would indicate that some of the novelties would expand X^(3/2) and\nsome would expand X^2, which might make the resulting sum worse than\n(sqrt(X))^3.\n\nI understand your explanation that not the entire search space is going to\nbe searched due to the complexification nature of NEAT, but that doesn&#39;t\nenter into the computation if what I say above is correct. Extending the\ncurrent behaviour in 2D (which allready incorporates the advantage you\ndescrive) into 3D should look similar to the 2D result, and therefore\nrequire that many more novelties to be visited.\n\nIf some additional effect would occur making the 3D version look\nsignificalty different from the 2D version, then all bets are off, but\nspeculating about that seems a wee bit... speculative?  ;)\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
