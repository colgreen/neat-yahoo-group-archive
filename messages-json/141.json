There are two things stopping me from doing\nthis right now:\n\n-I&#39;m not sure if the NE community is currently big enough to support\nsuch a site, or to need such a site.  Certainly NE is not as big as\nevolutionary computation in general, and although NE is growing, I&#39;m\nnot sure what the demand would be in the present.\n\n-I don&#39;t know if I have time to run such a site...evonet looks like a\npretty time=consuming project.  I doubt I can maintain it on my own.\n\nThat said, at some point I would like to have such a site for NE.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
