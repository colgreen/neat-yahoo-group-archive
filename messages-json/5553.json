Have you had a chance to read Ken and I&#39;s recent publica=\r\ntion on novelty search and local competition: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publi=\r\ncations/2011/lehman.gecco11.html? Some of\nthe ideas we introduce there are =\r\nsomewhat similar in spirit to what you are suggesting.\n\nIn that publication=\r\n we apply NS to evolve virtual creatures. We look\nboth for creatures with n=\r\novel morphologies and those that have high\nfitness relative to their morpho=\r\nlogical niche. \n\nThat is, we have a space of morphologies characterized by =\r\nheight and\nweight. Within that 2D space we reward both novelty and localize=\r\nd fitness (fitness normalized by looking at its kNN in the 2D morphology sp=\r\nace, this type of normalization might also work in your instance). These tw=\r\no objectives are balanced using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. T=\r\nhe end result is that you an discover a wide diversity of different functio=\r\nnal morphologies within a single run.\n\nAnother way of looking at our approa=\r\nch is that we are implicitly doing\nfitness sharing in a derived 2D space to=\r\n encourage local specialization within niches -- that is, a tall, skinny cr=\r\neature does\nnot compete directly with a medium-sized, medium-weight morphol=\r\nogy\nthat may be more naturally suited to fast locomotion. This seems somewh=\r\nat related to your idea, although yours involves additional evaluations and=\r\n weighted averages of different fitnesses depending on the X,Y niching coor=\r\ndinates.\n\nYour suggestion of a more general conception of incremental evolu=\r\ntion\nis interesting as well. One problem with incremental evolution\nis that=\r\n you have to know both what the stepping stones are and the order in which =\r\nthey should be discovered to create some sort of training plan. Your genera=\r\nlization might alleviate the need to know the &quot;order&quot; of the stepping stone=\r\ns because genomes can specialize to whatever objective they are most suited=\r\n to (by changing their XY through mutation).\n\nAnyways, I look forward to se=\r\neing your idea further developed, it seems like a cool approach to potentia=\r\nlly evolve more complex things.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin&quot;=\r\n &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;co=\r\nlin.green1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Typically the x,y here could be weightings given=\r\n to different aspects\n&gt; &gt; of a fitness function or we could combine two dis=\r\ntinct fitness\n&gt; &gt; functions with weights (which amounts to the same thing).=\r\n So e.g.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    f(G, x, y) =3D (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * y)\n&gt; \n&gt; On relfe=\r\nction this isn&#39;t quite right. One weigting would adjust the balance between=\r\n two fitness functions, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt;     f(G, x) =3D (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * (1=\r\n-x))\n&gt; \n&gt; So for a 2D space you&#39;d have something like:\n&gt; \n&gt;     f(G, x, y) =\r\n=3D (f1(G) * x) + (f2(G) * (1-x)) \n&gt;                + (f3(G) * y) + (f4(G) =\r\n* (1-y)) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; We also need a way to make selection not become biased to=\r\nwards Individuals in one part of the space because they get better fitness =\r\nthere - maybe the fitnesses need be normalized in some way (max in each reg=\r\nion is the same) but that doesn&#39;t feel quite right (needs more thought).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll also give an example of a domain to try and explain why this might =\r\nwork. Consider a fitness function with just 1 dimension f(G,x) and we&#39;re tr=\r\nyign to evolve a bipedal walker. f1 could be a standing still test (not fal=\r\nling over), f2 could be the walking distance test. So you&#39;re genomes start =\r\nout by doing well on f1 and then some migrate over to f2 to populate that r=\r\negion of the fitness space. It does mean more CPU effort having to evaulate=\r\n f1 and f2, and you also need to define network inputs such that you can te=\r\nll the biped whether to stand or walk, so it&#39;s not an entirely trivial swap=\r\n in replacement of G based fitness sharing, but I&#39;m warming to the idea the=\r\n more I think about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
