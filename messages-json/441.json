I&#39;m just making some\n&gt; minor adaptations to it to use with NEAT.  It was\n&gt; developed by some folks at Carnegie Mellon University\n&gt; and Georgia Tech.\n\nOk sorry, I thought you were involved in the development, but no problem.\n\nI&#39;ve followed the XML thread (and I&#39;ve seen the file proposed-neat.xml), it\nseems to me that\ntwo general features are important for the standard:\n\n-Neutral standard for indirect and direct encoding.\n-Support dynamic addition of domains tags (as proposed by Colin).\n\nThe first seems necessary and straight forward since people like you Derek\nare working with indirect encoding; I&#39;m not sure if supporting both type of\nencodings may generate some kind of conflicts in the standard (seems not to\nbe a problem).\nThe second is a little more delicate because I think domain specific tags\nmay get out of control and make the standard useless.\n\nRight now I do not have more specific comments until I start using the\nproposed xml template (in about 15 days).\n\nSo far I think it looks good.\n\nRegards.\n\nGerman\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
