I imagine that when you\n&gt;&gt;learn, it is not a topological innovation.  \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Really?  Then how do you propose that learning can take place in a\n&gt;fixed topology, fixed weight network?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGoing back to the discussion about spiking neurons and what info might \nbe in the spike trains. One idea I had was that the spike trains convey \naddressing information as well as a value. Consider TCP/IP networks \nwhere you can address a specific node or you can broadcast to all nodes \nin a sub network. If neurons could do this then in effect you have a \nlogical network topology that sits atop of the physical topology. The \nlogical topology can then be modified by neurons adjusting which \naddresses they listen too (they could have more than one) and what \naddresses that attach to their outgoing signals.\n\nThis is just one example of how such a system might work. The general \nprinciple I think is that neurons could be describing some kind of \nlogical network and that the network can be updated by changes in the \ninternal state of neurons (which in biology happens in timescales from \nmilliseconds to days) - without any change of connections between \nneurons. Remember the discussion about data buses in the brain? This is \none approach that would allow data buses to be set up - perhaps like \ndynamic routing tables on the internet.\n\nSo it comes down to whether you mean fixed physical topology or fixed \nlogical topology.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
