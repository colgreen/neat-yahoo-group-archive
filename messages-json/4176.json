I believe it would be okay to let\nactivatio=\r\nn functions inside nodes mutate, but if that is done I would\nnot change the=\r\n neuron to a neuron with a different innovation number.\n That would not wor=\r\nk well for NEAT because it would mean that the same\nconnection connects to =\r\nmore than one neuron (i.e. in some cases the\noriginal neuron and in some ca=\r\nses the new neuron), which means that\nthe actual network structure becomes =\r\nambiguous e.g. during mating of\nsuch individuals.    \n\nHowever, I understan=\r\nd the motivation for your suggestion, but I am\nguessing if the chance of mu=\r\ntation is low enough it will not be all\nthat destructive to simply mutate t=\r\nhe functions while leaving the\ninnovation numbers for their respective node=\r\ns unchanged.  \n\nBy the way, I would consider this issue an implementation d=\r\netail, so\nit is not necessarily an &quot;official&quot; part of the HyperNEAT system =\r\nthat\nit does or does not mutate the activation functions of\nalready-existin=\r\ng nodes.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;godin.gregory&quot; &lt;godin.gregory@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; First off, let me introduce myself.\n&gt; I&#39;m a french=\r\n developper working in IT software compagny completely \n&gt; non related to IA=\r\n. Well actually, I&#39;m a complete newbie concerning \n&gt; IA ;).\n&gt; Few times ago=\r\n, I started a personnal project that aims to evolve ANN \n&gt; with genetic pro=\r\ngramming for a simple food gathering problem. I \n&gt; discovered NEAT and Hype=\r\nrNeat (and this group) by googleing the \n&gt; subject.\n&gt; I&#39;m still reading the=\r\n litterature, and I sometimes do have hard time \n&gt; to fully understand the =\r\nwhole picture.\n&gt; (Btw, sorry for my poor english, I read a lot in english b=\r\nut I almost \n&gt; never write/spoke, and thus I&#39;m just loosing my skills over =\r\ntime.)\n&gt; \n&gt; My question is quite simple. After a quick look on HyperNeat pa=\r\nckage, \n&gt; I saw there is no mutation that shift the activation function of =\r\nCPNN.\n&gt; So I was wondering if this mutation could be relevant, and if Neat =\r\n\n&gt; can handle this kind of mutation?\n&gt; I think it could be done by simply d=\r\nisabling the neuron and add a new \n&gt; neuron with the same name but with a d=\r\nifferent innovation number.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Greg.\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: My apologies if =\r\nthe question is just stupid ;)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
