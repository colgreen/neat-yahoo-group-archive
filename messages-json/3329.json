But \nthe node biases and time constants are also simple. When I watch=\r\n an \nanimaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it looks like it=\r\n \nexibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be described as a mexican \n=\r\nwave travelling across the hidden nodes. \nAs the CPPNs complexify, so do th=\r\ne activity patterns exibited. When \nusing regular NEAT for the problem of k=\r\neeping the humanoid model \nbalanced, it has moslty erratic behaviour, and t=\r\nhe lucky ones (with \nhigh fitness) usually find a way to trick the system a=\r\nnd stay in a \nbalanced position forever, without moving at all. \nBut when H=\r\nyperNEAT is used for this, it looks really interesting and.. \nnatural! The =\r\nmodel is trying to balance using its arms, and it is \nmoving.. It looks lik=\r\ne a drunk guy, but you note the difference. \nI&#39;ve arranged the nodes in a g=\r\neometric way.. Let me explain - the left \nand right arm&#39;s outputs are separ=\r\nated in the left and right in the \nsubstrate space, and close to each other=\r\n. So do the legs. The hidden \nnodes are in the center in a star/cirlular sh=\r\nape. I also included 3 \ninputs (head velocity) in the center around 0.0, bu=\r\nt with smaller \nradius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n"}}
