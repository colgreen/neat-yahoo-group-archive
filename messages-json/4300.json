For this game a real-time version \nof =\r\nNEAT was created and the player essentially trains a team of robots \nto fig=\r\nht. Then makes battles with some other player&#39;s team. It is fun, \nit is eve=\r\nn an entirely new genre of computer games. \n\nBut I guess you mean games of =\r\na broader range, where the player \ncompetes with, or fights the NPCs, rathe=\r\nr than training them. If we \ncut out the FPS genre, there are many other ge=\r\nnres where NEAT can be \napplied. One example is strategic games, where the =\r\nunits are like in \nNERO but play against yours and get smarter as the game =\r\nprogresses. \nGenerally, in cases where the NPCs are many and of the same ty=\r\npe, they \ndon&#39;t have to be as intelligent as NPCs in FPS games, where you f=\r\night \na bot directly, not lots of them. In cases where one population of \ne=\r\nvolving NPCs plays against another, an interesting co-evolutionary \narms ra=\r\nce may occur. \n\nIt is important to note that NPCs playing against the playe=\r\nr may just \nbecome *too good* at their task and therefore make the game bor=\r\ning. In \norder to keep the game interesting, Novelty Search can be applied,=\r\n but \nthere is an issue. NS will have to explore too ugly and stupid \nbehav=\r\niors before it ever finds a meaningful one. Therefore it is not \nsuited to =\r\nreal-time video games where the agents learn as the game \nprogresses. I&#39;d l=\r\nike to see if there is something proving me wrong \nabout it. \n\nNow about em=\r\notions. Modeling emotions through NE sounds like \nsupervised training to me=\r\n. Observing emotions and learning to imitate \nthem and make up its own. The=\r\nre are games so close to reality that \nwill have to include realistic emoti=\r\nons for the next-generation NPCs. \nSuch games are &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;T=\r\nhe Sims&quot;. \n\nIf emotions are not to be evolved, but scripted, NEAT can poten=\r\ntially \nuse the emotions as inputs for possible intelligent behaviors. Play=\r\ners \ncan produce their own character behaviors through interactive \nevoluti=\r\non or just pick up and download behaviors from an archive \ngenerated by Nov=\r\nelty Search. \n\nBorrowing some ideas from chat-bots that simulate emotion ma=\r\nybe is a \ngood thing to start. I have a book in bulgarian (back from 1974),=\r\n \nwhere it is mentioned about one model proposed by the Ukraine \nscientist =\r\nNikolay Amosov. Here is a cite from it (my translation, \nsorry about any er=\r\nrors):\n\n/*** CITATION ***/ \n...\n\nExcellent results were obtained from the i=\r\nmplementation of the \nproposed model for AI by the soviet scientist Nikolay=\r\n Amosov. Before \nwe tell you about his concept, let&#39;s introduce the termino=\r\nlogy. Amosov \nthinks, that &quot;Thinking - this is processing information. The =\r\n\ninformation can be considered as facts for the object/s, represented \nby a=\r\n *model*. The model is a complex system that reflects another \ncomplex syst=\r\nem - the object/s. Therefore the act of thinking is a \nmanipulation with th=\r\ne models from the inner and outside world, \ntargeted to achieve certain goa=\r\nls. A system with this capability can \nbe called *intelligence*.&quot;\n\n... \n\nTh=\r\ne human brain is a very complex system, made up from billions of \nneurons w=\r\nith differing characteristics. Via many connections, they \nconnect into a h=\r\nuge network. In this network the models of the inner \nand outer reality are=\r\n created. In this sense, the model is a group of \ninterconnected neurons th=\r\nat excite together. \n\n... \n\nThe processing of the information happens via a=\r\nctivating the neurons \nand sending impulses between them. That way the mode=\r\nls are activated \nand interact. The impulses come from the inner and outer =\r\nworlds (by  \nevents that are sensed) and activate the apropriate models. Fo=\r\nr \nexample the smell of burning wood excites the model that represents \nfir=\r\ne and makes us search for the source of fire. The sense of hunger \nexcites =\r\nthe model of the meal we wish to eat and makes us imagine the \nfood and the=\r\n ways we can get it. *(The absence of addictive drugs have \nsimilar effects=\r\n - Peter C.)*. \n\nThe models that get excited in our brain simultaneously ar=\r\ne too many, \nbecause the environmental challenges are too many as well. Her=\r\ne is why \na mechanism is needed, a system, that chooses only one model from=\r\n the \nset and excites it, putting it into the focus of our attention, while=\r\n \ninhibiting the others. According to Amosov, and this is the heart of \nhis=\r\n concept, this task is performed by a core system, the System of \nExcitemen=\r\nt and Inhibition (SEI). Its task is to coordinate the \ninteraction between =\r\nmodels. SEI does not work all the time, but on \nshort impulses. It excites =\r\nthe model that has the highest level of \nactivity, but periodically turns o=\r\nff in order to &quot;listen&quot; for other \nmodels that became active. Because the e=\r\nnvironment and the inner state \nare constantly changing, the models are cha=\r\nnging as well.\n\n...\n\nWe cannot take a deeper look at all models now, becaus=\r\ne they are too \nmany, but according to Amosov, creativity can be viewed as =\r\nthe \ncreation of new models based on existing others. We also need to \nunde=\r\nrline the big role of emotions. They are the main engine of SEI. \nThe activ=\r\nity of the System of Excitement and Inhibition correlates \ndirectly to the =\r\nactivity of emotions. \n\n/*** END OF CITATION ***/\n\nOK well this citation sh=\r\nould bring up some ideas of what can be done. \nIn fact it has to be already=\r\n implemented somewhere, I don&#39;t know where \nthough, maybe as a paper or tap=\r\ne on the first computers :) It is \nwritten that when SEI is turned on, the =\r\nexperimental bot exhibits very \nintelligent behavior. And very &quot;emotional&quot; =\r\nalso. If SEI is off, the \nmodels are like fighting each other and the bot g=\r\nets confused. It is \njust one interesting model for an emotional AI, I don&#39;=\r\nt know if it has \nbeen well-researched, but it seems like a good thing to t=\r\nry and get \nimplemented. This is my opinion concerning emotional AIs. \n\nOth=\r\nerwise there are many many games where the NPCs can use NEAT, at \nleast par=\r\ntially in order to modify their strategies. The most \npromising technique I=\r\n know of is Knowledge-Based NEAT ( KB NEAT, http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~nn/pr=\r\noject-view.php?ProjID=3D131 ). You can \nscript a general FSM-based AI and t=\r\nhen convert it to a working neural \nnetwork with the same behavior. Then yo=\r\nu can leave it to improve \nfurther, complexifying and possibly altering the=\r\n strategy through \nrtNEAT. This is basically injecting a priori information=\r\n for the \nsearch, a good kick-start for evolution, which is much better tha=\r\nn \nsearching for it from scratch. Plus, it is guaranteed that the whole \nkn=\r\nowledge is there, because they are not evolved from some weird \nlower-dimen=\r\ntional spaces, initially progressing quickly but turning \nout to be dead-en=\r\nds for further progress in the long run. \n\nIt is also possible to exploit g=\r\neometric relationships in the task \ndomain via Connective CPPNs (HyperNEAT)=\r\n. My NEVH project is one \nexample, though it didn&#39;t ever achieve perfect wa=\r\nlking in a 3D \nsimulated physics environment. My conclusion about it is tha=\r\nt gravity \nmakes the humanoid model fall too soon and FS cannot progress. E=\r\nven NS \ncannot progress in the way I want, unless the behavior \ncharacteriz=\r\nation is changed and the gravity removed. But for other \nanimal-like robot =\r\nmorphologies it should apply perfectly. \nIt is actually not just about walk=\r\ning gaits. Any game has geometric \nregularities that HyperNEAT can discover=\r\n and exploit. \n\nPeter C\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shanemcdonaldryan&quot; \n=\r\n&lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking of applying for a grant to=\r\n apply NEAT to video games. \nI\n&gt; am interested if anyone has ideas on apply=\r\ning NEAT to non-first \nperson\n&gt; shooter (FPS) games.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be interested=\r\n in ideas on how to use NEAT to develop reactive\n&gt; emotions for players. Es=\r\nsentially I&#39;d like to see anyones ideas on \nhow\n&gt; to give non player charac=\r\nters (NPC)emotions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any other ideas of applying NEAT to non-FPS games =\r\nwould be greatly\n&gt; appreciated and I will shamelessly copy them and put the=\r\nm in my \ngrant\n&gt; application :)\n&gt; \n&gt; However if I get the grant I will keep=\r\n the group updated on my\n&gt; progress. I think the more people working full t=\r\nime on NEAT related\n&gt; projects the better.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Shane\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
