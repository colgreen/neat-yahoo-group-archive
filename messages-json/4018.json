But the information should be up-front going in rather than \n&gt; withheld and unanswered.\n\nAndy, I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s bothering you. You express\nimpatience that every possible question has not been answered within\none year of the debut of a completely new methodology. It verges on\nparanoia to suggest that we are &quot;withholding&quot; information (the source\ncode is released; anyone can perform any experiment that they wish). \nI suppose you just don&#39;t realize how much effort goes into running\nexperiments and writing papers. \n\nNotice that others in this group ask questions that are couched as\nfriendly discussion. Yet you take the attitude that someone is hiding\nsomething from you and you are therefore &quot;disturbed.&quot; \n\nYou should change your tone. Instead of attacking the source for not\nhaving answered every question that you have and performed every\nexperiment that you personally believe we should ever perform, why not\nput it more like, &quot;It would be interesting to see if...&quot; or &quot;One\nexperiment I&#39;d like to perform is...&quot; or &quot;An interesting question is\nwhether...&quot; In other words, what is accomplished by your aggressive,\nconfrontational demeanor?\n\nI remember hearing once, though I do not remember the source, an\ninteresting quote on scientific research. To paraphrase: &quot;Good\nscientific research answers hard questions. However, the best\nscientific research raises entirely new questions that we never could\nhave even asked before.&quot; Think of quantum physics. The uncertainty\nprinciple has led to endless discussion of paradoxes and\nimpossibilities, with no end in sight, but we do not see people\naccusing Heisenberg of trying to hide the &quot;truth.&quot; Instead, it is a\ncredit to his discovery that we are now asking such profound questions.\n\nSo let me suggest to you that you change your tone and drop the\nconfrontational demeanor. That is not an appropriate way to speak to\ncolleagues, or to anyone else for that matter, and I sincerely hope to\nmaintain the exceptional positive atmosphere this group has maintained\nthroughout 5 years (believe it or not!) of fruitful and interesting\ndiscussion.\n\nLet me also add that I am not the moderator (who is Derek James, who\nhas done an excellent job), and therefore this is just my personal\nsuggestion.\n\nken\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0001_01C8AA99.88742390\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16640&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGRO=\r\nUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D453535913-30=\r\n042008&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Amen to the time it tak=\r\nes conducting \nexperiments!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D453535913-30042008&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D4=\r\n53535913-30042008&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Science is w=\r\neeks of methodical, experimental tedium \npunctuated by a few&nbsp;&quot;Aha&quot; mom=\r\nents.&nbsp; The discussion regarding CPPNs, \nHyperNEAT and the boundaries o=\r\nf the envelope have been tremendous.&nbsp; I feel \nlike I&#39;m playing catch-u=\r\np to understand the some of the fundamental capabilities \nof HyperNEAT, whe=\r\nn compared with the rest of the group - but what I see is \nexciting indeed!=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D453535913-30=\r\n042008&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3D453535913-30042008&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \ncolor=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;Ken Lloyd&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial color=3D#0000ff size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dlef=\r\nt&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \nsize=3D1&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px;=\r\n BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV class=3DOutlook=\r\nMessageHeader lang=3Den-us dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;\n  &lt;HR tabIndex=3D-1&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; neat@yahoogroups.com \n  [mailto:ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com] &lt;B&gt;On Behalf Of &lt;/B&gt;Kenneth \n  Stanley&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; =\r\nTuesday, April 29, 2008 5:15 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; \n  neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [neat] Re: Machine Learning and the \n  Long View of AI&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;--- In &lt;A \n  href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;afcarl2&quot;=\r\n \n  &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The lack of \n  scientific/me=\r\nthodic&lt;WBR&gt;al approach in demonstrating ability &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to \n  discover pat=\r\nterns, a priori known patterns, before attempting to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  demonstrat=\r\ne a &quot;killer-application&lt;WBR&gt;&quot;, for which there is no known &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  figu=\r\nre of merit to compare &quot;ability to discover patterns&quot;, is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  distu=\r\nrbing, and expecting an inordinate level of faith on the part of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n  the reader.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The lack of any comparative computational co=\r\nst \n  data is equally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; disturbing, and begs the question, especiall=\r\ny since \n  there appears to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be a growing body of user experience t=\r\nhat the \n  computational cost is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; steep.
