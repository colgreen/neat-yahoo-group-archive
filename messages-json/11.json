My name is Joseph Reisinger, I&#39;m an\n&gt; undergraduate student at UT. I&#39;m\n&gt; working with Risto and Ken on an honors thesis; the\n&gt; topic is modularity in\n&gt; NE systems. \n\nHi, Joseph.\n\nI&#39;ve read your paper on modular NEAT, and it was very\ninteresting.  Philip and I are still wrapping up a\nstandard implementation of NEAT in Java, but the most\ninteresting directions we&#39;d like to go next are:\n\n1) Indirect encoding\n2) Variations of competitive coevolution\n3) Learning during an individual&#39;s lifespan\n\nYour website says this about the reusable modules:\n\n&quot;A variable complexity building block (module) can\nhave any number of hidden neurons and connections and\ncan be re-used anywhere any number of times in a\nchromosome.&quot;\n\nBut if I understood your paper correctly, the modules\ncan only connect directly to the input and output\nlayers.  Is that right?\n\nI like the way the modules start minimally, just as\nNEAT itself does, and complexify throughout the run. \nThis seems like the right approach.  \n\nAre you going to continue working with modularity in\nNEAT?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
