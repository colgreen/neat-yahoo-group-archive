Sounds similar except your labels\n&gt;could be used to connect up disperate networks right, whereas Mod. NEAT\n&gt;modules always connect between the input and output layers, they don;t\n&gt;connect to each other.\n\nYes, I was in the discussion we had here a few months ago.\n\nISRT the Modular NEAT paper did use labels, but they were explicit, not \nevolving (e.g. the label said &quot;I connect to (1,3)&quot;).  That works fine as \nlong as every &quot;concept&quot; that the system might want to label exists from the \nstart.  The idea behind arbitrary labels is that new concepts can evolve as \nrequired.\n\nMod Neat with module to module connections was something I suggested at the \ntime.\n\nHowever, in the domain used for that paper there&#39;s also the question of the \nsymmetry of the board.  If a ALS/modular system worked, then it should be \nable to evolve it&#39;s own systems to exploit the symmetry (e.g. the same \narrangement of pieces on a different part of the board should use the same \nmodule).  But who knows how long that might take.  As an alternative, one \ncould build some understanding of symmetry into the system from the \nfirst.  That would involve a different idea, where connections to modules \ncontain relative positions.  Such as:\n\nconnection#1 :  Any Square\nconnection#2 : LeftOf(Connection#1)\nconnection#3 : Above(Connection#1)\n\n...\n\nWhich is another strand in the stuff I&#39;m writing up.  The use of simple \npattern-recognition to connect modules in a smart manner.  It&#39;s just the \nextension of the ALS, e.g. if an output from one module consists of more \nthan one channel and they both need to be wired up, then the labels on the \nreceiving module can read something like:\n\nconnection#1 : concept-A\nconnection#2 : concept-B from the same place as connection#1\n\nWhich would serve to pass X and Y coordinates around together...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
