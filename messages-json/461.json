We have a graphical game engine that is working for us\n&gt; for now, but we are starting to think more long-term about the right\n&gt; engine for the future.  I wonder if anyone here knows any way to \n&gt; license or obtain an RTS-style game engine from any company or\n&gt; organization?  There are several first-person-shooter style engines\n&gt; available, but it&#39;s much harder to find an RTS engine.  Any\n&gt; suggestions would be apprecated!\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
