Instead of dropping the species that\ndon&#39;t improve since a long time, giving them a luck\nwith higher mutations rates since reasonable. Some\nissues came to my mind :\n   * How to handle the fact we have several kind of\nmutations ? One answer would be to randomly modify\ntheir probability.\n   * Dropping species could be also good, because it\nfavors exploitation of most promising species. I would\napply the adaptation of mutation rates only on the\ndesperate case : any global improvement since a long\ntime.\n\n--- &quot;Rafael C.P.&quot; &lt;kurama.youko.br@...&gt; a �crit\n:\n\n&gt; I suggest you to read about MOGA (Mutation Only\n&gt; Genetic Algorithms) and\n&gt; AGA/LHDC/SHDC (Adaptive Genetic Algorithms). But\n&gt; it&#39;s not intended to\n&gt; increase diversity and find new solutions, it&#39;s\n&gt; intended to make the best\n&gt; possible mutations within the current population.\n&gt; Anyway, I agree that\n&gt; mutation to increase diversity is a good thing, I&#39;ve\n&gt; already implemented it\n&gt; in a class some time ago (but I&#39;ve used the total\n&gt; population instead of the\n&gt; rate change of fitness, which now, indeed, I think\n&gt; would be better).\n&gt; \n&gt; On 3/20/07, shanemcdonaldryan\n&gt; &lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Hi my name is Shane Ryan. I am researching using\n&gt; NEAT for time series\n&gt; &gt; prediction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been lurking in the group for the past few\n&gt; months. I&#39;ve got a\n&gt; &gt; few questions/suggestions that I&#39;ll post as three\n&gt; separate messages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am wondering if anyone has tried using a\n&gt; variable mutation rate?\n&gt; &gt; Basically if the system determines that overall\n&gt; the fitness rate\n&gt; &gt; change has gone below a threshold value. Then\n&gt; increase the chance of\n&gt; &gt; new nodes being added and increase the range of\n&gt; weight variations\n&gt; &gt; until the fitness begins to improve again. Then\n&gt; lower the system wide\n&gt; &gt; mutation rate back down again once there has been\n&gt; an improvement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The way I see it when the system begins to\n&gt; stagnate. Instead of\n&gt; &gt; continuing to fine tune the system. Start making\n&gt; some much more\n&gt; &gt; radical changes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another way to do this might be too increase the\n&gt; number of species\n&gt; &gt; based of the rate change of fitness. Essentially\n&gt; start with many\n&gt; &gt; species then lower the overall number of species\n&gt; and increase their\n&gt; &gt; populations when you want to fine tune the\n&gt; solutions. But if there\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t been any improvements for a significant\n&gt; amount of time start\n&gt; &gt; increasing the variety of topologies (ie increase\n&gt; the number of\n&gt; &gt; species) until there are some improvements.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I searched the archives but didn&#39;t find any topics\n&gt; exactly matching\n&gt; &gt; this. Sorry if it has been discussed ad nauseum.\n&gt; Please point me in\n&gt; &gt; the right direction if this topic has been flogged\n&gt; to death!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shane Ryan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =========\n&gt; Rafael C.P.\n&gt; =========\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =========\n&gt; Rafael C.P.\n&gt; =========\n&gt; \n\n\n_______________________________\nMarmakoide aka Alexandre Devert \n_______________________________\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________________________ \nD�couvrez une nouvelle fa�on d&#39;obtenir des r�ponses � toutes vos questions ! \nProfitez des connaissances, des opinions et des exp�riences des internautes sur Yahoo!
