Though I agree that it is conceptually quite \nappealing: especially its ability to compare vectors of different sizes.\n\nStephane and Jean-Baptiste have shown that even simple distance measures \nsuch as Hamming distance between binary sensory-motor vectors can work \nwell.  But, if an individual is a robot with an evolving morphology and \nit does not have a fixed set of sensors or motors it becomes less clear \nwhat the vector characterizing its behavior should be.  You could still \nuse vectors of sensory motor signals and have vectors of different \nsizes, in which case you would need something like NCD.  Or, you could \nuse some other behavioral characterization that would always have a \nfixed dimension in which you would be losing a lot of information about \nthe individual&#39;s behavior.\n\nDo you have some way of approximating NCD that is more computationally \nfeasible?\n\nBest,\nJosh\n\n\nOn 06/14/2013 10:35 AM, Drew Kirkpatrick wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Josh,\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as behavioral diversity goes, there&#39;s been some interesting \n&gt; papers on using information distance.

I replaced NEAT&#39;s speciation mechanism with a genotypic\n&gt;     diversity metric computed as the distance to the k-nearest\n&gt;     neighbors calculated using NEAT&#39;s genomic distance measure.  This\n&gt;     seemed to work well enough.  Though, as Stephane mentioned, based\n&gt;     on his and Jean-Baptiste&#39;s work it is quite likely that using a\n&gt;     behavioral diversity metric would be even more effective. \n&gt;     However, in some domains it is not clear how behavioral distance\n&gt;     should be characterized.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Ken/Joel, I do have a question for you:  In my NSGA-II / CPPN-NEAT\n&gt;     hybrid I did not use any crossover and just relied on asexual\n&gt;     reproduction.  Did  you incorporate sexual reproduction in your\n&gt;     implementation?  If so, how did you determine which individuals\n&gt;     were allowed to mate if speciation was not employed?\n&gt;\n&gt;     Best,\n&gt;     Josh\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     On 06/13/2013 10:37 PM, Oliver Coleman wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     &quot;Effective Diversity Maintenance in Deceptive Domains&quot; (J.\n&gt;&gt;     Lehman, K.
