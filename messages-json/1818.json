But I was \ninspired by some folk doing artificial life work rather than NN.  e.g. one \nof them (I&#39;ll try to find the reference) had a system which essentially \nevolved systems of partial differential equations.  I think he followed a \ncomplexification process not dissimilar to NEAT.\n\ne.g. he had &quot;substances&quot; and &quot;catalysts&quot; each substance was a string of \nnumbers and each catalyst worked by joining or splitting substances based \non a match between part of the sequence of the substance and a sequence \nstored on the catalyst.\n\nThus, he might have:\n\nS1 + S23 -&gt; S123\n\ncatalyzed by:\n\nJoin1-23\n\n[[leading to PDEs of d[S1]/dT = -[S1].[S23].k.[Join1-23], d[S123]/dT = \n[S1].[S23].k.[Join1-23] etc etc]]\n\nWhich would also catalyze.\n\nS41 + S234 -&gt; S41234 etc\n\n--\n\nHe was trying to evolve processes similar to those seen in developmental \nbiology.  e.g. where an initially homogenous field of cells develops, first \norientations (posterior vs anterior, dorsal vs ventral etc), then layers \n(it&#39;s not a simple as &quot;gut&quot;, &quot;skin&quot;, &quot;between&quot; but a bit like that) and \nfinally organs, limbs etc.\n\nSo I think he started with an square grid of cells.  With a separately \nmeasured concentration of each chemical for each cell, a slow leak of some \nchemicals from cell to cell for intracellular signalling, and some source \nof initial asymmetry, like one slightly random starting concentration; \nconcentration gradients across the grid in X and Y; one cell with a little \nof one chemical in it.\n\nThe system of PDEs can then be evaluated to simulate the evolution of the \nsystem over time.  All sorts of phenomena can be reproduced in such a \nsystem, oscillators, amplification, latches, threshold triggers, ...\n\nI forget exactly what he was evolving for, but the idea that occurred to me \nwas to read out three of the chemicals as colours and then select \nindividuals for resemblance to a target picture.  You could then evolve a \nset of PDE which generated an image.  You can then imagine all sorts of fun \nexperiments, such as varying the grid size, or changing the starting \nconditions from completely asymmetric to periodic.\n\n--\n\nHmm, not sure I have explained that at all well, however...\n\nThe point where this becomes relevant to Mattias&#39; program is that this \nparticular theoretical view of developmental biology works in a world very \nlike an array of pixels (only with more than three colours on each \npoint).  The result from that work, (and from more general CA work) is that \na single expression evaluated on each pixel, however complex, is not enough \nto create really sophisticated structures.  For complex stuff, you need an \niterated function, and for the most configurable behaviour, you need some \ncommunication between adjacent points (so they can do things like &quot;are you \nsky, then I&#39;ll be sky as well&quot;).\n\n\tThat was the sort of thing I was wondering about, and I see no reason why \nit would not work just was well if it used ANN to iterate a cell from T to \nT+1 than if it were using PDEs.\n\n\tIan\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
