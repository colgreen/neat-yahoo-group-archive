I too was humbled by the\npoker aspect when I started trying to reduce the input vector (which is of\ncourse the hard part) to something of even close to a workable size. \nCapturing the state and historical state of the game all in a single\nvector is of course extraordinarily difficult.  However, if someone can\nfigure out how to decompose the game even to a mid-sized input, I&#39;d still\nlike to take a run at it.  The engine I wrote is very fast (as I figured\nthat would be the bottleneck work-wise).  As it turns out, the bottle neck\nis more likely (in my opinion) the computation required for any meaningful\nreduction of the input.  For example, a useful data point is probably the\nprobability any given hand will win at any given point in the game\nassuming homogeneous players and homogeneous strategy.  This can easily be\ncalculated but it is work-intensive.  In fact, prohibitively so depending\non how you do it.  Of course, it is probably possible to approximate it,\nbut I never came up with a model for this.\n\nI think some headway could be made but be prepared to spend a lot of time\ncoming up with a very light, very fast model for the game of poker that\nyou can use to evolve the machine.  Anything else will result in something\nthat never, ever converges.  If you make any progress, let me know.  I&#39;d\nbe happy to work with someone on this!  Also, I posted my engine on the\nNEAT groups but if someone wants it, let me know.  It is a great deal\nfaster than the C# implementations and could probably be even faster.\n\nBest luck,\n\nJeff Haynes\n\n\n"}}
