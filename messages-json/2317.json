A sort of  EP-NEAT fusion, this is basically\n&gt;what I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;was describing a while ago in the discussion about good benchmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt;functions. Does anyone have a good argument for/against this? I\n&gt;suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt;aligning the input/output value ranges of different functions is\n&gt;one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;problem, but that could be solved by with a bit of normalisation\n&gt;I suspect.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is also an idea on my todo-list and will fit very easily into\n&gt;this\n&gt; &gt; framework...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I also think this is a good idea, and on my todo list as well.\n&gt;There is no reason sigmoids should be the only activation function,\n&gt;and the more I have thought about this, the more convinced I have\n&gt;become that it would help, though the question of what those other\n&gt;functions should be is important.  Have you guys look at Mattias\n&gt;Fagerlund&#39;s DelphiNEAT function approximation demo?  I believe he\n&gt;used several non-sigmoid activation functions in that version of\n&gt;NEAT, and as can be seen, it approximates some pretty diverse\n&gt;functions quite well.\n\nI actually made a first stab at this yesterday.\n\nI have 8 types of node:\n\nSigmoid\nNegSigmoid = 1 - Sigmoid\nAnd\nOr\nXor\nNand\nNor\nXNor\n\nwhere the logic functions use inputs &lt; 0.5 as false and &gt; 0.5 as true and \nalways return 0 or 1\n\n         [[there are other ways to do this, e.g. OR(a, b, c) is equivalent \nto MAX(a, b, c) in some ways...]]\n\nMy preliminary results are:\n\nBefore multinode:\n         1,000,000 cycles reaches a score of ~0.9 but then seems pretty \nheavily stalled (this is still without species)\n\nAfter multinode:\n         Improvement seems much faster and reached a score of 0.9 in \n100,000 cycles...\n\nSo far so good...\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
