I didn&#39;t\n&gt;quite understand Ferreira&#39;s explanation on her web site but it looks\n&gt;like it might be straightforward to implement.\n\nIt&#39;s a similar to the multiplexing problem that has been plaguing IEX...\n\nIt&#39;s a question with six inputs:\n\n2 &quot;address lines&quot;\n4 &quot;data lines&quot;\n\nThe problem is, treat the data lines as a 4-element array, treat the \naddress lines as a 2 bit number, output the contents of the data array \nelement indexed by the address lines.  For total clarity, in C, a solution \nwould be:\n\nint Multiplexer6(int addr0, int addr1, int data0, int data1, int data2, int \ndata3) {\n         int index = addr0 + (addr1 &lt;&lt; 1);\n         int data[4];\n\n         data[0] = data0;\n         data[1] = data1;\n         data[2] = data2;\n         data[3] = data3;\n\n         return data[index];\n}\n\n// note that all inputs and the output are constrained to 0 or 1\n\nA similar standard test is the 11 multiplexer, where there are 8 data lines \nand 3 address lines.\n\nI&#39;ve read her paper now.  Her neurones have a step activation function, and \na threshold, they output 0 or 1 and everything is +ve.  This is in line \nwith the standard GP multiplexing test case but it makes the logic simpler \nthan if either the address or data were floats.\n\n&gt;  I also note that she runs\n&gt;a business that uses GEP commercially, so it can&#39;t be all that bad Ian :)\n\nNot &quot;bad&quot; as such, but like all commercial techniques, a bit hyped beyond \nits reality.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
