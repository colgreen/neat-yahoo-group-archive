My view is =\r\nthat the best way is to include a separate CPPN \noutput that determines act=\r\nivation functions in the same CPPN that \ndefines connection weights.  It is=\r\n true that that output is \noverspecified because it returns a value for 4 i=\r\nnputs instead of 2, \nbut you can just make a convention that you only read =\r\nit e.g. when \nthe last two are both (0,0).  Note that this is just an arbit=\r\nrary \nconvention, but it removes the overspecification.  The reason I think=\r\n \nthis approach is better than coevolving is that the mathematical and \ngeo=\r\nmetric reltationships that describe the regularities in the \nconnection wei=\r\nghts end up in the hidden nodes of the CPPN, and these \nvery same relations=\r\nhips are likely relevant to the pattern of \nactivation functions in the sub=\r\nstrate as well.  So if you separate \nout the CPPN that determines activatio=\r\nn functions, then it cannot \ntake advantage of what is known internally fro=\r\nm generating connection \nweights, and vice-versa.\n\nWe have already tried th=\r\nis approach as a way of generating node \nbiases (which is sometimes an impo=\r\nrtant capability) and we have found \nit to work effectively.  That is, the =\r\nnode bias is determined by a \nsecond CPPN output that is read for the node =\r\nat x1 y1 when x2=3D0 and \ny2=3D0.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff C=\r\nlune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Colin-\n&gt; \n&gt; That does make sense. It would =\r\nbe really cool to see how either of \nthose\n&gt; suggestions works. Even cooler=\r\n would be a comparison of the two. My \nguess is\n&gt; that the separate, co-evo=\r\nlved strategy would work better because it \nwould be\n&gt; less constrained. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Do you have any test problems in mind?

Ken=\r\n and others, another way of looking at \nit is that\n&gt; &gt; the CPPN as well as =\r\noutputting connection strength between two \nnodes, also\n&gt; &gt; outputs a value=\r\n which tells us what activation function to use \n(although\n&gt; &gt; each connect=\r\nion has two end points of course). A better way to do \nthis might\n&gt; &gt; be to=\r\n have an entirely separate co-evolved genome that describes \na network\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat accepts a single substrate coordinate and outputs parameters \nfor a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; parameterised activation function.
