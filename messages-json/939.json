I noticed a few minor things \n&gt;though:\n&gt;\n&gt;-I don&#39;t think the default value for connectness of the initial \n&gt;genome should be 0.2.  The default should be 1 and people should be \n&gt;able to adjust it down from there.  I think most users would not \n&gt;know what the 0.2 is and not understand what affect it&#39;s having.\n&gt;\n&gt;-I find I can&#39;t delete a network in the species visualization as it \n&gt;says I can.  The only species that I can get to disappear are dead \n&gt;ones, and not by clicking on them.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Something went wrong with file loading in the pole balacing and \n&gt;prey capture simulators.  It seems you changed something about your \n&gt;file structure but didn&#39;t make the corresponding change in their \n&gt;loaders.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s getting quite impressive.  Congratulations on really nice work!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHi Ken,\n\nThanks for the feedback and words of encouragement :)\n\nI&#39;ll get right onto the problems/suggestions.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
