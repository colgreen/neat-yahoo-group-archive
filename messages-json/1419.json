E.g. if the outputs are labeled A thru G\n&gt; \n&gt;     A\n&gt;   -----\n&gt;   |   |\n&gt; B |   | C\n&gt;   | D |\n&gt;    ---\n&gt;   |   |\n&gt; E |   | F\n&gt;   |   |\n&gt;   -----\n&gt;     G\n&gt; \n&gt; The binary input samples 0010 (deimal 2) and 1100 (decimal 12) \nshould \n&gt; both &quot;turn on&quot; the outputs ACDEG which represents a decimal digital \n&gt; display &quot;2&quot;. I.e. the outputs represented as binary should be: \n1011101\n&gt; \n&gt; Results:\n&gt; So far all experiments on the full set of outputs have failed.  It \n&gt; always reaches a local optimum and gets stuck for more than 3000 \n&gt; generations.  This, in spite of some amazingly complex evolved nets\n&gt; \n&gt; When I run NEAT on a single output at a time (change the topology \nto \n&gt; produce a single output, representing only one of the LED&#39;s instead \n&gt; of all 7), occasionally after hundreds of generations it will find \na \n&gt; solution.  Interestingly, some of the single LED attempts converge \n&gt; more quickly averaged over repeated runs, while others (like &quot;D&quot;) \n&gt; take much longer.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve tryed all different kinds of combinations of the NEAT \n&gt; parameters, and even tried a different activation function \n&gt; (hyperbolic tangent instead of sigmoid) with similar dismal results \n&gt; on the full set of outputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Karl\n\n\n"}}
