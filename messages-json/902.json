I was saying that if you do \n&gt; two phases, only-complexifying followed by only-simplifying, that&#39;s \n&gt; going to be less efficient than using both dynamics in the first \n&gt; place.\n\nAre you saying that you have a delete mutation?\n\nFor me, I think that a mixed method (simulataneous add and remove) \nsounds more intuitive. Followed by a pure delete run once a satisfying \nanswer has been found - in case you intend to use that answer away from \nthe evolution run or if you&#39;re looking for minimal solutions.\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
