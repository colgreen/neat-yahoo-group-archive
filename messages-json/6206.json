Importantly, the offspring of these compiled\nCPPNs show meaningful variations because they directly embody important\ndomain-specific regularities like symmetry or repetition. The CPPN-Compiler\ntries to solve a similar problem than Clune in his paper on the seeded-CPPN\ntechnique. However, the CPPN-Compiler does not require an external scaffold\nthat evolution can elaborate on and the resulting phenotypic regularities\nare directly embodied in the CPPN.\n\nIn the future it will be interesting to extend this concept to the wide\nvariety of CPPN-enabled domains. For example, a CPPN-Compiler could also\nautomatically generate seeds for ANNs created by HyperNEAT. Such a neural\nCPPN-Compiler could automatically construct CPPNs that produce structural\norganization we see in natural brains (e.g. the organization of the\ncortical columns), potentially allowing higher cognitive tasks to be solved.\n\nWe are also working on an interactive webpage, where you will be able to\nspecify shapes by hand and then start interactive evolution from the\ncompiled seed. I will make another announcement once it is usable.\n\nI hope you enjoy the paper and am looking forward to your thoughts.\n\nBest,\nSebastian\n\n\n--\nDr. Sebastian Risi\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen, Room 5D08\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark\nemail: sebastian.risi@..., web: http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/\nmobile: +45-50250355, office: +45-7218-5127\n\r\n--089e013a215af5710404e9422f7f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hello all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m happy to announce my new AAAI sy=\r\nmposium paper on a compiler for CPPNs that allows to automatically transfor=\r\nm phenotypic descriptions Into genotypic representations:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PDF: &lt;a hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/risi_aaai2013.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.cs.ucf.edu/=\r\n~risi/risi_aaai2013.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;In this paper, the CPPN-Compiler is abl=\r\ne to generate CPPN-encoded representations from vector-based images that ca=\r\nn serve as the starting point for further evolution.
