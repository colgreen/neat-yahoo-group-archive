We can isolate \ndifferent parts of the wave as different (temporal) regions (e.g. in the \ndiagram I cut it into &quot;high&quot;, &quot;falling&quot;, &quot;low&quot; and &quot;rising&quot; sections) and \nthen if we fed the system a different part of the input data during each \nphase, we can have four different &quot;concepts&quot; present in one network...\n\nOn a short time scale, the four sets of data are present in the network at \ndifferent times, but viewed over a longer time-frame (one or more whole \ncycles) they are all present at the same time, just in different phases.\n\nThus we have a mechanism for bringing multiple data sets into a single \nnetwork without having to provide a multiplexer between the data-store and \nthe processing network.  Instead, all we need is four &quot;trigger lines&quot;, each \ngoing high during a different phase of the cycle.  And an instruction to \neach data store telling it which of those lines means to send its \ncontents.  The output from the stores can then all be mixed into a single \nchannel, as only one store will ever be transmitting at a time.\n\nComparisons between different concepts can be achieved simply by having \nsome delays in the net, so that data from a previous phase is still around \nwhen a later one arrives.\n\nPrioritizing different concepts can be achieved by giving the different \nphases different priorities and switching the concepts between them based \non processing in the net.\n\nA search can be performed by keeping the current best concept in one phase \nand iterating other concepts through the other phases...\n\nJust some beer-mat theorising...\n\n         Ian\n\n((The word &quot;concept&quot; used metaphorically throughout this document.))\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
