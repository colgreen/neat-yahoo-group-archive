Can I setup SharpNeat to only ev=\r\nolve the topology of a \nnetwork,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and determine the weights with tradi=\r\ntional back prop ANN \ntraining?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why would you necessarily want to=\r\n do that?\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to be able to seperate the weight evolution, because =\r\none of \n&gt; experiments I want to try is numeric prediction, and from reading=\r\n \n&gt; around the internet, it seems that solving this type of problem it \nis =\r\n\n&gt; best to find the weights based on one set of training data, but \n&gt; valid=\r\nate the network on an second set of data.  There may be other \n&gt; ways to do=\r\n this with NEAT, while still allowing NEAT to evolve the \n&gt; weights, but I =\r\ndon&#39;t know enough about the algorithms yet - I have \nto \n&gt; play with it / r=\r\nead for a while.\n&gt; \n\nMike, you can do that with NEAT alone.  What you do is=\r\n evaluate each \ngeneration on the training set and test the champion of eac=\r\nh \ngeneration on the validation set.  When the validation scores start \ngoi=\r\nng down, you stop evolution.\n\nThat said, it is still viable to combine NEAT=\r\n with backprop as well, \nas some people have done, but it is not necessary.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n&gt; Thanks Again!\n&gt; Mike \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 7/3/06, rognorak &lt;rognorak@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Hello All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I stumbled onto NEAT a short time=\r\n ago, and I think its an \namazing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of work - I&#39;m not an expert o=\r\nn ANN&#39;s / Genetic \nAlgorithms by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any means, but decided to play aroun=\r\nd with NEAT because I have \n&gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been fascinated by the subjects.=\r\n I have a few questions that \nmight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help me get started.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n1.
