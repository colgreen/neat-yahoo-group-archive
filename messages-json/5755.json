In bacteria the DNA is replicated serially and the reproduction time is=\r\n proportional to DNA length. Eukaryotes on the other hand, have a parallel =\r\nDNA replication mechanism and reproduction time is independent of DNA lengt=\r\nh. This produced wildly different results in DNA content. Most bacteria hav=\r\ne very lean genomes. In eukaryotes on other hand, most of the DNA holds var=\r\nious forms of junk. A striking example of this is an amoeba having 200 time=\r\ns the DNA length of a human. Eukaryotes, of course, got way more sophistica=\r\nted than bacteria. There are too many other variables here however for us t=\r\no put it down to the lack of complexity penalty.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
