It&#39;s \ninteresting to note that you found a solution by evolving weights only. \nSearching a fixed topology can be seen as focusing in on one small area \nof the much larger NEAT search space (which of course includes \ntopology). By doing this you can expect to find a solution far quicker \nif you happen to have selected a good topology. OK, stating the obvious \nalert here perhaps.\n\nThinking back to my own prey capture experiments - which BTW span 5 \nyears and the development of 3 seperate neuro-evolutuion engines! -  I \nfound that the jump to finding a topology with recurrent connections \nthat could form the basis of redamentary memory was a significant &#39;step&#39; \nfor all of the neuro-evolution algorithms to overcome. With SharpNEAT I \nhave spent a lot of time optimising the experiments and core code so \nthat I can crank over as many generations per sec as possible, IMO this \nis necessary to solve reasonably complex tasks in a reasonable time. For \ninstance, my prey capture experiment typically runs at several hundred \nevaluations per second (with 100 simulations per evaluation)and \ntherefore searches can run into hundreds of thousands, even millions of \ngenerations. My own belief is that this large number of generations is \nnecessary to trawl a multi-dimensional search space effectively.\n\nNow, you may also be seeing this &#39;step&#39; when trying to evolve topology, \nespecially since you have a large number of inputs into your cat. You \nmight want to think about reducing the inputs to an absolute minimum, \nsay the first 8 (wall and mouse proximity only), and to start NEAT off \nwith a very minimal topology, or one that is close to what you have \nfound to work, but that is sort of cheating I guess :)\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\ngerbopel wrote:\n\n&gt;Okay, here&#39;s an update:\n&gt;\n&gt;So I ran the experiment last night (scenario D) with a population of\n&gt;256 fully connected recurrent networks (example pictured below). \n&gt;Weight perturb was max of 3.0, 80% of offspring were mutated. \n&gt;Sterilization took place after N=30 generations.  No complexification\n&gt;or simplification was performed.  White/cyan are forward links\n&gt;(exhitory/inhibitory respectively), yellow/purple are recurrent links.\n&gt; Yellow nodes are recurrent hidden and purple nodes are recurrent output.\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatBrain.jpg\n&gt;\n&gt;My fitness calculations were off before but even with the correct\n&gt;values my previous attempts were not close.  Perfect fitness is 2041.\n&gt; So, the fully recurrent network that did not evolve the topology,\n&gt;just the weights, was successful after about 800 generations.  Here is\n&gt;the log:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatAndMouseLog2.txt\n&gt;\n&gt;A second run was done and reached fitness 2040 by generation 971,\n&gt;although it never got perfect.  Here is that log:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatAndMouseLog3.txt\n&gt;\n&gt;So, obviously it _can_ be done in this scenario, it is just that my\n&gt;NEAT implementation can&#39;t seem to handle evolving structure and\n&gt;weights at the same time.\n&gt;\n&gt;Any thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt;I am now testing the hard-coded recurrent networks with the most\n&gt;complex memory scenario that I have.  The previous one (as mentioned\n&gt;in earlier response to Derek) was simplified in that the cat never had\n&gt;to travel far and he was always never presented with an intersection\n&gt;on the way to the mouse (assuming he went the right way).  I am now\n&gt;placing the cat various distances from the mouse (who still always\n&gt;starts in an intersection and can move 4 spaces).\n&gt;\n&gt;Stay tuned for results.  In the mean time I&#39;d love to hear people&#39;s\n&gt;thoughts on the matter.\n&gt;\n&gt;Many thanks,\n&gt;Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
