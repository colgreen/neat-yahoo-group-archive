Entries can be music, images, sculptures, videos, or\nint=\r\neractive online experiences, but are not limited to these forms of\nexpressi=\r\non; the goal is that the submissions exhibit some form of\nindependent creat=\r\nivity through genetic and evolutionary computation.\n\n=3D=3DEntry Submission=\r\n=3D=3D\n\nEntrants must submit: (1) a brief artistic statement illustrating t=\r\nhe\nconcept, (2) a short paper describing the technical details and the\nevol=\r\nutionary algorithm, and (3) a set of multimedia files, either 5\nstill image=\r\ns, a video of up to 5 minutes, or a sound file of up to 5\nminutes, that dem=\r\nonstrates the output quality of the evolutionary\nprocess. All submissions s=\r\nhould be sent to ahoover@... by\nJune 14, 2013.\n\n=3D=3DEvaluation=\r\n=3D=3D\n\nThe submissions will be evaluated by a jury of researchers from the=\r\n\nevolutionary computation and the technological arts communities. Each\nsubm=\r\nission will be judged on the following criteria:\nartistic or design merit, =\r\ninnovation, creativity, technical quality,\nand relevance.\n\n=3D=3DPresentati=\r\non=3D=3D\n\nFinalists selected by the jury will be invited to present their\ns=\r\nubmission at the competition session, held during the GECCO\nconference.
