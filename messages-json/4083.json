It is\ncert=\r\nainly a difficult feature to implement.  The color system is\nsomewhat compl=\r\nicated and the result of a lot of trial and error.  The\nmain principle that=\r\n we followed that probably helped was that we\nwanted to be able to evolve c=\r\nolor directly onto our existing black and\nwhite images.  Hence, color outpu=\r\nts are a function of both the\nexisting black and white output (which we cal=\r\nl &quot;structure&quot;) and of\npositional inputs, which allows colors to diverge fro=\r\nm the pure b&w\nstructure over time.  I believe it is this relationship betw=\r\neen color\nand the underlying existing structure that is producing images th=\r\nat\nlook sensible.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;m=\r\nattias@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you describe how you represent color within pi=\r\ncbreeder?
