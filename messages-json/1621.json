In nature, not all parts of a chromosome exhibit equal \nmutation rates.  Now this is not clean data, because when we look at \nchromosomes we are always seeing them after _some_ degree of selection, but \neven so it is thought that genes can evolve higher or lower mutation \nrates.  There is a technique which uses this for GA (*).  Basically what it \ndoes is that on each &quot;gene&quot; (which are single real values) it stores a \nsecond parameter to control the mutation of the parameter (I think as the \nwidth of the distribution around the current gene value).  Thus the \ngene-values and the individual gene mutabilities co-evolve - genes which \ncannot vary without losing a lot of fitness acquire low mutabilities \nwhereas those which can still vary usefully stay highly mutable.... (ISRT \nthis technique lacks any concept of an &quot;elite&quot; so that every gene is \nsubject to a mutation in every generation).\n\n\tAnyway, one can easily adapt it for NEAT, either as a parameter for \nmutation distribution width, or mutation probability, or both.\n\n\tOne could even look to the connection probabilities, maybe as an evolving \nparameter read from the destination (being the node most affected by \nconnection) or else read from both genes concerned and multiplied together...\n\n\tNode creation would then be, I guess, a probability on each connection, \nmaybe (waves hands vaguely)...\n\n--\n\n\tAs an aside, this also gives us another angle on modularity, since a \nuseful module should have a net mutability which has dropped quite low, and \none might also want to allow a quite different value for the probability of \nintra-module connection formation vs. inter-module connection formation...\n\n\tIan\n\n(*) I think it is &quot;Evolution Strategy&quot; (ES).  I checked here \nhttp://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.de.uu.net/EC/clife/www/top.htm), but \nit&#39;s too heavy for me to (re)comprehend in a short time.\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
