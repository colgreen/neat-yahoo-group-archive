But I still stand by my\n&gt; argument that just because astrology is nonsense doesn&#39;t mean it\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t have actual predictive power - so long as enough people\n&gt; believed in it and applied it. Of course on aggragte they will be\n&gt; playing a zero sum game (no-one wins overall and transaction costs\n&gt; mean the average player loses), and then smarter folks predict once\n&gt; step ahead and then two steps, etc and the system decends back into\n&gt; chaotic noise.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I just disproved my argument(*) :)\n&gt; \n&gt; * - in the long run. This might still work over a given time period,\n&gt; that is, until enough people catch on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n\n"}}
