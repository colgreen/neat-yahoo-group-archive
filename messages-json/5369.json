Basically, take what v=\r\nariables make up a protein and use those as your geometry.  For example, if=\r\n what distinguishes two proteins are their size and number of connections, =\r\nthen those variables become your x and y axes and every protein is a point =\r\nin that space.  If you have more than 3 variables, you can still use HyperN=\r\nEAT to create N-dimensional substrates, although the cost of creating the n=\r\network increases.\n\nJason G.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mridul P &lt;p_mridu=\r\nl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; In my problem, the nodes do not have co-ordi=\r\nnates.

That&#39;s essentially what a CPPN=\r\n does.  \n&gt; So if you tried to train a CPPN to answer correctly for your par=\r\nticular graph, \n&gt; then you&#39;d be getting a CPPN encoding of that graph.  The=\r\n part I am a little \n&gt; fuzzy about is how that would help with a different =\r\nsuch graph.  To the extent \n&gt; the two graphs overlap, it would work, but if=\r\n they don&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure how \n&gt; learning from the first graph would genera=\r\nlize to the second.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mridul P &lt;p_=\r\nmridul@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The testing data is related to the=\r\n same graph.

Is it from a different graph or the same graph? \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe reason I ask is that it probably matters whether the nodes will be the =\r\nsame \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; nodes (i.e. because they are from the same graph) or nodes fr=\r\nom an entirely \n&gt; &gt; different graph.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In general, it does sound lik=\r\ne you could create an array of 9000 inputs and \n&gt; &gt; highlight the ones that=\r\n you are asking about.  The main question for HyperNEAT \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; is whether =\r\nthose 9000 inputs can be situated in a meaningful geometry?  For \n&gt; &gt; examp=\r\nle, is it naturally 300x300?  Or maybe something else?  If there is a \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ngeometry to them, and if there are regularities in their connectivity, then=\r\n in \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; principle HyperNEAT might be a good choice for learning that pa=\r\nttern.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, note that with 9000 inputs, there will generally be a=\r\n computational cost \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; to activating the network.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p_mridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am working on a bioinformatics problem, but it&#39;s easier to=\r\n talk about it in \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;graph theory terms....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a gr=\r\naph with a large number of nodes (~9000), and about 3000 edges \n&gt; &gt; &gt;betwee=\r\nn the nodes...
