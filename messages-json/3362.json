Besides=\r\n, I used FS-NEAT and \nonly \n&gt; 4 outputs for the legs. Very simple. :)\n&gt; Wit=\r\nh this approach, NEAT was able to find NNs that have just about \n5-\n&gt; 6 con=\r\nnections, oscillating the 4 outputs and moving the legs. It \nwas \n&gt; walking=\r\n (running forward in fact) and I was very very happy :) \n&gt; My problems star=\r\nted when I added the head, the arms and the feet. \n&gt; From 4 outputs they be=\r\ncame 15. This enlarged the search space a \nlot, \n&gt; and the FS-NEAT approach=\r\n usually connected.. like your left feet \n&gt; connected to your neck and I wa=\r\nnt you to walk - it doesn&#39;t work :) \n&gt; Using a fully connected CTRNN is lik=\r\ne a fixed-genome evolution so I \n&gt; dropped that as well. \n&gt; I decided to us=\r\ne HyperNEAT and give it a substrate that is close to \n&gt; the human&#39;s actual =\r\ngeometry in space. Left is left, right is right, \n&gt; up and down... \n&gt; The i=\r\nnputs are located in the center and are a 3D vector, \n&gt; representing the he=\r\nad&#39;s current velocity. It&#39;s like the.. organ \nfound \n&gt; in the middle ear (c=\r\nan&#39;t recall how to express that in english :)) \n&gt; The hidden neurons are or=\r\nganised in a circle around these inputs. \n&gt; The outputs have green color an=\r\nd: the topmost is the neck&#39;s joint \n&gt; desired angle. The arms are located b=\r\nelow it in the left and right \n&gt; sides of the substrate. Each arm has 3 out=\r\nputs. The legs are \n&gt; organised in a similar manner, and each leg has 4 out=\r\nputs. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;ksta=\r\nnley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe the challenge in this domai=\r\nn is indeed the fitness \n&gt; function \n&gt; &gt; as opposed to the learning method.=\r\n  The problem is that it is \nvery \n&gt; &gt; difficult to describe exactly what s=\r\nhould be rewarded early on.  \n&gt; &gt; Rewarding # of steps tends to encourage a=\r\n single flailing step \nyet \n&gt; &gt; misses better oscillatory behavior.  Even i=\r\nf an individual does \n&gt; learn \n&gt; &gt; a leg-based oscillation, it will likely =\r\nfall and therefore never \nbe \n&gt; &gt; noticed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Tyler Streeter was=\r\n working on this problem in his Verve \n&gt; project \n&gt; &gt; (http://www.vrac.iast=\r\nate.edu/~streeter/verve/gallery.html), which \n&gt; &gt; used NEAT with leaky-inte=\r\ngrator neurons, I discussed this problem \n&gt; &gt; with him often.  I believe he=\r\n ended up finding a clever way to \n&gt; reward \n&gt; &gt; oscillatory behavior.  Tha=\r\nt is the most important thing, since \nit&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; really the key to walking: =\r\nit&#39;s necessary for the circuit to \n&gt; produce \n&gt; &gt; an oscillating pattern.  =\r\nI may be remembering wrong, but I think \nhe \n&gt; &gt; may have started getting i=\r\nt to work by hanging the biped from an \n&gt; &gt; invisible &quot;string&quot; from the cei=\r\nling, so that it could not fall, \nand \n&gt; &gt; simply training it to oscillate =\r\nits legs.  Have you tried \n&gt; discussing \n&gt; &gt; it with Tyler?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the=\r\n way, can you please remind me what the inputs and outputs \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; on y=\r\nour substrate?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_ch=\r\nervenski&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The fitness function used in the binary is Average_Head_Height \n* \n&gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\number_of_FootSteps_Taken.

I know it is \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\naybe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong to assign 0.000 fitness, but I usually hope that in early=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; generations at least some individuals will get a score above \n&gt; zer=\r\no, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and therefore survive. Is this a right thing to do or I should \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; translate all fitnesses above 0.000 ? Like Total_Fitness +=3D \n&gt; 1.0; =\r\n? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Number_of_FootSteps_Taken is actually an integer and it \nmakes=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness landscape look like stairs...

A way to \n&gt; prevent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this is may be to=\r\n choose random initial positions for the \nmodel.. \n&gt; &gt; Or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground=\r\n plane can be made moving randomly.. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, it seems that the fitne=\r\nss function is wrong, since this \n&gt; way \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of achieving the goal is too=\r\n easy for the evolution to find.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently trying out how=\r\n good are they to walk.
