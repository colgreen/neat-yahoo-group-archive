What do you mean by &quot;leaves some\n&gt;conventions unspecified?&quot;  As long as you know the node(s) being\n&gt;connected and keep track of them as NEAT normally does anyway, why\n&gt;is this issue specific to recurrent connections?  Or maybe I just\n&gt;don&#39;t know what&#39;s meant by an &quot;unspecified convention?&quot;  I think\n&gt;maybe what you&#39;re saying is that what is considered recurrent in\n&gt;some individuals may not deserve that designation in others, but I&#39;m\n&gt;not certain.\n\nThis is where we have a situation like:\n\nA -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;D\nA-&gt; B&#39; -&gt;C&#39; -&gt;D\n\nIf individual-1 connects C to B&#39;  and individual-2 connects C&#39; to B, \nthat what has happened is that the ancestor was ambiguous on this \npoint (of the relative order of some pairs of nodes) and the \nindividuals 1 and 2 have established conventions for those orders, \nbut not in a manner that is compatible with one-another....\n\nThe other class of approach defines all these orders from the start, \nbut therefor cannot do one of those two connections, even though they \nare non-recurrent.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
