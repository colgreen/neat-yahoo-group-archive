This is not really an argument\n&gt; with anything you said, but mainly a commentary on the meaning of &quot;objective&quot; that I\n&gt; think draws a useful distinction.\n\nI&#39;m not sure I agree with the spirit of your argument but it&#39;s just a\ngut feeling at this point so I&#39;ll have a go at clarifying my thoughts\na bit further and maybe I can home in a bit more on where I&#39;m\ndisagreeing (if at all).\n\nBy &#39;survive&#39; I mean - execute some strategy that results in survival.\nSo find food and shelter, avoid danger, etc. Good survival strategy\nfor the domain =&gt; good chance of surviving, bad strategy =&gt; lower\nchance.\n\nIn an EA that survival *strategy* is &#39;do well on the fitness metric&#39;\n(aka objective) - because the only way to survive is to get selected\nby the EA&#39;s selection criteria. So I think we can clarify the argument\nby drawing a distinction between surviving/reproducing and\n/strategies/ that lead to surviving and reproducing. I think perhaps\nwe (or I) have conflated the two. Survive/reproduce is the high level\n[implicit] objective that is always present, and survival /strategy/\nis what we normally refer to as objective or goal in EC.\n\nSo far there&#39;s no distinction between nature/biology and EC. To my\nmind nature has found complex /strategies/ for survival because:\n\nA) Vastly more computational resource (or equivalent) [per unit time].\nB) Vastly more time.\nC) Vastly more complex domain.\n\nIt&#39;s this latter point that I feel has tended to be overlooked. If you\nconsider every living thing alive today and trace back through all of\ntheir ancestors, then every single one of those zillions of organisms\nexecuted a successful strategy that lead to survival. Considerably\nmore organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural\nworld does try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one\ngeneration at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\nthose poor strategies in the hope of finding something better. What\ndoes happen though is that stragies are so complex (for creatures with\nlarge brains anyway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find\nfood) and yet waste much time on poor sub-strategies (effectively\nstragey efficiency). Evolution will select for efficiency but unlike\nsurvival it&#39;s not a binary yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so\nmore like the small low scoring species in NEAT (from fitness\nsharing).\n\nIt&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies that fit your idea of\nsearching with no objective, they piggy back on for the ride and very\noccasionally become useful. Where EC tends to fall short IMO is that\nthe domain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so\nthere&#39;s less opportunty for exploring variations in strategy -\nbranching off into multiple successful branches and sub-branches\nwithout a major loss in fitness on the objective. Put another way, the\nnatural world&#39;s fitness landscape is dominated by smooth undulations\nin all dimensions, whereas EC objectives tend to have a few\nsharp/steep local maxima.\n\nNature also provides a gentle selection pressure towards complex\nstrategies by providing resources that require increasingly complex\nstrategies to reach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evolve\nlegs ang lungs. And you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without evolving\ngood eyes and fast/strong muscles, etc. but the plants and meat were\nthere as an untapped resource until that first legged creature and\nfirst carnivore came along. So we can see now that framing the\nsurvival as being an objective that&#39;s been achieved on day one misses\na lot of the key dynamics that drive evolution. Surviving is the high\nlevel implicit objective, some species have not moved on from floating\nin the sea eatign CO2 and sunlight, but other strategies were evolved\nto tap into new previously untapped resources - and that climb from\nsimple to complex resources utilisation continues to this day.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
