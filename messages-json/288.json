Could \n&gt; anyone suggest some inputs/outputs that would suit\n&gt; NEAT better, but \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t violate the Artificial Ant premise?\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking about modeling the ant mentioned by\nMatt Buckland in his book. (a real ant)  This ant\nlives on a Euclidean plane, not a digital array.  It\nleave the origin traveling in a straight line of\nrandom orientation.  After a random time it changes to\na new straight line direction.  It does this until it\nhits a piece of food.  Then, it does the equivalent of\na vector summation, because it heads in a straight\nline directly back to the origin!\n\nNow the angles and distances are not necessarily\nrandom, they are chosen by the ant.  Also, the vector\nsummation could be accomplished by adding each new\nvector to the running total of the previous ones.\n\nAn ANN could be evolved that walked in a good search\npattern that kept it fairly close to the nest, like\nsome kind of spiral.  You would reward it for finding\nfood an penalize it for time or distance searching.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
