Every little bit helps.  Heck, last night I took my old laptop with \na dead hard drive and booted it with a knoppix CD and turned it into a \nclient!\n\nThere is now a new client script, though.  The new script supports \ncompression of the data, so I can save a bunch on my internet bandwidth.  \nAll those downloads were slowing my internet connection to a crawl.\n\nThe new script is a shell script (rather than perl), and in addition to \ncompression, it includes an auto-update feature.  If I change the script on \nthe server, all clients will be running the new version as soon as they \nfinish the sample they are working on.  It also supports running multiple \ncopies in the same directory, for multi-processor boxes or machines with an \nabundance of horsepower.\n\nThe url for the new client script is\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/iex_client.sh\n\nThe first time you run it, it creates a config.sh file.  Customized settings \nare stored there so that when the script is updated, the customizations are \nnot lost.  Once you have customized the config file, run the script again \nand it will start working.\n\nPlease, please update to the latest client so I can get my internet speed \nback! :)\n\n&gt;Anyway I got it running your experiment with no problems.\n\nGood.\n\n&gt;Should I just leave it running for a while?\n\nAs long as you can spare...once you update the script. :)\n\n&gt;It&#39;s not going to cause a problem if you decide to restart the experiment \n&gt;is it?\n\nNope, not at all.  It doesn&#39;t care what state the experiment is in, it just \ndownloads source files, compiles them, executes them, and then sends the \nresults back.  It could care less if we are on generation 1 or generation 1 \nmillion.\n\nIn fact, I could make a minor modification to it that lets you configure the \nURL for fetching work packets and for where you return the results, and the \nclient would then be a totally generic distributed NEAT client.\n\n\n\n"}}
