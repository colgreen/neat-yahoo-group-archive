If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square left\n&gt; 2. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square up\n&gt; 3. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square right\n&gt; 4. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square down\n\nSo if two or more were &gt;.5, you took the highest?\n\n&gt; No, as the point was to see whether the network\n&gt; could evolve to solve this\n&gt; problem at all, and what strategies it would use to\n&gt; nagivate over the shape\n&gt; from its random starting position.\n\nDid the networks tend to converge to a particular\nmovement pattern (like spiraling clockwise or\ncounterclockwise)?\n\n&gt; Well, memory between timesteps was a required\n&gt; feature of this problem.\n&gt; Obviously, if the network couldn&#39;t remember anything\n&gt; about what it had seen\n&gt; before, it was unlikely to do very well. NEAT, as\n&gt; you know, detects\n&gt; recurrence - neurons connected back to themselves -\n&gt; and this is usually the\n&gt; way memory seems to evolve, as the same information\n&gt; will get looped back\n&gt; time after time. However, my experiments also showed\n&gt; long chains of neurons,\n&gt; which weren&#39;t part of loops, which seemed to be\n&gt; performing a similar\n&gt; function of keeping information in the network for a\n&gt; future time step. Now,\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t have thought this was necessarily\n&gt; unusual, but Ken picked up on\n&gt; it.\n\nThat&#39;s interesting.  Have you published these results\nsomewhere?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
