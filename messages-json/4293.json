The identity of cells in developmental\nprocesses is determined by local contextual information whereas Ken\nadvocates skipping that by letting cells determine their identity via giving\nthem their objective coordinates. The question is whether we lose anything\nimportant to the evolution of complexity by skipping this step.\n\nI think it is a fascinating question and, unable to come up with a good\nreason why development matters myself, but wanting to give the argument a\nrigorous evaluation, I have been asking many people in our field whether\nthey can describe something unique that a developmental process provides. No\none has come up with  a reason that compels me, so I have become a strong\nadvocate of the lack of a need for an unfolding process.\n\nHowever, in the course of watching a keynote on development in natural\nsystems at this year&#39;s gecco, an argument in favor of development occurred\nto me that may have merit. I am interested to hear what y&#39;all think of it.\n\nThe argument is this: it might be easier to evolve certain large-scale\nproperties when the organism is simple and small and then scale/grow them\nup, rather than incorporating them into an already complex phenotype. I\nthink an example illustrates the point best. Imagine evolution figuring out\nhow to put a coat of skin on an organism. It is not that hard to figure out\nwhat the shape of that skin should be when the embryo has only a few cells.\nOnce that simple and small coat of skin has formed, it can follow the simple\nrule of keeping the layer of skin the same thickness, and adding cells\nwithin that layer to grow to cover any arbitrary shape that the phenotype\nbecomes. This simple rule could produce a skin shell for a bat or a jaguar.\nNow consider how hard it would be for 3D hyperneat to create a skin shell\nfor a bat or a jaguar. The mathematical function to create such outlines is\nvery complex (although it is less so if it is a composition of other,\nalready created functions that produced the rest of the body). Still, it\nseems that this task might be harder for hyperneat than following the simple\ndevelopmental rules outlined above.\n\nWhat do you think? I would happily be convinced that this argument is\nwithout merit, so please let me know if you see any problems with it.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
