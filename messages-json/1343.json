Mattias&#39; experiments with function regression show \nthis: He allowed NEAT to use some non-sigmoid activation functions \nthat obviously helped it approximate various curves.  Of course the \ntrade-off is the increased number of parameters being searched.  But \non balance it seems to help, so I think further experimentation in \nthis area is warranted.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve been experimenting with the cross product domain and I think \nmy \n&gt; findings might be of interest to some of you who may not have been \n&gt; following the discussion...\n&gt; \n&gt; A 3D vector cross product can be calculated very simply with the \nformula \n&gt; Chad provided:\n&gt; \n&gt; To calculate the cross product of vectors a and b\n&gt; \n&gt; x = a1*b3 - a3*b2\n&gt; y = a3*b1 - a1*b3\n&gt; z = a1*b2 - a2*b1\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a simple formula that only contains subtraction and \nmultiplication, \n&gt; but it seems to be quite difficult to find a network to represent \nthis \n&gt; forumla. Neural nets of the knid we use are good at adding(and \ntherfore \n&gt; subtracting) because each neuron adds it&#39;s inputs, but what about \n&gt; multiplication?\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried a simple multiplication experiment and discovered that \nalthough \n&gt; networks can be found, that they are not trivial. Typically they \nwill \n&gt; have at least 4 hidden nodes to get the basic functionality and \nmore \n&gt; nodes are required for extra accuracy. Now consider that for a \nnetwork \n&gt; to calculate a cross product it must independently discover six \n&gt; multiplication sub-networks, connected up so that their result is \n&gt; combined appropriately. Hopefully this gives some idea of why the \ncross \n&gt; product domain is a non-trivial one.\n&gt; \n&gt; A quick google came up with this paper which investigates neurons \nthat \n&gt; multiply their inputs instead of adding them:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://gs37.sp.cs.cmu.edu/papers/files/mult-NN-complexity2.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; I havent read it yet but I tried out the concept and sure enough I \ncan \n&gt; find a network that performs multiplication just by connecting the \ntwo \n&gt; input (operand) neurons directly to the output, all the NEAT \nsearch \n&gt; needs to do is find the appropriate two weights. Some accuracy is \nlost \n&gt; because the answer passes through the sigmoid function, but it&#39;s \nabout \n&gt; as accurate as the networks found using adding neurons.\n&gt; \n&gt; I then tried the cross product domain again, this time with the \n&gt; multiplying neurons and a manually created seed genome with all \nthe \n&gt; connections required to perform cross product. The result was \nfailure, \n&gt; presumably because although the multiplication part is now being \n&gt; performed by the network, the additive (or subtraction) part of \nthe \n&gt; formula is now more difficult to achieve with multiplying neurons. \ndoh! \n&gt; So perhaps it would be an idea to mix adding and multiplying \nneurons? So \n&gt; now I&#39;m wondering what other domains might benefit from the \ninclusion of \n&gt; multiplying neurons into our various NEAT implementations? For \nstarters \n&gt; John&#39;s image enlargment might benefit, as might Derek and Philips \nroving \n&gt; eye (with a zoom factor).\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n"}}
