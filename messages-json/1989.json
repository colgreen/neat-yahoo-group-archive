OTOH, if it compiles it is probably not \nbroken, right? (!! YMMV)\n\nWARNING: This mod supports neither SWIG/GUILE nor GTKMM/VISUAL.\nIn fact, I hacked around them rather blindly.\n\nThe first file is kstanleyGCC34diff.txt, being a patch diff for the \nsource. (Windows users can probably read it well enough to see what is \ngoing on.) The main issues were &quot;using namespace std;&quot; and non-suffixed \nheader files. Strstream disappeared, but the StringStream replacement \nis almost drop-in. Tried to eliminate unused and uninitialized variable \nwarnings. Missing return values fixed, because they can be real \nproblems. (Unless they were all guile-support?)\n\nThe second file is a replacement Makefile, which you are at liberty to \nignore if you please. It alleges support for GUILE and GTKMM, but that \nhas not been tested whatsoever. For the Windows platform, I recommend \nMSYS/MinGW or CYGWIN.\n\nLet me know if you have problems, but do be aware that I have barely \ntested it at all.\n\nIs this kind of stuff worth posting here, or should there be a \nSourceforge repository?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
