For example, if\n&gt; there were a node with two incoming connections and\n&gt; one out going connections, it could be mutated and\n&gt; replaced with a subnet with two incoming connections\n&gt; and one outgoing connections.  Subnets could be kept\n&gt; in pools, just as in your implementation of modular\n&gt; NEAT, starting simply, with standard NEAT mutation\n&gt; operators acting on them each generation.\n\nDefinately an indirect encoding scheme would be better suited for this.\n\nI thought about a system like you are proposing. The problem for me was\nthat I still couldn&#39;t find a good way to preserve the idea of &quot;incremental\ncomplexification.&quot; For example, what is the first complexification you\nmake on an existing neuron? You want to make the network slightly more\ncomplex topologically, but how do you do that acting on a single neuron?\nNEAT doesn&#39;t really work on the level of neurons like SANE, IIRC it works\nmore on the level of connections (split a connection, add a connection,\netc).  So I chose that as my basis for mutations, to remain closer to how\nNEAT functions.\n\n&gt; I was thinking that replacing a single node might\n&gt; reduce the impact of such a significant structural\n&gt; mutation, and it would allow such a mutation to occur\n&gt; on any node in the network.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this sound plausible?\n\nIts still very plausible though. If I had had more time (or was pursuing\na graduate degree instead of undergradute) I definately would have spent\nsome time looking at this.\n\nUltimately though, I think Ken may be right, and developmental systems may\nbe the best way to go.\n\n&gt; Yeah...I remember thinking while I read your paper,\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s arguing that this could be a powerful method for\n&gt; large-scale domains, but he&#39;s testing it on very small\n&gt; ones!&quot; :)  I was wondering how it would perform with\n&gt; high input/output domains, and I&#39;m curious to read\n&gt; your future stuff, as well as experiment with some of\n&gt; these concepts myself.\n\nRight. That first paper definately wasn&#39;t anything I want to publish. It\nwas more like a &quot;proof of concept.&quot; The idea works (more or less) so this\nsemester I&#39;m going to be testing it on much larger domains.\n\nI&#39;ll keep you posted.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
