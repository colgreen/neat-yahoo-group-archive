The winbin package contains a=\r\nn executable for windows, cross compiled on linux. The other package is the=\r\n complete source.\n\nBelow is some info about eco from README.\n\n/Magnus\n\n\nThe=\r\nre are four separate populations that are learning how to fly in a world wi=\r\nth gravity. The goal has been too teach them to follow the blue light sourc=\r\ne in the middle of the screen (press &#39;m&#39; to auto move light source, right m=\r\nouse button to move it), but that goal is yet to be accomplished. The units=\r\n awareness of the light source has been turned off since it is not yet work=\r\ning.\n\nEach unit have 6 rays measuring the distances to the walls, press &#39;r&#39;=\r\n too see the rays of the current champion. They also know their orientation=\r\n in the world. _eval_unit() in eco.c contains the fitness calculations and =\r\ninput/output stuff. They have two outputs: thrust & turn angle. Each tick t=\r\nhey can turn maximum, +-8 degrees, and add maximum 0.03 to their current mo=\r\nve speed. The red flame (zoom with &#39;+&#39;&#39;-&#39;, or scrollwheel on linux) is the =\r\ncurrent thrust that tick, press &#39;p&#39; to pause and &#39;space&#39; to step while paus=\r\ning. Press &#39;f&#39; after zooming to return to original view.\n\nPress &#39;d&#39; to see =\r\nsome debug information in the lower left corner. First is the current numbe=\r\nr of ticks passed. Second value is the number of ticks/second that are eval=\r\nuated, press &#39;w&#39; too speed things up a bit. Next three values are the movin=\r\ng average of number of crashes/tick, calculated for the last 1000, 5000, an=\r\nd 15000 ticks.\n\nRemove world.map before starting to have an empty map. Use =\r\nleft mouse\nbutton + shift to paint walls. Erase walls with right mouse butt=\r\non + shift. Undo last wall with &#39;u&#39; (buggy). Use &#39;s&#39; to save map (world.map=\r\n) and the current genomes (pops.gnm). Remove pops.gnm before starting to cl=\r\near what they have learned.\n\nHack the code and change the definition of _NP=\r\nOPS to 1 (eco.c) to only have one population, to speed things up. Change th=\r\ne definition of _NUNITS to have less units in each population for more spee=\r\nd. Remove pops.gnm before starting if these values are changed.\n\nNote that =\r\nthe activation routine is different from the original implementation of rtN=\r\nEAT. I might in the future implement it in the same way as the original.\n\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G. M.&quot; &lt;cesar.gomes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nic=\r\ne!
