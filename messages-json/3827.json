That is, just because some \nthings change or a=\r\nre updated more than others during learning does \nnot imply that they shoul=\r\nd continue to do so or even that it was a \ngood idea in the first place (be=\r\ncause the problem might be \ndeceptive).  It&#39;s a pretty complicated topic bu=\r\nt I think the \nfundamental issue is that evolutionary computation is effect=\r\nive in \npart because it avoids trying to excplicitly assign credit to the \n=\r\nseparate parts of a solution.  So when we move to trying to extract \nexplic=\r\nit information about what belongs with what, we are somewhat \nundoing this =\r\nimplicit appeal.\n\nNevertheless, the idea that solutions need some kind of m=\r\nodularity \nor at least a pattern behind them makes sense.  It&#39;s just the \na=\r\npproach that is the tricky issue.  Have you taken a look at \nHyperNEAT?  It=\r\n is able to evolve networks with large-scale patterns \nthat can be modular =\r\nto varying degrees.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;christofer_fransson=\r\n&quot; \n&lt;christofer_fransson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; \n&gt; The human brain has =\r\ndifferent areas that solve different kind of\n&gt; problems.
