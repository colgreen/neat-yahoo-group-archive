Before I go, some background information:\nThe NEAT implementation that I&#39;m using is a pretty heavily modified\nversion of M. Buckland&#39;s Win NEAT.  I&#39;ve already successfully\nperformed XOR and several other tests that actually relate to my\nproject (cat and mouse).\n\nThe penalizing _any_ species is what Ken does in his code, so that is\ncertainly a feasible option.  Following him I&#39;ve used generations with\nno improvement as a measure, but I would be skeptical of using average\nfitness as a measure in any task more daunting than XOR.  Personally,\nI find that the average fitness of a species can swing considerably\nfrom generation to generation and does not always go up even when on\nits way to a solution.\n\nSo obviously allowing any species to be sterilized, using my current\ncriteria, is an option as well as is sterilizing the poorest\nperforming species based upon it&#39;s _age_ being over N generations. \nThere is _certainly_ no shortage of options, but I do feel that I&#39;m\nbasically just throwing darts at a board deciding what to try next and\neach &quot;attempt&quot; takes me a day or so to fully test out.\n\nThat&#39;s brutal.\n\nMike\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Bryan Adams &lt;bpadams@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I recently re-implemented NEAT and verified it on the XOR benchmark.  I \n&gt; haven&#39;t re-created the DPNV experiments (I&#39;m doing other things), so \n&gt; take this with a grain of salt ...\n&gt; \n&gt; My code penalizes _any_ species that does not achieve a new high in \n&gt; average fitness after N+5 generations (i.e., not just the bottom 2).  I \n&gt; did not see a performance improvement with &quot;delta coding&quot; \n&gt; (redistributing the population to only the top two species), so I left \n&gt; it out.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Aside: This policy created the opposite of your problem -- the \n&gt; population would sometimes lose the best individual(s) when the \n&gt; highest-performing species would stagnate and be thusly penalized.  I \n&gt; have been experimenting with providing a reward, either immunity from \n&gt; the age penalty or bonus offspring, to either the species with the \n&gt; highest average fitness or the species containing the population \n&gt; superstar (or some combination of those things).  As is sometimes the \n&gt; case with NEAT, none of these methods proved universally superior, so I \n&gt; just parameterized the various options ...]\n&gt; \n&gt; One piece of general advice that I&#39;ll offer is that I find that many \n&gt; aspects of the NEAT algorithm can be application specific; what&#39;s sauce \n&gt; for XOR is not necessarily sauce for your problem.  I&#39;ve been using\nNEAT \n&gt; to create robot controllers, and I&#39;ve made a variety of tweaks and \n&gt; additions to the algorithm/parameters and had some success.  The best \n&gt; advice I can give you is to keep detailed records of your algorithmic \n&gt; changes and parameter values when you run experiments so that you don&#39;t \n&gt; waste a lot of time trying to figure out how you got a given set of\nresults.\n&gt; \n&gt; And go easy on the brick wall with your coconut.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Bryan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; gerbopel wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;On discussing culling species after N generations of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;no improvement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Okay, now I&#39;m thoroughly confused.  After re-reading over the NEAT\n&gt; &gt; material I have and checking K.S.&#39;s source code again, nothing seems\n&gt; &gt; to match up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Specifically the publications state that the lowest performing species\n&gt; &gt; over N generations in age will not be reproduced.  However the code\n&gt; &gt; uses the any species that has not improved in N generations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Additionally, there is written: &quot;In rare cases when the fitness of the\n&gt; &gt; entire population does not improve for more than 20 generations, only\n&gt; &gt; the top two species are allowed to reproduce, refocusing the search\n&gt; &gt; into the most promising spaces&quot;.  That is from &quot;Evolving NN through\n&gt; &gt; Augmenting Topologies&quot;.  In code K.S. simply checks to see if the\n&gt; &gt; whole population hasn&#39;t improved in N+5 generations and then takes\n&gt; &gt; only allows to reproduce the top 2 species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So many different things are being said and being done here, I&#39;m not\n&gt; &gt; sure who to listen to.  At the moment I am not allowing the 2 worst\n&gt; &gt; species to reproduce if they haven&#39;t improved in N generations.  As\n&gt; &gt; well, if the whole population has not improved in N+5 generations then\n&gt; &gt; I only allow the top 2 species to reproduce.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately this is still leading to serious stagnation towards\n&gt; &gt; local minima.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I&#39;m getting to the\n&gt; &gt; point of hitting my head on the brick wall here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
