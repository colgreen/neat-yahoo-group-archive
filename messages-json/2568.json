It might be easier if there was a plain EXE version since I\n&gt;tend to use Remote Connection to my workhorse PC and then\n&gt;logoff/disconnect leaving processes running with no display - and hence\n&gt;no screensaver. Also it has other (low CPU) jobs to do, so keeping the\n&gt;CPU priority low would be nice.\n\nI usually set it to, err, whatever cryptic phrase MS use for a \npriority in stead of a nice simple number that anybody would \nunderstand, err, oh yes, &quot;THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL&quot;, would that \ndo you?  Can windows be in a state where there is no display?  I mean \nit&#39;s not like *nix where there needn&#39;t be a graphical front-end at all...\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m going to do an alternative exe that sits in the system \ntray (because my machine at work has _two_ CPU&#39;s (whooo!) and a \nsingle-thread app can use at most 1 of them, so I was going to stick \nthe exe in the system tray all the time (with an option to \nright-click on it and pause it for if I need both CPUs) and the \nscreen-saver to come in when the machine is completely not-in-use and \nuse the other CPU...\n\nBut you might have to wait a little longer for that, say until after \nthe weekend...\n\n&gt; &gt;       It&#39;s not as fully automatic as Seti@Home, in that you will need to\n&gt; &gt;mail the results back to me (which will typically zip down to \n&gt; about 1/2 a meg).\n&gt;BTW 7-zip (www.7-zip.org) is a nice tool for zipping up files. I&#39;ve seen\n&gt;it compress files to a quarter the size of an equivalent zip at max\n&gt;compression, so it might help alleviate the load on your mailbox.\n\nYes I have that, although I tend to avoid the heavier compression \nmethods for fear of incompatibility, but if we both use 7-zip \nobviously we&#39;ll be OK,\n\nIan\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
