There are some \n&gt; &gt; problems \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nen trying to use CPPNs directly to map onto 2/3D objects \nwith \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fin=\r\nite, though variable (among individuals) size. I am \n&gt; &gt; particularly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n interested in this issue because it also holds the key to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aut=\r\nomatic generation of HyperNEAT substrates as well. And \nperhaps \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may open up new ways to have content generation in games, too. \nAnd \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Artificial Life, of course.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I remember that Ken su=\r\nggested that animal morphologies and \nsuch \n&gt; &gt; things \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may be easi=\r\ner to describe in higher dimensional space and then \n&gt; &gt; mapped \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ba=\r\nck to 2D/3D, just like in HyperNEAT. Day after day I was \ntrying \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; find such a higher-dimensional description of something that \nhas \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; limbs, joints, all with variable numbers and size. Even in the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmost \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simplistic 2D case, I never got even close to such an elegant=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose I want to have a 2D creature =\r\nwith rectangular limbs. \nBut \n&gt; &gt; how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many of them is unknown. How=\r\n they are connected - too. A limb \nis  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represented as position in =\r\n2D and width/height and an angle of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orientation. This makes 5D spa=\r\nce in which I have to query all \n&gt; &gt; possible \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things and ask the C=\r\nPPN if there is a limb or not. Sounds too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expensive, and more, eve=\r\nn if I do that, there are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; algorithmic/implementation issues that a=\r\nre just too hard. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem I had is, actually, that I =\r\nmissed the fact that a \nCPPN \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an infinite mathematical desc=\r\nription of the phenotype. Any use \nof \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN involves approxi=\r\nmating the phenotype with some kind of \nlevel \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detail. The =\r\nCPPN makes no difference if I use it for 16x16 \nvisual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate o=\r\nr 65536x65536, for example (note: I mean not in \n&gt; &gt; phenotype \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eva=\r\nluation). So there must be a way to have such level of \ndetail \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sca=\r\nling in animal morphologies as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I went back to th=\r\ne cellular growth approach, looking for \nwhat I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed before. The=\r\n biggest unsolved problem with my previous \n&gt; &gt; system is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that coo=\r\nrdinates may grow to infinite and the activation \nfunctions \n&gt; &gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; actually best suited to work in [-1..1] substrates (given the \nfact \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have fixed CPPN weight range and mutation powers). Plus, the \nC=\r\nPPN \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requeried on each cell on each timestep in the process=\r\n of \n&gt; &gt; development. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Too expensive and as the phenotype gets bigg=\r\ner, development \nslows \n&gt; &gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a rate that is not acceptable.=\r\n And more, it is not clear \nhow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scaling could work if I want to, s=\r\nay, have the same object, \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shape, much bigger, but t=\r\nhe cell size and the coordinate \nframes - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still fixed. Something w=\r\nas terribly wrong with that model. But \nI \n&gt; &gt; think \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have finall=\r\ny found a solution! Or at least something very \nclose \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The CPPN already encodes all the development of a phenotyp=\r\ne \nwith \n&gt; &gt; any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; precision via composing coordinate frames. A whol=\r\ne phenotype \nwith \n&gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its patterns with infinite (well at lea=\r\nst huge) precision can \nbe \n&gt; &gt; fit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into just the patch of [-1 .. =\r\n1] in Cartesian space. Assume I \nwill \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about 2D spa=\r\nce only for simplicity. That patch [-1 .. \n1] \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both X and Y=\r\n I call &quot;the Egg&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The first approach I took with the ide=\r\na of the egg was too \nsimple, \n&gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is interesting to know a=\r\nbout. After the CPPN &quot;paints&quot; the \negg \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cell color and st=\r\nuff, then it is re-queried again, this time \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outputs are 2D ve=\r\nctors. The magnitude of these vectors was re-\n&gt; &gt; scaled \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be wit=\r\nhin [0 .. MAX_DISTANCE]. So the entire phenotype \nbuilding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedu=\r\nre became very simple - first build the egg, then send \neach \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cell =\r\nwhere its vector points. Well that looks so ugly in \npractice, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh empty holes and.. eh.. forget that! This is not anything \nmore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\ndvanced than just painting the CPPN output directly like in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Picbre=\r\neder, just a fancy way of doing the same. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I realized=\r\n that these &quot;cells&quot; can be also thought of an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abstractions of &quot;mas=\r\nses/groups of cells&quot;. In nature, cells \ndon&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go &quot;that w=\r\nay&quot; moving through each other, but stick together. \n&gt; &gt; Entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tis=\r\nsues develop fast as a mass of cells divides and increases \n&gt; &gt; size. So \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I had this insight. I changed the concept of a cell and \nimproved \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; over \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the previous model. A cell is a circle with a radius, has =\r\na \ncolor \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has mass. It also has more properties but more o=\r\nn that after a \nfew \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other words. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the key=\r\n idea. In my previous model, the CPPN was \n&gt; &gt; instructing a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; big m=\r\nass of many cells on the fly, during development time. It \n&gt; &gt; took \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; advantage of using time as input, so the development was like \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n spatial pattern in 4D. But it suffered from the coordinates \nand \n&gt; &gt; othe=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems I mentioned above. In this model, the CPPN does not \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; operate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the cells during development. The CPPN predetermines =\r\nthe \nfate \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each cell right in the egg, before development b=\r\negins. \nEverything \n&gt; &gt; else \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during development is a consequence o=\r\nf the cell&#39;s fate and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; internal 2D physics world in which the p=\r\nhenotype develops. So, \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler words, the CPPN is programming =\r\nthe egg.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A cell has the following properties that are dete=\r\nrmined by the \n&gt; &gt; CPPN:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Color (of course :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Growth rat=\r\ne. How fast it increases size in % of circle area. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Time to begin=\r\n growth. It is a value in [0 .. 1] where 1 is \nthe \n&gt; &gt; total \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; numb=\r\ner of time steps allocated for development.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Growth time duration.=\r\n Between some min and max value.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Angle for division splitting. Be=\r\ntween [-1 .. 1], during \n&gt; &gt; development \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rescaled to [0 .. pi]\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As cells grow, they will inevitably overlap each other. This =\r\n\nissue \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; handled by the internal simple 2D physics engine th=\r\nat adds \nforces \n&gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the circles overlap. So they eventually wi=\r\nll converge to a \nstate \n&gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they only touch each other, and =\r\nthe whole phenotype bigger of \n&gt; &gt; course. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cells can divide. Divis=\r\nion is automatic. If a cell&#39;s radius \n&gt; &gt; reaches a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a fixed tresho=\r\nld value, it is split into 2 cells, each one \nhaving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly half =\r\nthe area of the mother cell. The mother cell is \nsplit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along a pre=\r\ndetermined angle, so the CPPN can control the \noverall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions =\r\nof growth for the phenotype. The 2 children overlap \nin \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\neginning, but as time progresses, they are pulled apart by \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ph=\r\nysics. Children cells inherit the properties of the mother, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nhange their positions and reset their lifetime timers. The \ncells \n&gt; &gt; in \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the egg count their children and their grandchildren as well. \nNo \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than 3 generations of division can occur, in order to kee=\r\np the \n&gt; &gt; number \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of cells relatively small for performance consid=\r\nerations. \nThough \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; value can be changed. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In order to keep the phenotype solid, not torn apart from \ninternal \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; velocities, a mass-spring grid mesh is created in the egg \nbefore \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; development. Cell divisions update the mesh. The mass-spring \nmesh \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n plus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cell-to-cell overlapping prevention forces act together =\r\nas \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phenotype increases in size and number of cells. Eventuall=\r\ny it \n&gt; &gt; will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become more stiff, where large group of recently di=\r\nvided cells \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; packed together. I don&#39;t know if that is a bug or=\r\n a feature :) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is one insight I had after seeing the=\r\n results. Watching \nthe \n&gt; &gt; mesh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops, and some with interest=\r\ning shapes and configurations, \n&gt; &gt; makes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me think this approach i=\r\ns very well suited to evolve HyperNEAT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrates as well. In fact=\r\n I am about to add brains to these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creatures right this evening :)=\r\n But I don&#39;t know, if the links \n&gt; &gt; should \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be determined from the=\r\n beginning right in the egg or after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development. Any suggestions?=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well this is it. I hope this may be some advance into th=\r\ne \nfield. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be happy to see any thoughts about this stuff.

Note however, that it is j=\r\nust a demo of \n&gt; &gt; development, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not evolution.
