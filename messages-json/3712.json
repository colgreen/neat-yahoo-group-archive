So it would probably always be limited to\ndevelopers that have explicitly been added to the project.\n\n&gt; As for major branching modifications like Hyper/Parralel neat it is a\n&gt; simple matter to create a branch in a SVN repository and hand out\n&gt; branch write access to whoever you choose.\n\nOK - I wonder if I can alter access per branch on sourceforge?\n\n\n&gt; The advantage for everyone\n&gt; of this is that any bug fixes, upgrades and improvements to common\n&gt; code on any branch or in the main release can easily be merged across\n&gt; or patches created (by anyone not just code maintainers) so all\n&gt; flavors of SharpNeat can benefit from the hard work...\n\n\nWell it&#39;s there now so if anyone wants their own branch to work on let me know.\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
