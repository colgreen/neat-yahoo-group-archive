I came to \nit quite sceptical, and whilst I don&#39;t now completely accept everything he \nsays, I did get a useful perspective from reading it.  In particular, he \nhas a couple of ideas which differ from the standard ANN baseline concepts \nand which are worth consideration.  That and he brings the computer science \ntheory into a nice natural evolution perspective -- which is my main \ninterest -- and brought up one major view which I had never considered.\n\n\tThis is a home site he has for the book.  Not sure the reviews really tell \nyou that much but the extracts told me enough that I bought it and there&#39;s \nlinks to the usual suppliers.  It&#39;s also not at all expensive...\n\n\thttp://whatisthought.com/\n\n\tI&#39;m not affiliated with him in any way.  We did exchange the some emails \nafter I read his earlier papers.\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\nAlso, if you hold the cover up in a bright light and move it in a small \ncircle it really makes you dizzy -- so what do you have to lose?\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
