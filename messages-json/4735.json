The robots can manipulate the link(s), =\r\ne.g., to lift each other. Recently, Jeff Clune (hi Jeff) introduced me to h=\r\nyperNEAT, and it looks like just the ticket to address two issues that we h=\r\nave to tackle. So here I am, excited newbie and all.\n\nFirst, I want to try =\r\nand use hyperNEAT to evolve gaits for organisms with pre-defined shapes (e.=\r\ng., spiders, snakes). The idea is to develop a single genome that determine=\r\ns the weights for neural nets in each of the individual robots that make up=\r\n the organism, so I would expect to pass the coordinates of nodes within th=\r\ne individual NN, but also about the location of the individual in the organ=\r\nism (possibly related to some central node or whatever).\n\nThe next step wil=\r\nl be to use hyperNEAT&#39;s CPPNs to evolve morphologies for organisms. I&#39;m thi=\r\nnking of a 3D grid where the CPPN assigns some value to each cell which def=\r\nines, according to some threshold, whether a robot goes in that spot or not=\r\n. The fitness of the CPPN would be the level of success in evolving a gait =\r\nfor the resulting shape as described above. Another method of combining mor=\r\nphology and gait development would be to interleave them in some way (waves=\r\n hands).\n\nSo...does that sound like a good plan, are there any pointers to =\r\nrelated work? Do&#39;s and don&#39;ts? Expressions of interest, ridicule or awe?\n\nT=\r\nIA,\n\nEvert Haasdijk\nVU Amsterdam\n\n\n"}}
