We choose a function based on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;problem at ha=\r\nnd, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a \ndifferent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;function. Bu=\r\nt often we come up with different ways of \nevaluating netwoks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for a gi=\r\nven problem and we often have discussions about what is \nthe best\n&gt; &gt; &gt;func=\r\ntion. What if we were to code up a few of theses different \nfunctions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nand allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This then \ncould be\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;something akin to an extinction event occuring in nature and \nchanging\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;the fitness landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;.... or if your function has=\r\n a bunch of measures that are \nweighted to\n&gt; &gt;give a final fitness score yo=\r\nu could just change the weighting\n&gt; &gt;occasionally.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been toying =\r\nwith this.  e.g. because TTT-PPS involves \ntesting \n&gt; each individual over =\r\n620-odd boards, you could regard the fitness \nof \n&gt; each individual as a ve=\r\nctor or values (one value for each \n&gt; board).  This still reduces to a sing=\r\nle overall fitness if you sum \n&gt; over the vector, but by keeping the values=\r\n separate for some \n&gt; purposes, you might be keeping information that would=\r\n otherwise be \ndiscarded.\n&gt; \n&gt; ((This is not specific to TTT, it would appl=\r\ny just as well to any \n&gt; case where the score is built as a sum over a set =\r\nof test \n&gt; cases.  Even co-evolution might be expressible this way, e.g. if=\r\n \neach \n&gt; individual plays against every other member of the population, \nt=\r\nhen \n&gt; that set of results is a fitness vector as well.))\n&gt; \n&gt; You can use =\r\nthis to identify individuals with important new \nfeatures, \n&gt; even if their=\r\n overall score is low.  e.g. given two individuals, \nwe \n&gt; have the simple =\r\ncomparison of scores:\n&gt; \n&gt; DScore(1, 2) =3D Score_1 - Score_2.\n&gt; \n&gt; But we =\r\nalso can divide up the test-cases according to who passed \nthem:\n&gt; \n&gt; Commo=\r\nnScore(1, 2) =3D Sum(Cases_Both_Pass);\n&gt; CommonFail(1, 2) =3D Sum(Cases_Bot=\r\nh_Fail);\n&gt; Advantage(1, 2) =3D Sum(Cases_1_Passes_But_2_Fails);\n&gt; Advantage=\r\n(2, 1) =3D Sum(Cases_2_Passes_But_1_Fails);\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, when 2 has a lower o=\r\nverall score than 1, but a non-zero \n&gt; Advantage(2, 1).  That tells us that=\r\n although 2 is a step back in \n&gt; absolute fitness, it has discovered someth=\r\ning that 1 cannot do \n&gt; (especially if 1 is the population leader, because =\r\nthe leader is \n&gt; least likely to be missing anything obvious and least-like=\r\nly to be \n&gt; able to acquire a new feature without losing some existing scor=\r\ne).\n&gt; \n&gt; Which might be a strong case for either:\n&gt; a) 2 being regarded as =\r\nfitter than naive fitness woudl suppose, or,\n&gt; b) splitting 2 off into a ne=\r\nw species to see if it can improve on \nits \n&gt; new feature (with the scope t=\r\no merge it back later)\n&gt; c) trying hard to merge 1 and 2 right now\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n      Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; p.s. I don&#39;t really know anything about it, but doesn&#39;t one =\r\nof the \n&gt; classifier approaches work a little like this?  Maybe pareto?\n&gt; \n=\r\n\nYes actually you are beginning to invent your own version of pareto \ncoevo=\r\nlution there.  What you&#39;re describing is basically a pareto \nfront.  There =\r\nis a lot of work on coevolving game players using a \npareto front by Sevan =\r\nFicici, Edwin De Jong, and Anthony Bucci.  For \nexample, this paper by Edwi=\r\nn De Jong is about a &quot;Pareto Archive&quot; for \ncoevolution:\n\nwww.cs.uu.nl/~dejo=\r\nng/publications/gecco04coev.pdf \n\nUnfortunately, while such methods integra=\r\nte some great ideas, they \nstill have some big drawbacks, mostly in terms o=\r\nf computation time.  \nIt gets very expensive maintaining that pareto front.=\r\n  Also there is \nsome debate about which part of the pareto front is import=\r\nant, but \nthat is very recent (actually I saw Anthony Bucci discussing this=\r\n \nquestion just this month at the AAAI Fall Symposium on coevolution).\n\nken=\r\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
