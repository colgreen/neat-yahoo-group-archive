I am\nstill thinking a=\r\nbout this issue, but I am not sure they are really\ndifferent.\n\nIn NEAT-base=\r\nd novelty search, speciation is still happening as normal.\n One thing speci=\r\nation does in fitness-based search is protect unique\nindividuals who may ha=\r\nve lower fitness based on the idea that they may\ntake a while to reach thei=\r\nr potential.  By analogy, in novelty search,\nthe effect is to protect genet=\r\nically unique individuals who may not be\nvery novel behaviorally on the cha=\r\nnce that they too may need some time\nto discover how to do something novel.=\r\n\n\nIn other words, speciation means less greedy search.  In some cases,\nof c=\r\nourse, being less greedy means being slower (such as when there is\na single=\r\n global optimum on a giant hill across the entire search\nspace).  In partic=\r\nular, if the most fit (or most novel) individuals\nfor whatever reason turn =\r\nout to be the best jumping-off points for\neven more fit (or more novel) ind=\r\nividuals, then the time spent on\nprotected individuals was &quot;wasted.&quot;  Yet t=\r\nhat would not be the case in\nall domains, so to forego such protection is t=\r\no take a risk in general.\n\nIt could be that in the maze domain a greedier k=\r\nind of novelty search\nwould be faster.  But would that be true in other dom=\r\nains?  An\ninteresting question is the extent to which novelty search is bet=\r\nter\nserved by greediness than fitness-based search.  I am not sure if\nthere=\r\n is any basis to believe that it is.\n\nThe idea of taking species age into a=\r\nccount might be interesting, but\nthe question is still why this considerati=\r\non would matter more or less\nthan in fitness-based NEAT?\n\nOverall, the way =\r\nI see speciation interacting with novelty search is\nto protect small specie=\r\ns that have unique genotypes even if those do\nnot translate to novel behavi=\r\nors in the hope that unique genotypes may\nhave the potential to turn into u=\r\nnique behaviors if given the chance. \n\nIt is possible that I am misinterpre=\r\nting the idea that you guys are\ndeveloping, so please do clarify my comment=\r\ns if that is the case. \nNovelty search does challenge a lot of common assum=\r\nptions about search.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; =\r\n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I believe so. Perhaps something simi=\r\nlar to the niching mechanism \n&gt; in generational NEAT, boosting younger spec=\r\nies&#39;s fitness and \n&gt; penalizing old species. In Novelty Search this may be =\r\napplied like.. \n&gt; If a species continiously produces novel forms, it is rew=\r\narded. If a \n&gt; species keeps prodicing the same or close to the same known =\r\n\n&gt; behaviors, then it can be penalized. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;lehman.154@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, overlooked your la=\r\nst point about speciation.\n&gt; &gt; That is a good point, that perhaps the fitne=\r\nss of the individuals is\n&gt; &gt; not as important as that of the overall specie=\r\ns, since that will\n&gt; &gt; determine the amount of offspring a particular speci=\r\nes gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the bias then is to genotypic lines that have produced=\r\n novelty in\n&gt; &gt; the past, which might be a good indicator of novelty in the=\r\n future.\n&gt; &gt; Maybe there is a way to reward species in a more principled/ex=\r\nplicit\n&gt; &gt; manner? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joel\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jo=\r\nel278&quot; &lt;lehman.154@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is a surpr=\r\nising result.
