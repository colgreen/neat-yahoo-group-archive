From reading your response my instinct is to use feedforward\nas the default/baseline for CPPNs and to look toward recursive CPPNs\nas a research path from there. The function composition aspect of\nfeedforward networks is simple to understand (again, it&#39;s like an\nexpression tree with a little extra complexity - but not as much as a\nrecursive network).\n\n\n&gt; But if you really want to kind of understand what types of things CPPNs will output, it&#39;s best left feedforward, because then it can\n&gt; be understood as sums and compositions of functions, which is conceptually pure and follows the theory in the papers.\n\nTotally agree.\n\n&gt; For example. Picbreeder is strictly feedforward, and that helps us to understand the function of internal nodes in Picbreeder\n&gt; networks (we hope to soon make public the structure of CPPNs within Picbreeder, which is very educational).\n\n\nWill look forward to it. I appreciate the amount of work it takes to\nget this kind of thing up and running.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
