In my experience most ANNs have weights here,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lots of them.  It&#39;s often the case that the majority\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the weights are between the inputs and the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; layer of neurons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think we&#39;re dealing with ambiguous terminology here.  The first\n&gt; &gt; layer of neurons in ANJI are responsible for nothing more than \n&gt; passing\n&gt; &gt; the input data on to the rest of the network.  They do have an\n&gt; &gt; activation function, but typically this is just linear (i.e., it\n&gt; &gt; effectively does not have an activation function).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, if you do not view these neurons as a layer, then what I \nwould\n&gt; &gt; call the first hidden layer is what you would call the input \nlayer. \n&gt; &gt; And yes, the inputs to this layer do have weights.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ANJI does allow the first layer of neurons to be connected to \neach\n&gt; &gt; other if recurrency is enabled.  And, in NEAT there really is no\n&gt; &gt; concept of layers, just neurons and connections.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Philip\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Right--what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here is starting with a \n&gt; minimalst network.  FS-NEAT suggests not only starting wih the \nhidden \n&gt; topology being evolved, but the input layer as well--with the \ninput \n&gt; weights all set to zero, I&#39;m hoping the inputs will be evolved as \n&gt; well.\n&gt; \n\nNote that there is a difference between a weight being set to zero \nand the connection not even existing.  FS-NEAT starts with most \nconnections literally not there at all.  That is a lot stricter than \nstarting with weights of zero because a connection has to exist \nbefore it can be peturbed, making the likelihood of any given \nconnection suddenly &quot;coming into existence&quot; much lower.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
