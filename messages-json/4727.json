That is, the left side of the agent is on the s=\r\name side of the agent as the left side of the team, which is how it usually=\r\n would be in the real world.  Nevertheless, you make a good point that the =\r\nsubstrate could be 3D as an alternative.  There is nothing wrong with doing=\r\n it that way and it does have its own advantages.  In fact, we have experim=\r\nented with both approaches to laying out agents for multiagent learning (al=\r\nthough only r(x) is in the GECCO paper), and both are valid.\n\nken\n\n--- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I am working on a project that needs a substrate of more than 2 \n&gt; dimens=\r\nions.
