And in this field, it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;especially unlikely that\n&gt;&gt;something is useful just because it&#39;s original,\n&gt;&gt;since there are a\n&gt;&gt;million mediocre variations of implementations that\n&gt;&gt;haven&#39;t been\n&gt;&gt;patented yet. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Exactly.  I think the initial conclusions you jumped\n&gt;to were just fine, Ken.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n:) I haven&#39;t had chance to do the thorough P.I. job you seem to be doing \nDerek but from what you&#39;ve said it all sounds a bit odd. Exactly how can \nsomeone patent Hebbian learning anyway? Aren&#39;t patents  supposed to \ncontain/define something that is unique and distinct from what has been \ndone before. Mind you I hear that patent systems around the world are \nreaching meltdown because of all the spurious applications from \ntechnolgy firms - no-one at the patent offices is qualified enough to \njudge all of the stuff that gets submitted. The people who ARE qualified \nare the ones generating the submissions :)\n\n&gt;&quot;Francisco holds an A.B. in Biochemistry and a Ph.D.\n&gt;in Organismal and Evolutionary Biology, both from\n&gt;Harvard, and has three years of postdoctoral\n&gt;experience at the Institute of Molecular Evolutionary\n&gt;Genetics. He is the author of fifteen publications in\n&gt;topflight scientific journals, and his research has\n&gt;achieved international attention in the popular as\n&gt;well as the scientific press and has been described in\n&gt;numerous textbooks.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nImpressive stuff. Organismal is my word for the day. I will try and work \ninto into a conversation somehow.\n\n&gt;Although there are no references or links to any of\n&gt;these publications, and Citeseer and other on-line\n&gt;searches turn up zilch.\n&gt;\nPut his name into google. There are some online papers linked from his \nCV at http://www.neuroblast.net/cuvi.html\nEverything seems present and correct.\n\n&gt;Right now I&#39;m viewing Ayala, his credentials, and his\n&gt;claims with a very large dose of skepticism.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNothing wrong with a healthy dose of skepticism, it is the basis of \nscientific discovery after all. I suspect you may be jumping the gun \nthough, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a thouroughly nice chap.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
