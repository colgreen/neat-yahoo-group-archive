This\nis indeed an interesting discussion that touches on many potentially\nimportant issues. I hope I can offer a useful perspective on these topics.\n\nYou are right that in a target-based scenario there can be many CPPNs that\ngenerate the same phenotype. But the CPPN is a genotype, not a phenotype. In\nwhat I&#39;m calling &quot;regular&quot; FFs, there are potentially many *phenotypes* that\nsolve the problem, and for each of them potentially many genotypes. So in my\nmind, there is still a useful distinction between target based FFs and\nregular FFs, though they are perhaps best seen as different points on a\nspectrum.\n\nIf I understand correctly, you are suggesting that the important distinction\nis how the FF interacts with the search process. But to me, this is a\ndifficult criterion to use because the search process could be anything. The\nspace of possible black-box optimization methods is huge, and what\nencourages piecewise incremental progress for one method may not for\nanother.\n\nI don&#39;t pretend to know what kind of algorithm would generate Einstein-level\nintelligence (I don&#39;t even know if this is a useful goal). But as a\nresearcher I highly respect once told me, &quot;your failure to imagine it does\nnot constitute a proof that it cannot be done.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s why I think your hypothesis is quite a bold one, because it looks at\nthe limitations of a specific class of black-box optimization methods and\ngeneralizes them to all possible black-box optimization methods. \n\nTo give just one example of the possibilities here: algorithms for\ncontinuous-armed bandits, such as X-armed bandits and Bayesian optimization\nmethods such as GP-UCB, can be applied to black-box optimization. These\nmethods avoid the problem of local optima in a principled way, by\nmaintaining a posterior distribution over the global FF, and using optimism\nin the face of uncertainty to ensure sufficient exploration of the solution\nspace. As a result, these methods have very nice theoretical properties,\nlike guaranteed convergence to the global optimum in the limit and\nlogarithmic regret bounds along the way. \n\nAs far as I know, no one has tried to develop versions of these methods that\ncan discover NN topologies, and which would thus be suitable for optimizing\nCPPNs or other indirect encodings. But there&#39;s no a priori reason to think\nit can&#39;t be done. I&#39;m not saying this would necessarily work or even that\nit&#39;s the most promising approach to explore. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s one\nexample of a principled approach that could avoid all the difficulties you\nmention and which we currently have no strong reason to eliminate from\ncontention.\n\nSo I think it&#39;s quite likely that these hard FFs are not unsolvable, but\njust that current methods cannot solve them. Rather than giving up on them,\nin my opinion we should be focusing on developing better methods for them.\n\nRegarding whether 6 nodes is a lot to represent fracture, I think the same\npoint applies: just because we can&#39;t think of a better way to do it, doesn&#39;t\nmean it doesn&#39;t exist. Our paper establishes 6 as an upper bound, which can\nbe easily done by example. If I understand correctly, you are suggesting\nthat 6 may be a lower bound, which is much more difficult to demonstrate.\n\nI could definitely imagine that a different type of network, or one with a\ndifferent set of activation functions, might be able to make better use of 6\nnodes. Even if it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a trade-off, and using fewer nodes\nmeans less flexibility, there may be many cases where that&#39;s a favorable\ntrade-off. We should at least be open to the possibility that it some cases\nthe sweet spot is not a representation that requires 6 nodes for fracture.\n\nI&#39;m looking forward to chatting more about this at GECCO.\n\nCheers,\nShimon\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , &quot;Ken&quot;\n&lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Shimon,\n&gt; \n&gt; These are some really interesting and deep issues we&#39;re getting into. I\n&gt; am sure they will be the foundation of great discussions at GECCO. I&#39;ll\n&gt; try to keep my response more brief than before.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Indeed recent quadruped results are not in the same setup as in your\n&gt; work; that is a legitimate qualification and they do not constitute a\n&gt; proof that in your particular setup HyperNEAT would succeed. However,\n&gt; they are arguably at least comparably complex. For example, the CTRNN\n&gt; in\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf\n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf&gt; is a complicated\n&gt; structure and the CPPN that encodes it is required not only to generate\n&gt; a controller for a single quadruped morphology, but to generate multiple\n&gt; controllers for multiple morphologies, all from the same CPPN. A video\n&gt; of three controllers all from the same CPPN is here:\n&gt; http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk &lt;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I think the question of what is &quot;target-based&quot; can actually be\n&gt; interesting, but I completely agree that the semantic side of the\n&gt; argument isn&#39;t really important. But what I do find interesting is the\n&gt; idea that these two scenarios differ substantively in your mind (as you\n&gt; put it):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;there is an important difference between FFs that require a single\n&gt; specific phenotype and FFs that require only that some goal be achieved&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think by &quot;single specific phenotype&quot; you mean pattern-matching (i.e.\n&gt; image-matching). But I think this distinction doesn&#39;t really exist: \n&gt; There are an unlimited number of networks (i.e. CPPNs) that can encode a\n&gt; particular two-dimensional image, just as there are an unlimited number\n&gt; of CPPNs that can encode a particular behavior or goal (such as\n&gt; following a line).\n&gt; \n&gt; What makes both target-based and fundamentally the same is not the\n&gt; number of ways they can be solved, but rather the way the fitness\n&gt; function interacts with the search process. The problem is that\n&gt; target-based fitness encourages piece-wise incremental progress, which\n&gt; tends to be highly deceptive. For example, with an image, matching a\n&gt; single pixel can raise fitness even if the function that causes that\n&gt; pixel to be matched has no relationship whatsoever to the overall\n&gt; regularities in the target pattern. The same is true in control tasks: \n&gt; A mutation that causes a quadruped to lunge forward clumsily is rewarded\n&gt; for the slight improvement in fitness, whereas an important underlying\n&gt; regularity (e.g. oscillation) necessary to get really good at the task\n&gt; is never established. Non-target-based fitness (or what I call\n&gt; &quot;non-objective&quot;) avoids these problems because it *does* reward\n&gt; establishing regularities: it appreciates new regularities even if they\n&gt; don&#39;t immediately raise fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; But what&#39;s most interesting to me is your intuition that there is some\n&gt; way to sidestep the tradeoff in combining indirect encodings with\n&gt; target-based fitness functions. That is, you suspect there may exist an\n&gt; indirect encoding that can both elaborate regularities compositionally\n&gt; over very many generations and also almost deterministically satisfy an\n&gt; arbitrary target-based objective. I am convinced that is not the case \n&gt; (it would be too good to be true), but you rightly point out that my\n&gt; position is a hypothesis. However, just as a thought experiment, can\n&gt; you really imagine any neural network encoding (including DNA) that\n&gt; would give you Einstein-level intelligence if the target was simply to\n&gt; score maximally on an IQ test? It is plain to me that the stepping\n&gt; stones to human level cannot be crossed in the presence of a\n&gt; target-based objective (or any one conceivable). However,\n&gt; interestingly, that does not mean that such a neural network does not\n&gt; exist in the search space. It just means a target won&#39;t get you there.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) We apparently disagree on whether 6 is a big number (for nodes needed\n&gt; to represent fracture). If you try to devise an encoding that\n&gt; represents fracture with fewer than that, my intuition is that you would\n&gt; be sacrificing an enormous breadth of flexibility in the kinds of\n&gt; fracture (and patterns in general) that you can represent. Think about\n&gt; the number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in fracture: it&#39;s not really\n&gt; well-defined, but a single line of fracture has a lot of dimensions:\n&gt; \n&gt; -position\n&gt; -orientation\n&gt; -curvature (which can be arbitrarily complex)\n&gt; -fracture gradient (that is, one region can smoothly transition into\n&gt; another in a kind of interpolated transitional zone)\n&gt; -embedding (fracture can potentially be hierarchical or regular, i.e.\n&gt; dependent on higher-level containing regions)\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea that all of that can be encoded in anything less than about 6\n&gt; simple functions seems optimistic. Of course, if you are willing to\n&gt; sacrifice some of those degrees of freedom, then you can get fewer\n&gt; nodes, but the exquisite minutia of such patterns would be lost (and\n&gt; you&#39;d move more towards direct encoding, like the wavelets do).\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, here are some cool examples of complicated kinds of fracture\n&gt; from Picbreeder (such as fractured periodic zones, but even more complex\n&gt; than even that):\n&gt; \n&gt; Nontrivial color patterns in each zone:\n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=11328\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Very complex brush-stroke pattern inside the apple vs. outside (the DNA\n&gt; for this one is fascinating):\n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=7109\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Fractured regions covering a distorted surface, giving a remarkable\n&gt; underlying curvature:\n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=2684\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A color variant: http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=6652\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I see so many remarkable examples like these on Picbreeder, the\n&gt; message to me is that we have only scratched the surface of what CPPN\n&gt; encoding can teach us about representation. That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s\n&gt; premature (in the face of such a treasure trove of evidence) to be\n&gt; worrying about whether we can represent some subcomponent of such\n&gt; patterns with less than 6 nodes. At present I&#39;m amazed they can be\n&gt; represented at all, let alone with under 6 nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much for raising these issues in any case - it&#39;s a great\n&gt; debate to have about representation and search and goes to the heart of\n&gt; the field of GDS/indirect encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , &quot;shimonw&quot;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your interesting and thought-provoking comments. I&#39;ll give\n&gt; some brief reactions here, and I hope we can have a productive\n&gt; discussion about it at GECCO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) I won&#39;t comment for now on the new experiments you&#39;ve been running\n&gt; because the details are not available yet. Instead, I will just comment\n&gt; on the various walking gait domains, because the details of the\n&gt; additional results you mentioned are in that case already available, in\n&gt; newly published GECCO papers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; FIrst of all, these are very cool results, and nice success stories\n&gt; for HyperNEAT. It&#39;s great to see that the GDS community is continuing\n&gt; the push the envelope in terms of robot locomotion, which seems to be\n&gt; emerging as a nice application for indirect encodings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I would simply caution against placing all these variations\n&gt; on the walking gait task on a one-dimensional spectrum of difficulty. \n&gt; In our paper, we took the orignal walking gait task and made only one\n&gt; change (increasing the mass of the torso) which clearly makes the task\n&gt; harder. In the papers Ken mentioned, there are other differences, e.g.,\n&gt; the use of an SUPG encoding, the use of CTRNNs, the use of a different\n&gt; substrate topology, and varying the length of the legs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s completely legitimate to make these changes and they don&#39;t\n&gt; detract from the results at all. But they are confounding factors when\n&gt; it comes to comparing HyperNEAT&#39;s performance on walking gait tasks of\n&gt; different difficulties. Some of these changes may make the task harder\n&gt; in some ways but other changes may make it easier in others ways, and so\n&gt; far we don&#39;t have experimental results that control for these factors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) I hope to avoid a semantic debate about what is a &quot;target-based&quot;\n&gt; FF. If you want to include what I was calling a &quot;regular&quot; FF in the\n&gt; scope of target-based FFs, I won&#39;t object. But my point is that,\n&gt; regardless of what you call them, there is an important difference\n&gt; between FFs that require a single specific phenotype and FFs that\n&gt; require only that some goal be achieved. For the latter, there may be\n&gt; many ways to skin the cat, though in any interesting problem, good\n&gt; solutions are still quite rare. The distinction is important because,\n&gt; while the former category is arguably only of theoretical interest, the\n&gt; second category corresponds to what I consider the most interesting and\n&gt; important class of FFs, because these are the FFs that naturally arise\n&gt; in a very large number of real-world optimization problems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, using your terminology, I agree it is reasonable to say\n&gt; HyperNEAT&#39;s difficulties with fracture are probably limited to\n&gt; &quot;target-based&quot; FFs. But for me, this is a potentially serious\n&gt; restriction, since target-based FFs include not just pathological FFs\n&gt; but a large class of real-world FFs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the wavelet method, I would still definitely call this an\n&gt; indirect encoding, but it is in some sense &quot;less indirect&quot; because it\n&gt; lacks the compositional functions of HyperNEAT. It&#39;s a perfectly\n&gt; reasonable hypothesis that such compositionality is advantageous in some\n&gt; ways. However, if that&#39;s true, then we should be able to demonstrate\n&gt; that by finding tasks where HyperNEAT outperforms the wavelet method\n&gt; (FYI, in the extended analysis Thomas is conducting for his master&#39;s\n&gt; thesis, we have found one variation of the line-following task where\n&gt; this is the case). So in that sense, the wavelet method is a useful\n&gt; baseline, which is the whole reason we introduced it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) If it&#39;s true that it takes ~6 nodes to represent fracture, then I\n&gt; think this a potentially important point. On regular FFs, it could\n&gt; contribute to the difficulty of discovering fracture, since\n&gt; representations that have only some of the necessary components may not\n&gt; be rewarded (I think you would call this &quot;deception&quot;). In\n&gt; Picbreeder-like tasks, we already see that fracture can evolve anyway,\n&gt; but this doesn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t do it even better if fracture required\n&gt; fewer nodes to represent. If we think that the solutions to many\n&gt; interesting problems require fracture, then I think it&#39;s at least\n&gt; possible that one could devise a better representation for such problems\n&gt; than the CPPNs used in HyperNEAT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I understand it, your approach to dealing with &quot;regular&quot; FFs is to\n&gt; reformulate them &quot;in a way that respects the need for phenotypic\n&gt; diversity and open-endedness.&quot; That&#39;s a very interesting approach and I\n&gt; think it has a lot of merit, but I don&#39;t think it will solve all our\n&gt; problems because it presupposes that such a reformulation is possible\n&gt; (or that the prior knowledge it requires is available). In some cases,\n&gt; I think we are just stuck with hard FFs and we need to develop better\n&gt; methods to deal with them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the idea that &quot;an unhappy and unhealthy indirect encoding is\n&gt; one with only a strict target to which to aspire&quot;: this is a very\n&gt; intriguing hypothesis, but to me it is only a hypothesis. I think it&#39;s\n&gt; true of existing indirect encodings, but that for me does not in any way\n&gt; rule out the possibility of developing a different indirect encoding for\n&gt; which that is not true, and I think that&#39;s one thing we should be\n&gt; working on. One of the reasons that I&#39;m interested in indirect\n&gt; encodings is that I strongly believe this can be done.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Shimon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nNo virus

I&#39;d like=\r\n to offer a couple reactions to your latest message. This is indeed an inte=\r\nresting discussion that touches on many potentially important issues. I hop=\r\ne I can offer a useful perspective on these topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are right th=\r\nat in a target-based scenario there can be many CPPNs that generate the sam=\r\ne phenotype. But the CPPN is a genotype, not a phenotype. In what I&#39;m calli=\r\nng &quot;regular&quot; FFs, there are potentially many *phenotypes* that so=\r\nlve the problem, and for each of them potentially many genotypes. So in my =\r\nmind, there is still a useful distinction between target based FFs and regu=\r\nlar FFs, though they are perhaps best seen as different points on a spectru=\r\nm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I understand correctly, you are suggesting that the important =\r\ndistinction is how the FF interacts with the search process. But to me, thi=\r\ns is a difficult criterion to use because the search process could be anyth=\r\ning. The space of possible black-box optimization methods is huge, and what=\r\n encourages piecewise incremental progress for one method may not for anoth=\r\ner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t pretend to know what kind of algorithm would generate Ei=\r\nnstein-level intelligence (I don&#39;t even know if this is a useful goal). But=\r\n as a researcher I highly respect once told me, &quot;your failure to imagi=\r\nne it does not constitute a proof that it cannot be done.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That=\r\n&#39;s why I think your hypothesis is quite a bold one, because it looks at the=\r\n limitations of a specific class of black-box optimization methods and gene=\r\nralizes them to all possible black-box optimization methods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To giv=\r\ne just one example of the possibilities here: algorithms for continuous-arm=\r\ned bandits, such as X-armed bandits and Bayesian optimization methods such =\r\nas GP-UCB, can be applied to black-box optimization. These methods avoid th=\r\ne problem of local optima in a principled way, by maintaining a posterior d=\r\nistribution over the global FF, and using optimism in the face of uncertain=\r\nty to ensure sufficient exploration of the solution space. As a result, the=\r\nse methods have very nice theoretical properties, like guaranteed convergen=\r\nce to the global optimum in the limit and logarithmic regret bounds along t=\r\nhe way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I know, no one has tried to develop versions of t=\r\nhese methods that can discover NN topologies, and which would thus be suita=\r\nble for optimizing CPPNs or other indirect encodings. But there&#39;s no a prio=\r\nri reason to think it can&#39;t be done. I&#39;m not saying this would necessarily =\r\nwork or even that it&#39;s the most promising approach to explore. I&#39;m just say=\r\ning it&#39;s one example of a principled approach that could avoid all the diff=\r\niculties you mention and which we currently have no strong reason to elimin=\r\nate from contention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I think it&#39;s quite likely that these hard FF=\r\ns are not unsolvable, but just that current methods cannot solve them. Rath=\r\ner than giving up on them, in my opinion we should be focusing on developin=\r\ng better methods for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding whether 6 nodes is a lot to rep=\r\nresent fracture, I think the same point applies: just because we can&#39;t thin=\r\nk of a better way to do it, doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. Our paper establ=\r\nishes 6 as an upper bound, which can be easily done by example. If I unders=\r\ntand correctly, you are suggesting that 6 may be a lower bound, which is mu=\r\nch more difficult to demonstrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could definitely imagine that a =\r\ndifferent type of network, or one with a different set of activation functi=\r\nons, might be able to make better use of 6 nodes. Even if it&#39;s true that th=\r\nere&#39;s a trade-off, and using fewer nodes means less flexibility, there may =\r\nbe many cases where that&#39;s a favorable trade-off. We should at least be ope=\r\nn to the possibility that it some cases the sweet spot is not a representat=\r\nion that requires 6 nodes for fracture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to chatt=\r\ning more about this at GECCO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Shimon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Ken&quo=\r\nt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:kstanley@...&quot;&gt;kstanley@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Hi Shimon,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; These are some really interesting and d=\r\neep issues we&#39;re getting into. I&lt;br&gt;&gt; am sure they will be the foundatio=\r\nn of great discussions at GECCO. I&#39;ll&lt;br&gt;&gt; try to keep my response more =\r\nbrief than before.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 1) Indeed recent quadruped results are =\r\nnot in the same setup as in your&lt;br&gt;&gt; work; that is a legitimate qualifi=\r\ncation and they do not constitute a&lt;br&gt;&gt; proof that in your particular s=\r\netup HyperNEAT would succeed. However,&lt;br&gt;&gt; they are arguably at least c=\r\nomparably complex. For example, the CTRNN&lt;br&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf&quot;&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/pape=\r\nrs/risi_gecco13b.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/pap=\r\ners/risi_gecco13b.pdf&quot;&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&gt; is a complicated&lt;br&gt;&gt; structure and the CPPN that encodes it is req=\r\nuired not only to generate&lt;br&gt;&gt; a controller for a single quadruped morp=\r\nhology, but to generate multiple&lt;br&gt;&gt; controllers for multiple morpholog=\r\nies, all from the same CPPN. A video&lt;br&gt;&gt; of three controllers all from =\r\nthe same CPPN is here:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&quot;&gt;http=\r\n://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 2) I think the question o=\r\nf what is &quot;target-based&quot; can actually be&lt;br&gt;&gt; interesting, but=\r\n I completely agree that the semantic side of the&lt;br&gt;&gt; argument isn&#39;t re=\r\nally important. But what I do find interesting is the&lt;br&gt;&gt; idea that the=\r\nse two scenarios differ substantively in your mind (as you&lt;br&gt;&gt; put it):=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;there is an important difference between FFs that r=\r\nequire a single&lt;br&gt;&gt; specific phenotype and FFs that require only that s=\r\nome goal be achieved&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I think by &quot;single specifi=\r\nc phenotype&quot; you mean pattern-matching (i.e.&lt;br&gt;&gt; image-matching). =\r\nBut I think this distinction doesn&#39;t really exist: &lt;br&gt;&gt; There are an un=\r\nlimited number of networks (i.e. CPPNs) that can encode a&lt;br&gt;&gt; particula=\r\nr two-dimensional image, just as there are an unlimited number&lt;br&gt;&gt; of C=\r\nPPNs that can encode a particular behavior or goal (such as&lt;br&gt;&gt; followi=\r\nng a line).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; What makes both target-based and fundamentally=\r\n the same is not the&lt;br&gt;&gt; number of ways they can be solved, but rather =\r\nthe way the fitness&lt;br&gt;&gt; function interacts with the search process. The=\r\n problem is that&lt;br&gt;&gt; target-based fitness encourages piece-wise increme=\r\nntal progress, which&lt;br&gt;&gt; tends to be highly deceptive. For example, wit=\r\nh an image, matching a&lt;br&gt;&gt; single pixel can raise fitness even if the f=\r\nunction that causes that&lt;br&gt;&gt; pixel to be matched has no relationship wh=\r\natsoever to the overall&lt;br&gt;&gt; regularities in the target pattern. The sam=\r\ne is true in control tasks: &lt;br&gt;&gt; A mutation that causes a quadruped to =\r\nlunge forward clumsily is rewarded&lt;br&gt;&gt; for the slight improvement in fi=\r\ntness, whereas an important underlying&lt;br&gt;&gt; regularity (e.g. oscillation=\r\n) necessary to get really good at the task&lt;br&gt;&gt; is never established. No=\r\nn-target-based fitness (or what I call&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;non-objective&quot;) a=\r\nvoids these problems because it *does* reward&lt;br&gt;&gt; establishing regulari=\r\nties: it appreciates new regularities even if they&lt;br&gt;&gt; don&#39;t immediatel=\r\ny raise fitness.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; But what&#39;s most interesting to me is your=\r\n intuition that there is some&lt;br&gt;&gt; way to sidestep the tradeoff in combi=\r\nning indirect encodings with&lt;br&gt;&gt; target-based fitness functions. That i=\r\ns, you suspect there may exist an&lt;br&gt;&gt; indirect encoding that can both e=\r\nlaborate regularities compositionally&lt;br&gt;&gt; over very many generations an=\r\nd also almost deterministically satisfy an&lt;br&gt;&gt; arbitrary target-based o=\r\nbjective. I am convinced that is not the case &lt;br&gt;&gt; (it would be too goo=\r\nd to be true), but you rightly point out that my&lt;br&gt;&gt; position is a hypo=\r\nthesis. However, just as a thought experiment, can&lt;br&gt;&gt; you really imagi=\r\nne any neural network encoding (including DNA) that&lt;br&gt;&gt; would give you =\r\nEinstein-level intelligence if the target was simply to&lt;br&gt;&gt; score maxim=\r\nally on an IQ test? It is plain to me that the stepping&lt;br&gt;&gt; stones to h=\r\numan level cannot be crossed in the presence of a&lt;br&gt;&gt; target-based obje=\r\nctive (or any one conceivable). However,&lt;br&gt;&gt; interestingly, that does n=\r\not mean that such a neural network does not&lt;br&gt;&gt; exist in the search spa=\r\nce. It just means a target won&#39;t get you there.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 3) We appa=\r\nrently disagree on whether 6 is a big number (for nodes needed&lt;br&gt;&gt; to r=\r\nepresent fracture). If you try to devise an encoding that&lt;br&gt;&gt; represent=\r\ns fracture with fewer than that, my intuition is that you would&lt;br&gt;&gt; be =\r\nsacrificing an enormous breadth of flexibility in the kinds of&lt;br&gt;&gt; frac=\r\nture (and patterns in general) that you can represent. Think about&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in fracture: it&#39;s not really&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; well-defined, but a single line of fracture has a lot of dimensions:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -position&lt;br&gt;&gt; -orientation&lt;br&gt;&gt; -curvature (which =\r\ncan be arbitrarily complex)&lt;br&gt;&gt; -fracture gradient (that is, one region=\r\n can smoothly transition into&lt;br&gt;&gt; another in a kind of interpolated tra=\r\nnsitional zone)&lt;br&gt;&gt; -embedding (fracture can potentially be hierarchica=\r\nl or regular, i.e.&lt;br&gt;&gt; dependent on higher-level containing regions)&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The idea that all of that can be encoded in anything less th=\r\nan about 6&lt;br&gt;&gt; simple functions seems optimistic. Of course, if you are=\r\n willing to&lt;br&gt;&gt; sacrifice some of those degrees of freedom, then you ca=\r\nn get fewer&lt;br&gt;&gt; nodes, but the exquisite minutia of such patterns would=\r\n be lost (and&lt;br&gt;&gt; you&#39;d move more towards direct encoding, like the wav=\r\nelets do).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; By the way, here are some cool examples of comp=\r\nlicated kinds of fracture&lt;br&gt;&gt; from Picbreeder (such as fractured period=\r\nic zones, but even more complex&lt;br&gt;&gt; than even that):&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; N=\r\nontrivial color patterns in each zone:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://picbreeder=\r\n.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D11328&quot;&gt;http://picbreeder.org/search/showge=\r\nnome.php?sid=3D11328&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Very complex brush-strok=\r\ne pattern inside the apple vs. outside (the DNA&lt;br&gt;&gt; for this one is fas=\r\ncinating):&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?s=\r\nid=3D7109&quot;&gt;http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D7109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Fractured regions covering a distorted surfac=\r\ne, giving a remarkable&lt;br&gt;&gt; underlying curvature:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D2684&quot;&gt;http://picbreeder.org/=\r\nsearch/showgenome.php?sid=3D2684&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; A color vari=\r\nant: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D6652&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D6652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; When I see so many remarkable examples like these on Picbreeder, the=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; message to me is that we have only scratched the surface of what C=\r\nPPN&lt;br&gt;&gt; encoding can teach us about representation. That&#39;s why I think =\r\nit&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; premature (in the face of such a treasure trove of evidence) t=\r\no be&lt;br&gt;&gt; worrying about whether we can represent some subcomponent of s=\r\nuch&lt;br&gt;&gt; patterns with less than 6 nodes. At present I&#39;m amazed they can=\r\n be&lt;br&gt;&gt; represented at all, let alone with under 6 nodes.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Thanks very much for raising these issues in any case - it&#39;s a great&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; debate to have about representation and search and goes to the heart =\r\nof&lt;br&gt;&gt; the field of GDS/indirect encoding.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best,&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ken&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;shimonw&quot; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Ken,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for your interesting an=\r\nd thought-provoking comments. I&#39;ll give&lt;br&gt;&gt; some brief reactions here, =\r\nand I hope we can have a productive&lt;br&gt;&gt; discussion about it at GECCO.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) I won&#39;t comment for now on the new experiments =\r\nyou&#39;ve been running&lt;br&gt;&gt; because the details are not available yet. Inst=\r\nead, I will just comment&lt;br&gt;&gt; on the various walking gait domains, becau=\r\nse the details of the&lt;br&gt;&gt; additional results you mentioned are in that =\r\ncase already available, in&lt;br&gt;&gt; newly published GECCO papers.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; FIrst of all, these are very cool results, and nice success=\r\n stories&lt;br&gt;&gt; for HyperNEAT. It&#39;s great to see that the GDS community is=\r\n continuing&lt;br&gt;&gt; the push the envelope in terms of robot locomotion, whi=\r\nch seems to be&lt;br&gt;&gt; emerging as a nice application for indirect encoding=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; However, I would simply caution against placin=\r\ng all these variations&lt;br&gt;&gt; on the walking gait task on a one-dimensiona=\r\nl spectrum of difficulty. &lt;br&gt;&gt; In our paper, we took the orignal walkin=\r\ng gait task and made only one&lt;br&gt;&gt; change (increasing the mass of the to=\r\nrso) which clearly makes the task&lt;br&gt;&gt; harder. In the papers Ken mention=\r\ned, there are other differences, e.g.,&lt;br&gt;&gt; the use of an SUPG encoding,=\r\n the use of CTRNNs, the use of a different&lt;br&gt;&gt; substrate topology, and =\r\nvarying the length of the legs.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s completely l=\r\negitimate to make these changes and they don&#39;t&lt;br&gt;&gt; detract from the res=\r\nults at all. But they are confounding factors when&lt;br&gt;&gt; it comes to comp=\r\naring HyperNEAT&#39;s performance on walking gait tasks of&lt;br&gt;&gt; different di=\r\nfficulties. Some of these changes may make the task harder&lt;br&gt;&gt; in some =\r\nways but other changes may make it easier in others ways, and so&lt;br&gt;&gt; fa=\r\nr we don&#39;t have experimental results that control for these factors.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) I hope to avoid a semantic debate about what is a &q=\r\nuot;target-based&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; FF. If you want to include what I was callin=\r\ng a &quot;regular&quot; FF in the&lt;br&gt;&gt; scope of target-based FFs, I won&#39;=\r\nt object. But my point is that,&lt;br&gt;&gt; regardless of what you call them, t=\r\nhere is an important difference&lt;br&gt;&gt; between FFs that require a single s=\r\npecific phenotype and FFs that&lt;br&gt;&gt; require only that some goal be achie=\r\nved. For the latter, there may be&lt;br&gt;&gt; many ways to skin the cat, though=\r\n in any interesting problem, good&lt;br&gt;&gt; solutions are still quite rare. T=\r\nhe distinction is important because,&lt;br&gt;&gt; while the former category is a=\r\nrguably only of theoretical interest, the&lt;br&gt;&gt; second category correspon=\r\nds to what I consider the most interesting and&lt;br&gt;&gt; important class of F=\r\nFs, because these are the FFs that naturally arise&lt;br&gt;&gt; in a very large =\r\nnumber of real-world optimization problems.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; So, u=\r\nsing your terminology, I agree it is reasonable to say&lt;br&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT&#39;s =\r\ndifficulties with fracture are probably limited to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;target-bas=\r\ned&quot; FFs. But for me, this is a potentially serious&lt;br&gt;&gt; restriction=\r\n, since target-based FFs include not just pathological FFs&lt;br&gt;&gt; but a la=\r\nrge class of real-world FFs.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding the wavele=\r\nt method, I would still definitely call this an&lt;br&gt;&gt; indirect encoding, =\r\nbut it is in some sense &quot;less indirect&quot; because it&lt;br&gt;&gt; lacks =\r\nthe compositional functions of HyperNEAT. It&#39;s a perfectly&lt;br&gt;&gt; reasonab=\r\nle hypothesis that such compositionality is advantageous in some&lt;br&gt;&gt; wa=\r\nys. However, if that&#39;s true, then we should be able to demonstrate&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nthat by finding tasks where HyperNEAT outperforms the wavelet method&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; (FYI, in the extended analysis Thomas is conducting for his master&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; thesis, we have found one variation of the line-following task where&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; this is the case). So in that sense, the wavelet method is a useful&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; baseline, which is the whole reason we introduced it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) If it&#39;s true that it takes ~6 nodes to represent fracture, t=\r\nhen I&lt;br&gt;&gt; think this a potentially important point. On regular FFs, it =\r\ncould&lt;br&gt;&gt; contribute to the difficulty of discovering fracture, since&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; representations that have only some of the necessary components may =\r\nnot&lt;br&gt;&gt; be rewarded (I think you would call this &quot;deception&quot;)=\r\n. In&lt;br&gt;&gt; Picbreeder-like tasks, we already see that fracture can evolve=\r\n anyway,&lt;br&gt;&gt; but this doesn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t do it even better if fra=\r\ncture required&lt;br&gt;&gt; fewer nodes to represent. If we think that the solut=\r\nions to many&lt;br&gt;&gt; interesting problems require fracture, then I think it=\r\n&#39;s at least&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible that one could devise a better representation =\r\nfor such problems&lt;br&gt;&gt; than the CPPNs used in HyperNEAT.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As I understand it, your approach to dealing with &quot;regular&=\r\nquot; FFs is to&lt;br&gt;&gt; reformulate them &quot;in a way that respects the n=\r\need for phenotypic&lt;br&gt;&gt; diversity and open-endedness.&quot; That&#39;s a ver=\r\ny interesting approach and I&lt;br&gt;&gt; think it has a lot of merit, but I don=\r\n&#39;t think it will solve all our&lt;br&gt;&gt; problems because it presupposes that=\r\n such a reformulation is possible&lt;br&gt;&gt; (or that the prior knowledge it r=\r\nequires is available). In some cases,&lt;br&gt;&gt; I think we are just stuck wit=\r\nh hard FFs and we need to develop better&lt;br&gt;&gt; methods to deal with them.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding the idea that &quot;an unhappy and unh=\r\nealthy indirect encoding is&lt;br&gt;&gt; one with only a strict target to which =\r\nto aspire&quot;: this is a very&lt;br&gt;&gt; intriguing hypothesis, but to me it=\r\n is only a hypothesis. I think it&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; true of existing indirect encod=\r\nings, but that for me does not in any way&lt;br&gt;&gt; rule out the possibility =\r\nof developing a different indirect encoding for&lt;br&gt;&gt; which that is not t=\r\nrue, and I think that&#39;s one thing we should be&lt;br&gt;&gt; working on. One of t=\r\nhe reasons that I&#39;m interested in indirect&lt;br&gt;&gt; encodings is that I stro=\r\nngly believe this can be done.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Shimon&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class=3DMsoNorma=\r\nl&gt;&lt;span style=3D&#39;color:white&#39;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=3DMsoNor=\r\nmal style=3D&#39;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto&#39;&gt;No virus f=\r\nound in this message.&lt;br&gt;Checked by AVG - &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.avg.com&quot;&gt;ww=\r\nw.avg.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Version: 2013.0.3345 / Virus Database: 3199/6417 - Release=\r\n Date: 06/16/13&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n------=_NextPart_000_008B_01CE6B30.2DD13290--\r\n\n"}}
