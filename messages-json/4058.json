I evolved controller networks for quadruped and=\r\n\n&gt; hexapod robots focusing on modularity.  The literature suggests that\n&gt; l=\r\neaky integrators are useful because of their richer dynamics, and\n&gt; therefo=\r\nre they use CTRNN networks to generate the oscillatory patterns\n&gt; required =\r\nfor walking.  However, confirming what Ken said, I have found\n&gt; that they a=\r\nre not necessary when joint angles are provided.  In this\n&gt; case, the requi=\r\nred oscillations with proper phase relations between\n&gt; legs are generated b=\r\ny the overall dynamics of the modular controller.\n&gt; \n&gt; The modular controll=\r\ner uses the same module for each leg, which allows\n&gt; its behavior to be exp=\r\nlained in terms of coupled cell systems, which\n&gt; are dynamical systems used=\r\n by Martin Golubitsky, Ian Stewart and\n&gt; others to model central pattern ge=\r\nnerators in animals.  In effect, the\n&gt; modular controller is a neural netwo=\r\nrk implementation of their coupled\n&gt; cell system, each cell corresponding t=\r\no a module of the network.\n&gt; Although I used it for a quadruped, they used =\r\nthe same coupled cell\n&gt; system to model biped locomotion.  So you might als=\r\no find it useful.\n&gt; The details and references are in our forthcoming GECCO=\r\n paper:\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/valsalam.gecco08=\r\n.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; The videos mentioned in the paper are available here:\n&gt; \n&gt;      h=\r\nttp://www.dailymotion.com/walkingtables\n&gt; \n&gt; Vinod\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At Wed, 14 May 2=\r\n008 16:44:03 -0000,\n&gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter C&#39;s message bri=\r\nngs up another issue that might be useful to\n&gt; &gt; Peter B:  For ambulation, =\r\nit might be more effective to use leaky\n&gt; &gt; integrator neurons than the usu=\r\nal feedforward neurons that are used in\n&gt; &gt; most ANN models.

But when joint angle=\r\ns are not provided, I do not think I\n&gt; &gt; have ever seen a regular recurrent=\r\n ANN (i.e. non-leaky or not some\n&gt; &gt; other special type of neuron) be able =\r\nto make something walk.  In\n&gt; &gt; fact, the &quot;flailing&quot; motions are often redu=\r\nced significantly by leaky\n&gt; &gt; integrator neurons.  Tyler Streeter saw this=\r\n when he worked on his\n&gt; &gt; biped with NEAT, which actually stopped flailing=\r\n after switching to\n&gt; &gt; leaky integrators.

As you are experiencing, the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; se=\r\nlection.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bec=\r\nause it does not care about the # inputs or outputs (and can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pot=\r\nentially exploit geometric regularities), but configuring\nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; su=\r\nbstrate then becomes the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming all of th=\r\nat stuff is set up well with whatever system, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelt=\r\ny search is a potentially winning approach.  Yet as you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; point \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; out there are some big questions there as well.  In fact, we\nare \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answers to these questions \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general principles might help fo=\r\nr\nnow: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not =\r\nnot need to\ncontain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every point ever visited.  Therefore, it ten=\r\nds to grow much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations.  However=\r\n, if it is indeed getting too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; big  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreaso=\r\nnable to collapse some of the archive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; points, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; although th=\r\nere is no standard method yet for how that should be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done.  But =\r\nwe have reason to believe there will be effective\nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple way=\r\ns to do that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, the issue of one individual look=\r\ning different just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effec=\r\ntivley the same behavior is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complicated.  For certain phase disa=\r\nparities, the two\nindividuals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but=\r\n it is true that at some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disparity, they may look very different=\r\n.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether that fact is actually problematic=\r\n to the novelty search \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it would simply re=\r\nward both types of behavior.  It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the pha=\r\nse difference is a result of some useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, which=\r\n could make it a stepping stone to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better.  Or,=\r\n it is possible that it is superfluous information \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; si=\r\nmply takes some extra time exploring the area around the\nphase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nhifted individual.  So it is hard to say a priori whether\nit is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major concern.  We will have better answers to such\nquestions as \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; technique is further explored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ho=\r\nwever, I agree that it would be nice to be able to say the\ntwo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nhase-shifted individuals are largely the same if that is\nindeed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwhat you want to say.  And for that, you would need a pattern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ma=\r\ntching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; more \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  There are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nertainly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available.  However, it&#39;s important to rec=\r\nognize \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident at this point that ignoring=\r\n the phase\nshift is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than taking it into consider=\r\nation, because\ntaking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means ad=\r\nding more information to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So overall I think novelty search is a very promising direction=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go for such problems, but it is still in the realm of=\r\n research \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no existing precedent), so it wi=\r\nll involve\nconsiderable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error to get it right until al=\r\nl these issues are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fleshed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out more clearly.  Ultimately,=\r\n though, if our hypothesis about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty vs. fitness is correct,=\r\n novelty search may turn out\nto be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way to get certain=\r\n highly complex types of\nbehavior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in some domains, whi=\r\nch is a sobering thought.  But if it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true, then there =\r\nis not much to do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot;\n&lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on no=\r\nvelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new approach.

As there\n=\r\nis 20 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; joints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this rig, I am providing joint posit=\r\nion and velocity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for each joint, as well as =\r\na bias, a sine-wave, the x, y,\nand z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components linear velocity=\r\n in the reference frame of the\nTori&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and fina=\r\nlly 3 variables which correspond to the vertical, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and forward orientation of the tori&#39;s head with respect to\nworld\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current experimental configuratio=\r\nn I am started out as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll control where neu=\r\nral net outputs correspond directly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; velocity; a ta=\r\nnh activation function is used to allow\npositive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neg=\r\native joint movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then remodeled the experiment to perfor=\r\nm as in the Toribash \n&gt; &gt; &gt; game;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the net will receive inputs (=\r\nand effect joint movements) only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time steps=\r\n. More importantly, I increased the amount of\noutputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 40, in order to accomodate the 4 possible \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions which can occur on a turn: holding, relaxing, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; extending, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that gives a\nstaggeringly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hu=\r\nge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Due to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nmplementation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large nets as t=\r\nhe\nstarting net \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram on the hea=\r\np. Realizing this was\na bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature s=\r\nelection and phased\npruning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, even with this, deception=\r\n seems to prevent any useful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour; the Tori will always ge=\r\nt stuck in ruts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using a python =\r\nimplementation of neat developed by Cesar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gomez\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under th=\r\ne GPL, which is available at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://code.google.com/p/neat-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This implementation is a WIP and I&#39;ve al=\r\nready done a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to incorporate the line=\r\nar genome encoding taken\nfrom the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EANT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method. I&#39;ve =\r\nalso been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in\norder to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimize wei=\r\nghts but I haven&#39;t had much success meshing this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the code yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later today whe=\r\nn I am home I will post my source files for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishes to experiment with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FINALLY, my question. The beha=\r\nviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represented\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list o=\r\nf 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nteps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proposed\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a new \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list =\r\nof discovered behaviours. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; works \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I =\r\nimagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of information to\nhold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I can compare the behaviour of 2 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; is there any compact encodi=\r\nng that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work? Since it often takes 25 000 seperate=\r\n evaluations to get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this rig=\r\nht now, theres going to\nhave to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k=\r\n seperate behaviours in some way that is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has identical behaviour to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; anot=\r\nher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later ins=\r\ntead? Just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviours it wo=\r\nuld appear that they were 100% unique,\nyet \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observer would instantly notice the similarity in how they\nact.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
