It&#39;s interesting to \nnote that Tyler Stre=\r\neter evolved his biped with no inputs!  He was \ntrying to see if a fully re=\r\ncurrent network on its own with no inputs \ncould produce a temporal walking=\r\n pattern.  Of course that makes the \nproblem quite difficult, and giving so=\r\nme feedback (i.e. inputs) makes \nthe problem easier.  However, too many inp=\r\nuts could tip the \ndifficulty back in the other direction.  In any case, my=\r\n approach to \na hard problem is always to first see if I can do the easiest=\r\n version \nof it.\n\nBy the way, about Natural Motion, most of their current s=\r\ntuff \nprobably is mainly hand-coded.  They started out using CTRNNs but \nth=\r\ney moved on the scripting and other things as Peter mentioned.  So \nthey ar=\r\ne a very difficult target to match with evolution alone.\n\nBy the way, thank=\r\ns for the encouraging words on NEAT and HyperNEAT.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It is real=\r\nly a prototype, Steve.
