What I realised was, that without\n&gt;something to compare against I couldn&#39;t determine if the technique was\n&gt;better than the more simple direct encodings out there.\n\nIt may not be better for simple problems.  I believe the judgement \ncriterion for indirect coding will be addressing harder problems, not \nworking better on the current ones.\n\n&gt;Actually, I don&#39;t know how others feel about this but I&#39;m sometimes\n&gt;slightly baffled at just how underdevelped this areas of AI research is\n&gt;and that some of this work wasn&#39;t done years ago!\n\nIt&#39;s not just this area.  I think the problem is that to publish you have \nto implement and test, and implementation is far more time concerning than \ndesign, and testing is slower still.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
