Right now I have an IGenome interface defined, \ninstances of which can of course be decoded (translated, developed or \nwhatever) into something that implements INetwork (which more generally \ncould be IPhenome I suppose). In the past there have been discussions \nabout the best place for the decoding algorithm, ideally IGenome and \nIPhenome would be totally abstract and a single abstract decoder \nalgorithm would act as the glue between the two systems. In reality a \ncustom decode algorithm is usually required, at least in the very \ngeneral case where IGenomes and IPhenomes could be absolutely anything \nyou want them to be.\n\nMy solution then is to package up IGenome and IPhenome into a higher \nlevel interface/class alongside the decoding algorithm. This new package \ncan then (potentially) be plugged into the NEAT engine in a completely \nabstract manner. My question then is, what is a good name for this \ninterface? ISupernome perhaps? :) \n\nI&#39;m doing a bit of web surfing to try and find an appropriate term from \nbiology, but I&#39;ve uncovered nothing so far. If you think about it though \nin biological terms this would be the system that consists of the \ngenome, the phenome and the cellular machinery that decodes the DNA/RNA \nand that builds proteins etc.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
