It is an example\nof machine learning. It is unsupervised learning because the program is given no\nstrategy advice whatsoever. In fact the individual ANNs don&#39;t learn anything. There is a\npopulation of ANNs, and the population learns, even though the individuals do not. The\nlearning is due to removing the worst players from the population, and allowing the\nothers to breed. This is repeated through many generations. Eventually perfect players\nof Nim are produced. The details are explained in the documentation supplied with the\npackage. \n \nThis is a bug-fix release. EvNim-1.09 fixes a bug in earlier versions. Credit to Nataraj\nChakraborty for finding the bug.\n\nEvNim was the first release from ANNEvolve, in April of 2003.\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
