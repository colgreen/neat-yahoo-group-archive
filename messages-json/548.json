I am still not able to see its value for\n&gt;&gt;scientific work.  It seems to me to be a part of\n&gt;&gt;business and web programming, where perhaps it is\n&gt;&gt;useful.  For scientific work I think it will mainly be\n&gt;&gt;a source of delay and failed projects.  Don&#39;t forget\n&gt;&gt;that learning about the various software systems you\n&gt;&gt;mentioned requires time.  \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;One of the main values to XML as I understood it was its ability to\n&gt;send data to nice graphing packages, so we can look at nice networks.\n&gt; But I am a little unsure at this point about whether this will pan\n&gt;out since it seems there is now some question on how to get good\n&gt;graphs with nodes in the right layers.  If you can&#39;t do it with XML,\n&gt;it seems to take a lot of its support away.  On the other hand, I get\n&gt;the sense a solution will turn up sooner or later, so I wouldn&#39;t count\n&gt;it out.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI understand the concerns here. When you&#39;re focused on research you \ndon&#39;t want to get bogged down with any unnecesary or extraneous coding. \nSure, the most immediate development is likely to be in the area of \nvisualisation. This is something that others are already doing and \ntherefore it&#39;s not immediately advantageous. However if good \nvisualisation and network manipulation tools do appear then at that \npoint there will be more of an incentive to output your networks as XML. \nAs Derek says, it&#39;s really not that difficult.\n\nPersonally I use XML for even very trivial I/O - because it is easy to \nuse and flexible and I know there are editors, tools, processors, etc \nout there I can use. If you&#39;re not convinced then I would just encorage \nyou to keep an eye on developments on the list.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
