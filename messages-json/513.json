The output of the NN would then be\n&gt;a bearing and \n&gt;speed the vehicle should go in in order to get to\n&gt;the target \n&gt;location, but avoiding the local obstacles. A model\n&gt;can be built for \n&gt;this task and an NN evolved for it.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t think that for desert racing the task is\n&gt;separable in the way you propose, although it would\n&gt;depend on the characteristics of the particular\n&gt;terrain.  Would you believe I have personal experience\n&gt;racing a motorcycle on the desert? :)  It&#39;s true; it\n&gt;was in California in 1961.  I used to be a dirt-biker.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat sounds like fun, consider me made envious :)\n\n&gt;But my assertion is that the vehicle spends at least\n&gt;50% of its time moving in a curved path.  Hence it is\n&gt;more appropriate that the ANN output steering and\n&gt;throttle information.  These outputs will rarely be\n&gt;constant, but rather continually changing.\n&gt;\nOk so I guess you move in curves a lot because you are constantly having \nto adjust direction to avoid oncoming onbstacles. For very large \nobstacles you will tend to follow a path of shortest distance around the \nobstacle, which is more likely to be a series of straight lines. I still \nthink my layered models could work here because each of them would \nconstantly be receiving fresh input. So if for instance there was a \nlarge circular crater we had to get around and we were due south of it \nand the target position is to the north. The local-navigation NN would \nsee that it cannot go due north and would pick the best trajectory \npossible, east or west. As we make our way around the crater it is \nconstantly adjusting the heading (towards north) so that we follow the \nedge of the crater - thus following a curved path.\n\nThinking about your comments I do now see a greater problem though. In \ncomplex terrains there is a very likely possibility that you could get \nstuck in a dead-end of sorts. To solve this problem you either need a \nrough predetermined route or perhaps some kind of maze searching \ntechnique, so e.g. if you find yourself in a dead-end you backtrack, and \ntry another route from some previously traversed point. This isn&#39;t an \narea I have knowledge of but I would imagine that this could be a tricky \nproblem for ANNs to solve alone. Us humans have the advantage in this \narea of being able to make out large obstacles such as valleys, or \ncanyon walls. We can therefore make good assumptions about where \ndead-ends are likely to be and work out good possible routes in our \nheads before we even start the engine!\n\nI still think that the task as a whole can be split of into different \nlayers. Some of those layers will be traditional software, some will be \nNN that can be evolved in the lab with simulations and some I see now \nwill be a real pain with no immediately obvious or easy solution!\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
