The logs for this product are immense.  They=\r\n log the inputs and\n&gt; outputs for every call coming in to the layer, and an=\r\nother log entry for\n&gt; every call out to the external dependencies.\n&gt;\n&gt; In t=\r\nhis iteration that just completed, I started work on a script to parse\n&gt; th=\r\nose logs and look for instances where exceptions were raised as responses\n&gt;=\r\n to requests.  The intention is to alert the team in the event that there a=\r\nre\n&gt; ever an unusual amount of activity.  I was thinking that the IDEAL thi=\r\nng\n&gt; would be if this script were to learn the definition of &quot;normal&quot; and o=\r\nnly\n&gt; alert when something truly abnormal took place.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s the thing:=\r\n  the definition of &quot;normal&quot; changes by the hour, and by\n&gt; the day.  Monday=\r\ns are typically the busiest days, and it falls off as the\n&gt; week progresses=\r\n.  Holidays can alter that.  The 1st and the 15th also seem\n&gt; to influence =\r\nit.  Around the noon hour is a peak time, and after around 5 it\n&gt; goes back=\r\n up, and then falls off again in the late evening.  The things that\n&gt; peopl=\r\ne call for also change depending on the time of day or the day of\n&gt; week.  =\r\nSo the definition of &quot;normal&quot; is highly complex.  Too complex,\n&gt; really, to=\r\n manually model it.\n&gt;\n&gt; As a first-stab at it, I just created &quot;floating thr=\r\nesholds&quot; that rise or\n&gt; fall a little bit whenever the actual is significan=\r\ntly over or under the\n&gt; current threshold.  This seems to kind of work, but=\r\n I&#39;m not satisfied with\n&gt; it.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I would like to see is an unsupervis=\r\ned learning algorithm.  I break\n&gt; down the logs into the bits and pieces ne=\r\ncessary for it to &quot;learn&quot; the\n&gt; definition of normal, and then have it tell=\r\n me how &quot;normal&quot; it thinks it\n&gt; is.  But it has to learn the definition of =\r\n&quot;normal&quot; from data that is not\n&gt; always normal.  I don&#39;t want to have to tr=\r\ny to come up with training data by\n&gt; pulling out the &quot;abnormal&quot; data.  I do=\r\nn&#39;t want to have to tell it if it is\n&gt; right or not for every one of the mi=\r\nllions of log entries per day over the\n&gt; several months of data that I woul=\r\nd need in order for it to understand what\n&gt; &quot;normal&quot; is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do any of you =\r\nhave any ideas about how Neat might be applied in a problem\n&gt; domain like t=\r\nhis?  Or are there other Machine Learning techniques that would\n&gt; be more a=\r\npplicable to this problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any feedback you might have!\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n--\n&gt; John Arrowwood\n&gt; http://www.FindingResonance.com/ - blog\n&gt; http://www.=\r\nTransformativeTherapiesInc.com/\n&gt; http://www.irie-inc.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--485b395e7ae9842e95049e8ec011\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi John,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Try taking a look at the Holt-Winters aberrant =\r\nbehavior detection algorithm in rrdtool.
