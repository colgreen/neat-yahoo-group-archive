We&#39;ll have to think about some of them for =\r\nawhile\nbut here&#39;s a few answers:\n\nThe reason why I chose to use a separate =\r\noutput for each connection\nlayer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is b=\r\necause I wanted to\nseparate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D=\r\n CPPN method,\nthen the two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;=\r\nz&#39;. \nBecause I&#39;m only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\nlay=\r\ner did some unique processing.  If there was only one output, it\nwould be h=\r\narder for the connection layers to distinguish themselves as\nthey would be =\r\ntoo dependent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs are\nnot used and the tw=\r\no layers are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\nempirical tests on which =\r\nmethod is better so I do not have any\nevidence to back my claim, but it&#39;s m=\r\ny intuition.\n\nI haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents other than Xcheckers. =\r\n I have\nhad my friends and people in the lab play against the HyperNEAT\nopp=\r\nonent and it is definitely better than all of us :-).  I would like\nto rele=\r\nase a binary version so people can play the opponents at\ndifferent generati=\r\nons and see the change in performance.\n\nOne active area of interest is to f=\r\nigure out how good a HyperNEAT\nplayer is in a global sense.  In Chellapilla=\r\n & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\nplayed human opponents in checkers on MSN Gaming Zon=\r\ne online and got\nan expert rating on that game server.  The problem with th=\r\nis is that\nit is very time consuming to play games by hand. It would not be=\r\n\nfeasible for me to test several individuals in this way.\n\nI have experimen=\r\nted with coevolution, but I need to solve the\naforementioned problem before=\r\n I can say anything about the performance\nof the evolved individuals.\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 11,=\r\n 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased=\r\n to share with you new results with\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appe=\r\nar in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008=\r\n), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt; &gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machin=\r\ne Learning.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI have a few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt; =\r\n* Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural to me?\n&gt; * =\r\nWas more than one CPPN configuration tried?
