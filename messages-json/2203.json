First, is this an\nANJI-specific question?  Which software are you using?  I just want to\nmake sure since I think there is an error in the calculations you are\nciting.  More below...\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; Whilst calculating the number of offspring for a valid (i.e. non\n&gt; extinct and size &gt; 0) specie, the count returns 0.  This is\n&gt; particularly prevalent in large species where the adjusted fitness\n&gt; becomes quite small comapared with the rest of the other, and\nusually\n&gt; much less populous, species. \n&gt; \n&gt; This becomes even more marked if I boost young species fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I understand, the offspring is calculated as follows.\n&gt; \n&gt; (av adjusted specie fitness) / (total of all species av adjusted\n&gt; fitnesses) * Population size.\n&gt; \n\nThis formula looks wrong.  It turns out there are a number of ways to\nexpress the number of offspring (all being mathematically equivalent\nformulations), but the specifics are crucial.  And this looks like it\nhas some specifics wrong.  The formula should be:\n\nOffspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / Total_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss)\n* PopulationSize \n\nNote that &quot;adjusted&quot; never comes into it.  The presence of the word\n&quot;adjusted&quot; in your formulation implies to me that you may be\ndouble-adjusting.  The adjustments come in when you are modifying\nfitnesses on a per-organism basis and assigning offspring on a\nper-organism basis.  In other words, each organism has its fitness\ndivided by the total number of individuals in its species.  But if you\nthen SUM all those adjusted fitness together, what do you get?  You\nget AverageSpeciesFitness, i.e. the simple average *unadjusted*\nfitness of all the organisms in the species.   \n\nThe point is this:  either you adjust the fitnesses of individuals and\nthen sum those adjusted fitnesses (as I do in my version of NEAT), or\nyou just take the average fitness of the species.  You do *not* do\nboth.\n\nNote also that the denominator is the sum of all the average species\nfitnesses.  No adjustment in that part either.\n\nThe problem boils down to the fact that there are two ways to express\noffspring assigned in fitness sharing as it&#39;s done in NEAT: on a\nper-species or per-individual basis.  Equations in my papers are\nusually expressed per-offspring.  It&#39;s easier to understand\nintuitively on a per-offspring basis because in those equations you\ncan see how the individual&#39;s fitness is being reduced according to its\nspecies size.  In other words the fitness of any individual matters\nless towards how many offspring the species gets the more individuals\nare in that species.  Averaging without adjusting, however, is just a\ndifferent way to formulate the same concept in which you don&#39;t diretly\nsee the reduction according to species size.\n\n&gt; For example, imagine we have 3 species. Specie_1 has 3 members av\nraw\n&gt; fitness 0.85, Specie_2 has 2 members av raw fitness 0.82 and\nSpecie_3\n&gt; has 145 members with av raw fitness 0f 0.9.\n&gt; \n&gt; Specie_1(adj) = 0.85/3 = 0.28333\n&gt; Specie_2(adj) = 0.82/2 = 0.41\n&gt; Specie_3(adj) = 0.9/145 = 0.006\n&gt; \n&gt; Specie_1 then generates 61 offspring\n&gt; Specie_2 then generates 87 offspring\n&gt; Specie_3 then generates 2 offspring\n&gt; \n\nAgain, this doesn&#39;t make sense.  If 0.9 is the average fitness of\nspecies 3 then it should be getting over 1/3rd of the offspring.  if a\nsystem is showing this behavior there may be a bug in the speciation\ncode.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
