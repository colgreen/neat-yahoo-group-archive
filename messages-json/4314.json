Small changes=\r\n in the weights of the Perceptron are likely to produce small changes on th=\r\ne patterns expressed by the system. I think that the search landscape could=\r\n  be quite smooth. Also, I might argue that with CPPN, frontiers depends on=\r\n a delicate balance of it links weights... I&#39;m pretty sure that small pertu=\r\nrbations on complicated CPPNs generate pretty large change in the pattern i=\r\nt outputs.\n\nReaction-diffusion are diffusions of chemicals coupled with rea=\r\nctions of those chemicals. They are expressed as partial differential equat=\r\nions, wich are integrated over a domain : usually, the unit square, but a d=\r\nisc, a sphere or whatever shape. Indeed, Greg Turk did reaction-diffusions =\r\non horses, see &quot;Generating Textures on Arbitrary Surfaces Using Reaction-Di=\r\nffusion&quot;. To integrate a differential equations over a domain, you have to =\r\nspecify what happens at the border of the domain. Usually, on a square, peo=\r\nple considers that &#39;left&#39; is wrapped with &#39;right&#39;, &#39;top&#39; with &#39;bottom&#39;, whi=\r\nch explains the &quot;wallpaper&quot; look... But you might consider that outside the=\r\n square, chemicals concentration are just always 0. Chemicals are produced =\r\nwithin the square and dissipate to the void at the square edge... No more w=\r\nrapping, no more perfect tiling, thus no more &quot;wallpaper&quot; look.\n\nAlso, gene=\r\nrating coordinate systems with pure local interactions is pretty easy. In m=\r\ny soon-finished Phd dissertation, I show a cellular automaton that generate=\r\ns a Cartesian coordinate system. If the states of the cells are perturbed, =\r\nthe cells restore the coordinate system (with a theoretical warranty of it)=\r\n. A spherical coordinate system , resilient to noise in it states, is also =\r\npretty easy to setup (diffusion of a single chemical, with &#39;0&#39; border condi=\r\ntions). No need to provide coordinates of each cells. By a rather optimisti=\r\nc leap, we can hope that the optimizer (evolutionary stuffs in our case) wi=\r\nll find the coordinate system that suit best for the problem.\n\nRegards,\nAle=\r\nxandre Devert\n\n--- En date de : Jeu 11.9.08, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@cs.u=\r\ntexas.edu&gt; a =E9crit :\nDe: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\nObjet: =\r\nRe : [neat] Re: An argument in favor of developmental processes?\n=C0: neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nDate: Jeudi 11 Septembre 2008, 12h02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n       =\r\n     To follow the details of the argument, I think the issue is not so\n\nmu=\r\nch with whether or not such systems can build a sharp frontier but\n\nwith th=\r\ne structure of the search space of the shapes bounded by such\n\nfrontiers.  =\r\nThat is, being able to build a frontier in principle is\n\nnot equivalent to =\r\nbeing able to discover the particular frontier shape\n\nthat you want.  Since=\r\n the shape of the frontier is a function of the\n\nchemical concentrations in=\r\n the cells, as you point out, then the shape\n\nultimately depends on a delic=\r\nate balancing act of chemical\n\ndistributions through reactions, diffusions,=\r\n signaling, or whatever\n\nmechanisms are in a particular model that ultimate=\r\nly distribute\n\nchemical through the cells in the system.  The search space =\r\ninduced by\n\nthis complex dynamical system may or may not be nicely structur=\r\ned.\n\n\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by &quot;all 0 borders?&quot;  I am not\n=\r\n\nsure I understand the idea for using 0&#39;s to move from wallpaper to\n\ndiscre=\r\nte objects.\n\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. com, Alexandre Devert &lt;marma=\r\nkoide@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;nitpicking mode on&gt;\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think that the cap=\r\nacity to build sharp frontiers is a real\n\nissue.

You\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; make a g=\r\nood point- my statement was too broad, in part because\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &quot;cellular gro=\r\nwth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; potentially refer to =\r\nmany types of systems.  \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Just to clarify my statement, I was=\r\n responding the line of discussion\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; with Peter about encodings that a=\r\nctually create distinct bodily shapes\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; that are self-contained and ha=\r\nve clear structural boundaries (which\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; reaction-diffusion systems ten=\r\nd not to produce; rather they produce\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; wallpaper-like patterns).  Oft=\r\nen when growth-based models are used to\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; define actual bodies with di=\r\nstinct borders, they are studied in the\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; context of blobs with a part=\r\nicular focus on how the blob knows when to\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; stop growing so that a bo=\r\nrder shape can be created.
