I side of my job is as &quot;Engineer Consultant&quot;\n(designing systems for the industry) the other side is &quot;Business Consultant&quot;\n(improving organization performance).\n\n   I&#39;ve a lot interest in NEAT because its ability to find simple solutions,\nits reduction of searching space through  complexification,  its ability to\nkeep several possibilities open in the solution space through speciation.\n\nSome of my thoughts about ANNs:\n\n-  Now I&#39;m studying  the Meta-learning or the process where the systems\nlearn to learn, I think the future are in that kind of systems, why?:\n\n- I think an &lt;&lt;Intelligent&gt;&gt; Systems is such a system that not only is able\nto solve a task, as well it is able to use all information it has learned\nuntil a time to accelerate its learning speed rate in the immediate future.\nIn this way I&#39;ve seen some success experiment with NEAT and &#39;Go&#39; game\n(successive tasks).\n\n- But, what is that experience?. They are not only useful parts to be\nreused; as well they are modifications in ANN structure searching space. To\nsay: if exist an ANN Space of Solutions (N) that is projected in the\nSolution Space (inputs/outputs) (S) and there are n tasks (r1, r2.rn) that\nmy system has been able to solve, my system must not be only a mix of\nNeurons in the N space and having the ability to solve such all tasks (&lt;=n).\nMy systems must be able to deform dynamically the searching space (inside N)\nusing the previous learned information to be able to find quickly new\nsolutions for task r_n+1 (Obviously if such task has a relationship with\nprevious tasks).\n\n- So, what have to change dynamically in a GA to look for the solutions in\nthe right places?.... Mutation and Crossover.  Imagine this yahoo group is a\nGA where we are &quot;solutions&quot;, everybody has his own knowledge about ANNs.\nEach message we send is a &quot;crossover&quot; process where we are sharing\nexperience and knowledge, however we don&#39;t a fix or random crossover, we are\nintelligent &quot;solutions&quot; and thus, we are able to incorporate to our\nknowledge the new part, we do a &quot;intelligent crossover&quot; or &quot;probabilistic\ncrossover&quot; based in the new information and in our previous experience,\nbesides when our solution &quot;mutates&quot; because we try something new in a ANN,\nwe try to maximize our probability to get a success result. (Normally in an\nintuitive/probabilistic way).\n\n- I think indirect encoding as DNA is a way to reduce the searching  space,\nbut DNA doesn&#39;t work as puzzle book to build life. DNA has evolves too. It\nhas got through evolution mechanisms to manage other part of DNA and\nprobably to mutate in the right way depending of natural selection\ncompetitiveness; in fact, recent studies have demonstrated that since the\nbeginning of evolution there were immutable DNA pieces sharing by all alive\nbeings. Probably under that pieces are the secret mechanism to evolve in a\nfast way.\n\nSo...my actual studies are about  &quot;Indirect encoding&quot;: not only encoding ANN\nstructures (I think to use it only  is a lost war because GAs need something\nmore to deal with such complex searching spaces), as well encoding a\ngenotype able to modifying dynamically searching space and managing old\nuseful parts (Metalearning).\n\nregards\n\n Germ�n Bravo.\n\n\n"}}
