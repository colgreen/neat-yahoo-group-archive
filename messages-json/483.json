Or are you going to\n&gt;&gt;write your own, or perhaps use another Java version of NEAT?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m thinking hybrid.  I want to do a more passive system, like SETI@home, \n&gt;where clients ping the server to get work to do.  That way, I can put \n&gt;computers to work that are outside my firewall.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n[Sound of me climbing onto soapbox]\n\nThe .Net framework and associated languages are also a possibility for \nmulti-platform stuff thanks to the Mono project, see \nhttp://www.go-mono.com/ for more info. If you have a windoze system you \nmight be able to compile any java stuff in J# (with freely available \nSharpDevelop) and then run it on Linux with the aid of Mono.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
