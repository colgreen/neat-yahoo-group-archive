I&#39;d like to be able to define them intuitively, e.=\r\ng., in some XML format (a GUI is probably asking too much). I&#39;ll also want =\r\nto  display them visually.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there an accepted (XML) format f=\r\nor substrate (or general NN) definitions? With a (C++) parser?

I&#39;ve been debating whether or not to make a releas=\r\ned version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In it&#39;s current state, the sheets are layed out on pla=\r\nnes and the camera can rotate and move around the substrates.  The node col=\r\nors represent activation levels, but when you mouse over a node, the colors=\r\n change to represent the connection weights emanating from the focused node=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is this the kind of thing you had in mind?  If there is a demand=\r\n for this app, I can package it with the next HyperNEAT C++ release.  If so=\r\n, is there anything that you&#39;d want the app to do that I haven&#39;t mentioned?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jason G.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
