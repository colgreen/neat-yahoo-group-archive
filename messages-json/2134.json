How are parents selected?\n\nRight.  This is where we run into terminology problems.  Every item in the \nheap has a h-parent.  This is unrelated to breeding.\n\nYou can select individuals for breading in whatever manner you wish, it \nisn&#39;t really a concern of the heap, although the obvious analogy to \nstandard NEAT would be:\n\n1) in species breeding -&gt; select another individual from the line between \nthe first parent and the leaf-node it was introduced at\n\n2) close species breeding -&gt; select another individual from anywhere in the \ntree below the first parent\n\n3) out species breeding -&gt; select another individual from anywhere else in \nthe heap\n\n&gt;   Is it somehow\n&gt;based probabalistically on how high up the tree they are?  And with\n&gt;whom are they allowed to mate?\n\nNot sure what you are asking here.  I probably need to draw some more \nspecific pictures to show how it fits together.\n\n&gt;   How would this be applied in a\n&gt;generational system?  Or is it not meant to be generational, i.e.\n&gt;more of a steady state idea?\n\nSteady state, I tend to assume that when I&#39;m thinking these things through, \neven thought it&#39;s not traditional NEAT.\n\n&gt;   Also when fitness is absolute (i.e.\n&gt;not just a comparison between two individuals) how does that affect\n&gt;your heap organization?\n\nIt doesn&#39;t, as long as you can compare the fitness of two individuals you \nare OK.\n\n&gt;   Would individuals pop up to the top e.g. if\n&gt;they have the max fitness?  (but that would then loose the kinship-\n&gt;tracking aspect to some extent)\n\nYes and no.\n\nLet me try to say it differently.\n\n1) a heap is partially sorted.  This means that all h-parents are fitter \nthan their children, but the there is no relationship between the fitness \nof h-siblings (none of these relations are genetic).\n\n2) because no comparison has been done between siblings, they are not in \ncompetition, and therefor represent different species\n\n3) any new individual is introduced at a leaf-node and immediately moves up \nfrom that node for as long as its fitness is higher than its parents\n\n4) thus the population leader is at the top of the tree\n\n5) by remembering the route an individual took on its way up the tree \n(which requires only remembering what leaf-node it started at) we can \nintroduce any g-children (genetic children) it has at the same point, thus \navoiding contaminating another species\n\n6) but to allow fit species to _slowly_ replace unfit ones, we can drop a \nsmall proportion of children on the wrong leaves, or else rely on \nout-species breeding to do this\n\n&gt;As I understand it presently, you have a method for organizing and\n&gt;storing relationship based on some combination of kinship and\n&gt;fitness ranking.\n\nNo, or rather yes.  The heap is organized only on fitness, but by adding \nchildren at the right place, we keep them competing with only their close \nrelatives.\n\n&gt;   It does seem possible this could be used in a\n&gt;useful manner, but one reason I might not be a big fan of it is that\n&gt;is does away with historical markings without substituting an\n&gt;equally powerful compatibility measure.\n\nNo.  I didn&#39;t say anything about innovation-numbers.  I woudl regard this \nas a drop-in replacement for purely the speciation part of \nNEAT.  Innovation remains as it is.\n\n&gt;   I agree it&#39;s an interesting\n&gt;idea to keep track of kinship, but if you literally know the\n&gt;historical origin of every gene in the system I am not sure why you\n&gt;would not organize based on that knowledge, which is more precise\n&gt;than kinship?  (Also, kinship-based organization explicitly\n&gt;encourages inbreeding)\n&gt;\n&gt;Aside from any of my critique, this is perhaps a new speciation\n&gt;method that has not been thought of before and probably merits some\n&gt;attention in terms of how it compares with other ones out there.\n&gt;\n&gt;A little off-topic from this proposal, I am not sure that doing away\n&gt;with aspects of speciation is really a good thing.  To me, the fact\n&gt;that you can control the sizes and number of clusters in your\n&gt;population is a good thing and not a bad thing.  It&#39;s also good that\n&gt;you can control the extent to which they interbreed.  Obviously this\n&gt;is an open empirical question, but my instinct is not to assume that\n&gt;there is anything arbitrary the idea of separating a population into\n&gt;compatibility groupings.  That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s the best method; we\n&gt;need comparisons for that.  Just that it&#39;s not clear on the face of\n&gt;it that there is something wrong with it.\n\nAs a (former) biologist of sorts, I don&#39;t like imposing speciation \nprecisely because in nature it arises naturally rather than being imposed.\n\nI&#39;m not saying imitate nature for imitation&#39;s sake.  I&#39;m saying more that \nthe correct comparison between maintained diversity in a simulation and \nmaintained-diversity in nature is not speciation but the diversity of \nalleles in a single species.  I&#39;m just trying to structure a single species \nso that it maintains diversity, without using nature&#39;s strategy of 2E10 \nindividuals...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n"}}
