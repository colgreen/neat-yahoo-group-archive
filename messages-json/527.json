I&#39;m not coming only from an ANN angle, but I&#39;m very interested \nin approaches for combining multiple entities of any evolving/learning type \n(ANN, GP, GA, ...) into coherent wholes.\n\n\tIt&#39;s a complex area and not hugely reported in the existing literature.\n\n\tI&#39;ve found two existing approaches exist:\n\n1) those variations on the &quot;classifier system&quot; approach which use the \noutput form the whole population.  Typically this seems to be achieved by \nletting the fittest individual process all those cases it can before \npassing any remaining cases to the next fittest.  Obviously for \nclassification you can do this because the discrete &quot;cases&quot; are separate \nand can be seen to be handled or not.  This is harder to apply to other \nscenarios (hence your need for &quot;confidence&quot;).  It&#39;s also necessary to be \nable to assess an individual in the absence of the others, which also may \nnot apply for a complex situation.\n\n2) The &quot;Hayek&quot; approach of Eric Baum \n(http://www.whatisthought.com/eric.html).  This uses economics to control \nthe confidence in each individual.  Individuals in each tick, analyse the \nsituation and bid an amount of money to be the dominant controller (Eric \nphrases this &quot;bidding to own the world&quot;).  The winner pays its bid to the \nprevious successful bidder (&quot;buying the world form the previous owner&quot;, \nwhich may be itself) and then takes control for one tick.  Any improvement \nin the value of the world after the individual&#39;s actions are credited to \nit, as well as the money from the individual buying control in the next tick.\n\nThis system works because it forces individuals to evolve an accurate \nmeasure of their own confidence.  Any individual which overbids will make a \nloss, go bankrupt and be killed.  Any which underbids will never get \ncontrol, make no profit, and the systems often include a fixed or \nsize-related &quot;tax&quot; which in time bankrupts these individuals as well.\n\n--\n\nI&#39;m cautiously keen on the Hayek approach, although it has at least one \npretty serious weakness: in a generation, a mutant high-bidding individual \ncan grab control and deflect the whole system from profitability (say by \nramming a boulder head-on).  Existing Hayek implementations handle this \nbecause any runs in which the system as a whole is unprofitable are taken \nback and the offending individual eliminated (or to put it another way, \ndeals involving individuals who &quot;default&quot; on their bids are unwound back to \na previous state).  This is a fine strategy as long as the world \n(simulation) the system lives in is cheap (because it has to be unwound as \nwell) but impractical for (i) complex simulations, (ii) simulations \ninhabited by more than one Hayek system, or (iii) physically implemented \nworlds (like real motorbikes in real deserts, for example).\n\nBut you can easily imagine using Hayek in this situation, feeding money \ninto the system for either forwards motion or reaching the end (either has \nbeen seen to work).  Giving each ANN an output for bid (confidence) in \naddition to its control outputs.  And there would be no concerns with using \nseveral different types of ANN in the population...\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
