If you&#39;re training on a long period of\nprice data then you should probably inflation adjust the prices, e.g.\nyahoo finance has daily prices for the S&P 500 going back 50 years,\nthe dow goes back even further. Thus when you calculate price deltas\nfor each day a delta from 1950 will be in the same units as for the\npesent day (e.g. 2009 dollars). Now because the price delta\ndistribution has fat tails (more big daily changes than a gaussion\ndistribution) if you normalize the deltas you will compress the bulk\nof daily prices changes into a very small value range, to overcome\nthis I would consider using Log(delta), and by all means normalize to\n[-1,1] after taking the log.\n\nI&#39;ve not tried the sliding window approach but it sounds viable, it\nalso sounds like a good candiate for HyperNEAT because (A) there are a\nlarge number of inputs and (B) the existence of a geometric\nrelationship between the inputs, albeit in time rather than space.\n\nI have a hypothesis that such an approach would generate profitable\nstrategies for historic data (e.g. train against 1950-60 and test\nagainst 1960-70), but that with the advent of algorithmic and internet\ntrading market dynamics are conitunally shifting such that an\nalgorithm that is profitable today may not be profitable tomorrow.\nE.g. you may have heard the rumours about Goldman Sachs gaming the\nsystem and being thrown off the NYSE electronic exchange - if true\nthen the removal of such a large market participant will have altered\nmarket dynamics to some degree.\n\nThere is at least one historic pricing anomaly that I&#39;m aware of that\ncould have been used to make money had you known about it, that being\nthe mispricing of options using the black-scholes formula from about\nthe mid 1970&#39;s until around the time of the LTCM collapse (&#39;98 I\nthink). An AI might well pick up on the discrepancy, but for that\nyou&#39;d need option pricing data which generally costs a lot of money -\nand some knowledge of option pricing of course.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
