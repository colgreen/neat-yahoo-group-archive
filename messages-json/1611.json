That&#39;s a really good summary and introduction to fixed-point \n&gt;techniques.\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks. Actually I intended to credit your name - I&#39;ll edit the doc later.\n\n&gt;The speed is about the same, which is about what we expected...\n&gt;\n&gt;...but as you say, for non-fpu cpus it will make a big difference.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I wasn&#39;t expecting the figures to be quite so close, in fact I&#39;m \nimpressed that the floating point ops occur at the same speed as integer \nones. Although there may be slighly more integer ops involved, so \nperhaps they are bit faster, still impressive though.\n\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;You lost a &quot;]&quot; in this somewhere....\n&gt;\n&gt;outputSignal = LookUpTable[(inputSignal &gt;&gt; 16) + 0x8000);\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk.\n\n&gt;w.r.t this bit\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;The results for Simple-OCR were similar, the best fitness was seen to rise \n&gt;but at a slower rate than is normally observed with the floating point \n&gt;network. It&#39;s worth noting that the NEAT genome used for these experiments \n&gt;was also still using floating point numbers and therefore a great many fine \n&gt;weight adjustments within a genome will actually have no effect in the \n&gt;resulting network since the float values have a higher level of precision \n&gt;than the integer based system in use, therefore it would probably be \n&gt;beneficial to switch the genomes over integers as well if you were actually \n&gt;looking to evolve integer based networks.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Could you not just up the minimum weight change until it definitely made a \n&gt;difference to the fixed point?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, fair point. I&#39;ll add that to the doc.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
