In the following, =\r\nI regard quantitative research as a discipline in which existing concepts a=\r\nnd methods are used as scientific tools which makes results produced under =\r\nthe same concepts and methods quantitatively comparable to each other. On t=\r\nhe contrary, qualitative research refers to finding new concepts and method=\r\ns that set a new starting point / new perspective for further research (a b=\r\nit like objective search vs. novelty search).\n\nI agree with all of you that=\r\n qualitative research is equally important as quantitative research. But I =\r\nam not sure whether reviewers with a strong focus on quantitative results (=\r\nlike in Jeff&#39;s case) are the only problem.\n\nGenerally speaking, I think tha=\r\nt most lectures just teach us some well accepted concepts and methods in wh=\r\nich research has been made and then remain within these boundaries and revi=\r\new the current state of research. This is good for learning the technical s=\r\nkills to make quantitative research. But you don&#39;t become sensitive for the=\r\n concepts themselves.\n\nI think most researchers simply don&#39;t learn the nece=\r\nssary technical skills for qualitative research in AI. It is a much tougher=\r\n task to identify the concepts / implicit assumptions behind a proposed alg=\r\norithm, to determine which concept from biology has been adopted than just =\r\ncalculating some numbers and p-values. Moreover, it is even harder to find =\r\nthe right focus for your own paper and to explain in a clear and precise ma=\r\nnner the new perspective that a proposed algorithm provides. We simply rece=\r\nive no training in depicting and delineating different perspectives on the =\r\nsame issue from each other using human language. \n\nI think this is the reas=\r\non why people sometimes like to write about their cool looking results rath=\r\ner than explaining more generally how the algorithm differs from existing a=\r\npproaches. On the contrary, I think that neuroscientists and related resear=\r\nchers should ask them self much more whether the existing categories we hav=\r\ne are already appropriate to study and understand natural neural networks (=\r\nand ultimately the human brain). \n\nMy opinion is therefore: qualitative res=\r\nearch needs more acceptance in the reviewing process BUT researchers also n=\r\need to learn more about the technical skills that are required to perform q=\r\nualitative research and to explain the results to others. \n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
