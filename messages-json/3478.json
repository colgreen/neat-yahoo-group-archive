The technology behind Picbreeder is a novel NEA=\r\nT-based Genetic \nArt applet that is integrated into a massive growing &quot;tree=\r\n of life&quot; \nthat never ends. Anyone who evolves a picture they like can publ=\r\nish \nit to the world and thereby permanently add their creations to the \nev=\r\ner-expanding tree of life.\n\nWhat makes Picbreeder particularly powerful and=\r\n unique is that you \ncan *branch* from the published work of any other user=\r\n that has come \nbefore.  In other words, you do not have to begin from scra=\r\ntch.  \nInstead, for example, if you want to a evolve a face, you can branch=\r\n \nfrom one of the many published faces and explore an infinite number \nof v=\r\nariations from that starting point.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing is that we do =\r\nnot know what is possible to \nevolve.  As lineages are built upon lineages,=\r\n complexification in \nNEAT means that images can theoretically become more =\r\nand more \ncomplex.  Thus, in theory, anything is possible.  In this sense \n=\r\nPicbreeder&#39;s users are pioneers, exploring collectively a space that \nhas n=\r\never been exhaustively explored and discovering together \ncreations that no=\r\n one of us could have discovered alone.\n\nI hope that you will decide to joi=\r\nn us on Picbreeder as we explore \nthis space.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
