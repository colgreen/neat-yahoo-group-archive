His version was pretty much feature-complete as of last  \nsummer, though I haven&#39;t heard anything from him in a while.\n\nI&#39;ve personally coded up a very general NEAT framework in python, but  \nI never got around to adding the module for neural networks. My goal  \nwas basically to abstract away all of the GA code so I could focus on  \ndifferent representations (of which I&#39;ve written several, including a  \ncomplexifying GRN, which is similar to NEAT). Anyway if you&#39;re  \ninterested, the code is fairly well commented (compared to my last  \nendeavor :P), and I have stubs completed for adding the remaining  \nNEAT bits as a representation, so basically all you&#39;d have to do is  \ncode up the neural network side. I could also write up a blurb about  \nhow to add a new representation.\n\nAnyway message me if you&#39;re interested; it might be easier than  \nstarting from scratch.\n\n-- Joe\n\nOn Jul 5, 2005, at 5:27 PM, Thomas B wrote:\n\n&gt; I came across mention of Karl Lewin and his work, but his links such\n&gt; as http://www.wooleyrhino.com/pyn.html are down.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas B&quot; &lt;tomb@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking for NEAT implemented in Python.
