The fog is now beginning to lift.\n\nYes I do intend on making my version of NEAT available.  It is part of\na much larger AI library so I need to strip out any irrelevant code\netc.  I&#39;ve just moved house, so it may take a few weeks.  I have no\npersonal web page, would it be ok to host it on your site?\n\nMy version of NEAT is in 2 parts.  The training and the testing/using.\n Both read in a csv file of data and process it accordingly.\n\nIf anyone is interested in an early version of it, let me know and I&#39;l\nl send them the whole kit.  There is no docs with it currently, so I\nwill put some rudimentary instructions in with any emails.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Matt, fitness sharing is meant to penalize a species the larger \n&gt; it gets.  Of course, species only tend to get very large if they \n&gt; have high fitness, which is what fitness sharing keeps in check.  If \n&gt; a species gets too large, it won&#39;t be able to keep expanding, \n&gt; thereby allowing other species a chance to explout their own niches.\n&gt; \n&gt; But you are right that the correct fitness value to use for \n&gt; identifying the champion is the *raw* fitness.  Once fitness is \n&gt; adjusted, it&#39;s just an internal number used by NEAT to assign \n&gt; offspring.  It is no longer useful for knowing who was the objective \n&gt; best.  So use unadjusted (raw) fitness for determining the champion.\n&gt; \n&gt; It should be noted that there are equivalent formulas for fitness \n&gt; sharing that involve a slightly different process than I used in my \n&gt; version of NEAT (and other version of NEAT may be based on how I did \n&gt; it).  These alternative forumulations actually do exactly the same \n&gt; thing, but they just involve a different set of steps.  You can \n&gt; refer to the question, &quot;Is there another way to do fitness sharing?&quot; \n&gt; in the NEAT FAQs on the NEAT Users Page at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n&gt; \n&gt; This question answers a slightly different question, but it notes \n&gt; that the following formula is equivalent to adjusting fitnesses and \n&gt; doing what I did in my NEAT code, even though there is no adjustment \n&gt; step:\n&gt; \n&gt; Offspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / \n&gt; Total_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss) * PopulationSize \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, do you plan to open your version of NEAT to the public?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just a quick intro to myself.  I have been &#39;playing&#39; around with \n&gt; NN&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; and GA for a few years now and came accross NEAT through Mat\n&gt; &gt; Buckland&#39;s excellent book.  I have implemented my own version (as\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s what I am good at) in Java.  Been reading the posts for the\n&gt; &gt; last few days and there is obviously a wealth of talent and\n&gt; &gt; information out there, hopefully I can use it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am using NEAT to predict FTSE 100 movement and weather \n&gt; forecasting.\n&gt; &gt;  I have tested my implementation with XOR and it works just fine. \n&gt; &gt; Obviously, the domain(s) that interest me are somewhat more \n&gt; complex.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My biggest confusion is about speciation.  I understand the\n&gt; &gt; compatability metric, but what I haven&#39;t grasped is the role of\n&gt; &gt; fitness sharing and its effect on a specie/population.  Ken&#39;s paper\n&gt; &gt; says that the fitness is reduced by the size of the specie.  Is \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; meant to be a penalty to more populous species?  My fitness \n&gt; function\n&gt; &gt; currently tends towards zero for more fit memebers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I save (to disc) the best from each genration it is important \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; I save the correct best member.  i.e. the one with the best raw\n&gt; &gt; fitness or the one with the best shared fitness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry if this is rambling, but I want to clear this in my own mind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Matt\n\n\n\n"}}
