The fitness function can&#39;t exactly be defined, since they=\r\n \ncan be evolved towards some tasks like &quot;go there&quot; or something. I \nwant t=\r\no briefly describe the details behind it. \n\nThe same network is used for bo=\r\nth the body and the nervous system of \nthe creature. First the body is buil=\r\nt by a spatial CPPN and converted \nto a mass-spring model. There are severa=\r\nl tissues (the CPPN outputs \ntissue type instead of level of expression). O=\r\nne type of tissue is a \nsensor tissue, which excites upon collision. Anothe=\r\nr type of tissue \nis a muscle tissue, which contracts the springs when exci=\r\nted. Like a \nregular bilogical muscle. \n\nThe key point is, that after the s=\r\npatial CPPN builds the body, the \nsame CPPN is then used for HyperNEAT (add=\r\nitional outputs, though), to \nevolve the connectivity of the neural network=\r\n controlling the body. \nInputs are located on sensor tissue only. Outputs a=\r\nre located on \nmuscle tissue. Hidden nodes are located on the remaining tis=\r\nsue. This \nis essentially evolving both the substrate and the connectivity =\r\nof \nthe network, but in a meaningful way, because of the geometry and the \n=\r\nsimulated 2D physics space. \n\nThe simulation is like this - when the sensor=\r\n tissue is excited by \nsome collision, this also plugs 1.0 into the associa=\r\nted HyperNEAT&#39;s \nnetwork&#39;s inputs. When the outputs activation level exceed=\r\ns some \ntreshold, the associated springs on the muscle tissue are contracte=\r\nd. \n\nI believe that using the same network for both pusposes (spatial and \n=\r\nconnective) is better than using different networks. Do you think \nthis in =\r\ngeneral is a good idea? \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
