In our paper, we reported the\n&gt; following stats for\n&gt; complexifying NEAT, averaged over 100 runs:\n&gt; \n&gt; Average Generations: 44.08\n&gt; Average Hidden Nodes:  3.12 \n&gt; Average Connections:  11.72 \n&gt; \n&gt; So your implementation seems to perform a bit better\n&gt; than ours on XOR.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Ken&#39;s original results for XOR were:\n&gt; \n&gt; Average Generations: 32\n&gt; Average Hidden Nodes:  2.35 \n&gt; Average Connections:  7.48 \n&gt; \n&gt; Since there are so many variables, it&#39;s difficult to\n&gt; tell how to\n&gt; optimize.  As Ken has pointed out before, elitism\n&gt; can make a\n&gt; significant difference in performance, depending on\n&gt; how (or whether)\n&gt; you&#39;re using it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not really sure how the different\n&gt; implementations compare.  I\n&gt; haven&#39;t seen such stats on JNEAT or DELPHI NEAT or\n&gt; any of the others. \n&gt; Though we did mess around a bit with JNEAT and just\n&gt; accepting the\n&gt; default parameters for XOR, it did seem to produce\n&gt; larger-than-optimal\n&gt; networks most of the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it was a learning exercise, I guess I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; worry too much about\n&gt; it.  Though it might be interesting to see if you\n&gt; can optimize it\n&gt; further, and figure out what exactly you had to\n&gt; tweak or change to do\n&gt; so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
