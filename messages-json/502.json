Some of these \nvehicles are quite large and heavy and the competition required them to \nmove at an average of 25mph to complete the course within the alloted \ntime frame. Therefore any NN in the real world would be needing to make \ndecisions based on a point just ahead of the vehicle NOT the current \nposition.  One of the vehicles veers towards the cameraman (safely \nbehind a concrete barrier) and then brakes abruptly just before the \nbarrier - the AI displayed good knowledge of the vehicle&#39;s breaking \ndistance! (or perhaps just luck)\n\nI tend to think that this kind of problem can be decomposed into \ndistinct layered functions:\n\n1) GPS tells us the distance and brearing of the destination point. High \nlevel code tells next layer down these variables. Simple traditional bit \nof software.\n2) Analysing that model and generating high level control decisions.\n3) Converting high level navigation decsisions into control signals that \ndrive the steering and power.\n\n2 & 3 then can be broken down into:\n\n1) Converting sensor input into an internal model/representation of the \nreal world.\n2) Anaylsis of local terrain results in a local high-level navigation \ndecision - e.g. layer 1 says go north, but there is a wall in the way, \nlayer 2 analysis therefore would decide to go east.\n3) Convert layer 2 output into vehicle control signals.\n\n\nIt&#39;s my opinion that the sort of simplified models we tend to use for \nNEAT type projects are ideally suited to evolving NN based controllers \nthat can be used for the high level control decisions AND the very low \nlevel stuff such as converting the local navigation task into control \nsignals to drive the vehicle. The stuff in between such as building of \nthe physical world model from sensor data is more suited to traditional \nsoftware development, though it&#39;s also worth a try.\n\nEach of these tasks on it&#39;s own is (hopefully) a reasonably simple model \nand can be evolved/developed independently of the others - and when put \ntogether I see no reason why they wouldn&#39;t be applicable to the real \nworld problem of controling a real vehicle.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
