On the other hand, games can be tricky\n&gt;(did I\n&gt; &gt; ever mention I used to be Head of R&D for a games company?)\n&gt;\n&gt;I think I knew that somehow.  Actually, aren&#39;t you involved in the CIG\n&gt;conference in Essex in April?  We&#39;re actually going to be presenting\n&gt;NERO there.\n\nYes, they couldn&#39;t get anybody current from the games industry, so I agreed \nto review some of the papers.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised, they were all good.\n\n&gt; &gt; What platforms does it run on (e.g. Linux/Windows...)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Theoretically it can compile on anything, but I&#39;ve only seen it\n&gt;running well on Windows.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I assume it&#39;s OGL graphics, are you using one of the open source\n&gt; &gt; games/graphics libraries?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We are not using open source, actually.  We&#39;re using Torque, for which\n&gt;we bought a license.\n\nWhat&#39;s it like?  And how expensive?\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll be very keen to try that when it is ready.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m just hoping we get it out on schedule!  I have definitely been\n&gt;learning the &quot;tricky&quot; part of games development.\n\nDon&#39;t get me started :)\n\n&gt;By the way, we will also be presenting NERO next week at the GDC\n&gt;Experimental Games Workshop in San Francisco.\n\nThat&#39;ll be interesting, you&#39;ll either get a very positive audience (because \ngames-programmers are all geeks and dead-keen on evolution, AI, etc etc \nmany artists also) or very negative (because games-industry people know \nwhat they like in a game and their standards are quite high).\n\n&gt; &gt; And I&#39;ll be happy to help out if there&#39;s any way I can...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;          Ian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hey, thanks!  Perhaps I&#39;ll see you in England?\n\nAfter I saw the papers, I was trying to get to attend the CIG conference, \nbut my employers are not in this field, and the registration costs were a \nlittle high for me to pay them myself.  So I&#39;ve resigned myself to reading \nthe papers on the web after the event.\n\nWhat are your arrival/departure dates and will you be anywhere further \nnorth than Essex?  I&#39;m in Sheffield, if you are going to be roughly in this \npart of the country I could try to meet up with you somewhere...\n\nI suppose I could try and persuade one of our local universities to invite \nyou to talk... I might be able to swing that although my contacts there \ntend to be graphics-researchers, not AI folk.  I think the AI groups are \ngenerally &quot;unsympathetic&quot; towards soft AI.\n\n         Ian\n\nIan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
