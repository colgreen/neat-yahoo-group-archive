One is that I can&#39;t find \na mea=\r\nningful position for them. The second is that I am going to use \nleaky-inte=\r\ngrators. Bias inputs are not well suited for them. I let \nthe CPPN output t=\r\nhe time constants and bias instead. \nI constrain the experiment to 2D for s=\r\nimplicity. If it proves to be \ninteresting, I will extend to 3D easily. Thi=\r\ns will bump up the \ndimentionality of the CPPN input/output space, though. =\r\n\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken Lloyd&quot; &lt;kalloyd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nPeter,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, I believe this is a powerful idea.  In effect the \npertur=\r\nbations need\n&gt; not be a collision, although that analogy works, but can be =\r\nan \noutput from\n&gt; other networks.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are many things one can do wi=\r\nth an intersection of graph\n&gt; thermodynamics (including, Fruchterman-Reingo=\r\nld, Kamada-Kawai, \nEades, etc)\n&gt; force directed graph layout and artificial=\r\n neural networks. Why \nlimit the\n&gt; interaction in 2D, or 3D space?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Th=\r\nis is a technique I use to model a system network graph in a \ncontext\n&gt; (an=\r\nother system network graph).  The input, output and bias nodes \nof the\n&gt; sy=\r\nstem under examination are the interface nodes between the system \nand its\n=\r\n&gt; context.

The fitness function can&#39;t exactly be defined, since \nthey \n&gt; ca=\r\nn be evolved towards some tasks like &quot;go there&quot; or something. I \n&gt; want to =\r\nbriefly describe the details behind it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The same network is used for =\r\nboth the body and the nervous system \nof \n&gt; the creature. First the body is=\r\n built by a spatial CPPN and \nconverted \n&gt; to a mass-spring model. There ar=\r\ne several tissues (the CPPN outputs \n&gt; tissue type instead of level of expr=\r\nession). One type of tissue is \na \n&gt; sensor tissue, which excites upon coll=\r\nision. Another type of tissue \n&gt; is a muscle tissue, which contracts the sp=\r\nrings when excited. Like \na \n&gt; regular bilogical muscle. \n&gt; \n&gt; The key poin=\r\nt is, that after the spatial CPPN builds the body, the \n&gt; same CPPN is then=\r\n used for HyperNEAT (additional outputs, though), \nto \n&gt; evolve the connect=\r\nivity of the neural network controlling the body. \n&gt; Inputs are located on =\r\nsensor tissue only. Outputs are located on \n&gt; muscle tissue. Hidden nodes a=\r\nre located on the remaining tissue. \nThis \n&gt; is essentially evolving both t=\r\nhe substrate and the connectivity of \n&gt; the network, but in a meaningful wa=\r\ny, because of the geometry and \nthe \n&gt; simulated 2D physics space. \n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne simulation is like this - when the sensor tissue is excited by \n&gt; some co=\r\nllision, this also plugs 1.0 into the associated HyperNEAT&#39;s \n&gt; network&#39;s i=\r\nnputs. When the outputs activation level exceeds some \n&gt; treshold, the asso=\r\nciated springs on the muscle tissue are \ncontracted. \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that u=\r\nsing the same network for both pusposes (spatial \nand \n&gt; connective) is bet=\r\nter than using different networks. Do you think \n&gt; this in general is a goo=\r\nd idea? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
