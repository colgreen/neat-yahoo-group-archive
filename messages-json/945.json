This goes back\n&gt;to the debate about how long to keep a record of innovation\n&gt;numbers.  In the FAQ I give some reasons I chose to only keep them\n&gt;around for 1 generation.  In your proposed model, this wouldn&#39;t be\n&gt;an option.  Also, it&#39;s nice to know the order that connections\n&gt;appeared.  If you ever look at a NEAT genome you can tell how often\n&gt;connections are successful and in what order they were put togther\n&gt;by looking at their innovation numbers.  Aside from these concerns,\n&gt;your idea is still doable but you&#39;d lose these capabilities.\n\nI think I can live with that.\n\nSo...I&#39;ve actually started coding.  YEAH!!!  And I have some questions.\n\nFor the initial state of the experiment, it is a population of one, assigned \nto an initial species.  Because there is only one, crossover can&#39;t take \nplace.  So, elitism causes one offspring that is identical to the first.  \nThe rest are created through mutation, right?\n\nThen, you have to analyze the mutants to see if any new species arose.  If \nmy understanding is correct, you have some &#39;compatability threshold&#39; that is \ntuned in order to give you the desired results, correct?  In this case, you \nwould measure the degree of difference between each individual and the elite \nindividual.  If the difference exceeds the threshold, a new species is \ncreated, and a second pass determines which of those two species each \nspecimen belongs in.  During that pass, if one is found that is over the \nthreshold, another new species is created, and the process begins again, \nuntil all members are assigned to the closest species, and none is over the \nthreshold away.  Or something like that...gotta keep the species count \nlimited.  Is that about right?\n\n\n\n"}}
