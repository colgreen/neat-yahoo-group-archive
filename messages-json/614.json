We&#39;ve also doen it with shortest\ndistance to output layer.  For the purpose of determining a best guess at\nwhich links should be recurrent it has served us well.\n\nFor the purpose of determinnig a graphical layout, it&#39;s not quite as good.\nSince we&#39;re using shortest distance, nodes tend to get &quot;pulled&quot; toward the\ninput or output layer.\n\n&gt; Message: 1\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 05 Apr 2004 01:11:37 -0000\n&gt;    From: &quot;yurifromtomsk&quot; &lt;neuroevolution@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: Mat Buckland&#39;s method for determining Layers and Recurrency\n&gt;\n&gt; There is another way (very similar to described one):\n&gt; Each neuron will have a layer identificator and input neurons will always\nbe a 0 level. Then for each other neurons a shortest distance to the input\nneurons is calculated. If, for instance, given neuron connected with input\none then it has layer index 1, or if given neuron connected with no input\nneurons but with neurons with layer indices 2, 4, and 5 then its layer will\nbe 3 (minimum possible). Thus it&#39;s easy to determine for each connection\nwhether its recurrent or not. We&#39;re just need to substract finish neuron\nlayer index and start neurons layer index. If it&#39;s positive then connection\nis direct, if not then we have a reccurent connection.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for my English.:)\n\n\n\n"}}
