I thought it would be awhile\nbefore we =\r\nsaw HyperNEAT and novelty search combined.  I ran it while I\nwas working on=\r\n other stuff for a bit over 50,000 evaluations, checking\nin on it periodica=\r\nlly.  The behavioral diversity was really\nimpressive: I got guys that were =\r\ntaking baby steps and guys that were\ndoing yoga poses (I swear one of them =\r\ndid &quot;the chair&quot;), although there\nwere still a good number of repeats, espec=\r\nially near the end (falling\nonto theirs knees seemed pretty common).  No on=\r\ne that I saw had a good\nwalking gait, but I guess it&#39;s possible that one co=\r\nuld have when I\nwasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an option to browse the ar=\r\nchive. I&#39;m\ncurious about a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing:\n\n-What=\r\n did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems like there are a\nnumber of vi=\r\nable options here.\n\n-What do the nodes on the substrate mean, and are they =\r\njust on a flat\nplane?  I used your older version when it was first released=\r\n, and if I\nremember right the two on the left are inputs and the stuff on t=\r\nhe\nright is various joints, but I wanted to make sure.\n\n-Similarly, what do=\r\n you use as the 5th input on the CPPN?\n\nThanks,\nDavid D&#39;Ambrosio\n\n\n\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This=\r\n email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; a file has been upl=\r\noaded to the Files area of the neat \n&gt; group.\n&gt; \n&gt;   File        : /novelty=\r\n_nevh.rar \n&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; \n&gt;   D=\r\nescription : Novelty Search applied to evolving HyperNEAT\nleaky-integrator =\r\nsubstrates controlling a 3D humanoid model.
