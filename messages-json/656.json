I normally see this solved within 100,000 evaluations \n(see new eval counter in the GUI) using the default search parameters. \nOnce this task is solved the evaluator switches to the old \nnon-deterministic approach (random start positions, varying prey initial \nmoves and speed) - unfortunately this part didn&#39;t work at all well, I \ndidn&#39;t see any improvement, in fact the networks lost some of their old \nability, presumably because the random trials don&#39;t test every bit of \nfunctionality and therfore some can be lost from one generation to the \nnext.\n\nIt did just occur to me though that the non-deterministic trials can be \nmade deterministic very easily by resetting the random number generator \nbefore each set of trials. I just tried this and it does seem to work - \nthe best fitness stabilizes whereas before it could be seen to vary - \nbut the best fitness now seems stuck at 61 and 63 out of 64 in the two \ntrials I am running\n\nAnyway there is a saved network in the zip that performs perfectly on \nthe pre-determined tests. In the prey capture evaluator click on the \n&quot;Initialise [Deterministic]&quot;  button - this loops through the 16 start \npositions. If you then set the prey initial moves to 3 and the speed to \n0 and click on the &#39;Step&#39; button to see the deterministic trial.  You \ncan of course still run the preycapture simulation automatically but \nthis uses random start positions (distance 0-4) and therefore you may \nnot see perfect results.\n\nColin.\n\nColin Green wrote:\n\n&gt;Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey Colin, just out of curiosity what was the fine tuning that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;improved things?  \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Hi Ken,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll probably write up what I did in detail on the web site, just \n&gt;quickly though I had a think about what you said about randomization in \n&gt;the trials, so whereas before I used 100 randomized trials and gradually \n&gt;increased the difficulty by giving the prey 0 to 4 initial moves an then \n&gt;increasing it&#39;s speed, I am now running 32 predefined trials. 16 tests \n&gt;with the prey starting within sensor range and not moving and another 16 \n&gt;using the same start positions but allowing the prey 3 initial moves. \n&gt;The initial moves are also deterministic in that the prey moves directly \n&gt;away from the agent and this also has the effect of moving the prey out \n&gt;of sensor range - by then though the agent has received inputs with the \n&gt;prey&#39;s location, so it has chance to remember where they prey was seen. \n&gt;These tests are passed 100% but do not produce a perfect agent - it \n&gt;still can&#39;t chase moving prey with a 4 move head start in all test \n&gt;cases, although it does perform pretty well actually :). Anyway this \n&gt;situation should be resolvable by extending the trials to contain \n&gt;further more difficult tests or by switching completely to a more \n&gt;difficult trial  i.e.incremental evolution.  In fact I may be able to \n&gt;revert to my original randomized trials once a good population has been \n&gt;found.\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
