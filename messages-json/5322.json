Our GECCO paper, &quot;Evolving the Placement and Density of Neurons in the H=\r\nyperNEAT Substrate,&quot; is an initial step in this direction:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs=\r\n.ucf.edu/publications/2010/risi.gecco10.html\n\nAt present, we are continuing=\r\n to refine this approach and finding some interesting results.\n\nBy the way,=\r\n others may also be exploring alternative approached to evolving the substr=\r\nate.  It is a pretty clear next step for the HyperNEAT approach in general.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Roberto Bovolenta &lt;crismelide@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, everybody,\n&gt; \n&gt; I=E2=80=99m an Italian\n&gt; researcher in Physics (=\r\nexcuse me for my bad English :-)).\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a\n&gt; question abo=\r\nut the HyperNEAT algorithm: it seems to me that, for a given node=E2=80=99s=\r\n\n&gt; substrate with a fixed resolution, the connectivity patterns are evolved=\r\n by CPPNs,\n&gt; but they however keeps a perfect geometrical regularity and ho=\r\nmogeneity inside\n&gt; the substrate.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, we\n&gt; know that huma=\r\nn brain is made up of different parts, each constituted by\n&gt; neurons which =\r\ngenerates different structures with different morphology (so with\n&gt; differe=\r\nnt connectivity patterns).\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; So, my\n&gt; question is: can we bu=\r\nild a variant version of HyperNEAT which can to evolve\n&gt; the substrate morp=\r\nhology too, therefore developing, inside it, areas with\n&gt; different morphol=\r\nogical patterns?\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a\n&gt; lot for your answer.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
