I think perhaps\n\nwe (or =\r\nI) have conflated the two. Survive/reproduce is the high level\n\n[implicit] =\r\nobjective that is always present, and survival /strategy/\n\nis what we norma=\r\nlly refer to as objective or goal in EC.\n\n\n\nSo far there&#39;s no distinction b=\r\netween nature/biology and EC.

If =\r\nyou\n\nconsider every living thing alive today and trace back through all of\n=\r\n\ntheir ancestors, then every single one of those zillions of organisms\n\nexe=\r\ncuted a successful strategy that lead to survival. Considerably\n\nmore organ=\r\nisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural\n\nworld does tr=\r\ny out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one\n\ngeneration at a time, it d=\r\noesn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\n\nthose poor strategies in the ho=\r\npe of finding something better. What\n\ndoes happen though is that stragies a=\r\nre so complex (for creatures with\n\nlarge brains anyway) that they can incor=\r\nporate successful parts (find\n\nfood) and yet waste much time on poor sub-st=\r\nrategies (effectively\n\nstragey efficiency). Evolution will select for effic=\r\niency but unlike\n\nsurvival it&#39;s not a binary yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probab=\r\nilistic, so\n\nmore like the small low scoring species in NEAT (from fitness\n=\r\n\nsharing).\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies that fit your idea of=\r\n\n\nsearching with no objective, they piggy back on for the ride and very\n\noc=\r\ncasionally become useful. Where EC tends to fall short IMO is that\n\nthe dom=\r\nain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so\n\nthere&#39;s less oppo=\r\nrtunty for exploring variations in strategy -\n\nbranching off into multiple =\r\nsuccessful branches and sub-branches\n\nwithout a major loss in fitness on th=\r\ne objective. Put another way, the\n\nnatural world&#39;s fitness landscape is dom=\r\ninated by smooth undulations\n\nin all dimensions, whereas EC objectives tend=\r\n to have a few\n\nsharp/steep local maxima.\n\n\n\nNature also provides a gentle =\r\nselection pressure towards complex\n\nstrategies by providing resources that =\r\nrequire increasingly complex\n\nstrategies to reach - you can&#39;t eat those lan=\r\nd plants until you evolve\n\nlegs ang lungs.
