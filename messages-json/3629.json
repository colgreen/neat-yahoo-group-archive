I am currently working\non a manuscript now that greatly bolsters the argument, but it is not out\nyet. I will let you know when it is.\n\nNevertheless, I started all of this with the great hope that evolution could\ndo a great job of picking its own parameters. I would love to be proven\nwrong! Please let me know if you have any success. I have found that\nevolution consistently does  poor job of evolving its own settings.\n\nHere is a challenge: take Ken&#39;s default settings for a good NEAT run.\nCompare those to a situation where a GA picks those settings. I&#39;ll bet ya a\nsix pack o porter the hand picked values do significantly better.\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n517.214.1060\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed, 7 Nov 2007 07:18:45 -0800\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Does NEAT always lead to higher fitness value?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 7, 2007, at 6:44 AM, Jeff Clune wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Beware: evolution is very bad at choosing good settings for evolution.\n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s in addition to all of the extra computation time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This is a rather broad statement, and, paper or not, I don&#39;t buy it.\n&gt; I believe a Differential Evolution would work *very* well to choose\n&gt; NEAT parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve thought of doing this very thing myself.
