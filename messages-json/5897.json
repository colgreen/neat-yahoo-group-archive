The configuration is now all done through one XML=\r\n file and it now supports HyperNeat (albeit a fairly untested version) that=\r\n I have tested with some of the experiments various papers (mentioned on th=\r\nis forum) by various authors.  I have further updated it such that it can a=\r\nlso evolve the best activation function for a give node/neuron and fixed a =\r\nfew bugs.  However, this version is not in svn on Sourceforge, not had chan=\r\nce to commit the changes.\n\nThe original code is very stable, in fact I thin=\r\nk I only had one real bug raised and was used in various AI competitions.  =\r\nThe documentation for the original code is probably not aligned with the sv=\r\nn sourceforge version when you get down to real detail, but the principals =\r\nstill hold, and shouldn&#39;t take too much effort to work out where the config=\r\nuration elements from the original neat4j have ended up in the new xml conf=\r\niguration.\n\nFeel free to use either version (don&#39;t merge them tho, they are=\r\n quite different) and if you have any problems let me know.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;roncking2001&quot; &lt;roncking@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Al=\r\nl,\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed on sourceforge that the svn version of neat4j is a couple=\r\n of years newer than the zip file one. They are quite a bit different inter=\r\nnally. The docs seem to match the zip file version.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which one is the p=\r\nreferred one? Can or should they be merged? I know\n&gt; the project is kind of=\r\n old, but it looks like it&#39;s a stable well-documented code base.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; \n&gt; Ron\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
