In the NN&#39;s I have encountered \nelsewhere the inputs are usually &#39;straight-through&#39; or placeholder nodes \nthat don&#39;t apply a function for precisely the reasons you stated. Of \ncourse if you were to normalize the input signals to between -1.0,1.0 \nthen no information is actually lost and experiments should (I would \nguess)  perform just as well as when no function is used. This is most \nlikely what has occured with Derek and Philips experiments, e.g. the XOR \nexperiments used inputs of -1,1 and 0.\n\nAs for whether using an input layer activation has a benefit, I&#39;m not \nwell versed in NN&#39;s enough to say yes or no. It may have a benefit for \nsome experiments, but on the whole it&#39;s more useful to have \nstraight-through input nodes and then to normalize the input signals or \nadjust them in some other way before being aplied to the NN and on a \nper-experiment basis.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
