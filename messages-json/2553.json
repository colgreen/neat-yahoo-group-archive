Does anybody want to know?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Oh go on then. I&#39;ll be watching CSI but I am\n&gt; &gt;listening, honest ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;ll take 1/2 hour to type in, so I&#39;ll try to do it\n&gt; tomorrow...\n\nOK, so this is to do with the rate equations of\ndynamic equilibria...\n\nSomething which anybody with a background in chemistry\nwill be familiar with...\n\nBasically, if we have some process that changes\nsomething from one state to another:\n\nx -&gt; y\n\nThen the rate of that (in the most-common cases) is\ngoing to be:\n\nS_f = [x] * k_f\n\nS = speed\n_f being a suffix for &quot;forwards&quot;\n[x] = the &quot;activity&quot; of x (which, if all x&#39;s are\navailable, just comes down to the number of x&#39;s)\nk is a constant for this process (the &quot;rate\nconstant&quot;).\n\n((there&#39;s a whole load of assumptions I am making\nhere, like for example that the x&#39;s aren&#39;t queuing up\nfor a narrow doorway, but when we&#39;re talking about an\nalgorithm it is fairly easy to know that they do\napply))\n\nOK, if the back process can also happen, then:\n\nS_b = [y] * k_b\n\nAnd the existance of those two processes is enough to\ndetermine that there is an equilibrium position.  e.g.\nany pot of mixed x and y will perform both these\nprocesses and change the ration of x and y until it\nreaches a point where S_f and S_b are equal.  This\npoint come when:\n\nS_f = S_b\n\nthus:\n\n[x] * k_f = [y] * k_b\n\nso:\n\n[y]/[x] = k_f/k_b (= K)\n\nThis ratio, called &quot;K&quot; (note: CAPITALISED) is called\nthe &quot;equilibrium constant&quot; and is basically a measure\nof how far &quot;forwards&quot; the system wants to be (e.g. a\nsystem with K = 100 will come to rest with 100 times\nmore Y than x).\n\n--\n\nOK, so back to NEAT.\n\nWe have the following processes (I&#39;m using &lt;-&gt; to show\nthat a process goes both ways):\n\ng0 &lt;-&gt; g1 &lt;-&gt; g2 &lt;-&gt; g3 &lt;-&gt; g4 &lt;-&gt; ...\n\nWhere g1 is a genome with 1 gene, g2 is a genome with\n2 genes, etc...\n\nSo the question is, what are the rate constants for\nthis, and they are very simple, for this:\n\ng0 &lt;-&gt; g1\n\nk_f = the &quot;add&quot; mutation rate (m_a)\nk_b = the &quot;del&quot; mutation rate (m_d)\n\nSo this part of the system will come to rest with:\n\nK_0_1 = g1/g0 = m_a/m_d\n\nAnd if we set m_a = m_d (just for illustration) that\nwill be 50:50...\n\n--\n\nLooking at the next link in the chain:\n\ng1 &lt;-&gt; g2\n\nk_f = m_a, but,\nb_f = 2 * m_d\n\nWhy is that?  Because this genome has _two_ genes to\nlose, and each gene has a m_d chance of being lost\n(yes, there is some extra complexity here where it\ncould lose two genes in one step and gecome a g0, but\nin practise the analysis doesn&#39;t change if you ignore\nthat -- because it is no different in its consequences\nthan if that change happened in two steps).\n\nSo for this step in the chain:\n\nK_1_2 = g2/g1 = m_a/(2 * m_d)\n\nAnd that&#39;s going to be 66:33\n\n--\n\nSo you can see the general situation, the strength of\nthe reverse process gets stronger and stronger as you\nmove to larger and larger genomes, so that the\nquilibrium position of between each g(n) and g(n + 1)\ngets further towards the smaller end.\n\nI this case, I set the two probabilities equal, so the\nbest the two rates can do is be equal, and that\nhappens between g0 and g1.  However, if I had set m_d\n&lt; m_a, then the balance point would have been roughly\nat g(m_a/m_d)...\n\n--\n\nAll of this is assuming that you apply a separate\nchance for gene deletion to each gene, rather than\napplying a flat rate to the whole genome and then just\npicking which gene to delete, but in that latter case,\nyou have a different sort of mechanism, and basically\nonly have the choice of:\n\nm_a &lt; m_d : expected size zero\nm_a = m_d : no expected size, just a random walk over\nall natural numbers\nm_a &gt; m_d : expected size infinity (eventually :)\n\n--\n\nObviously all that is in the absence of selection. \nSelection pushes those equilibria around with great\nease (which is why my current run, with an expected\nsize of two, is currently hovering around an average\nsize of 100...\n\n--\n\nPersonally, I&#39;m beginning to think that the\nrelationship between how you run delete probability\n(e.g. per gene or per genome) and how you handle\nunmatched genes during cross over are pretty crucial\nfor the control of genome size.  Unless you do both\nright, the ratio of m_a and m_d give far less control\nover the rate of bloat than you would ever expect...\n\nThis is all assuming you have deletion as a mutation,\nif you do it another way then obviously there is no\nbassis for comparison.\n\n   Ian\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
