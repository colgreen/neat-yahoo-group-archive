I know, this is true for something like sound localization (http://en.w=\r\nikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_detection_in_neurobiology#Sound_localization)=\r\n but maybe heterogenous conduction delays are also important in the impleme=\r\nntation of other functions.\n\nOf course, I immediately thought about impleme=\r\nnting it in HyperNEAT but haven&#39;t done it yet ;)\n\nJust in case someone of y=\r\nou finds time to read this paper I would be interested in hearing your thou=\r\nghts about the ideas in it and whether you think they can be combined with =\r\nmethods in the field of Artificial Development.\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
