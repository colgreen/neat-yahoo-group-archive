Between samples, =\r\nthe arm&#39;s \nspeed in the simulator was not set back to 0, resulting in the a=\r\nrm \nstarting each sample with the kinetic energy of the last sample.\nSince =\r\nthe correction of this mistake, everything works fine and NEAT \nproduces ve=\r\nry good results. \nI want to thank everyone who tried to help me with this!\n=\r\n\nThanks,\nMatthias\n\nPS: Now that I finally can evolve arm controllers, I hav=\r\ne another \nquestion. To get a controller with high ability to adopt to new =\r\n\nsituations, would it be better to train all organisms with a high \nnumber =\r\nof training samples (e.g. 15 different start goal positions) \nor with a low=\r\n but each generation randomly changed number of samples \n(e.g. 3 start goal=\r\n positions which are randomly generated each \ngeneration)?\n\n\n"}}
