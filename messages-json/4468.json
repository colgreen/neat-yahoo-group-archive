My input range is from 0..1 and I have about\n100 in=\r\nput neurons. In my training data and later using real data, I\nhave only for=\r\n 50% of those neurons input values. There is just no\nvalue I can assign as =\r\nthere is no data available.\n\nI can not create a new neural net for every po=\r\nssible combination of\nmissing input value as there are very much  possible =\r\ncombinations.\n\nAs I can not assign NAN to these input neurons, I was experi=\r\nmenting\nwith the following:\n\n1) Assigning 0 if there is no data available. =\r\nIf there is data\navailable then I assigned:\nx =3D (x/2)+0.5\n\nSo the new ran=\r\nge was 0.5 to 1.0 if there is data and 0 if there was\nnone. But this was no=\r\nt working very well. I assume the NN &quot;thought&quot;\nthe 0 is just like 0.5 but l=\r\nower as it has no signal.\n\n2) Also assigning 0 when there is no data, but a=\r\nssign also 0 if it is\na really 0. The NN can not know/decide if the 0 is be=\r\ncause the data is\nreally 0 or because it is not available\n\nThis version run=\r\ns slightly better. But not very good anyway.\n\nWhat can I do to solve this p=\r\nroblem? maybe assign -1 if there is no\ndata available? Or just create one a=\r\ndditional input neuron for every\nother input neuron and assign 0/1 regardin=\r\ng data is available or not?\n\nSo for example if there is no data available I=\r\n assign the data node 0\nand the no data available node to 1. Would that hel=\r\np? \n\nHow are you solving such a problem?\n\nThank you very much in advance,\n\n=\r\nChristian\n\n\n"}}
