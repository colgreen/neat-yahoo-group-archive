In other words, speciation\n &gt; &gt; facilitates starting the entire population with a\n &gt; &gt; very small genome and\n &gt; &gt; complexifying from there. But if you *don&#39;t* start\n &gt; &gt; that way, then\n &gt; &gt; the effects of speciation are questionable, since\n &gt; &gt; many of the\n &gt; &gt; species will be protected without justification just\n &gt; &gt; because they\n &gt; &gt; happen to be in the initial population. Does your\n &gt; &gt; system start minimally?\n &gt;\n &gt; I tend to agree with you, Ken...but I&#39;m just thinking\n &gt; out loud here.\n &gt;\n &gt; My impression is that speciation, as implemented in\n &gt; NEAT, is meant to protect innovation. Innovation does\n &gt; not necessarily have to be complexification, does it?\n &gt;\n &gt; If you had a speciated population of complex\n &gt; solutions, with subtractive mutations that actually\n &gt; remove or disable parts of the genome, an innovation\n &gt; might actually be a simplification of how a given\n &gt; neural structure functions, right?\n &gt;\n &gt; If there is a simplifying trend that might actually\n &gt; lead to increased fitness, you would also want to\n &gt; protect that group of genotypes by speciating them.\n &gt;\n &gt; This is analogous to nature, isn&#39;t it? There is a\n &gt; general trend of complexification, but in certain\n &gt; niches and within particular populations, a\n &gt; simplification of morphological structure could arise\n &gt; as a mutation and actually increase the fitness of\n &gt; that individual.\n\nHi Again Derek, Ken,\n\nYes, but with small networks I think you would only see subtractive \nmutations being beneficial when the evaluation task changes. So for \ninstance in the prey capture task described in the &quot;Incremental \nEvolution...&quot; paper from UT the prey capture task is increased in \ndifficulty. Initially the agent can just respond to input directly - the \nprey is to the left, so move left. Later we allow the prey to move \noutside the range of the agent&#39;s sensor before allowing the agent to \nmove. The agent has to effectively evolve a new network on top of the \nexisting very basic network, the new network tries to remember where the \nprey was last seen and move the agent in that direction. If we keep \nincreasing the difficulty of the task in this way then eventually the \noriginal, very basic network may become over simplistic and defunct. At \nthat point a subtractive mutation is beneficial.\n\n &gt; It seems that starting minimally and complexifying\n &gt; makes a lot of sense in the early stages of a given\n &gt; run, but perhaps in a long run, during the mid to late\n &gt; stages, simplification may be an important dynamic to\n &gt; add, and speciation may work to protect simplified\n &gt; innovations just as it worked to protect complexified\n &gt; innovations early in the run.\n\nThats how I see speciation, simply as grouping genomes that are \ncompatible so that sexual reproduction (crossover) is far more likely to \ngenerate good offspring.\n\n &gt;\n &gt; However, I&#39;d agree that if you start with a random\n &gt; population full of complex solutions, speciation is\n &gt; probably going to be much less useful. I don&#39;t know,\n &gt; though...it&#39;s a very interesting area to explore.\n\nAs I said in my earlier mail, each member of the initial population will \nbe in it&#39;s own species to start with. After a few generations though you \nshould see good genomes taking over a larger proportion of the population.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
