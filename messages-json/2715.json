Also Sony have announced a client for the Playstation 3.\n\nMore info here (See the high performance FAQ and PS3 FAQ):\n\nhttp://folding.stanford.edu/faq.html\n\nNow I&#39;ve often toyed with the idea of building a cluster of very cheap \nPC&#39;s as an easy way to get more CPU power. No doubt utilising GPU&#39;s \nwould require a lot of work but probably is a more attainable option \nthan say, utilising an FPGA or some other piece of specialized hardware. \nHopefully the CPU intensive stuff could be farmed off to a GPU using C \ncode or something while the core NEAT algorithm (which typically takes \nup a small percentage of CPU time) could remain in .Net, Java or \nwhatever language and environment you are currently using.\n\nWhile I&#39;m on the subject I&#39;ve been looking at Intel&#39;s new Core 2 Duo \nchips and their performance looks good. Sisoft Sandra reports an FPU \nscore of 15,406M Whetstones for the E6600, which compares to 7,477M for \nthe Athlon X2 3800+ and 3,482M for a single core Athlon XP 3200+ (I \ncurrently own an overclocled 2400+).\n\nSo for me right now I can potentially get a 5x speed increase just by \nupgrading my PC (and multi-threading SharpNEAT). Also the Core 2 Duo has \npower consumption of just 65W (75W for the very top end chip). Although \nyou can theoretically get a 35W Athlon X2 3800+, but I&#39;ve yet to find \nanyone who actually sells them.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
