We&#39;ll have to think about some of them for awhile\n&gt; but h=\r\nere&#39;s a few answers:\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I chose to use a separate output f=\r\nor each connection\n&gt; layer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is because=\r\n I wanted to\n&gt; separate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D CPP=\r\nN \nmethod,\n&gt; then the two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;z=\r\n&#39;. \n&gt; Because I&#39;m only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\n&gt; =\r\nlayer did some unique processing.  If there was only one output, it\n&gt; would=\r\n be harder for the connection layers to distinguish themselves \nas\n&gt; they w=\r\nould be too dependent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs \nare\n&gt; not used=\r\n and the two layers are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\n&gt; empirical te=\r\nsts on which method is better so I do not have any\n&gt; evidence to back my cl=\r\naim, but it&#39;s my intuition.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents oth=\r\ner than Xcheckers.  I have\n&gt; had my friends and people in the lab play agai=\r\nnst the HyperNEAT\n&gt; opponent and it is definitely better than all of us :-)=\r\n.  I would \nlike\n&gt; to release a binary version so people can play the oppon=\r\nents at\n&gt; different generations and see the change in performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; One=\r\n active area of interest is to figure out how good a HyperNEAT\n&gt; player is =\r\nin a global sense.  In Chellapilla & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\n&gt; played human opp=\r\nonents in checkers on MSN Gaming Zone online and got\n&gt; an expert rating on =\r\nthat game server.  The problem with this is that\n&gt; it is very time consumin=\r\ng to play games by hand. It would not be\n&gt; feasible for me to test several =\r\nindividuals in this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have experimented with coevolution, but I n=\r\need to solve the\n&gt; aforementioned problem before I can say anything about t=\r\nhe \nperformance\n&gt; of the evolved individuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM=\r\n, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with =\r\nyou new results with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twe=\r\nnty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case =\r\nStudy on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learni=\r\nng.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chos=\r\nen?\n&gt; &gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural \nto=\r\n me?\n&gt; &gt; * Was more than one CPPN configuration tried?
