In fact, you could be\n&gt; &gt; introducing damaging sampling bias by pointing NEAT away from optima\n&gt; &gt; that might be too small to hit with the initial population, but may\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; reachable from initial low-fit individuals.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My guess is that you won&#39;t do any harm, but nor will you see\n&gt; &gt; improvement.
