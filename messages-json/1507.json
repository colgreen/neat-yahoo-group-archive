I think it&#39;s great work and \nvery helpful.  It seems from your preliminary results that phased \nsearch can significantly outperform complexification alone, so we \nmight now be able to solve even harder problems.  For that reason \nalone, this is probably publication-worthy work, although there are \na few things that should be addressed, or at least I&#39;m curious about:\n\n-Why is the phased search so much faster?  It seems to be 5 or 10 \ntimes faster based on what you say, but that seems more dramatic \nthan I would expect.  I guess it&#39;s because this task is all about \nnetwork activation and has no &quot;domain simulation&quot; involved.  That \nwon&#39;t be the case in other domains, and therefore the speedup aspect \nof this might be misleading.  Therefore, it would be helpful to see \ncomparison graphs with generations on the x axis instead of time.  \nUsually people in machine learning are interested in # evaluations \nto get a soltuion rather than CPU time since ultimately that&#39;s the \nmain factor in computational complexity.  Time alone doesn&#39;t give \nthat information but generations does.\n\n-If you ran the complexifying or blended runs for the same number of \ngenerations as the phased runs would they catch up?  That&#39;s another \nreason it would be good to see a comparison by generations rather \nthan time.  If they can&#39;t catch up in the same # of generations, \nthat is a very strong result!\n\n-To really validate this approach, we need a task that cannot be \nsolved without hidden nodes.  So probably another experiment in a \nnew domain would be a good idea.\n\n-The # hidden nodes in a soltuion is interesting in its own right.  \nFor example, what is actually happening to keep complexity steady: \nAre connections being added then taken away back and forth over and \nover, or are several hidden layers being built at the same time as \nsome inputs are being pruned?  A graph of # nodes per solution would \ngive some insight.\n\n-It would be interesting to see a picture of a solution network.  It \nwould help address the above point and also it&#39;s just fun to see :)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
