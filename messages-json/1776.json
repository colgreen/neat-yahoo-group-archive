I&#39;m probably misunderstanding\nsomething..\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Colin, my office mate and I were discussing phased vs. blended\n&gt; &gt;searching and we were looking at your graphs from your phased\nwriteup\n&gt; &gt;and we realized something about the &quot;Mean Complexity Comparison&quot; is\n&gt; &gt;confusing:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;How many generations pass in 30-50 seconds (the approximate period\nof\n&gt; &gt;each oscillation)?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Ah well, the problem here is that each line on the graph is an\naverage \n&gt; of 3 runs. Therefore the fitness oscillations seen aren&#39;t\nindicative of \n&gt; the oscillation period during a typical run.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  It looks like not enough could be happening in\n&gt; &gt;that time to warrant a phase switch.  Does fitness really stagnate\nin\n&gt; &gt;just 20 or 30 seconds?  We thought maybe you&#39;d expect to see the\nfirst\n&gt; &gt;phase of the run stay in the complexifying mode for a long time\nbefore\n&gt; &gt;going to pruning, since it doesn&#39;t usually stagnate right off the\n&gt; &gt;bat?  \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Ok I&#39;m putting a graph of a single pruning run at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/pruning_run_1.png\n&gt; \n&gt; X-axis is generations in this graph, not clock time.\n&gt; \n&gt; This includes the mean complexity (total number of neurons &\nconnections \n&gt; in a genome) which shows a nice regular oscillation right from the \n&gt; start. The reason why there isn&#39;t a long(er) period at the start of\nthe \n&gt; run (before a pruning phase) is because the threshold for the\npruning \n&gt; phase is set very low. So if you look at the best fitness line where\nthe \n&gt; first pruning occurs you can see it is flat for a few generations,\nand \n&gt; this was enough to trigger the pruning phase. Note that pruning\nphase \n&gt; kicks in when mean complexity has risen by some threshold amount\nabove \n&gt; the level at the end of the last prune run (or the starting mean \n&gt; complexity if no prune phase has occured yet), if this threshold is \n&gt; passed then pruning won&#39;t start until the best fitness has stagnated\nfor \n&gt; some (configurable) number of generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; So in the graph you can see that the complexity rises quite steeply\nat \n&gt; the start, probably crosses the threshold and then pruning phase\nkicks \n&gt; in at the first sign of stagnation in best fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; With regards to the question of how many gens per second and\nwhether \n&gt; enough time has passed to warrant pruning, remember that the whole \n&gt; experiment runs quite fast, so for example the first pruning phase\nin \n&gt; the above graph kicks in at generation 1005 which corresponds to 41\nsecs \n&gt; clock time. Also you can see that the complexity has risen a lot in\nthat \n&gt; time and pruning is therefore warranted.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I guess the overall question is what is really going on and how is\n&gt; &gt;that graph staying so stable?  Maybe it would be useful to see a\ngraph\n&gt; &gt;of *champion* complexity over time, rather than mean.  Then you\nmight\n&gt; &gt;see where pruning was really paying off.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yes that would be worth doing, but don;t discount the pruning of\nthe \n&gt; population as whole because this speeds up the simulation and\nultimately \n&gt; increases our chances of finding a solution within a given\ntimeframe. \n&gt; It&#39;s an indirect benefit but an important one, I suppose you could\nsay \n&gt; I&#39;m taking a holistic approach to searching. So rather than just \n&gt; focusing in on how well genomes are doing I also consider how\nconducive \n&gt; they are to running a simulation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that help clarify things. I still have the raw log files from\nall \n&gt; of my experiments so if there are any other questions or if you\nwant a \n&gt; copy of them, just ask.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
