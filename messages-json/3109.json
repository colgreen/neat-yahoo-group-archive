For example, you may divide the grid \nup into 2x2 (quadrants), or even 3x3 (nonants?), and make observations \nthusly.  You may even make these observations linear (rather than \nbinary), for example based on number of ghosts/food/etc in a section, or \nthe weighted distance of all ghosts/food/etc from the center of a \nsection.  With such added global information, you&#39;d also need to provide \ninput as to where PacMan currently resides (so he might know which \nsection is most relevant).\n\nAnd of course, this problem is screaming for HyperNEAT.  :)\n\nBTW - mine did crash after I hit B and waited a few generations.  I got \nno exception dialog though, it just disappeared.\n\nStill, good work!\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
