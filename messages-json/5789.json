In this way, the concept of distances gets somewhat =\r\ninjected into the domain.  Alternatively, if you want to more directly enco=\r\nurage shorter distance plays, the magnitude of the teammate values could be=\r\n scaled with distance as well.\n\n      I&#39;ve never attempted to control attac=\r\nkers without the ball, or defenders.  If they are all choosing the same act=\r\nion, it may be beneficial to more clearly distinguish states by either usin=\r\ng path drawing again (to the player whose action is being chosen) or alteri=\r\nng their values, such that they are more dinstinct.  \n\n\n     Alternatively,=\r\n the way actions are selected may need to be adjusted, by using some heuris=\r\ntics to limit their choices.  For example, attackers without the ball could=\r\n be limited to selecting only nearby locations, or from some pre-determined=\r\n most open locations.  Defenders could be limited to marking the closest at=\r\ntacker to them, or the choice to intercept the ball could be closed to them=\r\n unless they are one of the closest players to the ball.  Finally, selectio=\r\nn of the highest value as the action may not be the best approach for parti=\r\ncular actions.  For example, in selecting a position to move to, the value =\r\nclosest to zero may be best, since it conceptually could indicate a region =\r\nthat fewer players are exerting influence on.  \n\nRegards,\n\nPhillip\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yyyyaun&quot; &lt;yyyyaun@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am tryi=\r\nng to use HyperNEAT for action selection in the half field offense task (Ro=\r\nboCup soccer) for both the attacker and defender team and have some problem=\r\ns regarding the state representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far I have used the same stat=\r\ne representation as in Stanley&#39;s and Verbancsics&#39; paper &quot;Evolving static re=\r\npresentations for task transfer&quot; (BEV).\n&gt; I have 3 different ANNs for actio=\r\nn selection of the attacker with ball (dribble, pass, shoot), attacker with=\r\nout ball (move to open position) and defender (mark player, intercept ball)=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Attacker with ball:\n&gt; The input layer is marked with the positions o=\r\nf attacker with ball (+1), attackers without ball (+0.5), position of the g=\r\noal posts (+0.5), positions of defenders (-1), paths from attacker with bal=\r\nl to its teammates (+0.3), to defenders (-0.3) and to the goal posts (+0.3)=\r\n. The highest output value determines the action: dribble towards goal (at =\r\nattacker with ball position), pass (at teammate position) or shoot (at goal=\r\n post position).\n&gt; The achieved performance is a little bit better than a s=\r\nimple handcoded solution, but I wonder a few things:\n&gt; The solution is not =\r\nreally aware of the distances of the attacker with ball to its teammates an=\r\nd to the goal, which results in attempted shots from the middle line and pa=\r\nsses to teammates far away. I tried using path values corresponding to the =\r\ndistances and no paths at all, but the performance is similar. I also tried=\r\n to use a lengthCppn-input (as in the visual discrimination task), but that=\r\n does not show any performance gain.\n&gt; Is there a better way to represent t=\r\nhe state and shoot action?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Attacker without ball:\n&gt; The input layer=\r\n is marked with the position of attacker with ball (+1), attackers without =\r\nball (+0.5) except the attacker requesting an action and defenders (-1). Th=\r\ne highest output value determines the position to which the agent should mo=\r\nve.\n&gt; This does not work at all. All attackers tend to move to the same pos=\r\nitions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Defenders:\n&gt; The input layer is marked with the position of at=\r\ntackers (-1), positions of teammates (+0.5) and the defender requesting an =\r\naction (+1). The highest output value determines wether to intercept the ba=\r\nll (at attacker with ball position) or to mark an attacker (at attacker wit=\r\nhout ball position).\n&gt; This representation suffers the same problem as atta=\r\nckers without ball: all defenders execute the same action (mark same player=\r\n, intercept ball).\n&gt; \n&gt; I probably miss something because this is my first =\r\nexperiment with HyperNEAT. I&#39;d appreciate any tips for the representation o=\r\nf the state in the input layer, especially for attackers without ball and d=\r\nefenders.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; Thomas\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
