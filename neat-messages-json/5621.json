I see you&#39;re combining t=\r\nhe east/west scores into a single fitness score per opponent, but it sounds=\r\n like from the paper you&#39;re ending up with 12 fitness scores per host genom=\r\ne per generation (or more likely I&#39;m too tired to interpret the paper corre=\r\nctly). \n\nI&#39;m my current robot duel implementation I&#39;m simply combining all =\r\n24 of these evaluations into a single fitness score passed into the end-of-=\r\ngeneration &quot;epoch&quot; method in my NEAT implementation (basically a Linux port=\r\n of Mat Buckland&#39;s windows implementation setup as C++ classes). \n\nAt least=\r\n in the implementation I currently have, you can only have one fitness scor=\r\ne per genome in the population.\n\nAm I correct in combining them, or did you=\r\n do something else under the hood there with multiple fitness scores per ge=\r\nnome?\n\n\n"}}
