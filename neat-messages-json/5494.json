This layer is\nan abstraction layer between clients (web and IVR) and the back-end billing\nsystems.  The logs for this product are immense.  They log the inputs and\noutputs for every call coming in to the layer, and another log entry for\nevery call out to the external dependencies.\n\nIn this iteration that just completed, I started work on a script to parse\nthose logs and look for instances where exceptions were raised as responses\nto requests.  The intention is to alert the team in the event that there are\never an unusual amount of activity.  I was thinking that the IDEAL thing\nwould be if this script were to learn the definition of &quot;normal&quot; and only\nalert when something truly abnormal took place.\n\nHere&#39;s the thing:  the definition of &quot;normal&quot; changes by the hour, and by\nthe day.  Mondays are typically the busiest days, and it falls off as the\nweek progresses.  Holidays can alter that.  The 1st and the 15th also seem\nto influence it.  Around the noon hour is a peak time, and after around 5 it\ngoes back up, and then falls off again in the late evening.  The things that\npeople call for also change depending on the time of day or the day of\nweek.  So the definition of &quot;normal&quot; is highly complex.  Too complex,\nreally, to manually model it.\n\nAs a first-stab at it, I just created &quot;floating thresholds&quot; that rise or\nfall a little bit whenever the actual is significantly over or under the\ncurrent threshold.  This seems to kind of work, but I&#39;m not satisfied with\nit.\n\nWhat I would like to see is an unsupervised learning algorithm.  I break\ndown the logs into the bits and pieces necessary for it to &quot;learn&quot; the\ndefinition of normal, and then have it tell me how &quot;normal&quot; it thinks it\nis.  But it has to learn the definition of &quot;normal&quot; from data that is not\nalways normal.  I don&#39;t want to have to try to come up with training data by\npulling out the &quot;abnormal&quot; data.  I don&#39;t want to have to tell it if it is\nright or not for every one of the millions of log entries per day over the\nseveral months of data that I would need in order for it to understand what\n&quot;normal&quot; is.\n\nDo any of you have any ideas about how Neat might be applied in a problem\ndomain like this?  Or are there other Machine Learning techniques that would\nbe more applicable to this problem?\n\nThanks for any feedback you might have!\n\n-- \nJohn Arrowwood\nhttp://www.FindingResonance.com/ - blog\nhttp://www.TransformativeTherapiesInc.com/\nhttp://www.irie-inc.com/\n\r\n--20cf3054a527bf643e049e8eaef6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nJust want to pick the group&#39;s brain about something:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m wor=\r\nking on a team that has produced a WebService layer.=A0 This layer is an ab=\r\nstraction layer between clients (web and IVR) and the back-end billing syst=\r\nems.=A0 The logs for this product are immense.=A0 They log the inputs and o=\r\nutputs for every call coming in to the layer, and another log entry for eve=\r\nry call out to the external dependencies.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In this iteration that j=\r\nust completed, I started work on a script to parse those logs and look for =\r\ninstances where exceptions were raised as responses to requests.=A0 The int=\r\nention is to alert the team in the event that there are ever an unusual amo=\r\nunt of activity.=A0 I was thinking that the IDEAL thing would be if this sc=\r\nript were to learn the definition of &quot;normal&quot; and only alert when=\r\n something truly abnormal took place.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the thing:=A0 the=\r\n definition of &quot;normal&quot; changes by the hour, and by the day.=A0 M=\r\nondays are typically the busiest days, and it falls off as the week progres=\r\nses.=A0 Holidays can alter that.=A0 The 1st and the 15th also seem to influ=\r\nence it.=A0 Around the noon hour is a peak time, and after around 5 it goes=\r\n back up, and then falls off again in the late evening.=A0 The things that =\r\npeople call for also change depending on the time of day or the day of week=\r\n.=A0 So the definition of &quot;normal&quot; is highly complex.=A0 Too comp=\r\nlex, really, to manually model it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As a first-stab at it, I just c=\r\nreated &quot;floating thresholds&quot; that rise or fall a little bit whene=\r\nver the actual is significantly over or under the current threshold.=A0 Thi=\r\ns seems to kind of work, but I&#39;m not satisfied with it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;What I=\r\n would like to see is an unsupervised learning algorithm.=A0 I break down t=\r\nhe logs into the bits and pieces necessary for it to &quot;learn&quot; the =\r\ndefinition of normal, and then have it tell me how &quot;normal&quot; it th=\r\ninks it is.=A0 But it has to learn the definition of &quot;normal&quot; fro=\r\nm data that is not always normal.=A0 I don&#39;t want to have to try to com=\r\ne up with training data by pulling out the &quot;abnormal&quot; data.=A0 I =\r\ndon&#39;t want to have to tell it if it is right or not for every one of th=\r\ne millions of log entries per day over the several months of data that I wo=\r\nuld need in order for it to understand what &quot;normal&quot; is.=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;Do any of you have any ideas about how Neat might be applied in a prob=\r\nlem domain like this?=A0 Or are there other Machine Learning techniques tha=\r\nt would be more applicable to this problem?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for any feedback =\r\nyou might have!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;John Arrowwood&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.Fin=\r\ndingResonance.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.FindingResonance.com/&lt;/a&gt; - blog&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.TransformativeTherapiesInc.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.TransformativeTh=\r\nerapiesInc.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.irie-inc.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.ir=\r\nie-inc.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf3054a527bf643e049e8eaef6--\r\n\n"}}
