Again, money makes the most sense\nas=\r\n a measure of fitness, especially if you are focused on evolving\ncome-and-g=\r\no players in limit Hold &#39;Em.  If you wanted to focus on\nevolving good tourn=\r\nament players, I&#39;d use rank in a tournament\nstructure as fitness.\n\nI was th=\r\ninking a bit more about your approach, and to be honest, I\nhave some reserv=\r\nations.  Billings and the folks at Univ of Alberta\nseem to be using a rule-=\r\nbased player, built on a pot-odds player, and\nare using neural networks to =\r\nmodel and predict opponent behavior (if I\nunderstand their approach correct=\r\nly).\n\nYour approach seems the exact opposite.  You&#39;re using rule-based\nheur=\r\nistics to model opponents as tight/loose/passive/aggressive, and\nseem to be=\r\n trying to evolve neural networks that have to figure out\nthings like pot o=\r\ndds on their own.\n\nSo I&#39;m wondering what your motivation is for approaching=\r\n the problem\nthis way...I have to admit that Billings&#39; approach has greater=\r\n\nintuitive appeal to me, since figuring things like pot odds are\nrelatively=\r\n simple for traditional non-fuzzy programming, and things\nlike predicting o=\r\npponent behavior seems like the sort of thing that\nyou&#39;d want to apply a ne=\r\nuroevolutionary approach to.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
