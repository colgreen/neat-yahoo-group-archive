A subset of the sensory inputs to a \nNERO agent is a radar, d=\r\nivided into wedges.  An ad-hoc approach was \nused to covert &quot;there are two =\r\nguys in this wedge, one of them is \nclose and shooting at me, and one of th=\r\nem is far away&quot; into a single \nnumber that represents &quot;threat&quot; in that wedg=\r\ne.\n\nWhy not just make all wedges extremely thin, so that each wedge could \n=\r\nonly hold at most one enemy?  The obvious answer is that it would be \nextre=\r\nmely difficult to train a neural network which had 360,000 \ninputs, one for=\r\n every .0001 degree slice of the pie.\n\nHyperNEAT addresses this concern by =\r\nelevating the problem to a level \nabove individual sensors.  As David D&#39;Amb=\r\nrosio showed in his paper, \nhis CPPN evolved a &quot;concept&quot; of food gathering,=\r\n which was expressed \nat many resolutions.  In my paper, I evolved a vision=\r\n system which \ncould operate at any resolution.  By abstracting away specif=\r\nic \nsensors, we have narrowed the gap between the real-world inputs and \nth=\r\ne inputs to a learning system.\n\nNow instead of coming up with ways to creat=\r\ne sensor data, we can \nshift to coming up with ways to divide data up into =\r\ndimensions.  One \nimportant idea is that, although we have used physical ge=\r\nometry in \nboth of our projects, anything which has a vector of values can =\r\nbe \nconsidered a &quot;point&quot;, with each of those values lying on \nsome &quot;dimensi=\r\non&quot;.  Thus, every problem could have geometric \nproperties, even though the=\r\n idea that there&#39;s some numerical distance \nbetween &quot;happy man&quot; and &quot;angry =\r\nsewer rat&quot; seems far-fetched.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.ca=\r\nrl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason,\n&gt;    Would it be correct to say that the applicat=\r\nion of the HyperNEAT \n&gt; approach to a problem, would be:\n&gt; \n&gt; a) the evolut=\r\nion of a CPPN network with problem inputs and outputs \n&gt; configured as inpu=\r\nts to the CPPN, and the output of which being the \n&gt; problem connection wei=\r\nght,\n&gt; \n&gt; b) the expansion of available activation functions within the CPP=\r\nN \n&gt; nodes, allowing exploitation of underlying functional relationships \n&gt;=\r\n of the problem inputs and outputs, and\n&gt; \n&gt; c) anticipated computational s=\r\navings due to evolution of only the \n&gt; CPPN, and only evaluation overhead o=\r\nf the problem network(?)\n&gt; \n&gt;    I&#39;m just trying to identify the applicabil=\r\nity, given the \napparent \n&gt; increase in dimensions associated with problems=\r\n in which actual \n&gt; geometry (as opposed to problem parameter space), is ap=\r\nplicable. \n&gt; Thanks for publishing your work and code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    An=\r\ndy Carl\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
