Still no where near a &#39;solution&#39;, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;proceeding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I found that if I installed cygwin \n&gt;(http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;on my windows box, I&#39;m able to use it as a client for the project, too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;So,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;for all those out there that wanted to help, but didn&#39;t have a linux \n&gt;box,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there you go!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, Collin, there was a bug in the client that broke the auto-update\n&gt; &gt; &gt;feature.  I fixed it, but you need to manually update your machine in \n&gt;order\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to pick it up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve added some nice graphs to the status page.  First graph is maximum\n&gt; &gt; &gt;fitness per generation.  It fluctuates a lot, because of the slightly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;random\n&gt; &gt; &gt;nature of the fitness evaluation process.  But I&#39;ve also plotted the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;running\n&gt; &gt; &gt;average, which definitely shows an upward trend.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The second graph replaces the old HTML-based population fitness graph.  \n&gt;It\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is a bar graph, one bar per network, with the scale of the graph\n&gt; &gt; &gt;representing the range of fitness within the population.  A zero in \n&gt;this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;graph represents the minimum fitness, not a zero fitness.  Likewise, a \n&gt;max\n&gt; &gt; &gt;value does not represent a solution, only the top performer.  The graph\n&gt; &gt; &gt;only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;shows the relative fitness between networks, not an overall fitness \n&gt;value.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The graph shows the networks in the order in which they were created, \n&gt;so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the elites from the previous generation appear first, followed by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;offspring for each topology.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The next graph is harder to understand.  It is a measure of how stable, \n&gt;or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;reliable, the fitness value described above is for each network.  If \n&gt;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;fitness of a network is still wildly fluctuating, then it is not very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;stable.  If the fitness hasn&#39;t changed appreciably in some time (where \n&gt;time\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is number of samples processed), then it will have a high stability.  \n&gt;The\n&gt; &gt; &gt;idea is, if we reach a point where all the networks have a stable \n&gt;fitness,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;we are done for that generation (we can finish up early).  \n&gt;Unfortunately,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;this point there is one topology whose fitness values still fluctuate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;wildly, so it has low stability, so the mechanism that was intended to \n&gt;help\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the experiment get through generations faster isn&#39;t yet able to do so.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The final graph is a fitness histogram.  The bars at the extreme left\n&gt; &gt; &gt;represent the lowest fitness within the population, the bars at the \n&gt;right\n&gt; &gt; &gt;represent highest fitness, and the height of the bar represent how many\n&gt; &gt; &gt;networks are in that range of fitness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;The next graph I intend to add is a pie chart, which shows the relative\n&gt; &gt; &gt;investment in each topology (offspring allocation number, not \n&gt;necessarily\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the same thing as actual offspring, since there is an offspring limit).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ll try to add that today or tomorrow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Any comments or suggestions for the status page?
