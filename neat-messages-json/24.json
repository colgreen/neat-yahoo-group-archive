But it isn&#39;t *truly* open ended...there is a point after which\n&gt; you can&#39;t really do much better.  It is actually quite hard to think\n&gt; of domains that are totally open ended and support ever-increasing\n&gt; complexity.\n\nCo-evolution among agents certainly makes it easier to find &quot;better&quot;\nsolutions, but it doesn&#39;t really make the domain any more open-ended.\nThere is still a limiting fitness (or limiting dimension(s), if you will)\nthat is eventually reached in deterministic environments. Actually its not\nreally a limiting fitness, its more of an area in the solution space where\nthe evolutionary pressure is balanced by the work required to evolve more.\n\n&gt; Board games like Go are certainly complex enough to support extremely\n&gt; complex structures, so that might be one domain.  But are there more\n&gt; biologically-inspired domains (like predator/prey) that can be truly\n&gt; open ended?  Derek, Philip, and I talked a bit about this when we met\n&gt; at the AI Conference.  It is a pretty big question in artificial life:\n&gt; what is the definition of world that supports unbounded continual\n&gt; progress?\n\nGo is certainly complex, but it is not open-ended. There is a theorem\nabout deterministic, perfect knowledge games that says roughly &quot;there is a\ngame tree for a single player that always ends in a win or a tie, no\nmatter what moves the opponent makes.&quot; The existence of an optimal\nstrategy like this (no matter how hard to find) means that at some point,\nyou can never get better at the game and thus evolution stops.\n\nThe same is true, I believe, for single predator/prey pairs. I don&#39;t think\nyou&#39;ll really start noticing &quot;unboundedness&quot; until you have several (3+)\ninteracting agents (something akin to Kepler&#39;s lays of planetary motion).\n\nWhat you need is some kind of evolving fitness function. Have you given\nany thought about just evolving a domain that supported maximum\n&quot;unboundedness&quot;? The domain could be undergoing some kind of symbiotic\nrelationship with the agents, with its fitness proportional to the\nincrease in fitness from generation to generation of the agents.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
