Presumably your networks performed very\n&gt; poorly against a random opponent (this has been my\n&gt; experience in evolving directly against BEST).\n\nCertainly. If I had intended to publish that version it could have used a\nlot of work :) That paper focuses more on the method, rather than the\ndomains. Seriously &quot;solving&quot; tic-tac-toe would require a lot more work.\n\n&gt; Somebody correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but evolution would\n&gt; occur even in a randomly-selected, randomly-mated\n&gt; population due to simple genetic drift, which would be\n&gt; even more pronounced in smaller populations.\n\nI&#39;m a little confused. Are you saying that there is no fitness function?\nIf fitness evaluation were random, then no, there is not really anything\nyou can call &quot;evolution&quot; There is genetic drift, but its basically\nbrownian motion around the centroid of the starting genetic material\n(depending on how you structure crossover and mutations).\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
