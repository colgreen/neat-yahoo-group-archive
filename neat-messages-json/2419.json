In my experience, the most common \nculprit in needing a very =\r\nhigh compatibility threshold is very fast \naddition of structure.  So it&#39;s =\r\nat least worth checking whether \ngoing back to the classic rates changes th=\r\ne situation positively. \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;dj=\r\names@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/12/05, itsmebas &lt;Bas@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW: =\r\nI had set the coefficients for excess genes, disjoint genes \nand\n&gt; &gt; weight=\r\n difference to 1, 1, and 2, respectively.

There&#39;s a previous discussion of this in the \narchives\n&gt; I be=\r\nlieve, so I won&#39;t go into it, but the basic result is that \nANJI&#39;s\n&gt; mutati=\r\non rates add a lot more topology per generation than Ken&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you wan=\r\nt to implement the mutation rates the way Ken did, just \nset\n&gt; the paramete=\r\nr:\n&gt; \n&gt; topology.mutation.classic\n&gt; \n&gt; to TRUE.
