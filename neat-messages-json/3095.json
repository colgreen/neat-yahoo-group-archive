Does anyone have any recommen=\r\ndations\nfor papers on intraday financial time series analysis? I have quite=\r\n a\nlibrary of papers if anyone want to trade notes. Yes I am very\nfamiliar =\r\nwith Sidhant Dash&#39;s excellent paper on the subject.\n\nAlso as I mentioned a =\r\ncouple of weeks ago. I will be putting up my\ntime-series specific NEAT impl=\r\nementation (based on Mat Buckland&#39;s\ncode) on Sourceforge soon. I am just wa=\r\niting to get my project\napproved. It works on windows and linux. Is relativ=\r\nely easy to use for\nTS prediction. Has a couple of nice features like using=\r\n a uniform\nrandom number generator.\n\nAnyone interested in chatting about NE=\r\nAT TS or more specifically NEAT\nTS for intraday financial prediction. Pleas=\r\ne drop me a line.\n\nThanks,\n\nShane \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Gree=\r\nn &lt;cgreen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks Ken.\n&gt; \n&gt; My initial thought is to try usi=\r\nng my waveform generator experiment to \n&gt; find an approximation of the unde=\r\nrlying function that generates the \n&gt; competition data, as at first glance =\r\nsome of the datasets appear to be \n&gt; very cyclical. Under the &#39;Instructions=\r\n&#39; tab on the web page it says\nthat \n&gt; the submitted results will be compare=\r\nd to &quot;established statistical \n&gt; forecasting methods&quot; and then it lists the=\r\n following techniques:\n&gt; \n&gt;     * Na=EFve\n&gt;     * Single, Linear, Seasonal =\r\n& Dampened Trend Exponential Smoothing\n&gt;     * ARIMA-Methods\n&gt; \n&gt; So does a=\r\nnyone know off-hand what types of data sets these techniques \n&gt; can perform=\r\n [good] predictions for, and therefore what type of data \n&gt; source is likel=\r\ny being used for these competition data sets? E.g. is it \n&gt; more likely to =\r\nbe, say, environmental readings such as temperature, \n&gt; river flow rates, w=\r\nater oxygen levels, population levels, etc. where we \n&gt; can expect some cyc=\r\nlic behaviour (through the seasons)?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I ask is that my inves=\r\ntigations into financial time series \n&gt; data have lead me to believe you re=\r\nally need additional information to \n&gt; predict stock and indices price seri=\r\nes with any sort of success, e.g. \n&gt; Price/Earnings ratios, and even then s=\r\nuch series will possess a large \n&gt; amount of unpredictability caused by ran=\r\ndom events. I&#39;ll give it a try \n&gt; anyway but I think the chances of getting=\r\n anything like good results \n&gt; with my existing waveform generator experime=\r\nnt are much greater with \n&gt; something like cyclical environmental data rath=\r\ner than financial data \n&gt; that, although cyclical in the very long term (li=\r\nke in decade \n&gt; timescales), tends to be largely chaotic IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
