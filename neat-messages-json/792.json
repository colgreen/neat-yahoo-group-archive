But we&#39;re very interested in coevolutionary\ntechniques, as this seems to be the logical future for domains in\nwhich good computer opponents don&#39;t exist.\n\nI don&#39;t know if any of you have read Panait and Luke&#39;s paper comparing\nK-Random Opponents coevolution and SET (Single-Elimination Tournament)\ncoevolution:\n\nhttp://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/twocompetitive.pdf\n\nTheir findings suggest that both of these approaches work well, and\nmay be dependent on the amount of randomness in the domain.\n\nThey also point out that most professional sports rely on a\ncombination of these approaches, which they broadly categorize as\n&quot;renaissance&quot; and &quot;duel&quot; approaches.  Most pro sports have a regular\nseason, in which teams play a broad sample of other teams.  Those with\nthe best overall records at the end of the season enter a\nsingle-elimination tournament to decide who is &quot;the best&quot;.\n\nOther sports, like tennis, are almost exclusively SET-based.  I&#39;m\nwondering if the group has any thoughts on these types of dynamics,\nand if anyone knows of any theoretical work done on these dynamics.\n\nAlso, what are the relative advantages to double-elimination, versus\nsingle-elimination?  It&#39;s twice as computationally expensive, but how\nwell does it contribute to the coevolutionary dynamics?  K-Random Opps\nseems more biologically plausible, but SET and DET are much more\nefficient, and seem easier to extend with Hall of Famers.  If they\nwork as well or better in general, shouldn&#39;t they be the preferred\nmethod?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
