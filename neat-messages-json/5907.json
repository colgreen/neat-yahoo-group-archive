You can play it here:\n=\r\n\nhttp://apps.facebook.com/petalzgame/\n\nPetalz builds on a custom version of=\r\n NEAT and a specialized CPPN-based flower encoding to allow players to bree=\r\nd endless unique and beautiful flowers on their own balconies that friends =\r\ncan visit.  You can then sell your flowers to other players in a global mar=\r\nketplace (who can then breed them further) or even send them to other frien=\r\nds on Facebook.  Under the hood, CPPNs are powering Petalz to allow the flo=\r\nwers to evolve.  (And of course they can actually increase in complexity ov=\r\ner many generations too because of NEAT.)  Crossover is also a fun operator=\r\n here (called cross-pollination in the game), and often the children of two=\r\n parent flowers noticeably resemble both parents.\n\nWhile I mentioned that P=\r\netalz originated in our EPlex lab here at UCF (in an effort led by Sebastia=\r\nn Risi, who has now moved on to a postdoc at Cornell), we ultimately made t=\r\nhe decision to spin it out of the university into a company (called FinchBe=\r\nak) to make it possible for us to support a real social game based on NEAT.=\r\n  The main partners behind the effort are Sebastian Risi (FinchBeak Preside=\r\nnt), David D&#39;Ambrosio, Joel Lehman, Ryan Hall, and myself.  Ashlee Hynes cr=\r\neated much of the art.  So indeed Petalz is now a commercial effort (based =\r\non free-to-play with optional microtransactions), but I think of course it&#39;=\r\ns relevant to NEAT Users hopefully as inspiration for the possibilities it =\r\nsuggests in making some real-world products with neuroevolution technology.=\r\n\n\nAt the moment the game is starting an open Beta, so we&#39;re not actively pr=\r\nomoting it outside this group.  But we are very happy for this community to=\r\n have an early opportunity to try it out and we welcome your comments and s=\r\nuggestions.\n\nWhen you drop in, feel free to stop by my balcony, see my flow=\r\ners, and say hello!  (You can find my balcony through flowers of mine that =\r\nare on the market.)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
