The upper left portion shows a top-level view of the eye\nscanning the image.  The upper right shows what the eye is looking at.\n And the lower portion of the screen shows the affinity output during\nscanning.  It ranges between 0 (non-match) and 1(match), and the\nx-axis is the number of steps.\n\nThe affinity is actually calculated by taking the affinity value and\nevery step and summing the total, but values are skewed for outputs at\nlater steps.  This skewing is not reflected on the graph\nshown...they&#39;re just raw affinity output values.\n\nHave a look at let us know if you have any comments/questions.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n"}}
