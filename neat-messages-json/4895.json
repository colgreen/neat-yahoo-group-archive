My  control experiment (i.e. the one I think should definitely=\r\n give a solution) is a re-implementation of the food foraging problem.  The=\r\n fitness function is the same.  So doing nothing nets a fitness of 32, and =\r\nmax fitness is 60.  Instead what Im seeing is a small improvement to averag=\r\ne best fitness of about 35, and then almost every generation I have a coupl=\r\ne outliers with a fitness around 40-45.  \n&gt; \n&gt; This is all using rtNeat.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; So, my question is whether or not I likely have some parameters tuned ba=\r\ndly (not unlikely) and if so, what the likely culprits would be.  I&#39;ve twea=\r\nked those several times to no avail.  Or,  is it likely just my implementat=\r\nion of the food foraging world? \n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Ahlstrom\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
