But my point is more =\r\nabout how a regularity (or irregularity) was *preserved* as opposed to how =\r\nit was *achieved*. No matter how a particular organizational principle come=\r\ns about (now I&#39;m being more careful to avoid suggesting it&#39;s more or less r=\r\negular than before), the problem is that there is no reason for evolution t=\r\no reward and thereby preserve it in an objective setting when it&#39;s first di=\r\nscovered.  So whether or not bilateral symmetry comes from a reduction in r=\r\negularity or an increase in regularity, if the first bilaterally symmetric =\r\nindividual does not look very close to the final objective (and it most lik=\r\nely does not) then it is likely to be selected out and lost by an objective=\r\n-driven search.\n\nThis is now going to be slightly off-topic, but I would li=\r\nke to add the following thoughts to your response: \nI also see the problem =\r\nthat certain organizational principles (OPs) are hard to establish when the=\r\nir advantage becomes only apparent in the long run (if at all). Nevertheles=\r\ns, I think that the starting position of an evolutionary process can facili=\r\ntate or prevent the emergence of certain OPs. For example, starting with ra=\r\ndial symmetry, I could imagine that the amount of possibilities to reduce s=\r\nymmetry offers far more chances to establish asymmetric patterns than the r=\r\neduction from an asymmetric structure to a symmetric one. \n\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
