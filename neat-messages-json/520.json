I&#39;m curious\nabout how to \nget a confidence output from a system. I think any system should be\ndecomposed, \nbut how? There are many methods that do many things, some better than\nothers.\nI haven&#39;t read anything before on decision confidence, and I couldn&#39;t\nfollow \nthe link Ken gave. This computer isn&#39;t so reliable ( corrupt version of\nwin98 ver1 ), \nso I&#39;ll have to wait till I get back up to campus to read what he\nposted. \nAs a matter of fact, I&#39;m still learning about the vast number of\ndifferent network flavors \ninvented so far. Once the papers about how slow back propagation is\nstarted coming \nout, the variety of learning algorithms exploded. \nWhen I get a better handle on it, I think the NEAT algorithm would blend\nwell with many \nof the structures I&#39;ve been seeing. The LSTM neuron is pretty novel and\nhas good learning \ncharacteristics. It could become a subset of the NEAT tool set. There is\nnothing wrong \nwith evolving networks that learn things as they go. The challenge is\nevaluation fitness. \nThe solution space may well explode when you start adding variables like\nthat, but \nthen that&#39;s the biggest strength of the genetic algorithm. I&#39;ve had too\nmuch coffee, I could \nbabble for hours... Sorry for the ramble. \n\nChad \n\n\n&gt; \nHi Chad, \n\nYes I think I understand. I would tend to think of the technique you \ndescribe as being a further level of task decomposition. I described \nbraking the goal task into layers, high to low. I think the technique \nyou describe would fit in nicely by taking a sub-task at a specific \nlayer and braking it down further. Would you agree? \n\nColin. \n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
