Sort of like an coevolutionary embodiment thing. The\nway I see it, it could be set up as a simple kind of coevolution: one\npopulation of entities (DNA strings) and a population of developmental\nrule sets. This is along the lines of some of DeJong&#39;s and also Ficici&#39;s\nwork over at Brandeis (coevolving teacher/learner pairs).\n\nI think this could be really powerful, because it can incorporate the\nminimal starting and incremental complexification ideas (on a higher\nlevel) with a developmental system that can explore the targeting and\nheterochrony that leads to the various forms of reuse.\n\nThis dichotomy is really important in biology, i.e., DNA is almost\ncompletely useless information without the developmental system that it is\npaired with. And the two definately evolved together.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;d love to do a PhD thesis on this idea if I can get into a\ngood graduate school.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
