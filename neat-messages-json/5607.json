My take is that NE ca=\r\nn play a constructive role in this big-data/many-users type of world.  Or p=\r\nerhaps it might be more accurate to say that big-data/many-users can play a=\r\n constructive role in NE.  In any case, I think we&#39;re already seeing exampl=\r\nes of this potential synergy in the form of crowd-sourced evolution.  These=\r\n examples include Picbreeder, Galactic Arms Race, and EndlessForms.  While =\r\nthese examples do not rival the impact of something like big data in langua=\r\nge translation, when you consider the resources/funding invested in somethi=\r\nng like Google, Picbreeder gets a lot of bang for its buck and really does =\r\nleverage crowds in a unique way.  The 8,000+ image phylogeny on Picbreeder =\r\nis a great collection of evolutionary data whose study can lead to further =\r\ninnovations.  In fact, novelty search was invented based on observations of=\r\n the process of discovery on Picbreeder.  There is more to be found there s=\r\ntill, and crowd-sourced evolution remains a wide-open area with all kinds o=\r\nf unrealized possibilities\n\nGAR also shows that it can be implicit, so user=\r\ns don&#39;t even have to know what&#39;s going on.  In a few days I&#39;m actually head=\r\ning off to an invited workshop on &quot;crowd sourcing of research&quot; and &quot;scienti=\r\nfic discovery games,&quot; where NE is standing alongside the various innovative=\r\n ideas in crowdsourcing of recent years.\n\nStill, Ghulam makes the point tha=\r\nt &quot;big data&quot; perhaps is still a challenge when we&#39;re talking about somethin=\r\ng like having many inputs into a neural network.  That&#39;s a different issue =\r\nfor NE, but NE is taking steps in that direction with methods like HyperNEA=\r\nT that don&#39;t really care how many inputs you give them.  We still face a ch=\r\nallenge in the massive CPU utilization that evolving populations of multimi=\r\nllion-connection networks requires, but perhaps the networked world offers =\r\nor will offer novel opportunities for parallelization that can address the =\r\nvoracious need for CPU cycles in NE.\n\nAt the same time, while it&#39;s true tha=\r\nt there has been radical progress in e.g. foreign language translation, the=\r\n promise of big data is sometimes over-hyped.  For example, my Amazon recom=\r\nmendations are as uninspiring as they were 10 years ago.  And the stuff Net=\r\nflix suggests that I will like is usually somewhere between obvious and hil=\r\narious.  Data-mining at its most grandiose rests on a kind of faith that th=\r\nere is some secret &quot;truth&quot; hiding deep in the masses of data that will reve=\r\nal something so subtle about me and you (and humanity) that we never even k=\r\nnew it.  While I&#39;m sure that buying habits are helpful to analyze for compa=\r\nnies at the margins, it&#39;s unclear that it is always an AI revolution.  It&#39;s=\r\n true there are 700M Facebook users, but you might look at that as a commer=\r\ncial opportunity more than an AI opportunity (crowd-sourced evolution and a=\r\n few other application excepted).\n\nAfter all, let&#39;s not forget that one of =\r\nthe inspirations for NE is the evolution of brains, which predated all thes=\r\ne buzzwords by millions of years.  To some extent, the promise of NE is thu=\r\ns independent of the modern world even as it is realized within it.  If we =\r\ncould learn to evolve brains, it won&#39;t be a question of how we fit in with =\r\nthe technologies of today, but how they fit in with us.  Of course, that is=\r\n more at a Holy Grail level, but still important to keep in mind as we watc=\r\nh modern technology evolve.\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t want to dismiss the idea that=\r\n all these things can synergize, because they can.  Like I said crowd-sourc=\r\ning is a huge untapped opportunity for NE and the commercial opportunities =\r\npresented by the modern world (e.g. with millions of users and mobile devic=\r\nes) are exciting in their own right, regardless of their centrality to AI. =\r\n We are definitely going to see NE exploiting these opportunities.  As NE m=\r\nethods improve, the potential for them to be commercially relevant increase=\r\ns.  For example, improvements in representation open up whole new applicati=\r\nons, like our work in music evolution.  NE has the current disadvantage of =\r\nsignificantly less investment compared to other AI technologies, but it has=\r\n the advantage of the element of surprise.  \n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to start =\r\na discussion on where NE fits into the modern world. We&#39;ve\n&gt; begun entering=\r\n the age of &quot;Big Data&quot;-- 200M tweets/day, 700M Facebook users,\n&gt; etc. We&#39;re=\r\n also finding ourselves more immersed in computing technology as\n&gt; mobile p=\r\nhones become more ubiquitous.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested in your thoughts. Specifi=\r\ncally:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Where does Neuroevolution hold the most potential for interne=\r\nt\n&gt; applications?\n&gt; \n&gt; - What kind of data will NE be best suited to levera=\r\nge?\n&gt; \n&gt; - How does the ubiquity of mobile technology help NE-based applica=\r\ntions?\n&gt; \n&gt; - As we now have over a billion people online, what kind of lar=\r\nge-scale\n&gt; human feedback systems may be devised that rely on NE?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Wh=\r\nat do you generally see as the future of NE for consumer apps?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have =\r\nmy own thoughts on these, which I&#39;m happy to share, but I&#39;m really\n&gt; intere=\r\nsted in what the community thinks. As the world has changed\n&gt; drastically e=\r\nven since the first NEAT paper was published, keeping up with\n&gt; the real wo=\r\nrld necessitates us periodically re-examining the practical\n&gt; application s=\r\npace for our research area. Other areas seem to have flourished\n&gt; in the ne=\r\nw  world: NLP is regularly used to measure consumer sentiment in\n&gt; social m=\r\nedia, graph analysis algorithms are used heavily at both Google and\n&gt; Faceb=\r\nook to determine which page to show or which friend&#39;s posts to display\n&gt; in=\r\n your feed. Where does NE fit in here?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
