I picked up on it \nlast year from a post on the Genetic Programming yahoo group, it&#39;s \nbasically 6 inputs, made up of two binary address inputs which select \nwhich of four binary data inputs should be returned as a response.\n\nAnyway, after taking a fresh look at the code today I spotted an error \nand also made a small change to the fitness function. SharpNEAT has just \nfound a perfect network in two independent runs, taking about 10-15 mins \neach. I wonder how this compares to GP&#39;s ability to find a solution? I \nwould guess probably not too well actually, since I would guess that GP \nis better suited to boolean logic type problems. I may investigate this.\n\nI think this domain was also related to the image processing that John \nArrowood was working on. I think that the switching ability was a \nsub-task of what John was trying to achieve.\n\nI&#39;m going to try the more difficult 11-multiplexer now, that&#39;s 3 address \nlines and 8 data lines.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
