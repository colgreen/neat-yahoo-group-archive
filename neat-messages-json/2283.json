And this measure is already hideously expensive (in CPU).\n\n\tA score system such as this can be used to compare players from different \npeople&#39;s projects, so I thought I&#39;d like to throw up some definitions so \nthat people can applaud or denounce, as the mood takes them...\n\n\tI propose calling this a TicTacToe Perfect Player Score (TTT-PPS).\n\n\tThere are two approaches to the normalization of the boards that are \npresented to the player.  e.g, for those who didn&#39;t follow Colin and my \ndiscussion on this (symmetry or normalization) this is the question of \nwhether you consider mirrored and or rotated versions to be the same board \nor not.  For the purposes of this test, I propose defining PPS scores for \nnormalized and non-normalized data sets.  I use normalization as follows, \nwhen PPS is normalized you should present only the &quot;archetypal&quot; form of \neach board to the player.  The archetypal form is defined as follows:\n\n\t- for any given board, examine the 8 possible rotated/reflected variations \nof it, and for each one calculate an ID number as follows:\n\n\tID = SUM(cell(i) * 3 ^ i);\n\n\twhere cell(i) is:\n\t\t0 for an empty cell\n\t\t1 for a cell taken by the current player\n\t\t2 for a cell taken by the opponent\n\n\tand the sum uses i values from 0 to 8 corresponding to a board laid out as \nfollows:\n\n\t0 1 2\n\t3 4 5\n\t6 7 8\n\n\tthe archetype of any board is then the one with the lowest ID.\n\n--\n\n\tThere are also a few different choices for how you score each play, \nspecifically:\n\n\t- how you score a player attempting an illegal move (playing on a cell \nthat&#39;s already taken) - e.g. do you penalize it more than a bad but legal move\n\n\t- how you score partial success, e.g. whether you give any credit for a \nplayer who plays for a stalemate when a win was available\n\n\tThese are not totally separate, e.g. the overall scale is arbitrary, so if \nwe use a low score for illegal plays then we are effectively increasing the \nreward for partial successes.\n\n--\n\n\tThere are seven different classes of play that a player might make:\n\n\tI - illegal move attempted\n\tW - (eventually) leads to a win\n\tS move (eventually) leads to stalemate and that&#39;s the best available\n\tL move (eventually) leads to a loss and that&#39;s the best available\n\tS/W (eventually) leads to stalemate but a win was available\n\tL/S (eventually) leads to a lose but a stalemate was available\n\tL/W (eventually) leads to a lose but a win was available\n\n\tSo, putting all that together and thinking it through a bit, I find only a \nfew scoring schemes that really make sense\n\nname\t\t\tI\tW\tS\tL\tS/W\tL/S\tL/W\n\nTTT-PPS(flat)\t\t0\t1\t1\t1\t0\t0\t0\nTTT-PPS(legal)\t-1\t1\t1\t1\t0\t0\t0\nTTT-PPS(nl)\t\t0\t1\t1\t1\t.5\t0\t0\nTTT-PPS(legal-nl)\t-1\t1\t1\t1\t.5\t0\t0\n\ne.g. &quot;flat&quot; only rewards the best possible play (in terms of PPS), &quot;legal&quot; \nis the same but punishes illegal moves more than bad moves, nl allows \npartial credit for Not Losing, even if you could have won, and legal-nl is \nthe same but again punished illegal moves.\n\n\tFurther, each of these can be &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;canonical&quot;.\n\n\tNormalised tests involve 627 boards. Canonical ones have 4520 (as far as I \nhave worked out so far, I could still discover some bugs)...\n\n\tEach overall score will be the average of score over all boards in the test.\n\n--\n\n\tThese scores all have the properties:\n1) a &quot;perfect&quot; player will score 1.0000.\n2) only illegal moves can drive a score negative.\n3) players that cannot make illegal moves (some approaches won&#39;t allow \nthis) will score the same on legal and non-legal forms.\n\n--\n\n\tAt the moment I am working up to using one of these scores as a fitness in \na SLEAT run.  I have it all working but started with different scoring \nscheme, so I just need to settle on one of the above probably TTT-PPS(legal).\n\n\tObviously this is not proper evolution, e.g. I&#39;m feeding part of the \nanswer into the fitness function, but it&#39;s an interesting proof-of-concept \nexperiment.  If I can&#39;t make a perfect player when I&#39;m cheating this much, \nwhat hope have I on a flat playing-field?\n\n\tIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
