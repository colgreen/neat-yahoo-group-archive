The term encompasses both parallel Embodied Evolution (Watson et al=\r\n., 2002), in which evolution is distributed across a population of robots, =\r\nas well as Evolutionary Robotics (Floreano and Mondada, 1994) where evaluat=\r\nion is serialized on a single robot. Notable examples of EPS occur across a=\r\n wide variety of systems, ranging from Robotics (Zykov et al., 2004)] to FP=\r\nGAs (Thompson, 1996) to 3D printers (Rieffel and Sayles, 2010). Although EP=\r\nS comes at a cost (the speed of the real world, unlike CPUs, does not follo=\r\nw Moore&#39;s Law), by definition it avoids the &quot;reality gap&quot; imposed by simula=\r\ntion, and has produced novel and tangeable real-world results. Regardless o=\r\nf application or method, all implementations of EPS are bound by many of th=\r\ne same constraints and technical challenges. The aim of this full-day singl=\r\ne-track workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently involve=\r\nd in the Evolution of Physical Systems, as well as those interested in the =\r\ntechnique, in order to share ideas and innovations. As the frontiers of art=\r\nificial life move from the computer to the petri dish, the Evolution of Phy=\r\nsical Systems offers to provide inroads into domains which are otherwise im=\r\npossible to simulate. \n\nThe first EPS Workshop, at ALIFE `13 in East Lansin=\r\ng Michigan, was a tremendous success. Spread over an entire day, we had tim=\r\ne for eight speakers to give presentations, as well as an extended panel se=\r\nssion on the promises and pitfalls of the Evolution of Physical Systems. Th=\r\ne room was packed for both morning and afternoon session, with more than 60=\r\n attendees.\n\nImportant Dates\nSubmission Deadline: June 17, 2013\nNotificatio=\r\nn: July 1, 2013\nCamera-ready: July 22, 2013\nWorkshop: September 2, 2013\n\nNo=\r\nte: Workshop-only registration is available\n\nOrganizers:\n- John Rieffel (Un=\r\nion College, New York, USA)\n- Jean-Baptiste Mouret (Universit=E9 Pierre et =\r\nMarie Curie, Paris, France)\n- Nicolas Bredeche (Universit=E9 Pierre et Mari=\r\ne Curie, Paris, France)\n- Evert Haasdijk (VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherla=\r\nnds)\n\nWorkshop=92s website: http://cs.union.edu/~rieffelj/EPS-Workshop-13/\n=\r\nConference=92s website: http://www.dmi.unict.it/ecal2013/\n\nSubmission\nWe in=\r\nvite both extended abstracts and full &quot;concept&quot; papers. We invite and encou=\r\nrage participation by those who already have an EPS-themed paper accepted a=\r\nt ECAL.
