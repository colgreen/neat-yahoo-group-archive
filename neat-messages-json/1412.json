It is possible to do anything you want based\n&gt; &gt;on the compatibility function, and using it as a basis for deciding\n&gt; &gt;which interspecies matings are tolerable is certainly feasible.\n&gt;\n&gt;no. I mean what if two mutations are identical but were inovated\n&gt;seperatly, so that that they are rated as less compatable. In the early\n&gt;part of a search, the ratio of members in a population may be comparable\n&gt;to the possible number of node insertion points. So if in the second\n&gt;generation, the same mutation occured as had occured in the first\n&gt;generation, it would be described as a different gene. Later, as this\n&gt;phenomenon happens more than once, measured compatability as returned by\n&gt;the compatiablity function wouldn&#39;t reflect the identical mutations.\n&gt;Am I making a mountain out of a molehill, or am I missing something\n&gt;important about the compatibility function?\n\nThat really depends on how you handle the assignment of innovation ID&#39;s.  \nFor example, I remember which connection was split to make a node.  Later \n(even hundreds of generations later), if a connection between those two \nnodes is again split, the new node will receive the same node ID as the \nfirst time.  So if a particular piece of structure happens to evolve twice, \nit is recognized as being the same structure.\n\nKen&#39;s implementation doesn&#39;t do that, not between generations anyway.  But \nat the same time, Ken&#39;s implementation has managed to evolve solutions to \nthings, so obviously it isn&#39;t critical.\n\nMy suggestion is this:  If you are aware of the possibility of compatible \nstructures being seen as incompatible, and that bothers you, and you have \nthe time, energy, and know-how to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen, then by all \nmeans, make sure it doesn&#39;t happen!  You&#39;ll sleep better at night... ;)  \nOtherwise, don&#39;t worry, NEAT will still work just fine. :)\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
