Another thought, what values are you inputing into \nthe network? If you are using 0 and 1 then you might want to change this \nto 0.1 and 0.9, or at least use 0.1 instead of 0.0.  Zero causes \nproblems because it cannot be transformed by connection weights - \nanything*0 = 0.\n\nIn fact this might be why the bias signal is so important at the moment.\n\nAlso, you&#39;re probably doing this already, but just in case - for the \noutput nodes just take anything less than 0.5 as a zero and anything \ngreater then 0.5 as a 1.0.\n\nActually this problem is more difficult than I first thought because you \nwant generate the correct combination of LEDs for values above 9. So \nthat the network has to do extra work to figure out that 10 gives the \nsame result as 0. It might be kinder to NEAT of you tried input values \nof 0 to 9 before moving on to the more difficult problem you currently have.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
