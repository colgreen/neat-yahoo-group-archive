F.e : output of\nsom {3,5} then input =\r\n(array of 10 float) ll be {0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0}\n\ni have not already thinked=\r\n for the fitness method but we know that the\noutput of neat ll be connect t=\r\no one switch state and element ( door ,\nlight etc)\n\nso array[0] ll contain =\r\nstatus ( first word ) 0 off 1 on \nthe other array ll be array[1] door kitch=\r\nen etc....\nso an output like that {1,1,0.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0} ll correspond to s=\r\nom\nresult {3,5} and from there whe know that is open door kitchen.\n\nand the=\r\nn if he say {0,0,1,0,1,0,1} we let s neat correct it for giving\n a better r=\r\nesult.\n\none time we have a good network we save the topologies and weight a=\r\nnd\ndon t use neat anymore.\n\nAm i wrong ?\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, A =\r\nNikiforov &lt;soapp@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello fab_wartix and all\n&gt; I&#39;m going t=\r\no start working on some simular task, have you already\n&gt; decided which type=\r\n of SOM you will be using?
