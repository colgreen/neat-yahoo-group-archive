My approach is d=\r\nifferent than many of the examples because it is not a robot/game approach =\r\nwhere you know the state at any given time and it is definative.  With frau=\r\nd, it is shades of gray.\n\nThe other thing is I am using a set of data to tr=\r\nain on.  I have 10,000 cases, and test each genome against 8,000 cases.  2,=\r\n000 cases are being held out for independent validation.\n\nSo my question is=\r\n on the fitness function.  Here is my current approach.  Basically I am sum=\r\nming the squared error for all 8,000 cases that I run through the genome:\nf=\r\noreach (DataRow dr in dtTrain.Rows)\n{\n    SetInputs(dr);\n    box.Activate()=\r\n;\n    double out1 =3D box.OutputSignalArray[0];\n    double err;\n    if (isF=\r\nraud =3D=3D 1)\n        err =3D 1 - out1;\n    else\n        err =3D out1;\n   =\r\n err *=3D err; // square the error\n    fitness +=3D 100 - (int)Math.Round(1=\r\n00 * err, 0);\n}\n\nNow, since I test a genome on a set of cases instead of a =\r\nsingle state, I am wondering if the sum of the error is the best approach i=\r\nn my case.  Obviously, STDEV comes to mind as one other possibility.\n\nMy cu=\r\nrrent approach seems to have problems complexing.  After 5,000 generations =\r\n(population 500), the best genome is quite simplistic.  My fitness has also=\r\n only gone from 512,486 to 514,743.  This translates into getting 1001 of t=\r\nhe 2,000 test cases correct (so basically just coin flip results).  My old =\r\nneural net gets 1200 correct so it isn&#39;t my inputs (ok, maybe data conditio=\r\nning is an issue?).  For data conditioning, I am using 0 centered StdDev =\r\n=3D 1.\n\nThe connections for the best genome is below. Nodes 0-75 are inputs=\r\n (my current neural network trained via other techniques uses 60 of those i=\r\nnputs and is 60% accurate).  Node 76 is the output, and any id above 76 is =\r\na hidden node.\n    \n    &lt;Connections&gt;\n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;147&quot; src=3D&quot;145&quot; tgt=\r\n=3D&quot;76&quot; wght=3D&quot;0.11515210787375874&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;184&quot; src=3D&quot;182&quot; =\r\ntgt=3D&quot;76&quot; wght=3D&quot;-0.15767564282512914&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;293&quot; src=3D&quot;6=\r\n2&quot; tgt=3D&quot;145&quot; wght=3D&quot;-7.6662831469826536&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;589&quot; src=\r\n=3D&quot;145&quot; tgt=3D&quot;182&quot; wght=3D&quot;-10&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;763&quot; src=3D&quot;47&quot; tgt=\r\n=3D&quot;182&quot; wght=3D&quot;-8.1612453869437189&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;2140&quot; src=3D&quot;1&quot; =\r\ntgt=3D&quot;2139&quot; wght=3D&quot;9.95966789207033&quot; /&gt; \n      &lt;Con id=3D&quot;2141&quot; src=3D&quot;21=\r\n39&quot; tgt=3D&quot;182&quot; wght=3D&quot;9.9724126338387382&quot; /&gt; \n    &lt;/Connections&gt;\n\nAs you =\r\nmay have deduced from my connections, I use a weight range of 10.  I starte=\r\nd out using the default 5, but it quickly started producing multiple hidden=\r\n nodes that did nothing but connect to one another in order to accumulate a=\r\n total weight &gt; 5.  Maybe this is desired in NEAT to increase complexity?\n\n=\r\nSo any advise would be greatly appreciated.  My current area of focus is th=\r\ne fitness function approach and the weight setting.  Of course, comments/su=\r\nggestions on other areas would also be apprecitated.\n\n\n\n"}}
