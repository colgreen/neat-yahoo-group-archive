This particular experiment was =\r\nset \nup to answer some questions I had in mind. The first one is obvious, \n=\r\nis there a geometric regularity in the predator/prey task that \nHyperNEAT c=\r\nan possibly exploit. And there is. I can see some \nmeaningful behaviors eme=\r\nrging with HyperNEAT as early as the 4th or \n5th generation. My next questi=\r\non was, what is the difference between \nthe indirect encoding and the direc=\r\nt encoding. Let me make it more \nclear. In your experiments in the robot du=\r\nel domain, both robot NNs \nare encoded directly and complexifying. They ela=\r\nborate on previous \nstrategies by incrementally adding more structure, righ=\r\nt? \nWhat about HyperNEAT, does it preserve the same dynamics, where the \nCP=\r\nPNs complexify but the substrate is fixed? Does it lead to endless \nalterat=\r\nion of strategies instead of elaboration? I can predict that \nHyperNEAT can=\r\n discover some complex connectivity patterns between \nhidden nodes to devel=\r\nop some kind of &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior, but is \nthat limited? \nWell this qu=\r\nestion is still not answered because, as you mentioned, \nthe predator/prey =\r\ntask is too easy to learn, though there is room for \nthe predator and prey =\r\nto learn tricks to fool each other. For example \nthe prey can learn to hide=\r\n behind walls, etc. \nYes I compared it to direct encoding NEAT and generall=\r\ny I can conclude \nthat HyperNEAT develops strategies faster. Especially in =\r\nthe case of \nmany many inputs. Scaling works as well, but it is not perfect=\r\n. \nLet me tell you about the source code. Unfortunately the core NEAT \nlibr=\r\nary I wrote and use is locked under an NDA but it is equivalent to \nthe rtN=\r\nEAT modification I released with the NEVH project. The \nvisualization routi=\r\nnes are basically the same there, there is nothing \nnew at all. But I can r=\r\nelease the source code for the demos \nthemselves. Please ask me about any d=\r\netails, I will be happy to help \nanyone. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter, thanks for this Hype=\r\nrNEAT coevolution demo.  I see some\n&gt; interesting behaviors evolving, but I=\r\n am curious about your own\n&gt; conclusions?  What did you learn from this exp=\r\neriment?  Did you try\n&gt; comparing it to regular NEAT in the same domain?  I=\r\n am not sure\n&gt; whether the difference would be great since I am not sure if=\r\n this \ntask\n&gt; is sufficiently complex to exhibit a significant difference b=\r\netween\n&gt; the methods.  That is, there is probably only so good that you can=\r\n \nget\n&gt; before new skills stop really mattering in this domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the=\r\n way, do you plan releasing source code for your various\n&gt; experiments and =\r\nAI code?  It seems like you have a nice system set \nup\n&gt; and other people m=\r\night like tinkering with it.  I especially like \nthe\n&gt; real-time CPPN/subst=\r\nrate displays.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This email message is a notificatio=\r\nn to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of th=\r\ne neat \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   File        : /HyperNEAT_PredatorPrey.exe \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Description :=\r\n HyperNEAT applied to competetive predator-prey\n&gt; coevolution task (with wa=\r\nlls).  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can access this file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; \nhttp://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/neat/files/HyperNEAT_PredatorPrey.exe \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To learn more=\r\n about file sharing for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \nhttp://help.yahoo.=\r\ncom/l/us/yahoo/groups/original/members/web/index.htm\nlfiles\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
