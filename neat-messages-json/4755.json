I already have zlib-devel packages installed, so I =\r\ntry and build tinyxmldll and thats where things blow up.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I create th=\r\ne following directories:\n&gt; mkdir tinyxmldll/build/debug\n&gt; mkdir tinyxmldll/=\r\nbuild/release\n&gt; \n&gt; but when I try running cmake -i on those directories, I =\r\nget the error:\n&gt; CMake Error: The source directory &quot;/home/user/hyperneat/ti=\r\nnyxmldll/build/debug&quot; does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.\n&gt; \n&gt; So th=\r\nen I try running cmake -i in the tinyxmldll directory itself, and it seems =\r\nto run; however, when I run make, I get the following error:\n&gt; \n&gt; /usr/bin/=\r\nld: cannot find -lzlib\n&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n&gt; \n&gt; but I&#39;ve =\r\nalready set the zlib include path to /usr/include and the zlib_lib path to =\r\n/usr/lib64, but it still cannot find the files.  Even when I try to build t=\r\nhe included zlib and point the path to those header and lib files, I get th=\r\ne same error.  Has anyone built it on Linux?  Can anyone point to a step my=\r\n step procedure for building hyperneat and its dependencies?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank You=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
