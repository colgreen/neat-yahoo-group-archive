There may be something to the \n&gt;idea of detecting common paths and temporarily replacing them with \n&gt;something simpler...though I don&#39;t really know if that&#39;s the main \n&gt;idea here.\n&gt;\nYes it is a bit vague isn&#39;t it, but then New Scientist is a science \nmagazine rather than a journal. Also I think part of the reason is that \nthis seems to be research into biological nets (although a computer \nmodel was mentioned). I took the shortcut to mean a new connection \nbetween two previously distant neurons, but not as a replacement of \nexisting connections, just a new connection that provided a feedback \nthat kept a signal looping through the network - In their words &quot;the \nnetwork formed self-sustaining loops of activity&quot;.\n\nI couldn&#39;t find the source of the article so I took the liberty of \nemailing one of the people involved.
