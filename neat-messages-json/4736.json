I am sure it=\r\n would be domain-dependent.  It is possible that some functions with abrupt=\r\n changes could complement their more gradual counterparts, or it could turn=\r\n out disruptive for some reason.  It&#39;s hard to say.  But my feeling is that=\r\n in general it is not a critical kind of decision, though it might affect p=\r\nerformance to some extent.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;=\r\ncolin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2009/7/1 Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Colin, I don&#39;t think there is any agreed standard set.

S=\r\ntart with a minimal set and maybe introduce others at a\n&gt; later time if the=\r\ny show promise. E.g. I wonder about functions with\n&gt; abrupt changes in rate=\r\n of change, e.g. abs and square, and whether\n&gt; they are complementary or su=\r\nbstitutes for functions with a similar\n&gt; overall profile but with smoother =\r\ncurves, e.g. gaussian and sine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also agree that something like an =\r\nunbounded linear function can have\n&gt; &gt; unintended consequences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My =\r\nguess is that even sigmoids and Gaussians alone can work well, although\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n it&#39;s just a hunch.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
