In the\npaper on hyperneat checkers however, Jason=\r\n Gauci and Ken Stanley query\na single cppn to get connection weights for th=\r\ne input/hidden layer,\nand the hidden/output layer. (A Case Study on the Cri=\r\ntical Role of\nGeometric Regularity in Machine Learning)\n\nGiven that single =\r\nlayer feedforward networks were found incapable of\nlearning linearly insepe=\r\nrable  patterns, it seems like the\nfunctionality of NEVH could be severely =\r\nhindered by limiting itself to\nsearch the space of single-layer perceptrons=\r\n. \n\nIs there a principled way of extending the method used by Gauci and\nSta=\r\nnley in the checkers paper to making arbitrary amounts hidden\nlayers? Can a=\r\nnyone provide any insights on whether limiting the\ngenerated nets to single=\r\n layer actually inhibits their ability to\nlearn in the domain of humanoid b=\r\nipedal walking? \n\n\n"}}
