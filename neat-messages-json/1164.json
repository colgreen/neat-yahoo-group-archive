It turns out\n&gt;this is very hard to do, and most domains turn out to have a limit\n&gt;to how much intelligence can help after a certain point.  Such\n&gt;domains are called &quot;open-ended,&quot; and designing them to be truly open-\n&gt;ended is perhaps as hard as AI itself.\n\n         This is essentially the object of my Living@Home project.\n\n         There&#39;s a web-page: http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/ but \nthere&#39;s not a lot on it yet.  Actually that reminds me, I must kick the guy \nwho&#39;s supposed to be revamping the web-pages...\n\n         But basically the idea was:\n\n- moderate complexity &quot;physical&quot; environment\n- evolving body plan from a variety of pre-built components\n- build the &quot;brain&quot; from:\n1) low level evolving entities (such as NEAT-nets and/or GP-programs) -- \ncall these &quot;genes&quot;\n2) house the evolving entities in a &quot;co-evolving support framework&quot; (CSF) which\n         2.1) specifies gene&lt;-&gt;gene wiring\n         2.2) specifies gene&lt;-&gt;body wiring\n         2.3) pattern matches gene&#39;s interests against sense input\n         2.4) arbitrates conflicting gene output\n         2.5) distributes resources (e.g. run time) between genes\n         2.6) (maybe) handles &quot;somantic learning&quot; e.g. in crediting \npleasure and pain to genes\n\nIt&#39;s a pretty complex area, and I&#39;m only slowly coming up to speed on quite \nhow hard it will be.  Obviously its important to try and draw up a series \nof staged prototypes so that we can move steadily towards the hard \nstuff.  But even that is complex :)\n\nMy current project is writting a &quot;manifesto for evolving agents&quot;, which \nbasically is about the gap between a &quot;naked&quot; evolving software technique \n(NEAT, GP, ...) and a whole evolving agent.\n\nWhen it&#39;s done, I will invite comment, but it will be a while...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
