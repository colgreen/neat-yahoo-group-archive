The technical tutorial, spanning in two parts, will cover fundamentals as well as techniques for building both speech recognition systems and synthesis systems.\n\nThis will enable participants to gain sound knowledge of speech signal processing as well as design of speech recognition and speech synthesis systems. It will also put them into position of building their own recognition and synthesis systems.\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nProf. Samudravijaya K. has been working in the area of spoken language processing at TIFR, Mumbai. His research interests include robust speech recognition, speaker verification, speech database and cursive script recognition. He received his Ph.D. degree from Mumbai University in 1986.\n\nMr. S. P. Kishore has been working in the area of speech processing at IIIT Hyderabad and also at LTI, Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests include speech processing and machine learning. He received MS (by Research) degree from IIT Madras in 2001 and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at LTI, Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nDr. Sitaram is a Senior Research Scientist at HP Labs India working in Language Technologies and Applications. He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Communication Engineering, specialized in &quot;Speech recognition&quot;, from IISc, Bangalore. His interests include speech recognition, speech synthesis, spoken dialog systems and real time implementation of these in embedded and telephony platforms.\n\nMore Details: http://www.ncst.ernet.in/kbcs2004/tut1.shtml\n\nTutorial 2: Pattern Evolution Algorithms for Search, Optimization and Data Mining\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tutorial would cover the Monte Carlo algorithms, genetic algorithms and ant miner with support vector machine in detail. Emphasis will be given on learning and using them for search, optimization and data mining purposes. A number of examples and illustrations will be made including Bioinformatics applications like protein structure prediction, classification of protein structures, Chemoinformatics applications like Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, Medical diagnosis, and abnormality & fault detection in chemical processes.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nDr. Sunderarajan is the group coordinator of Scientific and Engg. Computing Group at CDAC, Pune, India. He has a Ph. D. in Physics from Anna University. He has been working in the field of protein structure prediction using GA and electronic structure calculations for past several years and has published about 45 paper in international journals.  \n\nDr. Jayaraman is a senior Scientist at the Chemical Engineering and Process Development division of the National Chemical Laboratory. His research interests include mathematical modeling of chemically reacting systems; Process Optimization, Control & Monitoring; Modeling and Design of Chemical & Bioreactors; and application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Bioinformatics and chemically reacting systems.\n\nMore Details: http://www.ncst.ernet.in/kbcs2004/tut2.shtml\n\nTutorial 3: EVOLVABLE HARDWARE - Implication on Engineering Design and Intelligence of Autonomous Systems\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tutorial will discuss Framework for Evolutionary Computation (EC) and its application as Evolvable Hardware (EHW). It will cover EHW definition, general considerations and EHW classification, technology support of EHW and advanced type of FPGA, hardware architectures with intrinsic EC like embryological architectures, emergent functionality architectures, evolvable fault tolerant systems, Parallel evolvable architectures of Higuchi type, and evolvable architectures on functional level. The tutorial will also cover application of GA for design of EHW design elements with local improvement of chromosomes applied for optimization of evolved configuration in RLD (Reconfiguration Logic Devices) block of EHW architectures.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nProf. Negoita received his Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Bucharest (TUB), Romania in 1985. He is currently a Professor in The School of Information Technology, Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec), New Zealand and the Director of Centre for Computational Intelligence at WelTec.
