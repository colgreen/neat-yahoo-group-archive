The approach comes under modularisation (noting that this can\nalso be used to mean co-evolving high and low level nets rather than\n&#39;fixing&#39; the low level nets and working from there).\n\nBasically we&#39;re lazy and we don&#39;t want to do all of that, or rather,\nwe&#39;re interested in just how far you can push evolutionary methods to\ndo some of the hard work for us, e.g. figure out good/robust\nfunctional decompositions.\n\nAs an aside HyperNEAT has been put forward as a natural next step on\nfrom the modular line of thinking - so how could we possibly encode\nthese functional breakdowns/subnets in a general way... with indirect\nencodings such as HyperNEAT.\n\nMy current thinking is that approaches such as HyperNEAT address the\nencoding part of the problem but that there is another problem which\nis how well suited the fitness space is to guiding evolution from\nsimple to more complex &#39;critters&#39;.\n\nSo if I take you example of vision and the various levels (V1-V5 or\nwhatever), if I ask NEAT or HyperNEAT to distinguish between a picture\nof a ball and a cube it&#39;s going to have problems because the only\nfeedback is right/wrong, so any clever little tricks that evolution\nencountered that may ultimately have been useful to the final task are\ndiscarded because they didn&#39;t improve fitness. I always try and think\nabout what&#39;s going on in natural evolution and there we know (or are\nfairly sure) that eyes started out as primitive light sensors just\ndetecting light and dark and not much else, and gradually the\nstructure of the eye will have co-evolved with the visual processing\nparts of the brain such that finer detail could be processed to\nprovide more information (recognise objects of increasing complexity).\nAs an aside IMO it&#39;s highly likely that intelligence got a boost by\nway of non-visual parts of the brain &#39;borrowing&#39; functionality from\nthis hierarchical processing going on (which isn&#39;t strictly\nhierarchical as I think there are signals going down from high to low\nlevels guiding low level recognition in an iterative manner).\n\nAaaanyway. I figure we can simulate this aspect of nature by providing\na range of tasks of increasing complexity, this has been tried by\ntestign against f1 and then moving onto f2, etc when some fitness\nthreshold is reached (incremental evolution). That has the benefit of\nnot having to evaluate against multiple fitness functions (slowing\nthings down), but I think the idea of weighting them is potentially a\nmore powerful and generalised form of incremental evolution. It also\nprevents you entir epopulation clustering around a few &#39;easy&#39; regions\nof teh search space as we can punish fitness based on density of\ncritters in some region (adjusted fitness = fitness / density_at(x,y).\n\nDensity I figure is derived from distance of K nearest neighbours. So\nyou can imagine each critter has a circle of influence and if lots of\ncritters are nearby they&#39;re all competing for &#39;food&#39; (or whatever) so\nare less fit than if they were by themselves and had no competition\nfor all of the nearby food.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
