Has any of this type of\n&gt; analysis been done?

This is exactly the \nperspective I was trying to argue we should change.  The question is \nnot whether it could perform as well with 25% less structure, but \nwhy would we care if it did?  The goal of systems like that, that \ntry to prune down at the end of evolution to a small &quot;good&quot; \nsolution, is just to find a final solution that looks good.  But the \npoint of NEAT is that *every* networks you evaluate over the course \nof all of evolution has a cost.  What&#39;s important is that on average \nover all of evolution we are minimizing the space we have to search \nthrough.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
