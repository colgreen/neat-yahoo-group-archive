It&#39;s\nthe particular method of subdividing the population as a way of doing\nit that I&#39;m questioning.\n\n&gt; However, I am not completely sure what you are suggesting because\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how you classify an individual as &quot;evolutionarily\n&gt; younger?&quot; Isn&#39;t every individual evolutionarily descended from the\n&gt; first generation and therefore all equivalent in this respect?\n\nAn offspring in Generation 10 is younger or newer than a member of\nGeneration 1. Every new offspring exhibits innovation, unless it&#39;s an\nexact copy of a network that has appeared previously, correct?\n\n&gt; While I may not understand the proposed remedy, part of your\n&gt; argument was philosophical in terms of what speciation really means,\n&gt; and I see where you are coming from on that. Yet I do believe that\n&gt; what is going on in NEAT is justifiably analogous to natural\n&gt; speciation in the way that you question. While you point out that\n&gt; everyone in NEAT is competing on the same fitness function and\n&gt; therefore it is not really like nature, I would disagree. In\n&gt; nature, there is also only one fitness function, which is &quot;to\n&gt; reproduce.&quot; All species are just variations on ways of getting that\n&gt; done. In analogy, all species in NEAT are variations on ways of\n&gt; getting done whatever it is the fitness function requires.\n&gt; A &quot;niche&quot; in this sense means an alternate means to accomplish a\n&gt; task, which is an idea well suited to different topologies and\n&gt; weights that do the same thing in different ways.\n\nJust depends on how fine you slice the fitness function. Sure every\nindividual is trying to perpetuate its genes, but typically a niche\nrefers to exploiting different resources. A hawk and a fish are both\ntrying to perpetuate their genes, but they are solving a myriad of\ndifferent problems to achieve that goal.\n\nIf you had animats in a simulated environment, and you used NEAT to\nevolve their behavior, and some learned to forage off artificial\nplants, while others evolved to eat other individuals, I&#39;d consider\nthose clearer niches, but I agree its a fuzzy concept open to\ninterpretation.\n\n&gt; I also do not fully understand the assertion that &quot;All chromosomes\n&gt; in NEAT can potentially mate with one another.&quot; NEAT was highly\n&gt; influenced by the competing conventions problem, which had been a\n&gt; known pathology in neuroevolution for many years. It was perhaps\n&gt; the worst of all problems with such sustems. The problem is of\n&gt; course exacerbated by differing topologies as well as weights. The\n&gt; competing conventions problem is actually a very deep problem\n&gt; because there are indeed inviduals that have no hope of mating\n&gt; effectively, which is evidenced all over nature. A bird and pig\n&gt; will never yield a flying pig, even through some kind of artificial\n&gt; insemination or chimeric hybridization. They should simply not be\n&gt; mating with each other (since it would waste precious evaluations\n&gt; from a computational standpoint, not to mention the ethical\n&gt; disaster).\n&gt;\n&gt; It was well known that enormous damage was being inflicted in non-\n&gt; speciated neuroevolving populations wherein similar bird-pig-like\n&gt; mating events were happening routinely. Thus, just because one can\n&gt; align genes optimally does not mean one should if species have\n&gt; diverged too far afield.\n\nAgain it just might be a matter of degree. Are networks in different\nspecies in NEAT really as practically different as a pig and a bird?\n\n&gt; In any case, it is probably wise to question the precise mechanisms\n&gt; through which NEAT accomplishes or aims to accomplish these ends,\n&gt; and I would not be surprised if competitive alternatives arise.\n&gt; However, I do still believe that the underlying motivations make\n&gt; good sense.\n\nOh, I think speciation in evolutionary algorithms was a conceptual\ninnovation. I was just thinking aloud about other possible simpler\nways to accomplish what is ostensibly the main goal of speciation: to\nprotect innovation.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
