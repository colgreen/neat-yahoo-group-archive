With modern versions of the libraries and gcc, there are a nu=\r\nmber of \nbuild problems you run into. There are two big things that I can p=\r\noint to as \na start.  First is that you must have version 1 of gtkmm.  You =\r\nhave 2.4.  \nAlso, you should go through and change the headers to the newer=\r\n format.  For \nexample, everywhere that you see \n\t#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;\nyou=\r\n want to change that to simply be \n\t#include &lt;iostream&gt; \n\nFrom there, make =\r\nthe appropriate changes, fixing errors as they show up in the \ncompilation.=\r\n  If you are not comfortable working in c++, it is difficult \nundertaking. =\r\n Since I did not particularly like having multiple versions of \ngtkmm on my=\r\n machine, and never was comfortable with swig and guile, I just \ndecided to=\r\n redo the visuals and front end in QT.  Still not quite done with \nthat.  R=\r\neworking from scratch seems to be cleaner and easier than just \ndebugging t=\r\nhe compilation however.  Your milage may vary however.\n\nAnother alternative=\r\n may just be to install an older version of Debian.  You \ncould also use on=\r\ne of the other implementations available to play with.  \n\n-- \n\nMark Ahlstro=\r\nm\n\n"}}
