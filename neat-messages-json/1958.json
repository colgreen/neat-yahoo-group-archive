I would like to do some\n&gt;simple 2-D graphics, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s\n&gt;available.\n\nI would recommend one of two libraries:-\n\n1. SDL (the Simple Directmedia Layer, www.libsdl.org) which is open \nsource and portable to just about everything, along with the SDL_gfx \nlibrary which adds the usual line, circle, etc. graphics primitives. \nThere are lots of other libraries which add bells and whistles and a \nlarge user-base. This is the library I&#39;m using at the moment.\n\n...or...\n\n2. Allegro (http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/) which has high-level \ngraphics primitives built in, and therefore needs less work to get it \nworking than SDL, but it&#39;s less portable. Porting between Windows and \nLinux shouldn&#39;t be too hard, though. It has a smaller user-base, but \nthere is help out there if you need it.\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
