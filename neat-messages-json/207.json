The idea of adaptive topology is very\nappealing to me, but the C++ implementation is not. \nThe other features of NEAT are also of great interest,\nincluding speciation and graphical display of\ntopology.   It would be a big hurdle for me to learn\nenough C++ as well as understand the details of NEAT. \nI have always found it difficult to read other\npeople&#39;s code.\n\nMy own software in in C, and takes the approach of\nvery fast execution of simple topologies.  I will be\nreleasing the 4-card puzzle evolver within a week. \nThis is well documented software that shows that a\nrecurrent network with fixed weights can remember past\ninputs and make good use of them.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
