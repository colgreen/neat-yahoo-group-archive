It&#39;s\nalso very interesting to hear that you have had success with\nabsolutely no sterilization.\n\nThe reason I&#39;m asking all these questions is that I am trying to\nevolve my agents on a particular task at the moment and it is just not\ngetting there.  If I evolve them for 1000 generations, it just won&#39;t\nget there.  It got the solution once but I&#39;ve since added another\ninput so the previous genome is invalid to the project.\n\nThus I am trying to figure out how to avoid this stagnation as I am\nstaring at a population of 500 genomes that simply are not converging\non the correct answer.\n\nQuickly: I am evolving a cat to chase a mouse around a simple 2D maze\n(no dead ends, 16 blocks evenly spaced in the maze to make connected\ncorridors).  I am trying to evolve a cat that learns to remember where\nhe last saw the mouse, so he can go there and continue the search. \nBut it just won&#39;t converge.  If he sees the mouse he can catch it just\nfine but as soon as the mouse goes out of view, it collapses.  I&#39;ve\nused incremental learning to teach one thing at a time but when I\nsetup the out-of-sight mouse experiment, it just won&#39;t converge.\n\nIf the solution doesn&#39;t lie in correcting these niggly bits of NEAT\nthen I&#39;ll start re-thinking the scenario I&#39;m using to test in. \nPerhaps no matter how I fiddle with the parameters of NEAT it still\nwon&#39;t converge.\n\nMike\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Wed, 30 Mar 2005 18:16:31 -0000, gerbopel &lt;redcrocodile@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; There is _certainly_ no shortage of options, but I do feel that I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; basically just throwing darts at a board deciding what to try next and\n&gt; &gt; each &quot;attempt&quot; takes me a day or so to fully test out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s brutal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike, you&#39;ve noted that you&#39;ve already performed some successful runs\n&gt; in XOR and your domain.  Philip and I reimplemented NEAT in Java (ANJI\n&gt; is our implementation), and we learned quite a bit from this process. \n&gt; Even though Ken did a great job explaining his algorithm in his\n&gt; initial paper, it is nearly impossible to cover every implementation\n&gt; detail.  We had LOTS of questions for Ken, and he helped immensely.\n&gt; \n&gt; But one of the more important things I think we got out of it is that\n&gt; many of the implementation details are simply not crucial.  I think\n&gt; Ken did a good job with the ablation experiments to verify the\n&gt; important aspects of NEAT, but we&#39;ve found that as along as it\n&gt; includes the main components, some of the more detailed implementation\n&gt; aspects don&#39;t really impact performance all that much.\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to go back and read some of the messages around #1205,\n&gt; where we indicate that with ANJI, we didn&#39;t implement stagnation\n&gt; penalties at all!  We still haven&#39;t done so.  We also don&#39;t cap the\n&gt; number of species in the population (I&#39;m not sure if the\n&gt; implementation you&#39;re working on does this).  And there is quite a bit\n&gt; of turnover in the population, and older species dying off as they&#39;re\n&gt; replaced by fitter ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; And we&#39;ve had very good success in all but the most difficult domains\n&gt; we&#39;ve tried.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, if you&#39;re saying that the algorithm is working reasonably well,\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t get hung up on trying to implement NEAT down to every last\n&gt; detail.  It&#39;s a pretty robust algorithm, and as long as you&#39;ve got the\n&gt; core, you&#39;ll probably do fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n\n"}}
