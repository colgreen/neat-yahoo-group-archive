After a couple of days exploring your code, specifically\n&gt;the OCR experiment,  I want to complement you on the nice package you\n&gt;have put together.  Very professionally coded and commented.  I was\n&gt;particularly impressed you went to the trouble to write alternate\n&gt;constructors for many of the classes. This level of quality is tough\n&gt;to maintain when working on a tool primarily for one&#39;s own benefit or\n&gt;learning.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n[Blush]\n\nHi Carl,\n\nThanks for the positive comments. I do try and maintain a certain degree \nof &#39;quality&#39; in the code I write, so it&#39;s nice when folks such as \nyourself pick up on this. I try and hold to the principle that if a \njob&#39;s worth doing then it&#39;s worth doing properly. A concept that was \nreinforced within me by reading Zen & The Art of Motercycle Maintenance \na couple of years ago. :) Actually I think about this stuff all the \ntime, mainly as a consequence of trying to write software in a \ncommercial environment where the concept is somewhat alien. ho hum.\n\n&gt;It&#39;s been well over a year since I did anything serious with C# and\n&gt;it&#39;s nice to get back in tune &lt;wink&gt; with the language.  Like you, I\n&gt;think the MS team that designed the language did a very good job of\n&gt;cleaning up C++ and the libraries and enjoy working in the C# environment.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI was very skeptical of MS at first, but came around in the end. Miguel \nde Icaza (top man at the Mono project) even suggested that .Net could \nbecome a standard platform for Linux software development.\n\n&gt;Along with the SharpNEAT system, I downloaded the handful of articles\n&gt;on the site.  Have you written any &quot;user documentation&quot; along the\n&gt;lines of &quot;Design Your Own Experiment&quot; or do I dive in and learn by\n&gt;your examples?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI haven&#39;t but I ought to. I started updating the web site with the \nintention of adding a HOW TO type page, but as is often the way I got \ndistracted. In the mean time yeh have a look at the existing \nexperiments, hopefully everything should be /reasonably/ easy to \nunderstand. I recommend you grab the pre-release zip file I posted on \nthe list recently, the way experiments are put together was modified to \nallow for co-evolution experiments.\n\n&gt;Thanks for all the work you have contributed.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
