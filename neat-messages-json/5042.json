Beware though, it =\r\nuses s**tload of memory (around 700Mb) for a population of 25 organisms and=\r\n 3001 inputs (bias is the first) & 150 outputs. It takes around 15 minutes =\r\non a 2 GHZ computer to run 100 generations. Run the test program and choose=\r\n the HUGE test.\n\nPatch v0.7 and grab neat.c neat.h error.h and include them=\r\n in your project. Have a look at test.c to see how to use. Note that only F=\r\need Forward networks are possible to evolve after patching, due to my lazin=\r\ness for the moment :)\n\n/Magnus\n\n\n"}}
