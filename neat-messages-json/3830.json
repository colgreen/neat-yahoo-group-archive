That is, just because some \n&gt; thi=\r\nngs change or are updated more than others during learning does \n&gt; not impl=\r\ny that they should continue to do so or even that it was a \n&gt; good idea in =\r\nthe first place (because the problem might be \n&gt; deceptive).  It&#39;s a pretty=\r\n complicated topic but I think the \n&gt; fundamental issue is that evolutionar=\r\ny computation is effective in \n&gt; part because it avoids trying to excplicit=\r\nly assign credit to the \n&gt; separate parts of a solution.  So when we move t=\r\no trying to extract \n&gt; explicit information about what belongs with what, w=\r\ne are somewhat \n&gt; undoing this implicit appeal.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, the idea=\r\n that solutions need some kind of modularity \n&gt; or at least a pattern behin=\r\nd them makes sense.  It&#39;s just the \n&gt; approach that is the tricky issue.  H=\r\nave you taken a look at \n&gt; HyperNEAT?  It is able to evolve networks with l=\r\narge-scale patterns \n&gt; that can be modular to varying degrees.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;christofer_fransson&quot; \n&gt; &lt;christofer_fransso=\r\nn@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The human brain has different areas t=\r\nhat solve different kind of\n&gt; &gt; problems. My question is if you think it is=\r\n a good idea to try\n&gt; &gt; encouraging a network to divide a problem into smal=\r\nler sub \nproblems\n&gt; &gt; and then solve it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is my thought:\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; - Let say that every neuron has 3 coordinates (x,y,z) \n&gt; &gt; - Assuming t=\r\nhat you can tell which neurons were performing well \nin \n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; epoch \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (Backprop run, network weights that didn&#39;t have to be changed \nmuch \n&gt; e=\r\ntc)\n&gt; &gt; - All those nodes should &quot;gravitate&quot; towards each other\n&gt; &gt; - Nodes=\r\n close to each other have a higher probability to form a\n&gt; &gt; connection.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The result should be a network that in someway tries to be \nmodular.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Next step should be to see if it is possible to do individual \n&gt; train=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; of different areas of the network.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I mean when you learn m=\r\nath and when you are painting, different \n&gt; areas\n&gt; &gt; of the brain is activ=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Comments?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Br,\n&gt; &gt; Christofer\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
