I will=\r\n be ever so  grateful or any  suggestions would be\n&gt; highly appreciated.\n\nH=\r\ni Ramen,\n\nIf you haven&#39;t already, I&#39;d suggest reading Ken&#39;s paper &quot;Evolving=\r\n a\nRoving Eye for Go&quot;\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04\n\nas =\r\nwell as our paper &quot;Evolving a Neural Network Active Vision System\nfor Shape=\r\n Discrimination&quot;.  The first describes Ken&#39;s approach to\napplying a roving =\r\neye paradigm to small-board Go and scaling up to\nslightly larger boards.  T=\r\nhe second describes how our version of the\nroving (or &quot;floating&quot;) eye is im=\r\nplemented, at a fairly high level of\ndescription.\n\nThen you might want to p=\r\noke around the code.  Here are the ANJI javadocs:\n\nhttp://anji.sourceforge.=\r\nnet/javadoc/index.html\n\nAll the stuff that handles the eye is in the com.an=\r\nji.floatingeye\npackage.  Logic for playing ANNs against each other or again=\r\nst\nhand-coded algorithms is in com.anji.tournament, and logic specific to\nT=\r\nic-Tac-Toe is in com.anji.ttt.\n\nWe implemented the floating eye for scannin=\r\ng any 2D surface, but have\nnot yet applied it specifically to board games, =\r\nalthough I&#39;m going to\ntry to implement this for 9x9 Go next semester for my=\r\n first-year\nproject, so please let me know how you&#39;re progressing.  Carryin=\r\ng on\nthe discussion through the list is probably a good idea, so that\nother=\r\ns who might be working on similar issues can chime in or simply\nreference t=\r\nhe thread.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
