(url: \n&gt; http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/user/Antonia.J.Jones/GammaArchive/IndexPage.htm )\n&gt; \n&gt; basically it is a way of making a (fast) good guess at what the noise \n&gt; variation from a non-linear function in a data set is, without knowing \n&gt; what the actual function is.\n&gt; \n&gt; the main application she made to neural nets is that if you have an\nidea \n&gt; of what the noise variance is you can know when to stop training your \n&gt; net to prevent overtraining, thus arriving at a faster, better solution.\n&gt; \n\nSo basically this idea would be useful in classification problems\nright?  I can&#39;t really picture how you&#39;d apply it to control.\n\nBy the way how is grad school?  Do you talk to a lot of NN/EC people\nthere?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
