I think a C#\n&gt;implementation of NEAT would be great, and also I agree doing you own\n&gt;implementation will be educational. \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nthanks!\n\n&gt;Before I answer your questions, the general rule should be that all\n&gt;input nodes and all output nodes are always copied from parent(s) to\n&gt;child.  However, only hidden nodes that are connected to an inherited\n&gt;link should be copied to children.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nok that makes sense. If a node is not being connected to then throw it \naway. We can always add more in later. If I do go the way of \ndistinguishing between input, hidden and output nodes then I would \nprobably place the 3 node types in 3 different Vector(ArrayList in C#) \nstructures - this avoids the additional task of having to seperate them \nout each time we want to decode the Genone into a Network\n\n&gt;&gt;Some questions then:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;1) I see from your recent email that you (optionally) allow input \n&gt;&gt;nodes to be removed. Do you also allow input nodes to be added?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In general, the previous posting was not meant to imply that input\n&gt;nodes are allowed to be removed.  They really should never be removed\n&gt;or added.  There should always be a constant set of possible inputs. \n&gt;However, it is possible to start out with some *disconnected* input\n&gt;nodes, which later get &quot;added&quot; in the sense that a new connection\n&gt;appears that links them into the network.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGot it. This really goes back to my previous email - we can consider \ninput nodes to be connection points for the NN rather than proper \nworking nodes. Do you agree?\n\n\n&gt;&gt;4) Not really a question, just an observation. In your original\n&gt;&gt;\n[...]\n\n&gt;&gt;It is true that only connection genes are used in measuring\n&gt;&gt;compatibility, since as you observe connections never change the nodes\n&gt;&gt;to which they connect.  Thus they are a sufficient set to determine\n&gt;&gt;the network topology and compatibility.  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nUnderstood.\n\n&gt;&gt;It is also true that I used the same class NNode for node genes and\n&gt;&gt;for actual neurons.  However, it is a subtle, but actually the NNodes\n&gt;&gt;inside actual NN&#39;s are not literally the same NNodes in the genome. \n&gt;&gt;In other words, the NNodes in the networks are created separately,\n&gt;&gt;although they do contain an &quot;analogue&quot; pointer back to the node gene\n&gt;&gt;from which they were created.  Actually, I regret this slightly\n&gt;&gt;confusing programming decision.  It would have been easier to\n&gt;&gt;understand had a used a separate class for &quot;node genes&quot; and &quot;actual\n&gt;&gt;neurons.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nMy own philosophy (which often changes!) is that clear code is \npreferable to optimized/fast code, at least where experimentation is \ninvolved. Looking back at the EANN work I did 4 years ago was quite an \neye opener I can tell you :)\n\n&gt;Good luck with your project.   Don&#39;t be discouraged if it&#39;s a bit of a\n&gt;learning curve starting up.  I&#39;m sure several here can vouch that\n&gt;after the initial framework gets put in place things get easier and \n&gt;more interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAh well I think it&#39;s fair to say I&#39;m not a /complete/ novice in this \narea but I appreciate the encouragment all the same, cheers!\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
