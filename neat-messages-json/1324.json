Here&#39;s what I came up with...\n\nIf you consider the origin of a (3D) cartesian coordinate system with \nvectors coming out at all angles in all 3 dimensions you have a sort of \nspikey sphere. You could then calculate the cross product of each of \nthese vectors with every other vector, and this should give you a good \nenough set of examples for the neural net search to be able to \nspecialize and also to cover every possible set of vectors that we might \nwant to find a cross product for.\n\nBy my thinking the smallest set of vectors that fits the above scheme \nwould have a set of vectors all seperated by 45 degrees, e.g. if we \nthink of one plane at a time, here is the x,y plane (z=0):\n\n                    View this in Courier New font if it looks a mess!\n            y\n         &#92;  |  /\n          &#92; | /\n           &#92;|/ \n      ------------ x\n                             / | &#92;\n                           /   |   &#92;\n                         /     |     &#92;\n\n\nHere we have 8 vectors, each seperated by 45 degrees. If we then take \nthis set of vectors and rotate it about the x axis by 45 degrees we get \nanother set of vectors - repeat this two more times and you end up with \n26 vectors in all 3 dimensions that are evenly spread out and that form \na spikey sphere :)\n\nIf we then compare each vector against itself and all of the others this \nthen makes 26*26=676 test cases. Remember that we should compare each \nvector with itself so that we can be sure the network learns to generate \nthe zero vector when comparing parallel vectors.\n\nOf course it might be necessary to use an even larger set of vectors to \nimprove the accuracy of the evolved network - I don&#39;t know, but I think \nthe set described above is an absolute minimum.\n\nI hope that was clear enough and helps out a bit,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
