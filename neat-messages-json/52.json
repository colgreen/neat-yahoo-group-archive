In my final Semester I \nworked on a research project which combined NEAT with an agent \nmodelling system Repast. I also attempted cooperative coevolution \nwith a team of three predators attempting to catch a prey.\n\nIf your interested in what I&#39;ve done you can check out my paper:\n\nhttp://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~jovincen/report2003.pdf\n\n(I&#39;m hoping that compy doesnt have any spelling mistakes :)\n\nI combined Ugo&#39;s JNEAT code with Repast. My system isn&#39;t exactly \nuser friendly at the moment. There is a lot I&#39;d like to fix. I could \nput something up if people were really really really interested :P\n\nAlthough I do keep putting it off (I&#39;m teaching myself Vis \nStudio .NET atm ... i know its the dark side but I gotta eat :P)\n\nMy interest in NEAT at the moment however is purely for fun. I am \nconsidering honours next year but I dont think this will be the \ncase. (I shudder at one more year of school).\n\nI would like to continue my experiements to see if indeed I can find \na solution to my problem. I didnt have enough time in my research \nproject :S\n\nAlso, I would like one of those shiny new apple&#39;s (fastest desktop \ncomputer or something like that).. Normally I avoid apples but my \nexperiements take weeks to get anywhere.. :D\n\nfeel free to contact me should you have any questions. I&#39;ll see what \nI can do.\n\ncheers,\nJono\n\np.s. Has anyone considered a Non-Yahoo (ie, no annoying adds) forum \nfor our little club? \n \n\n\n"}}
