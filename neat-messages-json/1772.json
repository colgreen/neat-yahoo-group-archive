I\ndon&#39;t \n&gt; think the eye in your paper used rotation did it Ken? Not to mention\nthe \n&gt; zooming function which may or may not be useful depending on the\ntype of \n&gt; board game.\n&gt; \n\nMy roving eye actually was able to rotate by 90 degree increments. \nHowever, it could not zoom, as you note.  \n\nFor robot/agent control domains like prey capture, I think the best\nkinds of sensors are rangefinders or radars, like in my robot duel\nwork.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
