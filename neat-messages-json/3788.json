It would be really cool to see how either of those\n&gt;  suggestions works. Even cooler would be a comparison of the two. My guess is\n&gt;  that the separate, co-evolved strategy would work better because it would be\n&gt;  less constrained.\n\nPossibly but I think Ken makes a good point about the activation fn\nselection re-using the regularities inherent in the connection weight\ngenerating CPPN. If we don&#39;t need to re-use those regularities then\nthe CPPN can evolve connections to the activation fn output(s) that\nare completely isolated from the connection weight (sub)network.\n\n\n&gt;  Do you have any test problems in mind? Problems that require the use of many\n&gt;  different types of activation functions?\n\n\nThis goes back to a discussion ages ago about using neurons with\ndifferent activation functions or neurons with multiple input\nconnection points (collectors?) with each collector totalling its\ninput and feeding a parameter into diffeerent activation functions.\nE.g. you might have a neuron with two collectors and the activation\nfunction might be to multiply the inputs from the two collectors.\n\nSuch a model would perhaps be a good generalisation of both\ntraditional artificial neural nets and Genetic Programming. At some\npoint I did have a think about where CPPNs fit in with that idea and I\nthink using extra outputs from a CPPN to specify activation functions\nper node is part of the answer. Thinking about it some more now I can\nalso see that in addition to an x,y target coordinate being output\nfrom a CPPN we could also have a collector index output as well. So\nx,y --&gt; x,y,c\n\nReally you need a flexible codebase to play about with all of these\npossibilities and the various combinations of systems, hence the\nearlier discussion about future SharpNEAT development.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
