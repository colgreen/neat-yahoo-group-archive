I initially modified the strategy by making it randomly select \nfrom the set of available moves at any given point in a game. I have \ntaken this further by building a list of available moves sorted by how \nmany open lines each can participate in, e.g. the center square can \nparticipate in up to 4 different lines (horizontal, vertical, and the \ntwo diagonals), an open line is defined as one that does not yet contain \nany of the opponents pieces. A sort of roulette wheel selection is then \nperformed on this list - it is currently heavily weighted towards the \ngood moves, but the chance of selecting the best move is not 100%.  This \nstrategy is incorportaed into the existing ones of always playing a \nwinning move, blocking an opponent winning move, forking and fork \nblocking strategies.\n\nWhat this does is provide a more varied range of play, that hopefully \nwill help evolve more robust players. In fact the weighting described \nabove could be adjusted to create anything from very good to very bad \nplayers, but hopefully they won&#39;t be quite as predictable as the current \nset of players - although I am keeping them as part of the evaluation.\n\nThis extra player hasn&#39;t greatly improved the evolved networks so far, \nalthough some experimenting with the above startegy is still required.\n\n\n2) Phased searching - The current plan then is to implement the &#39;phased \nsearch&#39; technique discussed on this groups a while ago, and to see if it \nis able evolve better players. Before I do this though I want to \nimplement a more simple problem domain, one that is fast to evaluate so \nthat experiments can be run a lot faster....\n\n\n3)OCR - Optical Character Recognition. The plan is to expose a set of 2D \nbitmaps, in turn, to the inputs of an NN. The number of outputs will \nreflect the number of 2D maps in the current set, so that the NN can \nindicate which character it &#39;thinks&#39; it is looking at by setting the \nappropriate output high. Straightforward and hopefully very fast. Also \nthe problem difficulty can be adjusted by changing the set size, the \ndata in the sets and the dimensions of each character.  Using such a \nscheme allows us to very rapidly increase the input/output space - which \nwe know is going to cause NEAT difficulties. I can then experiment on \nthis domain with phased searching switched on to see if it improves the \nNNs we can generate.\n\n\nI was also thinking that I could provide a set of shapes in various \norientations and evolve NNs that are able to pick out the same shape in \nit&#39;s different orientations. Perhaps some background reading is in order \nhere as there are probably loads of other variations on these schemes \nthat I /could/ do.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
