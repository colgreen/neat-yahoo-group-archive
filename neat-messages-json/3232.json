The =\r\n\napplication is a roving eye visual discrimination system. \nThe CPPNs use s=\r\nigmoids, gaussians and sine activation functions. The \nsubstrate space is 3=\r\nD cartesian. \nThe results are a bit disappointing, so I am looking for answ=\r\ner why. \nI set up the substrate like this - the inputs are organized in a N=\r\nxN \ngrid on the Z =3D=3D -1 plane, N is currently 11. The hidden nodes are =\r\n\narranged in a circular manner on the Z =3D=3D 0 plane, and the outputs \nar=\r\ne arranged the same on the Z =3D=3D 1 plane. \nThe eye learns to distinguish=\r\n between a square and a circle very \neasy, but things got weird when I incr=\r\neased the complexity of the \ntask - it had to learn to distinguish the targ=\r\net shape regardless of \nits position. \nIt never learned that. The eye is mo=\r\nving and zooming chaotic, without \nconcentrating on the shape&#39;s corners or =\r\nsomething like that, but \nswitches state and flees when some pixel on the r=\r\netina is set.. I \nhope you can imagine this. \nI hope you may help me find w=\r\nhat is the problem. The problem may be \nthe substrate configuration or dime=\r\nnsionality, or the NEAT parameters \n(which I checked and didn&#39;t find anythi=\r\nng strange)... \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
