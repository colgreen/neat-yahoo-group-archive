Additionally, methods from\ncomputational intelligence promise to have a big impact on game\ndevelopment, assisting designers and developers and enabling new types\nof computer games. The 2010 IEEE Conference on Computational\nIntelligence and Games brings together leading researchers and\npractitioners from academia and industry to discuss recent advances\nand explore future directions in this quickly moving field.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n    * Learning in games\n    * Coevolution in games\n    * Neural-based approaches for games\n    * Fuzzy-based approaches for games\n    * Player/Opponent modeling in games\n    * CI/AI-based game design\n    * Multi-agent and multi-strategy learning\n    * Applications of game theory\n    * CI for Player Affective Modeling\n    * Intelligent Interactive Narrative\n    * Imperfect information and non-deterministic games\n    * Player satisfaction and experience in games\n    * Theoretical or empirical analysis of CI techniques for games\n    * Comparative studies and game-based benchmarking\n    * Computational and artificial intelligence in:\n          o Video games\n          o Board and card games\n          o Economic or mathematical games\n          o Serious games\n          o Augmented and mixed-reality games\n          o Games for mobile platforms\n\nThe conference will consist of a single track of oral presentations,\ntutorial and workshop/special sessions, and live competitions. The\nproceedings will be placed in IEEE Xplore, and made freely available\non the conference website after the conference.\n\nPaper submission deadline March 15\nTutorial and special session proposal deadline January 31\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark\nmail: julian@..., web: http://julian.togelius.com\nmobile: +46-705-192088, office: +45-7218-5277\n\n"}}
