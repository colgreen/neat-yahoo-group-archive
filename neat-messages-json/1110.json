Some thoughts:\n\nIf I understood correctly, you are still activating in time steps.  For a \n5-layer network, you still have to call it 5 times.  Thus, it is taking 5 \ntimes longer than it needs to, and doing 5 times the work.  If you weren&#39;t \ngoing to use generated code, like I did, then you would want to build an \nin-memory data structure that you could step through quickly and easily so \nthat you could activate only once.  You would only have to build that \nstructure once.  How many times you need to activate the network determines \nwhether or not you make a return on your investment.\n\nAlso, you are doing all of the sigmoids one after another.  I found a \nsignificant improvement if I did the sigmoid as soon as the data was \navailable for it.  I got better parallelism that way.  You might give it a \ntry.\n\n\n&gt;From: Colin Green &lt;cgreen@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [neat] Neural network optimization details\n&gt;Date: Sun, 20 Jun 2004 16:09:07 +0100\n&gt;\n&gt;For those following the &#39;computation time&#39; thread I have written up the\n&gt;details of the optimizations I have performed on my network code along\n&gt;with some benchmarks. The details are at\n&gt;http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/network_optimization.htm\n&gt;\n&gt;Hopefully this will work, my ISP has a habit of randomly deleting file\n&gt;juts lately!\n&gt;\n&gt;BTW my initial 12x improvement claim has been reduced to 8x, this was\n&gt;due to my not using the code optimization consistently. This is still\n&gt;pretty good though.\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
