Each subfield\nof AI has a differen=\r\nt perspective on intelligence and unspoken\nassumptions about what is critic=\r\nal to recreate it computationally. To\nbetter understand such differences, w=\r\ne aim to bring together a diverse\ngroup of AI researchers interested in dis=\r\ncussing and comparing how\nintelligence and processes that might create it a=\r\nre abstracted in\nvarious subfields. For example, such discussion may includ=\r\ne honest\nexamination of the strengths and weaknesses of different approache=\r\ns,\nand what features of biological intelligence are crucial or\nunnecessary =\r\nto include in algorithms.\n\nWe hope to encourage cross-pollination of ideas =\r\nbetween researchers\nviewing intelligence in different ways (e.g. through th=\r\ne lens of MDPs\nor symbolic manipulation) and at  different levels of abstra=\r\nction\n(e.g. biologically-plausible neural simulations or restricted\nBoltzma=\r\nnn machines). One goal is to facilitate  revising or creating\nnew abstracti=\r\nons of intelligence and intelligence-generating\nprocesses. More information=\r\n can be found here:\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/AAAISymposium2013/\n\nContrib=\r\nutions related to how intelligence can or should be abstracted\nalgorithmica=\r\nlly in artificial intelligence research are invited.\nExtended abstracts tha=\r\nt summarize the results of a research program\nalong these lines are most we=\r\nlcome, as are personal position papers or\ncontributions describing speculat=\r\nive work or work in progress. Works\nbridging traditionally separate AI para=\r\ndigms are encouraged.\nParticipants should be open to inspiration from work =\r\nand ideas in\nother subfields, and be willing to step outside their intellec=\r\ntual\ncomfort zones.\n\nInterested participants are encouraged to submit exten=\r\nded abstracts\n(no more than 2 pages), or full-length papers (up to 6 pages =\r\nin AAAI\nformat) in PDF format to sebastian.risi@.... Accepted\nsubmi=\r\nssions will be published as citable, peer-reviewed papers in the\nAAAI techn=\r\nical report.\n\nAreas of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n- Differen=\r\nt levels and types of knowledge representation and reasoning\n- Abstractions=\r\n of the following:\n   - Neural networks (e.g. deep learning networks, spiki=\r\nng ANNs, and\nplastic ANNs)\n   - Learning (e.g. machine learning and reinfor=\r\ncement learning)\n   - Biological development (e.g. generative and developme=\r\nntal\nsystems, and developmental robotics)\n   - Evolutionary search (e.g. di=\r\ngital evolution and evolutionary\nalgorithms)\n- Biologically-inspired comput=\r\nation\n   - Evolutionary robotics\n   - Swarm intelligence\n   - Artificial li=\r\nfe\n- Philosophical arguments on characteristics of appropriate abstractions=\r\n for\nAI\n\nThe symposium will be held Friday - Sunday, November 15-17 at the\n=\r\nWestin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, Virginia (adjacent to\nWashington, DC=\r\n).\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.
