In this paper, we argue that\ncomplexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions\nthrough adding new structure, achieves both these goals.  We\ndemonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution\nof Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly\ncomplex neural network architectures.  NEAT is applied to an\nopen-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers\ncompete head to head.  Because the robot duel domain supports a wide\nrange of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an\nescalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying\ncomplexification.  When compared to the evolution of networks with\nfixed structure, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more\nsophisticated strategies.  The results suggest that in order to\ndiscover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in\ngeneral, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize. \n\nThe article is available via:\n   \n -- comp.ai.jair.papers (also see comp.ai.jair.announce)\n\n -- World Wide Web: The URL for our World Wide Web server is\n       http://www.jair.org/\n    For direct access to this article and related files try:\n       http://www.jair.org/abstracts/stanley04a.html\n\n -- Anonymous FTP from Carnegie-Mellon University (USA):\n        ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/project/jair/volume21/stanley04a.ps\n    The compressed PostScript file is named stanley04a.ps.Z \n\nFor more information about JAIR, visit our WWW or FTP sites, or\ncontact jair-ed@...\n\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
