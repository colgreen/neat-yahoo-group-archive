I realise this \nis a special case, you would normaly see some minimal fitness in the \ninitial population and hence no problem.\n\nPossible solutions then.\n1) Precalculate the size of the population, test for the zero case and \nif so then keep the original species sizes.\n2) Define a minimum fitness greater than 0. This is a bit bit of a hack \nthough really.\n3) Keep generating initial populations until a none zero fitness occurs.\n\nThoughts?\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
