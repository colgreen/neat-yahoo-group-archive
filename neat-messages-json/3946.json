I&#39;ve done something similar \nfor poker, and can tell you that it certainly makes the evaluation vs. \nhuman players much easier.  There are tools like AutoIt that let you \nwrite high-level scripts to do these kind of things automatically.\n\nWesley\n\nJason Gauci wrote:\n&gt; Hey Stephen,\n&gt;\n&gt; Great questions!  We&#39;ll have to think about some of them for awhile\n&gt; but here&#39;s a few answers:\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason why I chose to use a separate output for each connection\n&gt; layer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is because I wanted to\n&gt; separate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D CPPN method,\n&gt; then the two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;z&#39;. \n&gt; Because I&#39;m only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\n&gt; layer did some unique processing.  If there was only one output, it\n&gt; would be harder for the connection layers to distinguish themselves as\n&gt; they would be too dependent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs are\n&gt; not used and the two layers are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\n&gt; empirical tests on which method is better so I do not have any\n&gt; evidence to back my claim, but it&#39;s my intuition.\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents other than Xcheckers.  I have\n&gt; had my friends and people in the lab play against the HyperNEAT\n&gt; opponent and it is definitely better than all of us :-).  I would like\n&gt; to release a binary version so people can play the opponents at\n&gt; different generations and see the change in performance.\n&gt;\n&gt; One active area of interest is to figure out how good a HyperNEAT\n&gt; player is in a global sense.  In Chellapilla & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\n&gt; played human opponents in checkers on MSN Gaming Zone online and got\n&gt; an expert rating on that game server.  The problem with this is that\n&gt; it is very time consuming to play games by hand. It would not be\n&gt; feasible for me to test several individuals in this way.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have experimented with coevolution, but I need to solve the\n&gt; aforementioned problem before I can say anything about the performance\n&gt; of the evolved individuals.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with you new results with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt;&gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural to me?\n&gt;&gt; * Was more than one CPPN configuration tried?
