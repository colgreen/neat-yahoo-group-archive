(for example, the neuroevolution parameters)  If so, then it\nmay be necessary to more closely compare your newer version with the\nworking version of JNEAT, and see where the difference is.  Some basic\nthings to check:\n\n-Is your version creating more than one species?  If not, that\nindicates a bug in speciation.\n-Is your version adding new structure, i.e. are networks getting\nbigger?  If not, there may be a bug there.\n\nThe reason these questions matter is because it sounds like for some\nreason you aren&#39;t getting that critical hidden node to appear, which\nmay be because species aren&#39;t being protected, or may be because you\naren&#39;t able to add structure for some reason.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Luca_PI&quot; &lt;wolfgroups@e...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; first of all sorry for my english :)\n&gt; I have imported JNEAT into J#.NET deleting all the graphic\ninterface \n&gt; (dir GUI) using it as a DLL and creating the interface in VB.NET.\n&gt; I have changed only the Vector in ArrayList.\n&gt; After that i try to reproduce the XOR experiment with the original \n&gt; parameter. \n&gt; The result is that the fitness don&#39;t go over 6.25 evry time I start \n&gt; the simulation!\n&gt; NEAT evolve very fast up to 6.23 (in about 4-5 generation) and\nafter \n&gt; go step by step near 6.25 until catching up 6.25 in about 13 \n&gt; generation. after all it doesn&#39;t make nothing.\n&gt; I try to increment the epoch value up to 100 with the same result...\n&gt; There&#39;s a reason to that???\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the answers\n&gt; Luca\n\n\n"}}
