In general this is something you don&#39;t see when \n&gt;you do a normal generational experiment, since you dont see everyone \n&gt;at once, but in NERO since we saw everyone at once, we could see the \n&gt;effect of a high bias.  One theory is that a high bias can easily \n&gt;cause one of the turn outputs to go high with a relatively low \n&gt;weight, making &quot;spinniness&quot; a likely genetic trait.  My conclusion \n&gt;has since been to keep biases below 1.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAn interesting observation. As you say, you don&#39;t normally see what is \ngoing on in the vast majority of simulations, although the population \nmean fitness gives an indication of how fit the population is as a whole \n- but this figure is compilcated by many other factors such as how many \nelite are preserved per gen.\n\nA few well defined benchmark tests would be ideal for providing harder \nevidence to back up this observation. Actually I still use a default \nweigth strength range of +-5, perhaps this range should be reduced also \nby the same reasoning?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
