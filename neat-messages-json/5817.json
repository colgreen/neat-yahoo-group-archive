Whether you match up the nodes or match up the con=\r\nnections, either way the numbers assigned to those nodes or connections mus=\r\nt come from a chronological history of their additions.  The numbers assign=\r\ned to nodes are also historical markings derived from a counter that increm=\r\nents every time a new node appears.\n\nIn most NEAT implementations, both nod=\r\nes and connections receive markings in this way.  The traditional NEAT algo=\r\nrithm uses the connection markings to match up networks, but the node marki=\r\nngs could also be used.  In effect, the history is over-specified when you =\r\nhave both, but there is no harm in that and it generally is a good idea any=\r\nway to mark both nodes and connections so that we can easily understand whe=\r\nn certain structures (i.e. both nodes and connections) appeared relative to=\r\n other structures.\n\nNote that there are some philosophical issues that aris=\r\ne if you really tried to use only node markings.  What happens in that case=\r\n is that it is no longer possible for connections between the same two node=\r\ns in two different individuals to have different markings.  While one might=\r\n argue that such a connection should always have the same marking, I would =\r\npersonally disagree because that is like saying that a protein that arises =\r\nin fish that is used for one purpose is the &quot;same&quot; as a similar protein tha=\r\nt arose independently in humans for an entirely different purpose.  Because=\r\n the aim of these markings is ultimately to figure out how different indivi=\r\nduals are related, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily in our interest to say th=\r\nat such genes are really the &quot;same&quot; when they come from such divergent line=\r\nages with such incompatible purposes.\n\nIn practice, it is likely that the s=\r\nystem would still work okay in either case, since the most important princi=\r\nple is just to keep generally similar structures clustered together.  The m=\r\ninutia of slightly differing approaches will not have major (though they ma=\r\ny have minor) impact.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Thomas Jack &lt;thoma=\r\nsjack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, you could just match up genes during crosso=\r\nver by comparing\n&gt; their [in, out] connection tuples for value equality (av=\r\noiding\n&gt; problems from hash collisions).\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the difference betwee=\r\nn that and the historical marker approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, May 20, 2012 at 12:=\r\n11 AM, Thomas Jack &lt;thomasjack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Suppose that, instead of inc=\r\nrementing a global counter to assign\n&gt; &gt; historical markings to new genes, =\r\nyou just use a consistent hash\n&gt; &gt; function on the connection tuple of [in,=\r\n out] ids. This would mean, I\n&gt; &gt; think, that you don&#39;t have to keep a per-=\r\ngeneration list of structural\n&gt; &gt; mutations, but the historical markers for=\r\n matching structural\n&gt; &gt; mutations will always be the same, across all gene=\r\nrations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there some benefit to the approach described in the NEA=\r\nT\n&gt; &gt; publications that I&#39;m missing, or should this work fine?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One =\r\ndifference is that you can&#39;t differentiate between disjoint and\n&gt; &gt; excess =\r\ngenes, and so lose one of the c1,c2 hyperparameters =97 is this\n&gt; &gt; importa=\r\nnt?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
