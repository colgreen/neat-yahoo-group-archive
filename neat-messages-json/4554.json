Did you try using leaky=\r\n-integrator based \nneurons for the substrate? I found them very useful for =\r\ngenerating \noscillation patterns. Substrates of leaky integrators with tanh=\r\n() \nactivation functions produce oscillations much easier than others. \nHm.=\r\n. I should really try with robots with 3 legs or more.

T.\n&gt; Evolving coordinated ga=\r\nits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Co=\r\nngress on Evolutionary Computing Special \nSection\n&gt; on Evolutionary Robotic=\r\ns, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legged robots show promise for =\r\ncomplex mobility tasks, such as \nnavigating\n&gt; rough terrain, but the design=\r\n of their control software is both \nchallenging\n&gt; and laborious. Traditiona=\r\nl evolutionary algorithms can produce these\n&gt; controllers, but require manu=\r\nal decomposition or other problem\n&gt; simplification because conventionally-u=\r\nsed direct encodings have \ntrouble\n&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regula=\r\nrities and symmetries. Such \nactive\n&gt; intervention is time consuming, limit=\r\ns the range of potential \nsolutions, and\n&gt; requires the user to possess a d=\r\neep understanding of the problem&#39;s\n&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates tha=\r\nt HyperNEAT, a new and \npromising\n&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural=\r\n networks, can evolve \nquadruped gaits\n&gt; without manually decomposing the p=\r\nroblem. Analyses suggest that \nHyperNEAT is\n&gt; successful because it employs=\r\n a generative encoding that can more \neasily\n&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It=\r\n is also one of the first \nneuroevolutionary\n&gt; algorithms that exploits a p=\r\nroblem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which may \naid its\n&gt; performance. We compare=\r\n HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding \ncontrol, and\n&gt; find that HyperNEA=\r\nT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and \nvastly\n&gt; outperforms FT=\r\n-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT \nindividuals\n&gt; are more h=\r\nolistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in \nbetter\n&gt; coordinat=\r\nion of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results suggest \nthat\n&gt; HyperNEAT=\r\n is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for \ncomplex,\n&gt; yet r=\r\negular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
