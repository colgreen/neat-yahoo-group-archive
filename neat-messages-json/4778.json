Then the output field can be another field of the sa=\r\nme dimension where HyperNEAT highlights where it thinks the best hiding pla=\r\nce is.  It will work best if it is trained for specific maps.  That is, it =\r\nwould not generalize to another map than the one on which it was trained.\n\n=\r\nI think this is a good problem for HyperNEAT because it can deal with the h=\r\nigh input dimensionality, and it can also output in high-dimensionality, i.=\r\ne. by highlighting where it thinks a good location to hide is on the map.\n\n=\r\nFor NEAT it would be harder to deal with the dimensionality of inputs and o=\r\nutputs.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shanemcdonaldryan&quot; &lt;shanemcdona=\r\nldryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I am implementing a bot (AI for a video game).
