What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for\n&gt; something to be considered a coupled non-linear oscillators? For\n&gt; example, I am assuming that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\n&gt; part of a coupled non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\n&gt; appropriate for the neurons to be non-leaky? I guess I am curious why\n&gt; having a non-leaky neuron would be the most favorable choice in such a\n&gt; model, or whether it is somehow a matter of definition. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, what are the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n&gt; that would create this kind of system?\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce oscillations\n&gt; reliably, but I am not sure if that is actually anything different\n&gt; from what you are describing or just another instance of the same\n&gt; phenomenon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Vinod K.\n&gt; Valsalam&quot; &lt;vkv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interesting work! I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; &gt; perform on this domain. The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; &gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\n&gt; &gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs. &lt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne&gt;\n&gt; utexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With regard to the discussion about generating oscillations, I used\n&gt; &gt; neither sine wave as input nor leaky integrators. Instead, neural\n&gt; &gt; network controllers with standard sigmoid neurons were modularized to\n&gt; &gt; behave as coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems). As\n&gt; &gt; explained in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; &gt; post, such oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\n&gt; &gt; periodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits. They are easy to\n&gt; &gt; evolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\n&gt; &gt; and trot for quadrupeds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With only minor adjustments to your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; &gt; substrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillators. In fact,\n&gt; &gt; you would get a configuration similar to my modular controllers by\n&gt; &gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint angles and producing\n&gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs. HyperNEAT would then\n&gt; &gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand. I think that\n&gt; &gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if successful would\n&gt; &gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input. BTW, did you find that\n&gt; &gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary to\n&gt; &gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Vinod\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
