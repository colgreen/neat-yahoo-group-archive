But they were mostly \n&gt;   very uninteresting experiments, such as classification.  I think \nthe \n&gt;   most interesting neuroevolution outside of NEAT is coming from \n&gt;   Floreano and his group, who do evolutionary robotics using \n&gt;   neuroevolution.  Our own group from UT also had several \n&gt;   presentations, including one by Faustino Gomez on transferring \n&gt;   neuroevolved controllers to the real world.\n&gt; \n&gt;   It&#39;s true that half of GECCO is Genetic Programming.  That&#39;s \n&gt;   becausee GECCO is a combination of the old GA and GP \nconferences, \n&gt;   which used to be separate.  GP is kind of strange in that it&#39;s \njust \n&gt;   one method yet it is treated like a whole area.  This \ndistinction \n&gt;   between GA and GP may be fading though over the long term as \n&gt;   indirect encoding becomes more prominent.\n&gt; \n&gt;   In fact, attention to indirect encoding was the big thing I \nnoticed \n&gt;   changing at this conference.  For the first time since I started \n&gt;   attending 4 years ago, it got a lot of attention and communities \nare \n&gt;   starting to form.  People seem to have suddenly taken notice \nthat \n&gt;   it&#39;s going to be a big deal.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Coevolution is also getting a lot of attention, but mostly at a \nmore \n&gt;   theoretical level than practical.  Still, there was interesting \nwork \n&gt;   on cooperative and competitive coevolution, which are definitely \n&gt;   both relevant to neuroevolution, and most of the leaders in this \n&gt;   area go to GECCO.\n&gt; \n&gt;   ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; On Tue, 06 Jul 2004 21:04:55 +0100, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; \n&gt;   wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; Did you discover any new NEAT or NEAT like research going on \nor \n&gt;   any\n&gt;   &gt; &gt; interesting commercial connections?\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Not really.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; I attended a &quot;Genetic Algorithms in Industry&quot; tutorial, which \n&gt;   actually\n&gt;   &gt; turned out to be two guys from Dow Chemical, so it was \n&gt;   really &quot;Genetic\n&gt;   &gt; Algorithms in the Chemical Industry&quot;.  They spoke in very \nvague \n&gt;   terms\n&gt;   &gt; for the first half hour, and when they finally put some data \nup on \n&gt;   the\n&gt;   &gt; slides, when someone asked what they were representing, they \n&gt;   mumbled\n&gt;   &gt; something about how they couldn&#39;t say what the graphs actually \n&gt;   showed\n&gt;   &gt; because it was proprietary.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; GECCO is apparently a fusion of different conferences, and it \n&gt;   seemed\n&gt;   &gt; to me that many more of the papers and workshops/tutorials \nwere \n&gt;   geared\n&gt;   &gt; more toward Genetic Programming than any other use of GAs.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; There was an interesting presentation in my LBP session by a \nguy \n&gt;   from\n&gt;   &gt; a company that had successfully used GP techniques to identify\n&gt;   &gt; unexploded ordnance in military artillery ranges that were to \nbe\n&gt;   &gt; converted to civilian use.  I spoke to another guy from \nsomewhere\n&gt;   &gt; called Aerospace Corp who said he was skeptical of ANNs and \nmostly\n&gt;   &gt; looking for GP-based approaches to analyzing aerial and \nsatellite\n&gt;   &gt; photography.  It seems to me that ANN-based approaches to \nthese \n&gt;   sorts\n&gt;   &gt; of fuzzy recognition problems would be more promising than GP\n&gt;   &gt; approaches...so if anything I got a lot of ideas about \npotential\n&gt;   &gt; commercial connections, if anything.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Maybe Ken or Joseph had different experiences, though.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
