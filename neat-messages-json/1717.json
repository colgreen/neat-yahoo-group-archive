In other words, if it asks to zoom, make it zoom a \nlittle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more or a little less than it asked (i.e. add some noise).  If \nit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; asks to rotate, have a probability of slight over or under\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rotation.  Faustino Gomez from our group has shown that model \nnoise\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (noise added to actions) is more effective than noise added to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sensors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s interesting, but counterintuitive.  Wouldn&#39;t that be like\n&gt; &gt; purposely degrading the motor skills of a baby that&#39;s trying to \nlearn\n&gt; &gt; to walk?\n&gt; \n&gt; In a sense yes, but the benefit then is a more robust walking \npattern. \n&gt; One way to think about it is that by adding noise, you&#39;re forcing \nthe \n&gt; network to learn a more general function instead of allowing it to \nget \n&gt; away with the  &quot;simplest possible controller for the test \npatterns&quot; \n&gt; strategy. It is somewhat counterintuitive, however its precisely \nthe \n&gt; same thing as, e.g. the mutation operator in genetic search.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken: by the way that experiment sounds really interesting. Has \nTino \n&gt; published a paper on it yet?\n&gt; \n\nYeah he has a GECCO paper:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID\n(Pubs)=147\n\nIt shows that the kind of noise I&#39;m talking about is the best for \nreal world transfer.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
