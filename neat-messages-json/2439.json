Indeed, I&#39;ve plugged in a very simple\nex=\r\nperiment, and I&#39;m looking at restructuring possibilities as well -\nmainly:\n=\r\n\n- Separating each experimenting onto its own library\n- Initializing said l=\r\nibraries on the fly, not all at once (this would\nprobably save some memory)=\r\n\n- Creating a text &quot;dictionary&quot; of possible experiments, so that the\nnew ex=\r\nperiments can be plugged in without having to recompile the main\nprogram\n\nI=\r\n&#39;m still a bit fuzzy on what some of the experiment parameters mean,\nso I t=\r\nhought that this would help in understanding the overall library\nstructure.=\r\n\n\nI&#39;ll see you on the developers list.\n\n\n-- R.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
