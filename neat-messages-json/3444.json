I believe I asked Karl Lewin=\r\n for permission to do that \n&gt; about three years ago, but he told me the cod=\r\ne wasn&#39;t in suitable \n&gt; condition to be released.  Since then, we seem to h=\r\nave lost touch.  \n&gt; You are correct that he is the one who produced a pytho=\r\nn NEAT version.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I remember others mentioning they were working=\r\n on Python \n&gt; versions of NEAT but I can&#39;t remember who it was.  If someone=\r\n has \n&gt; such a version and wants to make it available, I will be happy to \n=\r\n&gt; link it from my website.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesa=\r\nr G.
