In my informal experiments it didn&#39;t seem to hav=\r\ne a large effect on the overall effectiveness of search. But, the probabili=\r\nstic method is simpler to implement and I like how it directly samples wher=\r\ne search is spending most time in the space of phenotypic behaviors -- whic=\r\nh is the underlying motivation for the archive. \n\nI think you are right, th=\r\nat the threshold version also approximates this sampling process over time,=\r\n and that the slight repulsive force of adding a highly-novel individual to=\r\n the archive in that version may be mitigated by averaging over many neares=\r\nt-neighbors. So overall this implementation detail might not be a determini=\r\nng factor in novelty search&#39;s success or failure in most domains. So, all o=\r\nther things being almost equal, the simpler implementation is the one I ten=\r\nd to favor :)\n\nBest,\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oli=\r\nver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =E2=80=8BHi Joel,\n&gt; \n&gt; Clicked the send button =\r\nbefore I was finished... in addition to previous\n&gt; email:\n&gt; =E2=80=8B\n&gt; *\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;=E2=80=8B\n&gt; That said, the simpler algorithm you suggest is interesting. =\r\nIt seems a bit\n&gt; more greedy in nature and may work well sometimes in pract=\r\nice.

Is there any\n&gt; experimen=\r\ntal evidence to show one is better than the other (at least for\n&gt; some task=\r\ns)? =E2=80=8BIn the paper you linked (&quot;Ef=EF=AC=81ciently Evolving Programs=\r\n\n&gt; through the Search for Novelty&quot;) it says:\n&gt; *&quot;adding a highly novel indi=\r\nvidual to the archive has the disadvantage that\n&gt; it penalizes an area of t=\r\nhe behavior space that may merit further ex\n&gt; ploration.&quot;*\n&gt; But I wonder i=\r\nf the average distance to the k-nearest-neighbours metric\n&gt; isn&#39;t enough to=\r\n avoid this issue for most practical purposes? I suppose KNN\n&gt; can mitigate=\r\n it (more so as K is increased), but won&#39;t do away with it\n&gt; completely lik=\r\ne the probabilistic approach will tend to (apart from the\n&gt; hopefully rare =\r\noccasions when a new highly novel individual is added to the\n&gt; archive).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; On the other hand, perhaps the probabilistic approach might tend to resu=\r\nlt\n&gt; in the search revisiting the same behaviours many times because they\n&gt;=\r\n weren&#39;t added to the archive the first time they were discovered? Again,\n&gt;=\r\n this is just an intuition, I have no idea if this is likely in practice.\n&gt;=\r\n Perhaps a combination of both methods is the safest bet. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=8B=\r\nCheers,\n&gt; Oliver=E2=80=8B\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; T: 0421 972 953 | E: oliver.coleman@... |=\r\n W: http://ojcoleman.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 11 June 2013 08:55, Oliver Coleman &lt;=\r\noliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Joel,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your advice!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Creating pressure for diversity within the population by comparing =\r\nnovelty\n&gt; &gt; among all current members certainly seems like a good idea and =\r\nmakes\n&gt; &gt; intuitive sense.

However, in new implementations\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I=\r\n&#39;ve tended to remove the threshold and instead add any new individual to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; the archive (at the end of a generation) with fixed probability (e.g.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; 0.05%).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Note that this approach is also described in a paper a=\r\npplying novelty\n&gt; &gt;&gt; search to genetic programming (\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://eplex.cs.u=\r\ncf.edu/publications/2010/lehman-gecco10b).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One nice thing about t=\r\nhis approach is that it is easier to understand how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; changing the proba=\r\nbility will influence archive growth than the novelty\n&gt; &gt;&gt; threshold. That =\r\nis, the expectation of growth per generation is just the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; probability o=\r\nf addition (which is a parameter to be chosen by the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experimenter) tim=\r\nes the population size. In contrast, the novelty threshold\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is specifie=\r\nd in terms of a more abstract quantity (i.e. novelty scores),\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and whil=\r\ne this threshold can also be adjusted dynamically to add one or two\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in=\r\ndividuals per generation on average, it can add some complication to the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; implementation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Adding to the archive probabilistically (i.e. =\r\neach new individual has\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some fixed chance of being added to the archiv=\r\ne regardless of how novel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they are) may also be more principled than t=\r\nhe threshold method. In effect,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; adding probabilistically samples unifo=\r\nrmly where search has been and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; creates an accumulating force away from=\r\n behaviors search has been spending\n&gt; &gt;&gt; most effort exploring.

W=\r\nhile it is true that the archive alone provides some information\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about=\r\n where in the space of behaviors has *previously* been searched, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\nopulation gives additional information about where is *currently* being\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; searched.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In other words, it is likely desirable to have th=\r\ne population itself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spread over the space of previously unexplored beh=\r\naviors. If only the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; archive is taken into account, it is possible that=\r\n the population itself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; may converge to searching one novel area of the=\r\n behavior space (where there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are few archive points), which could pote=\r\nntially lead down blind alleys.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When the population is taken into acco=\r\nunt there is some repulsive force\n&gt; &gt;&gt; within the population to maintain di=\r\nversity and explore different novel\n&gt; &gt;&gt; areas of the behavior space -- whi=\r\nch may in general benefit exploring the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; overall search for novelty.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That said, the simpler algorithm y=\r\nou suggest is interesting.
