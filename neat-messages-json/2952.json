I assumed it&#39;s all one needs but maybe there&#39;s other important information.\n\nThe strategies that have evolved so far seem reasonable, i.e. they usually fold more hands with more players, call and raise only with strong hands. Bluffing has also been part of an evolved strategy but it usually seems to die out. Maybe one needs opponent modeling to make bluffing an advantage in the long term?\n\nI&#39;m very excited about all of this, it seems like it should be possible to evolve good poker players. But it&#39;s still very early and it would also be good to get some reference players to evaluate against. Is there any way of playing evolved strategies against already established bots? I think poker academy might offer something along those lines.\n\nThomas\n\n\n-------- Original-Nachricht --------\nDatum: Fri, 16 Feb 2007 22:19:05 +0100\nVon: &quot;Thomas Haferlach&quot; &lt;thomas-haferlach@...&gt;\nAn: neat@yahoogroups.com\nCC: \nBetreff: Re: [neat] Re: Questions about NEAT for poker\n\n&gt; Hi Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently working on evolving a poker bot using a parallel genetic\n&gt; algorithm evolving neural networks under java. I&#39;m not using neat yet as I\n&gt; haven&#39;t had time to parallelise it yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment I&#39;m not doing any explicit opponent modeling but letting the\n&gt; networks pass some values on to the next hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; I represent the hand simply by giving a probability value vs random\n&gt; opponent as input to the net (one continuous and one binned into discrete binary\n&gt; input nodes). I can do this very quickly since I&#39;ve got a large (350MB)\n&gt; lookup table in memory and don&#39;t have to do any on-the-fly hand evaluation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically I&#39;ve just finished the framework (which also allows for non-NN\n&gt; table based strategies, etc) and have evolved the first solutions which\n&gt; definitely look promising.\n&gt; \n&gt; The general idea is that I evolve a network that plays a near optimal game\n&gt; without opponent information and then evolve a second network that\n&gt; modifies the probabilities of the first network&#39;s outputs based on the opponent\n&gt; history. I think modularising is the way to go and not having one monster\n&gt; network doing everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep you posted on how things go as I&#39;m only starting the big\n&gt; evolutionary runs today and tomorrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thomas\n&gt; \n&gt; -------- Original-Nachricht --------\n&gt; Datum: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 20:29:15 -0500\n&gt; Von: &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;feedyurhed@...&gt;\n&gt; An: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; CC: \n&gt; Betreff: Re: [neat] Re: Questions about NEAT for poker\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Sorry Jeff, my 4am emails don&#39;t really get the point across very\n&gt; well.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  When I say having a simulation engine, I am talking about one that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  provides everything needed to an agent.  Things like statistics are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  part of the engine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Whether it&#39;s &quot;too much information&quot; for the nets to learn, I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  know...that&#39;s what experiments are for. :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see...well, it&#39;s hard to say insofar as I don&#39;t know what that\n&gt; &gt; information is right now.  That is to say, I&#39;m still up in the air in\n&gt; &gt; my own mind as to what we would need to supply.  But by all means post\n&gt; &gt; the code somewhere and let&#39;s take a look.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; ...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\n&gt; &gt; interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\n&gt; &gt; in, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\n&gt; &gt; well, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\n&gt; &gt; idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\n&gt; &gt; gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\n&gt; &gt; hanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\n&gt; &gt; because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\n&gt; &gt; in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\n&gt; &gt; think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- Douglas Adams\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; &quot;Feel free&quot; - 10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat ...\n&gt; Jetzt GMX TopMail testen: www.gmx.net/de/go/mailfooter/topmail-out\n\n-- \nIst Ihr Browser Vista-kompatibel?
