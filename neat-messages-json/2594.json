A network is create=\r\nd from the\n&gt; genetics, but the genetics cannot be updated from the\n&gt; networ=\r\nk.  If the genetics change, the network must be\n&gt; reinstantiated.\n&gt; \n\nThe u=\r\nsual NEAT algorithm doesn&#39;t update genetics from the network \neither, so I =\r\nam a little confused at what you mean to imply with \nthis observation about=\r\n your system.  Perhaps you thought that \nregular NEAT does something along =\r\nthose lines which is actually \ndoesn&#39;t.  In any case, it just sounds like t=\r\nhe normal approach.\n\n&gt; The genetics are implemented by an abstract Gene\n&gt; c=\r\nlass.  Each type of gene implements the abstract\n&gt; class.  The system curre=\r\nntly only has two types of\n&gt; genes, NeuronGenes and WeightGenes.  Each gene=\r\n has a\n&gt; label which is a simple unsigned integer which is\n&gt; autoassigned w=\r\nhen the gene is created or cloned.  Each\n&gt; subclass must implement a compar=\r\ne method used to sort\n&gt; genes of each type.\n&gt; \n\nWhen you say &quot;Each gene has=\r\n a label..&quot; those sound like they are \ninnovation numbers to me.  It just s=\r\nounds like you only use \ninnovation numbers on the nodes, but they are inno=\r\nvation numbers all \nthe same.  You are inferring the uniqueness of connecti=\r\nons from the \ninnovation numbers on their respective nodes, but in effect t=\r\nhis is \nstill using innovation numbers.\n\n&gt; NeuronGenes are sorted by their =\r\nlabel, thus they  must\n&gt; be created in a specific order: input, bias, outpu=\r\nt,\n&gt; hidden.  Hidden neuron genes can come anywhere in the\n&gt; sequence, but =\r\nmust appear after the last non-hidden\n&gt; neuron gene.\n&gt; \n&gt; WeightGenes are s=\r\norted by their output neuron\n&gt; connection label first, followed by their in=\r\nput neuron\n&gt; connection label second.  The compare method for\n&gt; weight gene=\r\ns is about thirty lines of code.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the genetics are sorted, using S=\r\nTL with the\n&gt; gene&#39;s compare method, everything lines up as expected\n&gt; with=\r\n innovations.  I only sort once, immediately after\n&gt; the genetics have been=\r\n created.  Both the network\n&gt; creation code and the genetic mating code dep=\r\nend upon\n&gt; a well sorted gene sequence.\n&gt; \n\nI think you&#39;re just pointing ou=\r\nt that with some cleverness you can \nget by with only using the innovation =\r\nnumbers on the nodes.  I think \nthat&#39;s true, but it makes the program more =\r\ncomplicated because like \nyou said you need to do some special sorting of c=\r\nonnections based on \nnode numbers that wouldn&#39;t be necessary if you labeled=\r\n the \nconnections.\n\n&gt; A genepool is implemented using a hash table. \n&gt; When=\r\never a new gene is created, the hash table is used\n&gt; to see if   \n&gt; gene al=\r\nready exists.  In the case of a weight gene,\n&gt; the hash function uses the o=\r\nutput/input neuron label\n&gt; pairing.  If the gene is found, a reference coun=\r\nt is\n&gt; increased and a pointer to the existing gene is\n&gt; returned rather th=\r\nan creating a new gene.  Once each\n&gt; epoch, the genepool is purged of any g=\r\nenes that no\n&gt; longer have any references to help speed up searches.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nt takes only seconds to create large populations with\n&gt; huge networks.  My =\r\nlarge test case has a population\n&gt; with 5000 organisms of 100 neurons each.=\r\n  It takes\n&gt; only ten to twenty seconds real time to create the\n&gt; populatio=\r\nn.  The majority of creation time is spent in\n&gt; the speciation code, which =\r\nmay still be buggy.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure that taking only seconds to create a p=\r\nopulation really \naddresses any existing issues with NEAT.  The creation of=\r\n initial \npopulation was never a significant CPU bottleneck that I am aware=\r\n \nof, and using the usual innovation number scheme I&#39;m not even sure \nif it=\r\n might be faster.  But in any case, the NEAT algorithm&#39;s \nefficiency is not=\r\n pinnedon the initial population so it shouldn&#39;t \nmatter too much.\n\nI don&#39;t=\r\n want to sound like I&#39;m being overly critical of course.   \nDoing NEAT in d=\r\nifferent ways is great, and I encourage exploring \ndifferent schemes or var=\r\niations.  I think you may have done a good \njob just numbering the nodes, b=\r\nut I point out these issues mostly \nfor clarity for other people who might =\r\nbe new to NEAT and possibly \nconfused about what your statements may imply.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Michael Rosario &lt;michaelrosario_2003@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; J=\r\nust wondering...
