I didn&#39;t offer any input at the time since I wasn&#39;t\n&gt; currently involved in it, but I had done stock market predictions before\n&gt; that discussion, and I&#39;m trying it out again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d like to ask what came of your experiments? What indicators did you\n&gt; find useful? Did you ever find consistent out of bounds performers? What\n&gt; fitness functions did you try out?\n&gt; \n&gt; Finding a strategy that doubles or even quadruples your money on the\n&gt; training set it is as trivial as it is useless, unless it performs well\n&gt; out of bounds - which is much harder. And in my experience, strategies\n&gt; rarely do. Or they perform well for one out of bounds period (say 2003)\n&gt; but poorly for another (say 2004).\n&gt; \n&gt; As for my own experiments, I don&#39;t use a list of trading data for a given\n&gt; stock, instead I input a number of running averages. For instance, I\n&gt; might\n&gt; input the following indicators (all calculated the day before the market\n&gt; day that we&#39;re predicting);\n&gt; \n&gt; CloseRate, CloseRateAvg7, CloseRateAvg14, HighestRate, HighestRateAvg7,\n&gt; HighestRateAvg14 etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; All values are normalized by dividing by CloseRateAvg200. Inputing price\n&gt; information for the last X days might work, but it seems extremely short\n&gt; term and volatile. I&#39;ve found in previous experiments that using too many\n&gt; inputs can lead to overfitting, where the strategy simply identifies a\n&gt; number of instances in the training set where it&#39;s good to buy stock.\n&gt; Those instances are never repeated out of bounds and the strategy is\n&gt; useless.\n\nThere may be some value in using returns over the various periods,\nrather than average prices. I&#39;d also consider some form of volatility\nmeasure - the standard deviation of the logs of the returns would be a\npretty typical value.\n\nWhat is/are your output(s)? Buy/Sell? Predicted future price? Bear in\nmind that a short-term prediction may lead to frequent trading, which,\nunless you can deliver substantial returns will lead to commissions\nand bid-offer spreads eating up your profits.\n\n&gt; Technical Analyzis introduces a wide range of indicators, most of which\n&gt; have worked poorly in my experiments. Possibly the simplest TA strategy\n&gt; is to buy when the short term average is higher than the long term average,\n&gt; because that indicates that the stock is moving up, and to sell on the\n&gt; opposite.\n\nThis is a valuable (and profitable) system in a trending market,\nalthough it typically boils down to &quot;it&#39;s going up - buy, then sell\nwhen it stops going up&quot;. It tends to be awful in a sideways market.\n\nMomentum and Relative strength are often useful in such markets. I\nnever had much luck with more &quot;exotic&quot; indicators (stochastic\nthingies, oscillators and the like) although maybe I didn&#39;t calculate\nthem correctly.\n\nAre you providing less correlated market information?Stock/sector\nindices? Interest/currency rates? Economic indicators? What about less\nobvious stuff: the price of oil/gold, say? The current FIFA ranking of\nthe national football team? The Big Mac index?\n \n&gt; I&#39;m hoping to open up the discussion again and see if there are any new\n&gt; cool ideas floating around. The two indicators CloseRateAvg7,\n&gt; CloseRateAvg14 open up for this type of strategy.\n\nI&#39;m curious about seeing the effects of having the model output a\n&quot;confidence&quot; value.  I like the idea a lot, but haven&#39;t any concrete\nresults to show usefulness or otherwise.\n\nI can go on about this stuff until you&#39;re asleep - I spent  a lot of\ntime (and CPU days) some years back trying to evolve fixed-topology\nnetworks for stock trading. I suspended operations due to (a) lack of\neasily-available/cheap data (b) inadequacy of approach - NEAT wasn&#39;t\naround (c) lack of time (d) something else I&#39;ve forgotten just now.\n\nThere are definitely companies out there that have invested heavily in\nAI-inspired trading strategies. DE Shaw is one, part of what is now\nUBS is another.\n \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias\n\n"}}
