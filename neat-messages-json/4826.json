I use CUDA and it maps it pretty well, you even don&#39;=\r\nt have to know what a texture is. Just knowing the basic architecture of th=\r\ne card is enough. I have ran some activation tests, and a simple kernel to =\r\nactivate 13,107,200 nodes with 7 incoming links each takes 20 milliseconds =\r\n(with sigmoid exp-based function, step function would do much faster). This=\r\n is on one GPU , but you can have 4 , and even 7 in a motherboard. All conn=\r\nected with a PCI bus transfering at 2.5Gbytes per sec, against traditional =\r\nsingle core cluster on obsolete GigaBit ethernet which is only 100MB per se=\r\nc. With 4 NVIDIA GTX295 cards you can have a supercomputer with 1920 cores =\r\nfor about 4,000-5,000USD. But the key for fast implementation is, of course=\r\n, knowing your hardware, so , for example to count bits in an integer you d=\r\non&#39;t use ANDs and ORs, but special assembly language instructions like POPC=\r\nNT, MMX instructions with non-polluting cache loads like _mm_stream_si128()=\r\n which can speed up your software hundreds of times. I think the only reaso=\r\nn we don&#39;t have an artificial brain yet is because we don&#39;t have enough cor=\r\nes to do the math, but for the methods invented, we already surpassed all t=\r\nhe possible algorithms we would need. So, it is all about computing power n=\r\now.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
