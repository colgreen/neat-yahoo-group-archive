Is it beneficial to implement \n&gt;&gt;dormant genes in NEAT?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A lot of the discussion about how NEAT does not simplify is slightly\n&gt;misleading.  NEAT *does* have a mutation operator that flips enable\n&gt;bits to &quot;disabled&quot; with random probability.  It&#39;s just that I never\n&gt;actually used this kind of mutation in the experiments I ran.  The\n&gt;reason I didn&#39;t use it was so that we don&#39;t have too many opposing\n&gt;processes happening at the same time, which would make the analysis of\n&gt;the algorithm too convoluted.\n&gt;\nAbsolutely. One of my goals this time around is to keep everything as \nsimple as possible, with a view to switching additional functionality on \nlater. My previous EANN attempt using tree based genomes became a little \nconvoluted. I feel like I need to take a step back and perhaps build up \nto implementing a tree structure again later.\n\n\n&gt;  But there is nothing about the system\n&gt;itself that prevents one from allowing genes to become randomly\n&gt;disabled, and my current implementation has such a mutation available.\n&gt; (muate_toggle_enable in the .ne file).  \n&gt;\n&gt;That said, I&#39;ve tried using it, and didn&#39;t find any dramatic\n&gt;improvement in performance, although I absolutely believe more\n&gt;experiments with the idea of complexification with pruning are\n&gt;merited, especially over long term evolution.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think we all agree on this :)\n\n&gt;I should also note that as Derek said, NEAT does disable genes when it\n&gt;adds a node, and there is some probability during mating that a\n&gt;disabled gene may become reenabled.  I only mention this to point out\n&gt;you will see disabled genes occasionally even without another mutation\n&gt;operator.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nUnderstood.\n\n&gt;Also note that the proper way to simplify in NEAT is to disable,\n&gt;because if you literally cut out a gene, you lose that historical\n&gt;information, which is still useful for compatibility determination.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes and they may possibly become useful further down an evolution run, \nunlikely but possible.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
