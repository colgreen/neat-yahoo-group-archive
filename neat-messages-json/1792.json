It&#39;s just as likely to pick an insignificant\n&gt;combination of indicators that appeared during the event and either miss\n&gt;the next occurance, or miss interpret other events as a new occurance.\n&gt;\n&gt;You need a lot of occurances before predictions are solid.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSure. So we can safely forget about the idea of looking for big rare events.\n\n&gt;&gt;But do you want to wait around for (possibly) years to make relatively \n&gt;&gt;few big &#39;bets&#39; (high risk, eggs in one basket scenario), or do you want\n&gt;&gt;a system that makes more frequent smaller bets? (Trading being a form\n&gt;&gt;of betting). \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I certainly want fluidity due to the reasons I&#39;ve specified. I&#39;ve even\n&gt;looked at day trading, but that didn&#39;t pan out. Now I have a new data\n&gt;source and I might give it another shot. I haven&#39;t studied day trading\n&gt;extensively, do you think it&#39;s more or less predictable than intra-day\n&gt;trading?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPotentially I would say that day trading it could be viewed as having a \ncompletely dynamic to intra-day, mainly because day traders are a \nsignificantly distinct entity when compared to (say) fund managers and \nbrokers at large banks. You may see population dynamics caused by \nfactors such as internet chat rooms and temporary &#39;jumping on the wagon&#39; \nfor good stocks, and of course the selling up at the end of the day. \nNow, your average day trader might not be as smart as a city trader \n(I&#39;ve no evidence of this BTW, I&#39;m just speculating here) and may loose \nmoney more often and in predictable ways. So I definitely think it would \nbe worth investigating. I hope that last comment didn&#39;t come across as \ntoo predatory :)\n\n\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now it would be nice to have a system quietly looking out for\n&gt;&gt;those big bet scenario&#39;s 24/7 just to highlight them so you can make an\n&gt;&gt;informed judgement whether to act, but I see this as being a completely\n&gt;&gt;seperate system to one that looks for short term trades.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t dispute that, and I think it would be possible to hand-code a\n&gt;strategy that flags such a situation more succesfully than using AI to\n&gt;evolve it. I&#39;d say that a human analyzing the situation _could_ come up\n&gt;with something useful from one (or ten) data point(s), wheras AI would\n&gt;just as likely be fooled.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSure. With regards to the sterling collapse you could have gauged that \nsituation late on by looking at exchange rates (obviously), but also the \namount and direction of trading, intersest rates and probably some \nknowledge of the bank of england&#39;s reserve levels. But the people who \nmade the real money spotted the gaping flaw in the UK government&#39;s \nstrategy early on, probably before there were any indications from the \nmarkets. It was knowledge of the political and policy environment that \nwas key.\n\n&gt;&gt;I definitely see overfitting as being a problem because the only way to\n&gt;&gt;reduce it is to test against larger test data sets (thus slowing \n&gt;&gt;evaluation), even then one big gain on one data set could skew a\n&gt;&gt;fitness score. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Consider a system that first goes up 150% and then down 75% - you&#39;re still\n&gt;up 75% and that&#39;s great, right? Not really, what if you jumped on the\n&gt;system just at the 150% peak, then you&#39;d only get the 75% drawdown. You\n&gt;wouldn&#39;t trade that system for long.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nConsider a network that is performing poorly. If it knows how much it \nhas lost it could use this signal to dampen its outputs thus causing \ntrading to stop, thus the network will limit loss over a given time \nframe. The loss signal could be made to decay so that eventually the net \ncomes back to life, thus you have a self limiting trading system. This \ncould be part of the fitness function and hence the networks \nfunctionality, or this could be hard coded behaviour in a trading agent \nof which the network is one component.\n\n&gt;&gt;I had considered that a network with a confidence output that it\n&gt;&gt;keeps low most of the time, and which only goes high when it&#39;s very\n&gt;&gt;sure \n&gt;&gt;of making profit would be a good network. A sort of &quot;if you aint got \n&gt;&gt;anything interesting to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot; approach to \n&gt;&gt;prediction :)  But I can definitely see how overfitting might put the \n&gt;&gt;dampers on this idea, beside which it goes against my comments in the \n&gt;&gt;previous paragraph - few trades = bad.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, and confidence is relevant when you&#39;re predicting prices, but it&#39;s\n&gt;not relevant when the system decides whether to own or not, because it&#39;s\n&gt;inherent. If the system isn&#39;t sure, it reduces the &quot;want to own&quot; rating.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To clarify, do you agree that my output contains implicit confidence values?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt depends how you are interpreting your output. You say &gt;0.5 indicates \nbuy and &lt;0.5 indicates sell. So presumbaly you consider anything within \nmagnitude 0.5 to be a hold signal? And thinking about it I suppose \n&#39;hold&#39; is really an indication that you don&#39;t know which direction a \nstock will move next. E.g. if you though it was going to stay level for \nthe foreseeable future then you would want to sell and move your \nresources elsewhere, wouldn&#39;t you? Or would it be useful to distinguish \nbetween a high and low confidence &#39;hold&#39; signal?\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
