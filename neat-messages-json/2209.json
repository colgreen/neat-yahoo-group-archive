I spent the last few days implementing NEAT in \nPowerBASIC =\r\nand I&#39;m nearly done.  I am doing a rather simple\nsimulation.\n\nI basically s=\r\net up a &quot;room&quot; and drop an agent in the middle. \nThe \nagent needs to eat=85=\r\nso I place a large circle representing food in\nthe \nroom.  The agent has so=\r\n many steps to find the food or it \ndisappears.   The food is then moved to=\r\n a new location and the agent \ncan try again.  The agent is tested against =\r\nfour different food \nlocations.  The agent has 8 sensors that allow it to &quot;=\r\nsee&quot; in\nthose 8 \ndirections.  \n\nRight now with only 50 parents and 10 gener=\r\nations it is able to find \nall the 4 different food bins after about9 or 10=\r\n gens...which is \npretty good.. Especially since I discovered that I have a=\r\n neuron \nfiring issue in my code..\n\nAnyway..I am completely new to NN&#39;s...i=\r\n have no training on them at \nall, although I do know GA&#39;s fairly well (I a=\r\nm CEO of bioinformatics \nfirm that uses GA&#39;s to analyze genetics data).  \n\n=\r\nI have a question I hope you can help with.  the way I setup the \nnetworks =\r\nallows for recurrent connections to occur.  So suppose you \nhave a simple n=\r\netowrk where input node 1 connects to hidden node 2, \nwhich connects to hid=\r\nden node 3, which connects to back to node 2.  \nHow is firing to proceed in=\r\n such a scenario?  Node 2 can&#39;t fire \nuntil it has all its inputs, yet one =\r\nof its outputs(the one to node \n3) affects what its input will be.  Thanks =\r\nfor your help...\n          |-------\n          v      |\nNODE1--&gt;NODE2--&gt;NODE=\r\n3\n\nAnd what if a node links back to itself?  Then how is the firing \nsequen=\r\nce to work?  I saw a time delay in teh C code and I am \nguessing this is in=\r\nvolved, but I&#39;m not quite sure how...\n\nWhen I get this working, I would lik=\r\ne to tackle the tic-tac-toe \nproblem you guys are working on.\n\ni really app=\r\nreciate all your posts...very enlightening...\n\nBest,\nKevin Cramer\n\n\n\n"}}
