My logic being\n&gt; that I thought matching like innovations is beneficial but costly in\n&gt; terms of CPU time. So I figured this gives a good balance. However I\n&gt; just traced a bug whereby evolved networks where seen - by Ken - to have\n&gt; multiple recurrent connections on a single node. I realise now that this\n&gt; is a result of crossover between two genomes that contained the same\n&gt; connection, but with a different innovation ID. To fix this I should\n&gt; check for duplicate connections within genomes created by crossover,\n&gt; which erodes some of the performance gain obtained from using technique\n&gt; (2).\n\nThat&#39;s a good point.  How did you handle that case in your\nimplementation, Ken?  If 2 chromosomes crossover where each has a\nconnection between nodes 1 and 2, btu where the connections have\ndifferent innovation IDs, do you sum the genotype weights to create\nthe phenotype connection weight?  Or average them?  Or discard one?\n\n"}}
