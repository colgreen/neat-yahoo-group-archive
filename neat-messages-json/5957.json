The motion file consists of a matrix of 12x26 =\r\ndouble values between -1 and 1. \n&gt; Using hyperNEAT I guess it must be possi=\r\nble to generate CPPN&#39;s that generate these files, these files can be run in=\r\n webots and evaluated and a fitness can be assigned to these CPPN&#39;s. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMy plan was to use the Java version of hyperNEAT to generate these CPPN&#39;s, =\r\nthe problem is that for me it is not entirely clear: \n&gt; 1) how to generate =\r\nCPPN&#39;s using the java version of hyperNEAT\n&gt; 2) how to assign a fitness val=\r\nue for these generated files \n&gt; \n&gt; If someone could point me to some good s=\r\nources that explain how to do this I would be very thankful!\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind rega=\r\nrds\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
