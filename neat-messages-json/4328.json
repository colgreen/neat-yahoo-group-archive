CMAES adapts the Gaussian distribution sh=\r\nape and size with a fully *deterministic* strategy, and thus, are not they =\r\nare not parts of the genotype. This is different from Self-Adaptive Evoluti=\r\non Strategies (SAES), where Gaussian distribution shape and size is a part =\r\nof the genotype. There are both theoretical analysis and experimental resul=\r\nts that show that the CMAES strategy is much faster to find the optimal Gau=\r\nssian distribution shape and size compared to a SAES strategy.

I don&#39;t recall the specific discussion.=\r\n  In any case,\n\nthere was a time when I thought evolution could be good at =\r\nthings like\n\nthat, but my mind has been changing in recent years, so I appr=\r\neciate\n\nwhat your paper is saying.  \n\n\n\nI think what caused me to become a =\r\nskeptic about these kinds of\n\nmeta-evolutionary approaches is speaking to p=\r\neople who advocate the\n\nidea that evolution should &quot;evolve its own encoding=\r\n.&quot;  That idea is\n\nconnected to evolvability, which suggests that evolution =\r\ncan figure\n\nout its own best parametrizations to become most effective at e=\r\nvolving\n\nin a particular type of domain.  Working on encodings started to m=\r\nake\n\nme think that the search space of encodings is simply too vast to\n\nexp=\r\nect evolution itself to optimize the encoding.  It is basically a\n\nvast met=\r\na-search, far vaster than the problem domain itself (which is\n\nalready vast=\r\n to begin with in ambitious cases), and the actual problem\n\ndomain would se=\r\nem to locally obfuscate the landscape of\n\nmeta-parameters (just as your res=\r\nults show).  \n\n\n\nOverall, I started to feel like human intuition is a bette=\r\nr bet for\n\nsolving these meta-questions, or at least for addressing them\n\ne=\r\nffectively.  Also, as we started to think about novelty search, I\n\nstarted =\r\nto realize that evolution often innovates *despite* selection\n\nrather than =\r\nbecause of it, which is even more complicating at the\n\nmeta-level.  That is=\r\n, at a meta-level like encodings, if something\n\ngood came about, it might a=\r\nctually be because selection pressure was\n\nlow for a time.  In other words,=\r\n if selection pressure has been high,\n\nthe steps towards whatever optimal m=\r\neta-parameter was found would\n\nnever have been taken because the stepping s=\r\ntones are meta-suboptimal.\n\n Just talking about this issue with all these &quot;=\r\nmetas&quot; reminds me why\n\nit seems like wishful thinking to rely on evolution =\r\nto determine\n\neverything.  Luck and happenstance have to be accepted as fac=\r\ntors.\n\n\n\nIn another sense, evolving meta-parameters optimally sounds\n\ndange=\r\nrously close to a free lunch.   If there is an algorithm that can\n\nevolve t=\r\nhe right meta-parameters reliably, which in turn causes it to\n\nalways find =\r\nthe right solution, when would that algorithm fail?\n\n\n\nThe conclusion in my=\r\n view is to trust our instincts.  We (humans)\n\nstill have a role to play in=\r\n setting the parameters of our algorithms\n\n, and in designing our encodings=\r\n, by thinking about the problems they\n\nare intended to solve.  We are proba=\r\nbly not going to get away with\n\noffloading all the responsibility on evolut=\r\nion itself, at least not if\n\nyou want to see it succeed in reasonable time.=\r\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, Jeff (here I go contradicting myself), there are\n\nreportedl=\r\ny evolutionary algorithms that seem to show that they benefit\n\nfrom mutatin=\r\ng mutation parameters.  Evolution Strategies come to mind.\n\n ES has done th=\r\nis kind of thing for years.  CMA-ES now uses\n\nstatistical techniques to pre=\r\ndict optimal mutation distributions. \n\nWhat do your results suggest about s=\r\nuch approaches?  Are they just\n\nworking on &quot;toy problems&quot; or is there some =\r\nexplanation for why they\n\nclaim to derive benefit from evolving the paramet=\r\ners?\n\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Hello all-\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; A while back we had a discussion about whether nat=\r\nural selection is\n\ngood at\n\n&gt; choosing its own parameters. Many people assu=\r\nme that it would be\n\nbeneficial\n\n&gt; to evolve the parameters of a run (e.g. =\r\nmutation rate, crossover rate,\n\n&gt; etc.). After having done some research in=\r\n the area I have concluded\n\nthat it\n\n&gt; does not work well.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; When I ex=\r\npressed this view previously, some of you were very\n\nskeptical. At\n\n&gt; that =\r\npoint, I promised to share a manuscript that investigates the issue\n\n&gt; once=\r\n it was published.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; That manuscript finally came out yesterday in the=\r\n journal PLoS\n\nComputational\n\n&gt; Biology. I am rather excited because they c=\r\nhose it for the cover of the\n\n&gt; September issue. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; You can see it her=\r\ne:\n\n&gt; www.ploscompbiol. org\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Clune, et. al. =B3Natural Selection Fail=\r\ns to Optimize Mutation Rates for\n\n&gt; Long-Term Adaptation on Rugged Fitness =\r\nLandscapes.=B2\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I am interested to see what you think. In particular,=\r\n I would like\n\nto hear\n\n&gt; from those of you that were skeptical of my claim=\r\n. Do you still feel\n\nthat\n\n&gt; evolution can manage itself in light of this w=\r\nork? Note: I recognize\n\nthat\n\n&gt; this paper only covers mutation rates. Howe=\r\nver, the mutation rate is\n\none of\n\n&gt; the most important parameters. Further=\r\nmore, I think similar issues will\n\n&gt; arise with other parameters that resul=\r\nt in the perturbation of\n\ngenomes (e.g.\n\n&gt; crossover type and rate).\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; PS. PLoS allows readers to rate articles. If you enjoyed the\n\narticle,=\r\n and\n\n&gt; have a second, please rate it highly. I would really appreciate it!=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; PPS.
