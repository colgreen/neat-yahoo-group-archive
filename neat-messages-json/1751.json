If you&#39;re interested, I put the thesis itself\nis in the files section of this group (honors-thesis.ps.gz). That version\nis a little heavier on the implementation and analysis side, so it might\nbe helpful to you.\n\nUnfortunately I haven&#39;t put any work into it since finishing the GECCO\npaper, though I am working on a GRN-based system that I hope to get some\nresults on by the next GECCO deadline. Anyway I still have a ton of ideas\nfor modular NEAT, and I&#39;d love to see the work continue on it. I think the\nresults were pretty clear that its a powerful optimization, at least for\nsome types of domains.\n\nAs for the source code, I&#39;ve been planning for a while now to make a\nformal release of it, but I really haven&#39;t had a lot of time to go over\nthe code. I&#39;d be more than happy to package it up and send it to you in\nits current state, and to answer any questions you have, but, the code\nitself is not well-documented (much less so than Ken&#39;s original NEAT code\n:P) and probably needs to be rewritten. Let me know if you&#39;re interested\nthough; I can at least point out the really obscure implementation details\nfor you.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n\nOn Thu, 2 Dec 2004, Julian Togelius wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m a beginning research student at University of Essex, UK (more on\n&gt; me at http://julian.togelius.com) and I&#39;m also new to this group. My\n&gt; idea of the research I wanted to do was something very like modular\n&gt; neat until I found out about the project a few weeks ago...\n&gt;\n&gt; As I haven&#39;t been able to figure it out from the forum, I&#39;ll ask my\n&gt; question here: what is the current status of modular neat? Has any\n&gt; experiments been carried out since publication of the paper? Is anyone\n&gt; planning any? And is it possible to have a look at the source code for\n&gt; modular neat?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Julian\n&gt;\n\n"}}
