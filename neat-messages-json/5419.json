It is not immediately clear why HyperNEAT i=\r\nn particular is advantageous for time series problems, though it is possibl=\r\ne it can be leveraged in some way that is helpful.  \n\nAs an alternative, yo=\r\nu could also try regular NEAT as well.  Also, if you search through the arc=\r\nhives of this group you will find a number of discussions on time series pr=\r\nediction.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Peter&quot; &lt;blackprinzze@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m currently trying to develop HyperNEAT for Time series f=\r\norecasting (Stock & commodity)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1, Is there a current version of HyperN=\r\nEAT available that my be suited for this task?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2, If not can you pleas=\r\ne point me in the right direction, explaining  how this can be achieved. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 3, Forecast should behave, similar to that of a Moving average, with fo=\r\nrecast plots one period or more into the future. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
