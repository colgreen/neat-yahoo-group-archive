Here&#39;s how\nthe selection algorithm works:\n\n1. Pick a uniform random number between the min and\nmax population fitness.\n\n2. Select the individual in the population with\nfitness closest to the random number; use this\nindividual to reproduce.\n\nOf course NEAT already has a method to keep the\npopulation diverse, but in my domain I still usually\nhave a bunch of species all converged on different\nlocal optima.  I&#39;m experimenting with using this\nselection method in combination with NEAT.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this selection\nmethod?\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
