That is, =\r\nthey would have a single hidden node and full connectivity.  (And of course=\r\n make sure they have a bias node as a third input as well.)  Then turn off =\r\nall structural mutation and see how long it takes to solve.  If it takes a =\r\nlong time, then you know there is something poorly calibrated about the wei=\r\nght mutation setup.  In XOR, it is often the way weights are mutated that t=\r\nurns out to be causing a problem.  It should solve XOR very quickly if you =\r\nstart it with a solution topology and it only has to search for weights.\n\nA=\r\nlso, it&#39;s important to note that special parameters that award genomes bein=\r\ng &quot;young&quot; or &quot;old&quot; are probably very domain specific.  Maybe I&#39;d try to get=\r\n it solved without having those kinds of bonuses and penalties at all, sinc=\r\ne however they affect XOR, it may not apply to other problems.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alinehuf2&quot; &lt;alinehuf2@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello =\r\nall,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a french student at Paris university (sorry for my &quot;broken&quot; E=\r\nnglish).\n&gt; I&#39;m doing my first steps with NEAT and I encounter some difficul=\r\nties. I have read the FAQ on this web page : http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanle=\r\ny/neat.html but I have not found answers to my problems.\n&gt; I converted the =\r\nBuckland implementation from C++ to C (I am not comfortable with C++) : htt=\r\nps://github.com/alinehuf/neattest. \n&gt; I tried the XOR test as decribed by S=\r\ntanley in &quot;Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies&quot;, but I h=\r\nad a really poor result. My program found a solution 981 times out of 1000 =\r\ntests (98%) and it tooks an average of 184 generations and a solution has 5=\r\n hidden nodes=85\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried to change my implementation to make it look m=\r\nore like the Stanley&#39;s neat 1.1 (reproduction and delta coding). In his art=\r\nicle &quot;Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies&quot; he said that =\r\nNEAT can solde the XOR problem 100% of the time, in an average of 32 genera=\r\ntions and 2,35 hidden nodes=85 but even with the modifications the results =\r\nof my program are always disappointing (100% solution found in an average o=\r\nf 130 generation and with 5 hidden neurons)=85 \n&gt; \n&gt; Buckland uses paramete=\r\nrs quite different from those of Stanley especially concerning the penaliza=\r\ntion or bonus awarded to the species :\n&gt; iYoungBonusAgeThreshhold =3D&gt; 10\n&gt;=\r\n dYoungFitnessBonus =3D&gt; Stanley 1.0  - Buckland 1.3\n&gt; iOldAgeThreshold =3D=\r\n&gt; Stanley 15   - Buckland 50\n&gt; dOldAgePenalty =3D&gt; Stanley 0.01 - Buckland =\r\n0.7\n&gt; I tested both sets of parameters without any significant difference i=\r\nn the average result for the 1000 tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried different variations =\r\nin reproductive functions, speciation, mutation ... but without more succes=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I look at my log file, I realize that the best species (or bes=\r\nt genome) dies regularly. Sometimes the best species doesn&#39;t evolve for som=\r\ne generation and is fatally penalized. The best species doesn&#39;t reproduce a=\r\nnd then the best fitness disappears=85\n&gt; \n&gt; My goal is to use NEAT to evalu=\r\nate the final positions of games in General Game Playing. If NEAT can predi=\r\nct the score, then I hope to be able to use the network generated to evalua=\r\nte non-terminal positions. But for the moment, I do not manage to achieve s=\r\natisfactory results with the simple XOR problem and I do not know what coul=\r\nd be the problem. Do you have any advice or tips?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Alin=\r\ne Huf.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
