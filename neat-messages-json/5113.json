It features a lot of nice results.\n\nA few questions/comments:\n\n1) The issue of interpolation is extremely interesting. In this paper you\nexplicitly discuss how it would be beneficial to add new agents, and have\ntheir roles be intermediate versions of other agents (e.g., adding a 12th\nsoccer player between the forwards and the midfielders would create a player\nthat was a hybrid of the two roles). It would also be cool to see if teams\ncan gracefully re-divide the strategy-space when they lose agents. For\nexample, in soccer/futbol, after a few red cards are assigned, each player\ndoes not play the usual role that they would play on a team of 11, but\ninstead re-divide the space up amongst the fewer players. For example, after\nthe red cards their may be a left and right forward instead of a left, right\nand center forward. It would be cool to see if you can see such a result\nusing your method. \n\n2) You mention the benefits of interpolated roles, but do you have any\nevidence that such interpolation is occurring? One cool way to test this\nwould be to compare two different treatments: T1) take your original N\nagents and multiply them to achieve the desired scaled-up number of agents\n(e.g., 9, 25, 100, 1000). If you start with 10 agents, and scale to 1000,\nyou thus get 100 identical copies of agent 1, 100 identical copies of agent\n2, etc. Compare the performance of this treatment to T2) interpolate 1000\nagents into the z coordinate range, so you have 1000 slightly different\nagents. The difference in performance between these treatments will help you\nfigure out whether you are seeing a boost due to interpolation. If the\nperformance increase due to scaling is not different between T1 and T2, then\nyou know your performance boost was simply due to having more agents, not\ndue to interpolation (you note something similar when you say &quot;adding more\nagents that all do the same thing will eventually cause a pile-up&quot;...my\nsuggestion is a way to test this claim).\n\n3) Why do you feel this new technique is better than your old technique? Is\nit possible to compare the two experimentally? Have you done so?\n\n4) I notice you mention that you use 20% elitism. I usually only save the\nbest organism. Have you found 20% to work a lot better, generally?\n\n5) When you add new agents, do you leave the previous sheets in the same\nplace, and interpolate new sheets between them, or do you renormalize all of\nthe sheets such that it may be the case that no new agent is in the exact z\ncoordinate of one of the original agents? It might be interesting to try\nboth and see which tends to work better.\n\n6) What is the &#39;sign&#39; function you mention in Figure 2? In general, I am\nhaving trouble figuring out what this means: &quot;The starting structure of the\ninitial heterogeneous CPPN (Figure 2b) includes some additional structure to\nstart evolution with knowledge of mirrored team symmetry; in particular, the\nsign function of z connected to multiplication operators on the x-axis means\nthat the CPPN knows which side of the team is which and can opt to reflect\none side across the midline.&quot;\n\nCongrats again on this nice work.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2010 02:59:22 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Multiagent HyperNEAT Revisited\n&gt; \n&gt; Our 2008 GECCO paper by David D&#39;Ambrosio and myself introduced the idea that a\n&gt; single HyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of neural networks (instead of just\n&gt; one) that represent a pattern of policies for an entire team.  Since then a\n&gt; few people have asked about the way we laid out the team on the substrate and\n&gt; whether alternatives might be better.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to announce, with my co-authors David D&#39;Ambrosio, Joel Lehman, and\n&gt; Sebastian Risi, that we have extensively tested such an alternative\n&gt; z-axis-based encoding and published the results to appear in AAMAS 2010,\n&gt; available here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Direct Link: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; We believe this z-based substrate layout is superior to the previous one,\n&gt; particularly for scaling the size of the team, and should open up the field of\n&gt; multiagent learning further to HyperNEAT.  The paper also includes the first\n&gt; published results on scaling the size of the team without further training,\n&gt; which works because HyperNEAT can interpolate new policies for ANNs inserted\n&gt; along the z axis of the substrate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Videos that accompany the paper are here:\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/mahnaamas2010.html\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
