I&#39;ve\n&gt; posted more info on the Verve website -\n&gt; www.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/verve/main.html,\n&gt; including two new videos that show a biped character\n&gt; starting to walk.\n\nPretty cool vids, Tyler.\n\nObviously, these guys don&#39;t have &quot;training wheels&quot;, that is, skyhooks\nkeeping them from falling down.  Balance for bipedal walkers is\nincredibly difficult...are you averse to putting any kind of external\nhelper in place?  I thought I heard you mention that you had done some\nof this.\n\nAlso, how are you choosing the morphology?  The block torso seems to\nswing forward, and that makes sense, since walking is mostly leaning\nforward and catching yourself with your feet.  But does the ANN\ncontroller only control the legs or also the torso joint (which\nprobably needs to swing back to slow the gait or stop)?\n\nAnyway, interesting stuff...thanks for the update.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
