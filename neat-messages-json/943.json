Why give connections a unique innovation number at all? \n&gt;   Why not assign their unique ID based on the innovation numbers of the \n&gt; nodes they connect?  If you create a new connection between nodes 253 and \n&gt; 275, then the ID for the connection could be &quot;253:275&quot;.  Store the \n&gt; connections in a hash table, and you have instant prevention of duplicates.  \n&gt; Then, even if a connection is created 10 generations later, if it connects \n&gt; the same nodes, it&#39;s the same gene.  Even if the organism has subsequently \n&gt; gone off and formed its own species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any reason why that wouldn&#39;t work?\n\nI think there is a problem to appear. You idea supposes some global pool for connections information. Right? So there is no way to keep connections that do link the same neurons but have different weights. It&#39;s just because such connections are always the same for hash function as they have similar IDs.\n\n\n"}}
