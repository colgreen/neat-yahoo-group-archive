As an aside, I might mention that\nTORCS code is available for anyone that wants a much\nmore detailed vehicle and terrain simulation.\n\nIn my approach the ANN receives inputs of velocity,\nand distance coordinates to any nearby obstacles and\nthe goal.  The coordinates would be in the vehicle\ncentered frame of reference, i.e., distance and\nazimuth.  Perhaps angular velocity is needed as well.\nAll of those values are available from the physical\nmodel.  The ANN converts those inputs into steering\nand throttle values, which feed into the physical\nmodel.  These calculations are repeated with short\ntime steps, perhaps 1/20 of a simulated second per\nstep.  This results in a trajectory, which is then\nassigned a fitness value.  The fitness is initially\njust the distance traveled before crashing, or\ntraveling in a totally wrong direction.  For vehicles\nthat reach the goal, then the fitness is further\nincreased according to the average speed of the\njourney.\n\nI plan to base the physical model on RARS, which I\ndeveloped 9 years ago, and has been thouroughly\ntested.\n\n\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
