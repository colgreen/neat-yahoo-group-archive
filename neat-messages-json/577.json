Have you tried shuffling the\n&gt;order of the input and gotten the same responses?\n&gt;\n&gt;Ken&#39;s right...technically you should disable\n&gt;recurrency when attempting to solve XOR.  But if this\n&gt;network isn&#39;t memorizing the sequence, then I&#39;d agree\n&gt;that it is interesting. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Derek, Ken,\n\nI had considered that networks may learn the testing sequence so yes I \ndo reset each neuron&#39;s output for each test, and therefore there is no \nneed to shuffle the test sequences. Besides which the truth table I \nposted was calculated manually to confirm the result! - it is only small \nafter all. Looking at the truth table it does make sense: \n\n0    1    2    3(t0)    3(t1)\n--------------------------\n1    0    0    0.83     0.01\n1    0    1    0.16     0.05\n1    1    0    0.16     0.05\n1    1    1    0.007    0.007\n\n\nThe large negative weight on the output node (-7.4) has the effect of \nreducing larger signals from the previous time step more than small \nones. So 0.83 becomes 0.01, whereas 0.016 becomes 0.05. The point is \nthat the larger signal became the smaller and visa versa. This large \nnegative loopback weight would also have the effect of reducing all \noutput to 0.0 if I relaxed the network based upon waiting for a stable \nouput value (I read the FAQ entry thanks Ken).\n\nKen, yes t0 and t1 are the output of node 3 at times steps 0 and 1. \nReally that should be t1 and t2, since all outputs are 0 at t0.\n\nOne more interesting point, the maximum seperation between true and \nfalse always came out the same for all the runs I performed... 0.045. \n(Note that the numbers in the table are rounded).\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
