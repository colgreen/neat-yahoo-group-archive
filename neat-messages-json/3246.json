For \n&gt; &gt; example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you might have a single 2D input layer =\r\nconnecting to a single \n&gt; &gt; &gt; output \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node (yes/no); or you could h=\r\nave a multilayer 3D input field \n&gt; &gt; (where \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each 2D layer is a typ=\r\ne of object) connecting to a 2D output \n&gt; &gt; field \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (where each pixe=\r\nl answers the question, is there overlap \n&gt; &gt; here?).  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You might h=\r\nave a hidden layer, and you might not.

So you might for example \n&gt; &gt; ou=\r\ntput \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resolution representation of you=\r\nr possible decisions, \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something you normally wo=\r\nuldn&#39;t do in regular NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (b) Hypercube Network=\r\n: (i) Inputs: Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptors/parameters \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geometric coordinates being a subset thereof), \nassociated \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate network node =\r\n(i.e. like a timestamp \nassociated \n&gt; &gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coor=\r\ndinate point comprising a trajectory), mutually \n&gt; &gt; exclusive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptor/parameter expressly identified i=\r\nn the \n&gt; substrate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; node, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being co=\r\nllected together and collectively identified as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; either \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;to&quot; terminator of a link between any two substr=\r\nate \n&gt; &gt; nodes; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ii) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Output: Weigh=\r\nt of link between the currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; identified &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;=\r\nto&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate nodes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I think this characterizes it well, although there is \neven \n&gt; &gt; more \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexibility.  You can for example use additional outputs \non \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to represent additional attributes of link=\r\ns and/or \nnodes.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The timestamp idea is interesti=\r\nng- if I understand \n&gt; correctly \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caus=\r\ne the network to change over time in a deterministic \n&gt; &gt; way.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Although maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding.  But certainly \nthings \n&gt; &gt; like \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are possible.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s dif=\r\nficult to write an accurate general description \nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; what goes in and comes out of the CPPN at this point \n&gt; because \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no doubt that at this early stage that new id=\r\neas are \ngoing \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; broaden \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the possibilities be=\r\nyond what I am currently aware of.   \n&gt; But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said captures it pretty well for now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
