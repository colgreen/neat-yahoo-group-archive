It =\r\nis detailed in https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=3Ddetail&aid=3D1594074=\r\n&group_id=3D175856&atid=3D874910 and is a very easy code change.  I will ge=\r\nt round to fixing it in download version just as soon as I have fixed a bug=\r\n in neat4j v2.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vincedx15&quot; &lt;vin=\r\nce15@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m working with neat4j but I need to make it stop=\r\npable in order to resume an evolution later. I did it saving the serializat=\r\nion of the population object. The evolution starts and moves through epochs=\r\n. Unfortunately I&#39;m experiencing a problem in the NEATSpecieManager class. =\r\nFrom line 49:\n&gt; \n&gt; if (applicantGenes[applicantIdx] instanceof NEATLinkGene=\r\n) {\n&gt; \tweightDiffTotal +=3D (((NEATLinkGene)applicantGenes[applicantIdx]).g=\r\netWeight() - ((NEATLinkGene)repGenes[repIdx]).getWeight());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The su=\r\nm of weightDiffTotal at line 50 looks at the weight property of NEATLinkGen=\r\ne or NEATNodeGene, because Genes can be both Links and Nodes. \n&gt; Unfortunat=\r\nely, for some reason, sometimes, I get a ClassCastException because it cast=\r\ns the object to a Link even if it&#39;s a Node.\n&gt; The applicantIdx as a certain=\r\n value... let&#39;s say, 80, while repIdx is 1.\n&gt; To solve this I simply catch =\r\nthe exception and skip the instruction... and I know that this is bad! That=\r\n&#39;s why I&#39;m here.\n&gt; Should i change the cast and comprare Links with Nodes? =\r\nTo be honest... i&#39;m not really sure of what&#39;s going on here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope yo=\r\nu can help me. Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
