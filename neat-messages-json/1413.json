It is possible to do anything you want \nbased\n&gt; &gt; &gt;on the compatibility function, and using it as a basis for \ndeciding\n&gt; &gt; &gt;which interspecies matings are tolerable is certainly feasible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;no. I mean what if two mutations are identical but were inovated\n&gt; &gt;seperatly, so that that they are rated as less compatable. In the \nearly\n&gt; &gt;part of a search, the ratio of members in a population may be \ncomparable\n&gt; &gt;to the possible number of node insertion points. So if in the \nsecond\n&gt; &gt;generation, the same mutation occured as had occured in the first\n&gt; &gt;generation, it would be described as a different gene. Later, as \nthis\n&gt; &gt;phenomenon happens more than once, measured compatability as \nreturned by\n&gt; &gt;the compatiablity function wouldn&#39;t reflect the identical \nmutations.\n&gt; &gt;Am I making a mountain out of a molehill, or am I missing \nsomething\n&gt; &gt;important about the compatibility function?\n&gt; \n&gt; That really depends on how you handle the assignment of innovation \nID&#39;s.  \n&gt; For example, I remember which connection was split to make a \nnode.  Later \n&gt; (even hundreds of generations later), if a connection between \nthose two \n&gt; nodes is again split, the new node will receive the same node ID \nas the \n&gt; first time.  So if a particular piece of structure happens to \nevolve twice, \n&gt; it is recognized as being the same structure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken&#39;s implementation doesn&#39;t do that, not between generations \nanyway.  But \n&gt; at the same time, Ken&#39;s implementation has managed to evolve \nsolutions to \n&gt; things, so obviously it isn&#39;t critical.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is this:  If you are aware of the possibility of \ncompatible \n&gt; structures being seen as incompatible, and that bothers you, and \nyou have \n&gt; the time, energy, and know-how to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen, \nthen by all \n&gt; means, make sure it doesn&#39;t happen!  You&#39;ll sleep better at \nnight... ;)  \n&gt; Otherwise, don&#39;t worry, NEAT will still work just fine. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
