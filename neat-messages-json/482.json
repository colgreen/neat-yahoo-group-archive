From our experience, they can be pretty open about\nsharing.\n    For our virtual reality emergency department (www.imedi.org/edx.htm),\nafter a short pitch about our project, ID said they were open to the idea of\ngiving us their latest graphical engine (which at the time was Quake 3 and\ncost $300,000) to build our system for free.  Ultimately, Alan Fischer, our\nchief technical lead, decided to build his own system which is what you see\non the page.\n    Keep in mind also that previous iterations of ID software cost less\n(though still expensive.)  If I recall, it was $100,000 for Quake 2, and\n$10,000 for Quake 1.  But, at least at the time, if you go three generations\nback, they release the code for free.  Given that Doom 3 is coming out soon,\nQuake or Quake 2 code might soon be available for free.\n\n    While I am posting to the group, I might also mention that anyone who\nwould like to apply neuroevolution to evolving effective robotic navigation\nin hospitals or using them to predict which patients might be about to die\nor who shouldn&#39;t be sent home, we would love to hear project proposals at\nthe Medical Media Lab.  We fund grants and research externships (food,\nlodging, salary) in Washington D.C.\n\nThanks.\n\n-Mike\n---------------------------------\nMichael Gillam, MD\nInformatics Director, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare\nDivision of Emergency Medicine\n\nDirector, Institute for Medical Informatics Media Lab (www.imedi.org)\nDirector of Research, National Center for Emergency Medicine Informatics\n(www.ncemi.org)\nWashington D.C.\n\nChair, Web Educator&#39;s Interest Group\nSociety for Academic Emergency Medicine\n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 05, 2004 7:24 PM\nSubject: [neat] Game Engines\n\n\n&gt; Thanks to everyone who suggested an RTS game engine.  Unfortunately we\n&gt; really need something closer to commercial quality, so we may end up\n&gt; having to either rewrite an FPS engine ourselves, or go to a company\n&gt; and try to get them to let us use their proprietary code.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
