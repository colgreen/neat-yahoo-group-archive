Why did you go with a single dimension of  \noutput?\n\nI imagine that with the monochromatic version, it&#39;s easier to obtain  \nrecognizable objects, because we are focussed primarily on shapes and  \nshading (depth).  But in RGB I bet it would be harder to obtain  \nrecognizable objects because while we might obtain the right shapes,  \nthe colors would seem odd.  However, I&#39;m also betting that we could  \ncome up with some pretty interesting artwork this way.\n--\nStephen Waits\nsteve@...\nhttp://swaits.com/\n\n\n\n"}}
