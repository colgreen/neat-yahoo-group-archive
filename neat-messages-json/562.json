Xin Yao is a great speaker and a \nhighly motivating and encouraging supervisor as well and yes it sure \nis very hard to catch him. I am currently writing a paper with him \nwhich of course deals with the group&#39;s favourite topic - \nneuroevolution, but from an ensemble learning perspective. \n\nI&#39;ll second to Kennon&#39;s view on this MSc programme. It indeed is \nintellectually stimulating.\n\ncheers,\nArjun\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Kennon Ballou &lt;msc92klb@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (a bit off-topic, my apologies)\n&gt; \n&gt; xin yao is one of my lecturers here at birmingham :)\n&gt; \n&gt; he is a very good speaker. i say that he&#39;s my lecturer; \nunfortunately \n&gt; after the first two weeks he got someone else to cover the rest of \nthe \n&gt; lectures this term (Yong Liu, who despite being the co-creator of \n&gt; negative correlation learning, and quite a brilliant and nice guy, \nis \n&gt; not a particularly good lecturer.)\n&gt; \n&gt; i see this is why my coursemate (whose project Xin is supervising) \ncan \n&gt; never see him, since he&#39;s off wasting time at these stupid \nconferences \n&gt; in america :)\n&gt; \n&gt; by the way, if any of you are looking for an MSc programme, mine \nso far \n&gt; has been excellent - it has been a very good overview of \nevolutionary \n&gt; computation, neural computation, nature inspired optimisation, \netc. a \n&gt; large portion of the faculty here is involved in naturally \ninspired \n&gt; methods including neuroevolution, and it has been very \nintellectually \n&gt; stimulating.\n&gt; \n&gt; -KB-\n&gt; \n&gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yeah the guy giving the NN tutorial is Xin Yao, who is famous \nfor his\n&gt; &gt; 1999 pre-NEAT paper on neuroevolution, &quot;Evolving Neural \nNetworks,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; which was and probably still is the most comprehensive review of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; field.  But unfortunately at least in past years it looks like \nhis\n&gt; &gt; tutorial is mostly from that era, so it&#39;s missing a lot of the \nrecent\n&gt; &gt; developments in the field like NEAT.  (Of course this year could \nbe\n&gt; &gt; different.)  Still, I recommend checking it out since he&#39;s a well\n&gt; &gt; known researcher and his perspective may be useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n&gt;   msc natural computation : the university of birmingham\n&gt;   http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
