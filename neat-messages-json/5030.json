Folso=\r\nm-Kovarik that we have just added to Picbreeder: \n\nhttp://picbreeder.org/\n\n=\r\nAll images on the site now include a &quot;DNA&quot; button (directly below each imag=\r\ne) that launches you into the CPPN visualization applet for that image.  \n\n=\r\nThis visualization tool is much more sophisticated than just a way to see t=\r\nhe CPPN.  In fact, it shows you the &quot;hidden patterns&quot; computed at each hidd=\r\nen node of the CPPN.  That is, instead of displaying nodes as circles, it s=\r\nhows a little picture of the pattern computed by that node.  This visualiza=\r\ntion gives unprecedented insight into how the CPPN is building patterns pie=\r\nce of by through composition and combining.  Not only that, but you can als=\r\no change weights and do &quot;knockout&quot; experiments by deleting nodes in real ti=\r\nme and watch the effects not only at the final output, but throughout the e=\r\nntire network of hidden images.\n\nThe experience of playing with this tool r=\r\neminds me of the way that biologists try to decode gene regulatory networks=\r\n by determining the expression patterns of genes along the body axes.  (For=\r\n example, Drosophila flies are a popular subject of such study.)  However, =\r\nin Picbreeder we have the advantage of complete information, meaning that w=\r\nhat a biologist would take years to figure out for an organism, we can lite=\r\nrally discern in seconds for a Picbreeder image.\n\nIt is interesting to obse=\r\nrve how images are built from primitives near the bottom of the network tha=\r\nt later combine higher up to yield more complex shapes and gradients.  It i=\r\ns also interesting to look within lineages and see how some hidden patterns=\r\n are conserved internally.  There is a whole lot to learn, and I have alrea=\r\ndy learned a lot after only hours of playing with it.  The combination of a=\r\n massive evolutionary database on Picbreeder (over 7,000 images) with this =\r\nanalysis tool means you can in effect perform scientific investigations ins=\r\nide Picbreeder without any programming or special technical skills.\n\nThe to=\r\nol is intuitive, but you may be interested in all the bells and whistles, w=\r\nhich are described in this long-form documentation: http://picbreeder.org/a=\r\nnalysisDocumentation.pdf\n\nShorter instructions are displayed below the appl=\r\net itself when you load it.\n\nI would like to thank JT Folsom-Kovarik for th=\r\ne excellent contribution.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
