It&#39;s tempting to imagine writing a version of NEAT that could run o=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Azure.  Has the potential for exposing vast computing resources =\r\nfor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; relatively little coin.  Of course, at this point, if you were=\r\n going to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; develop something for Azure (or something similar), ther=\r\ne are better&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; languages than F# (probably C# for Azure and java for=\r\n just about anything&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; else - amazon EC2, hadoop, etc).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; - Jeff&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, =\r\nNov 22, 2009 at 5:19 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jeff, I&#39;m=\r\n not familiar enough with F# to judge whether it is well-suited&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; for NEAT or not.

There was a time when I would have said (did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; say) that C++ was the only language for NEAT. However, the advances are=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive.

I=\r\nt is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; completely&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interoperable with C#=\r\n/VB and can use the .NET framework. I&#39;m still&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; getting&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely ramped up on it but it seems like it might =\r\nbe very well&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; suited to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT. I was wo=\r\nndering what people think about this. Waste of time?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Maybe&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT would be better suited to hadoop or something li=\r\nke that.
