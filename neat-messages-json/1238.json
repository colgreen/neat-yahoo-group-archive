In the NN&#39;s I have encountered\n&gt; elsewhere the inputs are usually &#39;straight-through&#39; or placeholder nodes\n&gt; that don&#39;t apply a function for precisely the reasons you stated. \n\nYeah, this seems to be more of the norm in ANN architectures.  This\nwas another case where we took the words too literally without asking\nfor clarification.  Ken&#39;s original NEAT paper states, in the\nParameters section, states &quot;We used a modified sigmoidal transfer\nfunction, [equation], at all nodes.&quot;\n\nI guess part of our confusion stemmed from the common use of the term\n&quot;node&quot; to input placeholders.  It seems like most ANNs refer to the\npoints at which inputs are applied as either &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;neurons&quot;,\nwhen in reality they aren&#39;t really either.\n\nAnyway, as Colin points out, it probably doesn&#39;t have a huge impact on\nthe functioning of the network (especially if the range of input\nvalues is already constrained), though for consistency&#39;s sake, we&#39;ll\nmake the change and also rerun some of our experiments to see what\nkind of difference it makes.\n\nDerek\n\n&gt;Of\n&gt; course if you were to normalize the input signals to between -1.0,1.0\n&gt; then no information is actually lost and experiments should (I would\n&gt; guess)  perform just as well as when no function is used. This is most\n&gt; likely what has occured with Derek and Philips experiments, e.g. the XOR\n&gt; experiments used inputs of -1,1 and 0.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for whether using an input layer activation has a benefit, I&#39;m not\n&gt; well versed in NN&#39;s enough to say yes or no. It may have a benefit for\n&gt; some experiments, but on the whole it&#39;s more useful to have\n&gt; straight-through input nodes and then to normalize the input signals or\n&gt; adjust them in some other way before being aplied to the NN and on a\n&gt; per-experiment basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
