Here is my main question regarding\nthe work: How would you differentiate the NSA (novelty search algorithm)\nfrom exhaustive search in the behavior space?\n\nIf you think there is a relevant difference between the NSA and exhaustive\nbehavioral search, have you tried using the former as a control and seeing\nhow they compare?\n\nIf the NSA is effectively exhaustive search in behavior space, it seems to\nme that, while it will work well (and better than a GA) in small, deceptive\nlandscapes, it will not perform very well in large search spaces. Imagine,\nfor example, the paper&#39;s &quot;medium map&quot; but with a huge (near infinite) open\narea to the left of the starting condition. It could easily get lost over\nthere indefinitely.\n\nYou mention that it helps to have the domain constrain the search space.\nDoes this just mean that the (behavioral) search space has to be small\nenough that it can an exhaustive search can deal with it? How will it fare\nin the much larger search spaces of real-world problems, like checkers?\n\nUsing the NSA as something to bail out objective-search when it stagnates is\nan interesting suggestion. But at that point it should be compared to\nfitness sharing. Would it do better than fitness sharing? I can think of\nreasons it might (because it truly is not tempted by deceptive traps), but\nit would useful to see it compared to fitness sharing controls.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Thanks for putting this out there.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri, 09 May 2008 02:00:33 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Introducing a New Approach to Search: Novelty Search (New\n&gt; Paper)\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel Lehman and I are excited to announce our new publication to\n&gt; appear in the Eleventh International Conference on Articifial Life\n&gt; (ALIFE XI), called &quot;Exploiting Open-Endedness to Solve Problems\n&gt; Through the Search for Novelty.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper is here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html#lehman.alife08\n&gt; \n&gt; Direct link: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_alife08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; This paper is about a new kind of search (which works with NEAT) that\n&gt; abandons the longstanding notion in all of machine learning that the\n&gt; gradient of search should be measured with respect to the ultimate\n&gt; objective.  In other words, it entirely abandons objectives and\n&gt; thereby also abandons fitness functions as the impetus for search.\n&gt; Yet remarkably, we still show that such an algorithm can perform\n&gt; *better* than one that actually tries to achieve the objective!  I\n&gt; believe this strange result has fascinating implications for machine\n&gt; learning, artificial life, and even biology.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lately on this forum we have often discussed the nagging problem that\n&gt; the fitness function often does not properly recognize or reward the\n&gt; stepping stones on the way to the solution.  I went as far as\n&gt; suggesting that the fitness function can become an *obstacle* to\n&gt; success (e.g. when we discussed creativity in Picbreeder).\n&gt; \n&gt; While this discussion was largely philosophical, Joel Lehman and I\n&gt; decided to make it concrete and actually introduce an algorithm that\n&gt; makes an automated evolutionary process in *any* domain behave like\n&gt; humans in Picbreeder, that is, like open-ended evolution.  This\n&gt; approach is called &quot;novelty search.&quot;  The algorithm simply searches\n&gt; for behavior that is novel with respect to what has come before.\n&gt; \n&gt; The benefit of this approach is that it is immune to deception because\n&gt; it does not even try to achieve the objective.  I know it seems\n&gt; strange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact it is far more\n&gt; effective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive landscape than\n&gt; fitness-based search.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, what we are saying is that to achieve some of the most\n&gt; ambitious objectives we might have for evolution, we must abandon\n&gt; trying to explicitly achieve them.  To quote from the end of our\n&gt; Discussion section:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In summary, almost like a riddle, novelty search suggests\n&gt; a surprising new perspective on achievement: To achieve\n&gt; your highest goals, you must be willing to abandon them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe this lesson is true in practice and is therefore beyond a\n&gt; philosophical curiosity.  In fact, we are instinctively familiar with\n&gt; it in life in general when people say things like &quot;You are trying too\n&gt; hard&quot; or when we focus so much on something so far ahead of us in life\n&gt; that we forget completely to solve the short term problems that stand\n&gt; in our way.  It is no less true in evolution or search in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; For NEAT, novelty search should open up new opportunities for\n&gt; discovery that were previously closed off to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this work.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
