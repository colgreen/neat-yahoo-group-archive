(I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering how widespread it is.)\n\nMaybe it&#39;s not.  I think part of our problem is that we&#39;ve relied\nmostly on interpreting how NEAT works from papers, as opposed to\nreally stepping through your code.  In a sense that&#39;s good, because it\npossibly clarifies misunderstandings.\n\nI&#39;m guessing that most people here built their implementations by\nworking directly from your code.  I think we have to win the prize so\nfar for misintepretation, don&#39;t we? :)\n \n&gt; It is probably inevitable that in a fairly large and complicated\n&gt; system people will interpret certain things that seem clear to each\n&gt; individual in different ways.  Unfortunately this seems to be the\n&gt; case here, and I&#39;m sorry about the confusion.\n\nNo problem.  We made assumptions, and they turned out to be incorrect.\n But it is interesting to see how robust the algorithm is, since it\nhas performed reasonably well (even with truckloads of structure being\nadded every generation).\n\n&gt; Ultimately, the difference between our two systems is just in the\n&gt; rate of adding links and nodes.  That rate is indeed quite different\n&gt; (unless you made yours extremely small), but otherwise, both systems\n&gt; are still NEAT, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s *that* surprising that your\n&gt; system still works...it&#39;s just pumping more structure in faster.\n&gt; Most likely that&#39;s a liability and so your current performance can\n&gt; be even further improved.  Not necessarily bad news!\n\nTrue enough. :)\n\nI think we&#39;re actually going to keep our implementation the way it is,\nand just let users adjust mutation rates accordingly.  We still think\nbasing mutations on available potential locations is more\nbiologically-plausible.  Probably in a later release we&#39;ll allow for\nboth methods of handling mutations.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, it may explain why you found blended runs to be such\n&gt; an advantage, so it may mean further experiments are needed.  Not\n&gt; terrible news, though!  It&#39;s still interesting to note that high\n&gt; rates of structure adding combined with high rates of deletion\n&gt; together may come out fairly effective.  However, what we now need\n&gt; to know is whether your blending was just compensating for an overly\n&gt; aggressive structure building policy, or whether your results\n&gt; generalize.\n\nYeah...we&#39;ll have to see.\n\n&gt; Note that this does not use the term &quot;mutation rate,&quot; which you and\n&gt; Derek were thinking of.  Note &quot;the probability of adding a link&quot;\n&gt; would be a strange way to phrase something that could add more than\n&gt; one link.\n\nOkay, fair enough.  We extrapolated &quot;the probability of adding a link&quot;\nto &quot;the probability of adding a link where the potential for one\nexisted&quot;, rather than &quot;the probability of adding a link to an\nindividual chromosome&quot;, and obviously that was an incorrect reading.\n\n&gt; When we talked about weight mutation, we said:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;There was an 80% chance of a genome having its connection weights\n&gt; mutated, in which case each weight had a 90% chance of being\n&gt; uniformly perturbed and a 10% chance of being assigned a new random\n&gt; value.&quot;\n\nYeah, I think this passage was crystal clear.  I think the structural\nmutation explanation would have probably been clearer if it had been\nworded similarly (e.g., &quot;There was a 3% chance of a genome having an\nadditional node mutated, and a 5% chance of a genome having a new\nconnection added, though structural mutations were limited to one per\nchromosome per generation&quot;).  Or something like that.\n\nAgain, no real harm done.  It has resulted, at least, in some\ninadvertent experimentation. :)\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
