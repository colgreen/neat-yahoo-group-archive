It might be easier if there was a plain EXE version since I\n&gt;&gt;tend to use Remote Connection to my workhorse PC and then\n&gt;&gt;logoff/disconnect leaving processes running with no display - and hence\n&gt;&gt;no screensaver. Also it has other (low CPU) jobs to do, so keeping the\n&gt;&gt;CPU priority low would be nice.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I usually set it to, err, whatever cryptic phrase MS use for a \n&gt;priority in stead of a nice simple number that anybody would \n&gt;understand, err, oh yes, &quot;THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL&quot;, would that \n&gt;do you?\n&gt;\n\nYup.\n\n&gt;  Can windows be in a state where there is no display?  I mean \n&gt;it&#39;s not like *nix where there needn&#39;t be a graphical front-end at all...\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nIt didn&#39;t occur to me until you said &#39;screensaver&#39; but yeh, I often \nconnect over remote desktop, start an app with a GUI (e.g. I have a \nlittle prog that monitors live share prices and emails me at work if \nanything interesting happens) and then disconnect leaving the desktop \nsort of hanging. When I connect later on the desktop is still intact. \nIt&#39;s basically equivalent to logging off from a local machine - no \napplications are actually shut down\n\n\n&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m going to do an alternative exe that sits in the system \n&gt;tray (because my machine at work has _two_ CPU&#39;s (whooo!) and a \n&gt;single-thread app can use at most 1 of them, so I was going to stick \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThe OS can use one or two also :) \n\n&gt;the exe in the system tray all the time (with an option to \n&gt;right-click on it and pause it for if I need both CPUs) and the \n&gt;screen-saver to come in when the machine is completely not-in-use and \n&gt;use the other CPU...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI tend not to use screensavers. I&#39;ve been caught out in the past leaving \nprocesses running, only to come back later to discover the screensaver \ngrabbed all of the CPU drawing pretty pictures, doh!\n\nColin.\n\nP.S. I see there is now a global warming experiment / climate model \ndistributed client. Sounds like a self fulfilling prophecy to me!\n\n"}}
