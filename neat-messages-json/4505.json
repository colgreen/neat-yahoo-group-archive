It \npostulates that there are controllers in =\r\nthe brain and that there are parts of the brain that \ncontrol other parts. =\r\nThus the theory refutes the connectionist theory that there are no \nseparat=\r\ne controllers in the brain for higher-level functions and that all control =\r\nis &gt; &quot;&gt; \nlocal and distributed&gt; &quot;&gt;  at the level of the cells. Connectionis=\r\nt algorithms themselves \nare used to prove this theory. Plus there is evide=\r\nnce in the neuroscience literature to \nsupport this theory. Thus the paper =\r\nproposes a control theoretic approach to \nunderstanding how the brain works=\r\n and learns. That means that control theoretic \nprinciples should be applic=\r\nable to developing systems similar to the brain.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\n=3D\n&gt; For those interested, summaries of prior debates on the =\r\nbasic ideas of connectionism \nare available at the CompNeuro archive site. =\r\nHere is a partial list of the debate summaries \nthat are available\n&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/Archive/1999/0079.html&gt; - Some mo=\r\nre \nquestions in the search for sources of control in the brain\n&gt; &lt;http://w=\r\nww.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/Archive/1998/0084.html&gt; - BRAINS \nINTERNAL=\r\n MECHANISMS - THE NEED FOR A NEW PARADIGM\n&gt; &lt;http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/=\r\ncomp-neuro/Archive/1997/0069.html&gt; - COULD \nTHERE BE REAL-TIME, INSTANTANEO=\r\nUS LEARNING IN THE BRAIN?\n&gt; &lt;http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/Archi=\r\nve/1997/0057.html&gt; - \nCONNECTIONIST LEARNING: IS IT TIME TO RECONSIDER THE =\r\nFOUNDATIONS?\n&gt; &lt;http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/Archive/1997/0012.=\r\nhtml&gt; - DOES \nPLASTICITY IMPLY LOCAL LEARNING?

How could one go about =\r\ntransferring the strategic planning and\n&gt; tactical maneuver skills learned =\r\nby the drone from experience (assuming also\n&gt; that a form of online learnin=\r\ng is employed) to another drone of a relatively\n&gt; similar morphology and lo=\r\ncomotion characteristics where those skills be\n&gt; still relevant?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A level of a separation of\n&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_=\r\nconcerns&gt;  concerns exists in\n&gt; the brains of both drones in terms of abstr=\r\nact modules for a) low level\n&gt; autonomous flight and another b) for higher =\r\nlevel planning and maneuver\n&gt; cognitive functions.  These modular might exi=\r\nst as two separate networks\n&gt; coupled together living on separate FPGA chip=\r\ns, for example or might exist\n&gt; logically in one giant mess of neurons (due=\r\n to incremental complexification\n&gt; development).  It would be very useful t=\r\no have a process for decoupling a\n&gt; given autonomous system functionally an=\r\nd be able to reuse its component\n&gt; networks in different types of systems, =\r\nwhere it makes sense, by somehow\n&gt; &#39;fusing&#39; the parts together -  a process=\r\n that could also facilitate the\n&gt; adaptation and integration of components.=\r\n After all our brains have evolved\n&gt; into cognitive faculties, are compartm=\r\nentalized and have highly specialized\n&gt; circuits for recognizing faces and =\r\nconceptualizing numbers for example. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just a shot in the dark b=\r\nut may be modeling biological cellular growth and\n&gt; development might do th=\r\nis, there are some fascinating examples in biological\n&gt; systems where one s=\r\net of cells becomes integrated with another, for instance\n&gt; in the process =\r\nof restoring lost function by &#39;injecting&#39; stem cells.
