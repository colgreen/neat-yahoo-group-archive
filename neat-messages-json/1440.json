The population starts out with no \nconnections and hence all genomes score 0 in the first few generations \nuntil good conenctions are found. This was found to give similar results \nto starting with a small proportion of input-output neurons connections\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&gt;This is a traditional NEAT run in Colin&#39;s domain. The max fitness for\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;this domain is 260,\n&gt;&gt;\nyep.\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&gt; I believe. For the first few hundred generations,the population \n&gt;&gt; improves to about 80, but for the next several*thousand* generations, \n&gt;&gt; the max and average fitness for the population gets worse and worse, \n&gt;&gt; ending up essentially as good as the initial random population (~10). \n&gt;&gt; This isn&#39;t about simpler or more complex individuals performing \n&gt;&gt; better or worse. This is about the entire population getting *worse* \n&gt;&gt; throughout the run. It certainly seems to me that this is not the way \n&gt;&gt; NEAT is supposed to work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That definitely is a bit odd.  Colin, what was the number of \n&gt;generations of stagnation before a species was cut?  It looks like \n&gt;species were dying off pretty quickly there is that&#39;s really the \n&gt;underlying explanation for the downward trend.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe species &#39;drop off age&#39; was set to 200 generations. I still beleive \nthat the drop in population fitness is due to the phenomena I described, \nthat is:\n\n1) A rising species compatibilty threshold caused by the quickly rising \ncomplexity. This causes like species to be combined into fewer species.\n\n2) SharpNEAT culling fit species when they reach the drop off age.\n\n3) SharpNEATs current crossover technique which is very likely causing \ncomplexity to rise far quicker than in other NEAT implementations and \nthus exacerbating (1).\n\n\nIf I were to change (2) so that I focus in on the fittest species (as \ndoes original NEAT) then the fitness would (should) not ever drop. But \nas I say, I would prefer to cull species once they had not improved for \nsome time, even if they are the fittest. I am willing to admit that the \nculling age should perhaps be a lot greater for the fittest species, \nsince the culling&#39;s primary purpose is to discard of the numerous new \ntopologies, the bulk of which will probably be no good. Culling the \nfittest species after 200 generations might be being too eager.\n\nBut the principle remains that I recon it is still valid to give up on \nthe best topology if it hasn;t improved and to move on to another area \nof the search space. If we keep complexity in check then we might then \nsee another rise in fitness following a dip (which we do see in small \namounts, right?) as we move around different areas in the search space \nand give up on each of them in turn.\n\nThe question is, when do you give up? Or is it preferable to do what \noriginal NEAT does and focus in on the current best species and leave it \nto the operator to give up and re-start the search? I suppose if you \nlook at nature then the fittest species are never given up on - a local \noptimum is better than nothing, but then nature has a far large \npopulation to work with when trying get out of local optima.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
