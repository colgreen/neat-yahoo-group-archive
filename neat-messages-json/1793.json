I am truly humbled.\n\nWhy thank you. No, english isn&#39;t my first language, but I&#39;m familiar with\nmany kinds of morons, oxegenated or otherwise. ;)\n \n&gt; &gt; The question is - which indicators to use and what fitness function\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; use. I tried a dozen different fitness functions also. Max drawdown,\n&gt; max\n&gt; &gt; profit, max profit / max drawdown etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, the fitness function, there indeed is the rub. Could some sort of\n&gt; Chi-squared function be applied to determine statistical significance\n&gt; of the results?\n\nPossibly, I&#39;m not really familiar with chi-squared though I looked it up\nright now.\n\n[Snip]\n&gt; I think these may have a permanent\n&gt; effect on markets, such that rules that were applicable before are\n&gt; potentially lethal (in a financial sense) after. \n\nYes, but not only actual events carry this risk, trading conditions can\nchange for no particular reason, as when the market moves from bull/bear\nto a sideways market.\n\n&gt; Using daily data then\n&gt; severely restricts the amount of history that can safely be used.\n\nAh, yes, changes to legislation that mean that trading has forever changed\nwill invalidate all old data. But I&#39;m not sure that the short term trading\nis thus affected. Though I&#39;ll say this; trading _has_ changed the last\ncouple of years. Everyone trades with an online broker these days, and\nthey&#39;re far more active then ever before. This didn&#39;t used to be the case\nand arguably things have changed since before - say - 1998?\n\nHowever, I feel that there are probably a number a modes of trading that\nthe market place moves between, and individual stocks can exist in a\ndifferent mode from the rest of the marketplace. Thus, you want your\ntraining set to contain the mode that&#39;s going to prevail in the immediate\nfuture. Since you don&#39;t know what mode that is, and at what times in the\npast that mode was active, you&#39;re forced to include all modes.\n\nSounds complex, but in reality, I think that adding many years of data\nwould be enough. You want bull, bear, booms, total busts and sideways\nmarkets in the data set, cause either one of them could be next.\n\nSadly, this is never going to be as profitable as including a more limited\nnumber of modes, or only the mode that&#39;s active at the time.\n\n&gt; Perhaps a candidate input might be the time since a major shock was\n&gt; experienced, which might help the model decide when it&#39;s learned\n&gt; enough about the way the market has changed. I&#39;d expect that recurrent\n&gt; networks would be a big help here.\n\nI was forced to give up recurence (or it&#39;s GP equivalent) for practical\npurposes in my previous attempts, but I&#39;ll try to investigate it again.\n\n&gt; I think to get the full benefit of\n&gt; this the network shouldn&#39;t be iterated for each set of inputs until it\n&gt; reaches some kind of &quot;steady state&quot;, rather that each set of inputs\n&gt; consitututes one &quot;tick&quot; in the evaluation.\n\nThis sounds interesting.\n\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not saying that AI trading isn&#39;t possible though...\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m utterly convinced that it is - I&#39;ve worked with too many traders\n&gt; to believe that most of them couldn&#39;t be replaced with a reasonably\n&gt; well-written program!\n\nlol!\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
