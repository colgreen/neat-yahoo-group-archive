I only skimmed the patent,\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Briefly looking over their method, it doesn&#39;t look very principled.  I\n&gt;mean it just seems like a glorified GP implementation.  Every once in\n&gt;a while I see a site like this with very little detail but lots of\n&gt;grandiose claims about changing the world.  You get the sense they\n&gt;aren&#39;t aware of what&#39;s going on in the research world, because they\n&gt;seem to think their idea is one-of-a-kind.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBut what about the patent? I&#39;m not sure how the system works in the US \nbut over here in the UK patent applications cost not an insignifacnt \namount of money - I seem to remember figures in the thousands of pounds \nwhen I have discussed this in the past. Perhaps they just have more \nmoney (to throw about) than sense :)\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
