The methodology of applying a \nHyperc=\r\nube network comprised of a richer functional vocabulary to a \nsubstrate net=\r\nwork strongly coupled to the problem definition (i.e. \ninputs and outputs),=\r\n is the core feature. There is no reason that \nevolved complexification of =\r\nboth the Hypercube and substrate networks \ncan not be performed. The guidel=\r\nine being adding complexity to the \nsubstrate network only to the degree th=\r\nat the combined effects of \nhypercube functional vocabulary and topology ac=\r\nhieve the problem \nthreshold performance criteria within practical expendit=\r\nure of \ncomputational time/resources.\n\nAs an example, consider the multipli=\r\ncity of mathematical formulations \nconsidered for data modeling on the zunz=\r\nun.com website (tens of \nthousands). The importance of the hypercube functi=\r\nonal vocabulary \nlies in the ability express a useful mathematical relation=\r\nship with \nminimal additional search space, and be extensible (i.e. lego \nb=\r\nuilding block approach). If the hypercube functional vocabulary is \ntoo sim=\r\nplistic only, then the search space is inordinately increased \nby shear num=\r\nbers trying to achieve representation by brute force \n(i.e. such as a Taylo=\r\nr series expansion to achieve a Sine function).\n\nThen there is the need for=\r\n the hypercube functional vocabulary to \ncontain proximity based applicatio=\r\nn mapping/limit functions which \nallow multiple, fundamentally different ma=\r\nthematical expressions, to \ncoevolved in separate sub-partitions of the sea=\r\nrch space, to address \nunderlying problem discontinuities. Again, the guide=\r\nline being adding \ncomplexity only to achieve the problem threshold perform=\r\nance criteria \nwithin practical expenditure of computational time/resources=\r\n.\n\nThis is why I believe that the hypercube functional vocabulary of \nactiv=\r\nation functions require the ability to maintain additional \nassociated evol=\r\nved parameters, rather than simply Y=3Df(X).\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nStephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 28, 2007, at 3:53 PM, afcarl=\r\n2 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The attractiveness of evolving\n&gt; &gt; global relationships in =\r\nthe Hypercube network is self-apparent, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; the set of useful problems=\r\n in which the substrate network made up \nof\n&gt; &gt; only input and output nodes=\r\n seems limiting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right.  With HyperNEAT, I assumed that you would (man=\r\nually, a \npriori)  \n&gt; locate hidden nodes on the substrate.  And, yes, some=\r\n evolutionary  \n&gt; mechanism needs to be devised so that substrate configura=\r\ntions may  \n&gt; also be evolved.  Ken seemed to agree, and I wonder if they&#39;r=\r\ne  \n&gt; already working on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; With or without that mechanism, adding =\r\nevolvability of activation  \n&gt; functions feels complex to me... in the sens=\r\ne that it&#39;s probably  \n&gt; unnecessary.  But, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just a feeli=\r\nng.  If you  \n&gt; formally compare with and without activation evolution, I&#39;d=\r\n \ncertainly  \n&gt; like to see the results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, in your case, if you&#39;re =\r\nnot putting any hidden nodes on the  \n&gt; substrate, I can see how this would=\r\n help; however, I wonder if \nit&#39;s  \n&gt; enough?  Just doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;r=\r\ne going to get very far \nwithout  \n&gt; using hidden nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
