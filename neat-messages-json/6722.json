Submissions not accepted for talks will also b=\r\ne considered in the poster sessions.\n\nSSBSS 2017 will focus on advances in =\r\nthe science and technology emerging from the fields of synthetic biology, s=\r\nystems biology, genome synthesis and genetic engineering. \nThe School and t=\r\nhe Workshop will highlight new tool development, as well as the application=\r\n of these tools to diverse problems in biotechnology, computational medicin=\r\ne, molecular biology including therapeutics, industrial chemicals and biofu=\r\nels, natural products, and agriculture.\n\nIf you are engaged in above cited =\r\ntopics that you believe can impact the state of the science and technology =\r\nyou must consider submitting.\n\n\nGOAL\nGiven the rapidity with which this fie=\r\nld moves, it is challenging for both newcomers and experts alike to stay up=\r\ndated with all of the latest advances. \nThe goal of this summer school and =\r\nworkshop is to bring together scientists from academia and industry with di=\r\nverse but relevant expertise in a setting \nconducive to discussion of new r=\r\nesults and potential collaborative efforts. \nInvited talks will cover a wid=\r\ne range of topics ranging from fundamental basic science through to applica=\r\ntions. \nAttendees of this workshop will have the opportunity to hear about =\r\nthe latest findings in this fast-paced field and to establish collaboration=\r\ns with scientists who have complementary expertise.\n\n\nTOPICS\nSessions integ=\r\nrate the recent achievements made in the fields of synthetic biology, syste=\r\nms biology, biochemical engineering, synthetic enzyme, evolutionary enginee=\r\nring, \nintegrated omics, tools and methods, and emerging techniques, health=\r\ncare, biofuels, chemicals and materials, biologics, microbial and mammalian=\r\n systems, and other disciplines and applications.\n\nSubmissions should be re=\r\nlated to the following areas of synthetic biology, systems biology, genome =\r\nand genetic engineering:\n\nApplications of Synthetic & Systems Biology\nBiolo=\r\ngical Design Automation\nComputational/Mathematical Modeling and Design \nCom=\r\nputer Aided Design \nDirected Evolution \nDesigning and Writing Genomes\nDNA S=\r\nynthesis, Assembly, and Sequencing  \nHigh Throughput Design Space Explorati=\r\non \nIndustrial Applications of Synthetic & Systems Biology \nMammalian Synth=\r\netic Biology\t\nMetabolic Engineering \nMicrobial Synthetic Biology / Microbio=\r\nme Engineering \nMolecular Programming \nOmics Science and Synthetic & System=\r\ns Biology \nPedagogical/Educational Tools \nPlant Synthetic Biology \nProtein =\r\nEngineering \nSynthetic & Systems Biology for Cell Culture and Medical Appli=\r\ncations\nSynthetic & Systems Biology of Industrial Microorganisms\n\n\nCOMMITTE=\r\nE\nYaakov (Kobi) Benenson,  ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland\nLeonidas Bleris, =\r\n The University of Texas at Dallas, USA\nDomitilla Del Vecchio,  MIT, USA\nDi=\r\nego Di Bernardo, Telethon Institute  & University of Napoli &quot;Federico II&quot;, =\r\nItaly\nBarbara Di Camillo, University of Padova, Italy\nBarbara Di Ventura, B=\r\nioQuant/DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany\nSimone Furini, University of Siena, Italy=\r\n\nEmanuele Domenico Giordano, University of Bologna, Italy\nJ.
