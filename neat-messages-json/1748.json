However, just within the last couple weeks we\n&gt; have been experimenting with such input and that&#39;s what Reuben is\n&gt; referring to with his quotes.\n\nAh...okay.  Mystery solved. \n\n&gt; In answers to your questions about noise, there are several types of\n&gt; noise that can poitentially be added, but my disucssions with Reuben\n&gt; were specifically about adding noise to prevent NEAT from learning\n&gt; that specific pixels in a raw visual field are indicators of\n&gt; specific states or necessary actions.  \n\nI guess my next question is how you are feeding pixel input from the\nRARS model into the neural network.  Are you using an active vision\napproach?  Is there just a front-end view?  Or also a rear view?\n\nAre you inputting grayscale values, or including color?  How visually\ncomplex is the RARS model (i.e., Are walls always the same color and\nbrightness?  Is there shading in this environement?) ?  It would seem\nlike more richness and variation in the simulation environment would\nlead to more robustness.\n\n&gt; In general, it has been shown that for real world transfer &quot;model\n&gt; noise&quot; is quite effective, meaning that the actions requested by the\n&gt; outputs result in slightly unpredictable results.  Faustino Gomez\n&gt; showed this here at UT.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in the particular case of raw visual input, we are talking\n&gt; about a specific kind of problem- learning pixel correlations to\n&gt; states - and that might be best served by some noise in the\n&gt; display.\n\nWell, for car driving, if what you&#39;re saying is true, then it would\nmake sense to add noise to the control outputs.  But for the case of\njust correlating pixel information with particular states or\nsituations, that makes sense.\n\nFor the fingerprint domain, as we did with the basic shapes, we\nrandomize the images in the evaluation set by slightly moving them a\nrandom number of pixels up/down, right/left, scaling them up/down by\n10-20%, and rotating them in either direction 10-20 degrees.  We\nthought about adding random pixel noise, as Floreano did, and also\nconsidered randomizing other visual features, such as brightness, but\nin the end decided that the noise we were adding was probably\nsufficient.\n\nAgain, I don&#39;t know how sophisticated the RARS visual modeling is, but\nthat would seem to be one of the big challenges in such an accident\nwarning system...the complexity of real-world visual scenes,\ncomplicated by the fact that people drive all hours of the day and\nnight, so there&#39;s a huge amount of variance in lighting conditions. \nDoes RARS, for example, have night driving?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
