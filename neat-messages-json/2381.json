If you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;connecting nodes A & B, then start with B and traverse the net to see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;if you connect to A.  If you do, disallow the connection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks, this is an option I&#39;ll keep in mind if I decide to attempt the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Othello comp. Of course this approach will probably start eating CPU\n&gt; &gt; &gt;cycles as the genomes become more complex so it&#39;s something I&#39;d prefer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;to leave out of the code base in the long term - being somewhat obsessed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with optimisations as I am :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;One possible optimisation is to keep a list of a genome&#39;s neurons in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;order that they are connected, so that again we can safely assume that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;making a connection between some neurons with some index to some higher\n&gt; &gt; &gt;index in the list is OK. Elsewhere though I have code that assumes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;neurons are in innovation ID order, as this allows finding of neurons\n&gt; &gt; &gt;with a binary search over the list - so probably the solution is to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;maintain two lists.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;          You might already be thinking this, but one cheap way to do\n&gt; &gt; this is to keep a &quot;depth parameter&quot; in each neuron.  Depth is defined\n&gt; &gt; as zero in the input layer, and for any other neurone is the highest\n&gt; &gt; depth amongst its inputs plus one.  All you need do then is (i) never\n&gt; &gt; connect from higher to lower depth (equal is OK) and (ii) scan the\n&gt; &gt; neurones recalculating the depth after any connection change.  This\n&gt; &gt; is a simple form of dynamic programming....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;          Ian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ___________________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
