As a non-objective type of behavioral search, it is indeed rem=\r\niniscent of novelty search.  Like both of you I&#39;m not really sure if the id=\r\nea is that new, though it&#39;s not entirely the same as anything else either. =\r\n Another question is whether it has any advantage over easier-to-understand=\r\n ideas like searching for novelty. A couple concepts that remind me a bit o=\r\nf this work outside novelty search include &quot;homeokinesis&quot; (http://robot.inf=\r\normatik.uni-leipzig.de/videos/) and &quot;Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement =\r\nLearning&quot; (which at least sounds quite similar) (http://www.aaai.org/Papers=\r\n/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf)\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Greg&quot;=\r\n &lt;greg_barton@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.insidescience.org/content/physicis=\r\nt-proposes-new-way-think-about-intelligence/987\n&gt; \n&gt; From the article: &#39;Ent=\r\nropica&#39;s intelligent behavior emerges from the &quot;physical process of trying =\r\nto capture as many future histories as possible,&quot; said Wissner-Gross.&#39;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Fairly close to searching for novelty.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
