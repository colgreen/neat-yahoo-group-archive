This is why squaring the fitness is o=\r\nften a way to force more aggressive evolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Chris Garrett&quot; &lt;garrerc@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For my experiment, =\r\nI have positive and negative contributions to my fitness function.  After a=\r\n few iterations, I noticed that NEAT does not like fitness values less than=\r\n 0.000001 (1e-6).  I feel like I may be losing information if I simply clip=\r\n things at this value.  What would be the effect of simply padding the fitn=\r\ness with some large value?  Would there be any ill effects?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
