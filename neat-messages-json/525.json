I feel like you do all of the \nwork and speak for self advocates in NH group. I feel that self \nadvocates should be speaking for them selfs it is all about us. I am \na strong self advocate here in VT.  We really support our slogan \nNONTHING ABOUT US WITH OUT US.  Is there any reason why you are \ndoing basically all the talking from your NH group?  about what is \ngoing on with the group. My feeling is that you should let your self \nadvocates, advocate for them self.  And if they have not found there \nown voice yet maybe you could help them find it.  It is really worth \nit. Your e-mails do have good things in them to say, and i think \nadvocates should be involved in every thing that they are able to \ndo,  And i feel that the ADVISORS should\n&gt;  encourage them to do so  That is what SELF ADVOCATE MEANS \nspeaking for our self. And we all have good and important things to \nsay.\n&gt; Thanks for Listening\n&gt; I AM ALWAYS OPEN FOR FEED BACK AND SUGGESTIONS.\n&gt; PATTY D&gt; AND I SPEAK FOR MY SELF\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo! Mail - More reliable, more storage, less spam\n\n\n"}}
