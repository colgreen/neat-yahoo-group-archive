You might \nalso consider devising some simple experiments based on memory, \nrecalling sequences of symbols that sort of thing. That should be easy \nimplement and fast.\n\nFunction regression is another that comes to mind. You can use a range \nof functions of varying complexity to vary the problem difficulty. The \nOneInputFunctionRegression experiment in sharpneat does this and \ncontains a few different simple functions that I tried.\n\nI think certian classes of problems are always going to be none trivial \nto implement and slow to run, e.g. control, game playing. It would be \nnice to have some reference implementations and to define a standard \nscore based on performance on a fixed set of problem domains. As new \ndomains are introduced we could just define a new standard that includes \nthem.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  It would be nice to\n&gt; have a spectrum of tasks to test a new implementation or variation out\n&gt; against, that you&#39;d be able to run in an afternoon.\n\n\nTotally agree.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
