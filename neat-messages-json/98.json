Innovation does\n&gt; not necessarily have to be complexification, does it?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you had a speciated population of complex\n&gt; solutions, with subtractive mutations that actually\n&gt; remove or disable parts of the genome, an innovation\n&gt; might actually be a simplification of how a given\n&gt; neural structure functions, right?  \n&gt; \n&gt; If there is a simplifying trend that might actually\n&gt; lead to increased fitness, you would also want to\n&gt; protect that group of genotypes by speciating them.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is analogous to nature, isn&#39;t it?  There is a\n&gt; general trend of complexification, but in certain\n&gt; niches and within particular populations, a\n&gt; simplification of morphological structure could arise\n&gt; as a mutation and actually increase the fitness of\n&gt; that individual.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that starting minimally and complexifying\n&gt; makes a lot of sense in the early stages of a given\n&gt; run, but perhaps in a long run, during the mid to late\n&gt; stages, simplification may be an important dynamic to\n&gt; add, and speciation may work to protect simplified\n&gt; innovations just as it worked to protect complexified\n&gt; innovations early in the run.\n&gt; \n\nYes Derek you make a good point.  The interaction between\ncomplexification and simplification in NEAT has not been\nwell studied.  However, we have studied simplification in\nisolation: We ran experiments where we started with large fully-\nconnected topologies and then let them simplify by removing genes.\nThis was far less powerful than starting minimally and \ncomplexifying, although it was interesting.  You tended to get \nspurts of several improvements in a row after every few \nsimplifications, but the improvements tended to be miniscule \ncompared to the ones you get with complexification.  \n\nIn any case, if you start out minimally, and complexify *and* \nsimplify (albeit at a lower rate than complexifying) that could\nbe pretty interesting.  And it should work as you say- speciation\nwill protect simplifications just as it does complexifications.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
