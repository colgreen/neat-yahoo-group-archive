E.g. if you take \nan XOR network you would expect to see a chequered pattern with 4 \nsquares - a perfect network would have straight edges, but in reality \nthe edges will likely be smooth and curved if you have used a continous \nactivation function instead of a step.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n1) Render color images by using, say, three outputs to describe Red, \nGreen, Blue or Hue, Luninence, Saturation. In fact there are loads of \nother color systems, and I guess not all of them use three values.\n2) Real-time moving images that represent the changing outputs.\n3) Use hidden nodes as the data source. This is a development of the \nanaysis idea - if I have a network with loads of output and hidden \nnodes, I can still visualize the signals being generated on specfic \nnodes by slecting the as a signal source.\n3) 3D is harder to imagine, however if you apply a step function to your \none output value you can potentially use the threshold point to describe \nthe surface of a shape, or a more often it would probably be a curved plane.\n\nCombine the lot to get 3D movies of morphing shapes!\n\nColin\n\n"}}
