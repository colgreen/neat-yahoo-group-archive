A \n&gt;&gt;couple of things I need to look into are the population size fluctuating \n&gt;&gt;quite a bit (between 70-150 in a population that is supposed to be 150) \n&gt;&gt;and also I have not imlemented the purging of old species (droppoff_age \n&gt;&gt;parameter) - which is something you mentioned on the list yesterday \n&gt;&gt;which I would expect to be quite an important part of the search algorithm!\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nQuick update on this. I fixed the pop size problem and implemented \nspecies culling... starting to get nice results now. As an example of \nthe species culling working very well have a look at this log output:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\ngen=775, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=61.36, species=10, difficulty=8\ngen=776, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=64.93, species=10, difficulty=8\ngen=777, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=63.62, species=10, difficulty=8\ngen=778, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=69.39, species=5, difficulty=8\ngen=779, bestFitness=88.00, meanFitness=67.82, species=3, difficulty=8\ngen=780, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=69.45, species=3, difficulty=8\ngen=781, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=71.17, species=5, difficulty=8\ngen=782, bestFitness=90.00, meanFitness=68.34, species=5, difficulty=8  \n&lt;-- threshold of 90 achieved and therefore the task difficulty is \nincreased and the best fitness drops in the next gen...\ngen=783, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=64.32, species=6, difficulty=9 \ngen=784, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.79, species=6, difficulty=9\ngen=785, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.76, species=6, difficulty=9\ngen=786, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=65.57, species=6, difficulty=9\ngen=787, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=66.09, species=7, difficulty=9\ngen=788, bestFitness=86.00, meanFitness=66.03, species=7, difficulty=9\ngen=789, bestFitness=89.00, meanFitness=67.01, species=7, difficulty=9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe search was stuck at a best fitness of 88 and then culled some old \nspecies away, almost immediately an improvement is seen. I saw this \nhappen several times in the handfull of runs I just did.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
