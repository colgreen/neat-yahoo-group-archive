I guess \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;The placement of nodes in layers is somewhat\n&gt;arbitrary, since they really aren&#39;t in a layer.  My\n&gt;inclination would be to favor placing them in layers\n&gt;based on ease of readability when graphically\n&gt;represented, since that&#39;s the primary reason for\n&gt;putting them in layers in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTo be honest I purposefully haven&#39;t put much though into visualisation \nyet since I thought it might become tricky and hopefully there are some \npapers out there that can offer some help, e.g. Ken mentioned a paper by \nMat Buckland that offered some ideas and this would be my first port of \ncall. But since we&#39;re on the subject...\n\nLayering by distance from inputs and/or ouptuts gives us some kind of \nstarting point. Only trying it and seeing the output will tell us if \nit&#39;s actually a good technique. It&#39;s easy to do it&#39;s an obvious first \nchoice of visualisation to try. If it doesn;t work then we&#39;ll have to \ntry something else - at least it can&#39;t be any worse than an arbitrary \nlayout.\n\nPutting a little more thought into the process we could probably get a \nbetter layout by placing neurons in clusters based on the number of \ninterconnections. Quite how you would work that out though I have no \nidea! It sounds like one of those problems that is easy for a human to \ndo but is very difficult to describe mathematicaly.\n\n&gt;--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt;&gt;pretty well.  The\n&gt;&gt;one thing to make sure of is not to count a\n&gt;&gt;recurrent connection as a\n&gt;&gt;hop-  otherwise you can go in circles- but that\n&gt;&gt;requires also knowing\n&gt;&gt;which connections are recurrent, which may also be\n&gt;&gt;difficult depending\n&gt;&gt;how you keep track of things.  \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yep...good point.  We&#39;ve got logic that determines\n&gt;whether a connection is recurrent at the time we\n&gt;generate the XML, so we add a boolean &quot;recurrent&quot; tag\n&gt;to each connection as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHow do you determine if a connection is recurrent? Surely it is not \nalways a clearly defined thing, e.g. where there are many \ninterconnections all of  the connections could potentialy participate in \n&#39;loops&#39;. My first approach to this problem would be to use something \nakin to a tree traversal algorithm, incrementing a &#39;distance from start \npoint&#39; integer as we go and storing the distance at each neuron we \nvisit. Perform a complete traversal from each input neuron, If we \nencounter a neuron that has already been visited then check it&#39;s \ndistance value - if it is &lt;=currentDistance then don&#39;t traverse any \nfurther, if it is &gt;currentDistance then rest it&#39;s value and traverse on \nfrom that point. Does that make sense? I&#39;m not 100% sure if thise would \nwork effectively or whether it would be faster/slower than the technique \nyou guys are already using.\n\n&gt;&gt;The problem is that\n&gt;&gt;this method is very\n&gt;&gt;computationally expensive, and also requires always\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nYeh but it&#39;s not part of the main evolution routine so we can afford cpu \nexpensive code in this area- so long as it&#39;s not going to take a \n/really/ long time.\n\n&gt;&gt;knowing which\n&gt;&gt;connections are recurrent.  Once you get thousands\n&gt;&gt;of nodes I find it\n&gt;&gt;starts lagging out a lot before drawing anything.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, our XSL style sheet is going to be able to parse\n&gt;a network of thousands of nodes (and therefore\n&gt;probably tens or hundreds of thousands of\n&gt;connections), but I&#39;m not sure any such graphical\n&gt;representation is going to be very human-readable, no\n&gt;matter how it&#39;s laid out, at least if it draws every\n&gt;single structure.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAgreed. Large networks are going to be inherently hard to visualise no \nmatter how you lay them out. Would still be nice to see them on screen \nand perhaps zoom in and out, etc. Perhaps we could also develop a tool \nthat allows manipulation of networks, adding/removing or \nneurons/connections, that sort of thing. Ahhh, so perhaps another \nusefull XML attribute would by neuron X,Y coordinates!\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
