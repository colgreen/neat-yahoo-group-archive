I like the idea of the gradual merging in \nof structure from a side species as opposed to a single merge event. It \n&#39;feels&#39; more natural but I suppose that depends on the precise way you \ndo it. E.g. if you keep merging while the target species is improving or \nuntil a stagnation threshold (no improvements for N gens) has passed \nthen how much merging you do dynamically adjusts. A &#39;one-event&#39; merge \ncould be made to do this as well though I suppose.\n\nAlso this merging idea makes me think of bacteria exchanging genes that \ncode for certain proteins. For example a strain of staphylococcus can \nbecome resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics by a mutation that causes \nbeta-lactamase production. However this can take some time and a large \npopulation to achieve. Now if after drug resitance has evolved a second \nstrain without resistance co-exists with the first it can aquire \nresistance relatively quickly because -  as I understand it anyway - \nsome bacteria have a tendency to leave bits of DNA/RNA lying around \n(e.g. that codes for beta-lactamase) and other bacteria even of \ndifferent strains can hoover up these chunks of DNA and incorporate them \ninto their own genetic code.\n\nI suppose an analogue in NEAT would be if we had two seperate \nmodular-NEAT populations and they randomly exchanged modules from time \nto time.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
