In the Neat context, this is achieved by partitioning the=\r\n &quot;building block&quot; interior functionality from mutation. I would be very int=\r\nerested in any published prior work, but as it appears that prior availabil=\r\nity of IAMION (Individually Addressable Multi-Input/Output Node) research c=\r\nodes are seemingly sparse, I wonder if anything has progressed past proposa=\r\nl stage. Whether LRC, SVM, network-in-a-node, ensemble population-in-a-node=\r\n, or source code in-a-node, the first step is getting past SION (Single Inp=\r\nut/Output Node).\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman=\r\n &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Andy,\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect this sort of thing=\r\n has been proposed before, which doesn&#39;t mean\n&gt; it shouldn&#39;t be proposed ag=\r\nain or in a different context, but does mean\n&gt; that perhaps there&#39;s some pr=\r\nior research around it.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing which does come to mind is that by s=\r\ntarting with a fixed partial\n&gt; solution you are effectively starting the en=\r\ntire population on some\n&gt; non-optimal peak in the fitness landscape, which =\r\nis the point of your\n&gt; suggestion I think: why start at the bottom when the=\r\nre are typically simple\n&gt; ways of getting &quot;part way&quot; there. However &quot;part w=\r\nay&quot; means starting on some\n&gt; non-optimal peak in a complex fitness landscap=\r\ne; ie EAs don&#39;t follow a\n&gt; linear progression from some low point to some h=\r\nigh point in the fitness\n&gt; landscape (except for the most trivial problems)=\r\n: when attempting to avoid\n&gt; &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; with the LRC you might=\r\n end up inventing the wrong\n&gt; wheel with it. Thus the population may become=\r\n stranded around this peak\n&gt; (depending on mutation rates, etc) and so not =\r\nable to find better/optimal\n&gt; solutions. Of course this is a major potentia=\r\nl problem with any EA, but I\n&gt; do wonder if starting the entire genome on s=\r\nome non-optimal peak would\n&gt; exacerbate the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Points 4 and 5 wo=\r\nuld go some way (perhaps a very significant way) towards\n&gt; mitigating this,=\r\n but I think really you just end up trading off how far up\n&gt; the non-optima=\r\nl peak you start with how likely you are to getting stuck on\n&gt; that peak (w=\r\nhich is perhaps your point, and not a bad thing). So, it would\n&gt; be good to=\r\n see some research to see how useful this sort of thing really is\n&gt; (anyone=\r\n?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; \n&gt;  On 22 November 2011 09:34, afcarl2 &lt;afcarl2=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A suggestion for a generic 1st order &quot;co=\r\nncept&quot;, to be held inviolate\n&gt; &gt; withing the genome (direct or indirect enc=\r\noding):\n&gt; &gt; Linear Regression/Classification (LRC) hypothesis model, based =\r\nupon the\n&gt; &gt; following:\n&gt; &gt; 1) Model selection of included polynomial terms=\r\n based upon minimization of\n&gt; &gt; delta error between training and cross-vali=\r\ndation errors,\n&gt; &gt; 2) LRC embedded within single multi-input/output node of=\r\n start genome,\n&gt; &gt; 3) Start genome configured w/ LRC embedded node with inp=\r\nut weights of 1.0\n&gt; &gt; to each corresponding input of genome,\n&gt; &gt; 4) Start g=\r\nenome configured w/ LRC embedded node with scaled output w/\n&gt; &gt; weights of =\r\n1.0 to each corresponding output of genome,\n&gt; &gt; 5) Start genome configured =\r\nw/ LRC embedded node with scaled outputs for\n&gt; &gt; each polynomial term withi=\r\nn the LRC model, yet not connected,\n&gt; &gt; 6) LRC interior functionality held =\r\ninviolate within genome,\n&gt; &gt; The resulting start genome should have the fol=\r\nlowing characteristics:\n&gt; &gt; a) Start performance equivalent to LRC,\n&gt; &gt; b) =\r\nLRC interior complexity does not contribute to dimensional operator\n&gt; &gt; dis=\r\nruption,\n&gt; &gt; c) All significant LRC interior non-linear terms are available=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt; additional complexification if justifiable,\n&gt; &gt; The rational for t=\r\nhis suggestion as follows:\n&gt; &gt; i.

Computational process for development of=\r\n the LRC is well understood,\n&gt; &gt; iv. There is no good reason to re-invent t=\r\nhe wheel, corresponding to the\n&gt; &gt; cost of evolving rudimentary performance=\r\n equivalent of the LRC in NN\n&gt; &gt; formative elements,\n&gt; &gt; v. LRC interior no=\r\nn-linear terms are available for complexification, and\n&gt; &gt; therefore do not=\r\n require evolutionary development from NN formative\n&gt; &gt; elements,\n&gt; &gt; vi.
