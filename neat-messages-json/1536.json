I guess I&#39;d better introduce myself...\nI have a degree in Physics from Cardiff (UK), did 3 years \nPostgraduate research into the computer simulation of Polymers where \nI started to become interested in Genetic Algorithms applied to the \nprotein folding problem. Since then I been working for a company \nproviding end-to-end online betting systems for the major \nbookmakers, but have continued to be intrested in AI techniques in \nmy spare time. I started to get into using GA&#39;s to evolve neural \nnets after reading Fogel&#39;s Blondie24. My current pet project is \ntrying to use those techniques to evolve a neural net to score stock \ngraphs based on wether it thinks they are a buy, hold or sell. I \nstarted off with a very naieve GA and a fixed arbitrary net \ntopology. I stumbled onto NEAT whilst doing some google searches and \nam now hoping to apply it to my get rich quick scheme :-) Feel free \nto contact me if you would like to discuss anything.\nEmyr\n\n\n"}}
