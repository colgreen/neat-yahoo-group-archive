Right now I have an IGenome interface defined,\n&gt;instances of which can of course be decoded (translated, developed or\n&gt;whatever) into something that implements INetwork (which more generally\n&gt;could be IPhenome I suppose). In the past there have been discussions\n&gt;about the best place for the decoding algorithm, ideally IGenome and\n&gt;IPhenome would be totally abstract and a single abstract decoder\n&gt;algorithm would act as the glue between the two systems. In reality a\n&gt;custom decode algorithm is usually required, at least in the very\n&gt;general case where IGenomes and IPhenomes could be absolutely anything\n&gt;you want them to be.\n&gt;\n&gt;My solution then is to package up IGenome and IPhenome into a higher\n&gt;level interface/class alongside the decoding algorithm. This new package\n&gt;can then (potentially) be plugged into the NEAT engine in a completely\n&gt;abstract manner. My question then is, what is a good name for this\n&gt;interface? ISupernome perhaps? :)\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m doing a bit of web surfing to try and find an appropriate term from\n&gt;biology, but I&#39;ve uncovered nothing so far. If you think about it though\n&gt;in biological terms this would be the system that consists of the\n&gt;genome, the phenome and the cellular machinery that decodes the DNA/RNA\n&gt;and that builds proteins etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
