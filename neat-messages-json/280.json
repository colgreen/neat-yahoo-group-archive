I&#39;m afraid it isn&#39;t commented well, but it was\njust meant as a test to satisfy my own curiosity.\n\n&gt;do you think I could take a look at your\n&gt;source code and maybe extend it to signature\n&gt;recognition?\n\nYou could try: all you&#39;d need to do would be change gridcirc[],\ngriddiamond[] and gridsquare[] to contain your signatures, and modify the\ncoordinate limits for the new image sizes... Of course, in the real world\nyou&#39;d want to load them from bitmaps, which wouldn&#39;t necessarily be hard,\nit&#39;d just need a bit more work.\n\nOf course, the shapes I chose are reasonably simple. I can&#39;t say how well\nNEAT would handle more complex shapes.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
