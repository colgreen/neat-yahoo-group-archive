This kind of structure can accrue over time and\nmake the chromosome sizes very large (which increases the number of\ndimensions in the search space). To make the evolved networks more\nunderstandable/computationally efficient, some systems simplify the output\nof overly complex genetic code at the &quot;end&quot; of evolution. For example, if\nneuron A is connected to neuron B by link 1 and also link 2, then the\nweights of these two links are summed and the connection is simplified to\none link. This &quot;simplifies&quot; the neural network but doesn&#39;t result in a\nloss in functionality.\n\nKen&#39;s hypothesis was that if we could somehow avoid adding this kind of\nredundant structure in the first place, then the GA search takes place\nover a smaller space, and therefore can be more efficient.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
