Maybe, th=\r\nere is some kind of bridge to connect both perspectives and maybe we can co=\r\nme up with some new ideas.\n\n1. Definition of modularity: To my mind it is n=\r\not clear, how a module should be defined. Accoording to Kashtan (http://www=\r\n.pnas.org/content/102/39/13773.abstract), cited by Jeff, modularity is defi=\r\nned as many connections within a module and less connections between module=\r\ns. But one could also use the cytoarchitecture (e.g. brodmann areas, cell t=\r\nypes / wiring in the  hippocampus) as a criteria for measuring the modulari=\r\nty. Obviously, the definition of modules biases the search for them.\n\n2. Em=\r\nergence of modularity: independent from the definition, I don&#39;t see, why ne=\r\ntwork modules should evolve in different ways like other organic structures=\r\n. To my mind, the same principles that lead to the formation of global patt=\r\nerns in the organism contribute also to the formation of specific brain str=\r\nuctures (favoring to my mind the cytoarchitectural perspective). Following =\r\nthis perspective, it seem to me that different spatial locations of sensor =\r\nand motor systems contribute already to the formation of different modules =\r\nemerging at these systems. This raises the question: what could be a good s=\r\ntarting organism to investigate this hypothesis? I found this article very =\r\ninteresting, as it describes a possible transition from decentralized netwo=\r\nrks to a CNS with modules:\n\n&quot;Early Central Nervous System Evolution: An Era=\r\n of Skin Brains?&quot;\nhttp://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v4/n8/abs/nrn1175.html\n=\r\n\n3. Self-organizing mechanisms determine the number of connections:  This r=\r\neview gave me a new perspective on neural networks as it convinced me how i=\r\nmportant structural plasticity is: \n&quot;Using theoretical models to analyse ne=\r\nural development&quot;\nhttp://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v12/n6/abs/nrn3031.html=\r\n\n(e.g. see. Fig. 6)\n\nThe main message: neurons find on their own an equilib=\r\nrium between spiking and resting. If a neuron spikes too less, the number o=\r\nf connections increases, if it spikes too often, connections die. This mean=\r\ns, the number of connections is dynamically selected to make (as a side-eff=\r\nect) each neuron as informative as possible. (Maybe this is the way to use =\r\nthe encoding in order to constrain the number of connections, as suggested =\r\nby Ken?)\n\nClearly influenced by the cited articles, my humble and unproven =\r\nopinion is that modularity emerges as a side-effect of the fact that sensor=\r\ns and motors already represent something like modules and that self-organiz=\r\ning mechanisms and mechanisms to evolve and alter global patterns contribut=\r\ne to the elaboration of these modules.\n\nTo avoid some misunderstandings:  I=\r\n think, using connection cost in a fitness function is absolutely valid and=\r\n provides some useful insights (therefore I found Jeffs article very intere=\r\nsting). My point is just: one has to be aware that the number of connection=\r\ns in a network underlies some factors worth considering. :-)\n\n\n"}}
