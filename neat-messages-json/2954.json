One motivation for\nthis competition is comparing strengths and weaknesses of various CI\ntechniques, such as temporal difference learning, neuroevolution, etc.\nAnother motivation is just having a fun competition that is as easy as\npossible to participate in, but still has some depth to it.\n\nI think NEAT could do very well on this problem, and interfacing it\n(especiall one of the Java versions) to the competition code should be\nquite simple. Is anyone up to the challenge?
