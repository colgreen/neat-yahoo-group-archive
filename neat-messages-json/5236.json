A manuscript version is now=\r\n available at:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/lehman.ecj10.html=\r\n\n\nDirect link: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_ecj10.pdf\n\nThis articl=\r\ne examines the properties of novelty search in significantly more depth and=\r\n in a wider variety of domains than in the past.  In one new set of studies=\r\n, novelty search is tested in the maze task with behavioral characterizatio=\r\nns of varying dimensionality (up to 400-dimensional), and separately with v=\r\narious forms of finite archive sizes.  The main result is that the dimensio=\r\nnality of the behavior characterization is not the instrumental factor in t=\r\nhe success of novelty search and nor is novelty search hampered in general =\r\nby limiting its archive.\n\nThe second major study is in a biped walking task=\r\n.  Many have asked whether novelty search can work in less contrived domain=\r\ns than the now-familiar maze domain of our 2008 conference paper.  To answe=\r\nr this question, this new paper shows novelty search outperforming fitness-=\r\nbased search in this challenging domain.  The result that a simulated biped=\r\n learns to balance and walk without walking set as an objective further hig=\r\nhlights the intriguing implications of the approach.  A video of the best b=\r\nipeds evolved through novelty and fitness is at:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/n=\r\noveltysearch/\n\nWhile you may already be familiar with some of the other exp=\r\neriments in the paper, I believe it is still worth the time to read through=\r\n all of it because it provides significantly broader perspective and discus=\r\nsion than prior work, and we hope it will become the canonical reference on=\r\n the technique going forward.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
