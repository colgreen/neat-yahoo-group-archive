It is really interesting.\n\nI think it is particularly fascinating how well Novelty + Fitness\nMultiobjective competed with pure Novelty search on a problem designed to\nshowcase the benefits of Novelty search.\n\nMy original instincts regarding Novelty search were that it was a great way\nto overcome deception, but that there are huge classes of problems where\npure Novelty search will not work (e.g. take the problem you and the\noriginal novelty search paper used, make it 1000 times larger, and get rid\nof the bottom and left walls up to the first walls that jut in). I had\nthought that a combination of Novelty + Fitness would be able to handle such\nproblems well, which your results strongly imply. Your paper suggests that\nyou will conduct tests on such problems. Have you tried that yet? I look\nforward to seeing the results!\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor &lt;mandor@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 11 Aug 2009 16:12:37 +0200\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] New paper &quot;Novelty-based multiobjectivization&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;         Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just finished a paper for the IROS&#39;09 workshop entitled &quot;Exploring\n&gt; New Horizons in Evolutionary Design of Robots&quot;\n&gt; [http://www.isir.fr/evoderob]. It&#39;s about novelty search and, since we\n&gt; talked a lot about it on this mailing-list, it could interest some of\n&gt; you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the paper:\n&gt; http://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/papers/novelty_based_multiobjectivization.\n&gt; pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt;   Novelty search is a recent and promising approach to evolve\n&gt;   neuro-controllers, especially to drive robots. The main idea is to\n&gt;   maximize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency.\n&gt;   However, abandoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical\n&gt;   in many contexts. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective\n&gt;   evolutionary algorithm is employed to reconcile novelty search with\n&gt;   objective-based optimization by following a multiobjectivization\n&gt;   process. Several multiobjectivizations based on behavioral novelty\n&gt;   and on behavioral diversity are compared on a maze navigation\n&gt;   task. Results show that the multiobjectivizations is better at\n&gt;   fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty search while keeping a\n&gt;   comparable number of iterations to converge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt; 3 ((4&({*.(=+/))++/=3:)@([:,/0&,^:(i.3)@|:&quot;2^:2))&.&gt;@]^:(i.@[) &lt;#:3 6 2\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
