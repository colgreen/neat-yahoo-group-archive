I have to admit that I&#39;ve never fully convinced \nmyself that a population&#39;s complexity (within NEAT)  wouldn&#39;t spiral out \nof control without, say, some kind of punishment for complex (long) \ngenomes. Bad additions will result in a lower fitness and will therefore \ncause those particular genomes to be selected against. But what about \nneutral additions? connections that are neither good nor bad - what is \npreventing these connections from accumulating and clogging up the whole \nsimulation?\n\nThis is one of the reasons I&#39;m eager to get into the guts of NEAT and \nreally understand what is going on. I can imagine that in short runs \nthat connection accumulation would not be a problem, but in long runs \nwhere evolution stagnates... ? Off the top of my head I can&#39;t see any \nreason why deletion of connections shouldn&#39;t be included as a possible \nmutation - I will certainly be trying this out.\n\nRegarding the correlation between complexity and fitness. I agree that \ngenerally I wouldn&#39;t assume the two to be linked, but since  the only \nway of improving  is via mutation, and the only mutation is &#39;add a \nconnection/node&#39; then good genomes can reasonably be assumed to have \nmore connections and nodes.  Although I have convieniently overlooked \nsexual reproduction (which can improve without increasing genome length) \nand mutation of connection weights! So we&#39;re back to square one.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
