Given the conversion will cost you development time, what advantages are you gaining in Java, or disadvantages in moving away from .NET/C#?\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, I ask this as I have been attempting to evaluate performance between these two platforms. To what degree, if at all, is your move performance motivated?\n\n\nActually performance isn&#39;t really a major factor in my thinking. The\nJava and .Net compilers and runtime environments are all well thought\nout and fast environments in my opinion. OK so you&#39;ve got different\nJava VM&#39;s from different vendors for different scenarios, but they&#39;re\nall good including the standard (free) ones. And in the .Net world you\nhave Mono which was quite slow when I last tried it last (12 months\nago ish). But generally if you see significant performance differences\nit&#39;s most likely the code you&#39;re using, not the environment. As I say\nthe generics support in .Net is more performant, so that does tilt the\nperformance argument slightly in favour of .Net\n\nFor me the main argument for Java is the Eclipse IDE. It&#39;s far easier\nto navigate through code using views such as the type and call\nhierarchy, highlighting of variables, errors, warnings, TODO comments,\netc. on the right hand margin. The CVS/SVN support is really nice to\nuse - Visual Studio&#39;s equivalents are either very poor by comparison\n(SourceSafe) or very expensive (TeamSuite). Ultimately the Java coding\nexperience is nicer and makes more efficient use of programmer time\nIMO - a big plus in my book.\n\nSo although I prefer the .Net framework, the IDE&#39;s let the side down.\nAdd to that the fact that Java is more open source friendly and that\ncould sway the argument for me. Yes you can get a free version of VS,\nbut (a) it&#39;s not as good as Eclipse (also free) and (b) it has some\nfeatures disabled - 64bit support and multithreaded debugging are two\nI bumped into recently.\n\nDevelopment time is an issue. Not so much porting the core algorithm\nstuff as I&#39;m intending to refactor all of that anyway, but all the\ngraphical stuff and GUI interfaces could be a serious headache.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
