I just wanted to make sure we \ndon&#39;t stop thinking about the interesting practical issues.  The \ntheoretical side deserves its airing as well, and tells us something \nabout possibility.  I am strongly in agreement with you that we do \nnot want to &quot;inadvertantly close the best doors.&quot;\n\nOf course, theoretical arguments can cause doors to close \nprematurely as well.  Minsky&#39;s famous &quot;Perceptrons&quot; book, which \nshowed through theoretical analysis that a perceptron is limited in \nwhat it can compute, shut down the entire field of neural network \nresearch for decades.  \n\nUltimately neither practical hurdles nor theoretical limitations are \nthe final word on what is impossible in practice.  Just because you \ncouldn&#39;t get your method to solve the problem, or just because a \nproof showed that a certain type of structure cannot do it, does not \nmean something else won&#39;t come along that defies expectation.  Hence \nmy advice to keep an open mind.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;jeff@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At the risk of offending the gods, I&#39;m going to humbly add 2 cents.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I fully agree with everything you&#39;ve said here, I think \nthere is an\n&gt; important fundamental truth to all this.  And, it is simply that \nwhich I was\n&gt; trying and failed to convey.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the fact that it is possible to build a network capable of \nlearning\n&gt; (no further classical training required!) is, in a manner of \nspeaking, the\n&gt; whole kit and kaboodle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately, isn&#39;t it the creation of a true learning machine that \nwe strive to\n&gt; accomplish?  I am not in any way purporting to know the best path \nto this\n&gt; machine and as to the specifics (such as representation of memory) \nI have yet\n&gt; less insight.\n&gt; \n&gt; That being said, I think any confusion as to what is ultimately \npossible, and\n&gt; what is not, can inadvertantly close the best doors.  At the very \nleast, I do\n&gt; not believe it is an insignificant conclusion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 06 Sep 2005 21:54:07 -0000, Kenneth Stanley wrote\n&gt; &gt; John (caloyannis) is right when he says the &quot;trick is to find \nit!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s important to keep in mind in discussions such as \nthis \n&gt; &gt; one that theoretical facts are usually of little practical \n&gt; &gt; consequence.  That recurrent networks can represent any Turing \n&gt; &gt; machine is about as practically useful as knowing that you can \n&gt; &gt; theoretically build a fully-functioning computer out of water \npipes \n&gt; &gt; and water.  The real question with respect to recurrent NN&#39;s is \n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s reasonably easy to find and represent, not what&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; theoretically possible.  Also note that what&#39;s easy to find is \nnot \n&gt; &gt; always so much a property of the neural network alone as a \nproperty \n&gt; &gt; of the search process used to generate it combined with the type \nof \n&gt; &gt; neural network.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case, my point is that it certainly merits long and deep \n&gt; &gt; discussion what can or cannot be done with a recurrent network, \n&gt; &gt; regardless of what is possible in theory, even if all things are \n&gt; &gt; possible in theory.  We are generally interested in practice, \nwhich \n&gt; &gt; is much more complicated, which is also why it&#39;s fun: There is a \nlot \n&gt; &gt; of room for creativity and in fact standard recurrent structures \nmay \n&gt; &gt; indeed be more difficult to discover than other memory-based \n&gt; &gt; realizations such as Hebbian networks.  For this reason, we \nshould \n&gt; &gt; keep an open mind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;johncaloyannis&quot; \n&lt;johncaloyannis@y...&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello everybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I started dabbling in AI abouit twenty years ago on and off. \nFor a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while  I thought that genetic programming could be an avenue \nto \n&gt; &gt; follow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Koza). However lately I came across the NEAT concept which I \nfound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascinating since it combines the best of both worlds (neural \n&gt; &gt; networks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; + evolution).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have followed the discussions you guys have with interest. I \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that since the recurrent neural networks are intractable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematically, apart from some very special cases (hopfield), \none \n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only speculate and experiment to learn things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the discussion about the recurrency question and \nwhat a \n&gt; &gt; RNN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can or can not do there is a very interesting paper which \nproves \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a turing machine for every RNN and vice-versa. Since \n&gt; &gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that is computable can be achieved with a turing machine so \ncan it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through an RNN. The trick is to find it :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.uwasa.fi/stes/step96/step96/hyotyniemi1\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
