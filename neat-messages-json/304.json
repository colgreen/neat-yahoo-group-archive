Have \n&gt; you thought of having the line thickness\n&gt; proportional to the weight \n&gt; magnitude of connections (if svg allows that)?\n\nSure SVG would allow that.  It&#39;s just another\ngraphical format, a vector-based one.\n\nThis is the way JNEAT displays networks, right?\n\nThis leads me to another question: To what extent do\nyou use graphical information to analyze results?  The\nuse of graphing fitness throughout a run is obvious. \nGraphing the quantities of given numbers of\nindividuals in species can be useful as well. \n\nBut how often, and how do you use the graphical\nrepresentation of the networks?  This is an open\nquestion to the group.  Also, Ken, I&#39;ve noticed in\nsome of your papers you&#39;ve analyzed the functioning of\nthe resultant network.  Was graphical output of the\ntopologies useful for this?  Otherwise, how did you go\nabout it?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
