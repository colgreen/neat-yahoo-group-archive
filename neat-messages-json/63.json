Unless there \nwas some other means to distinguish the prey from the predators you \nwould just be rewarding &#39;random&#39; behaviour. As any time a predator \nis successful in capturing the prey it would have to be a fluke. For \na predator to chase (or bump into) a prey and not another predator.\nThey just can&#39;t tell the difference! :P\n\nCan you elaborate more on your flocking experiments? It sounds \ninteresting. How you rewarded flocking behaviour etc?\n\ncheers,\nJono\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;umeriqbal81&quot; &lt;umeriqbal81@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello All !\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m Umer, from Pakistan. I completed my BS in Computer Systems \n&gt; Engineering from GIK Institute, Pakistan this May. During my last \ntwo \n&gt; semesters, I worked on &quot;Developing Collective Intelligent \nBehavior&quot; \n&gt; as my Senior Design Project. The technique we (me and 3 other \nguyz) \n&gt; used, was NEAT. We worked in Visual C++, with OpenGL for our \n&gt; Simulation displays. \n&gt; \n&gt; We made environments with obstacles and lights and many robots \n(going \n&gt; from 2 to hundreds). The robots had simple IR transmitters and \n&gt; receivers, bump sensors, light detectors. \n&gt; \n&gt; We tried to evolve simple behaviors like, gathering, flocking, \n&gt; following the leader, finding light, predator-prey. In gathering, \n&gt; flocking, and finding light all the robots had the same neural \nnets \n&gt; to make decisions (Inputs from IR sensors, light, bump senors.. \n&gt; outputs to motors, and IR transmitter). Whereas, in the case of \n&gt; following the leader and predator-prey, we had two classes of \nneural \n&gt; nets. \n&gt; \n&gt; As you might have guessed, working with hundreds of robots for \nmany \n&gt; generations is computationally very expensive. So, we made a \n&gt; distributed version of NEAT. The simulations were carried out on \n&gt; different client machines (mostly pIIs and pIIIs in our AI Lab), \n&gt; while there was one master server that carried out &quot;epoch&quot;s of \nNEAT \n&gt; and gave new chromosomes to every new coming client. \n&gt; \n&gt; Some of the results we came up with were very interesting. \nEspecially \n&gt; in flocking, we could see robots behave like birds. they formed \nsmall \n&gt; groups, sometimes even spirals (with slower robots on the inner \nside \n&gt; of the spiral and faster ones towards the outer edges). We evolved \n&gt; some neural nets with 3-4 robots, and tried the same net for 50-60 \n&gt; robots and found that the neural nets didn&#39;t work all that bad for \n&gt; greater number of robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the &quot;finding light&quot; behavior, the robots usually tended to \nfollow \n&gt; the walls of the room in which they were kept to come to the light \n&gt; (which was normally placed at a corner). But when we placed the \n&gt; lights somewhere in the middle of the room, then due to the \nphysical \n&gt; limitations of the robot, it could not find out where the lights \n&gt; were. But once it got in the range of the light, it managed to sit \n&gt; under it. \n&gt; \n&gt; The results of following the leader and predator-prey were not \n&gt; satisfactory. The predators tended to catch each other, the \nfollowers \n&gt; tended to get stuck with each other. But, I think that was due to \nthe \n&gt; limitations of the robots. Since, they could not distinguish \nbetween \n&gt; predator, prey etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will write more about my work later. \n&gt; \n&gt; Although, now I dont get anytime to work on NEAT. Since, I&#39;m \nworking \n&gt; with a software house these days, and am preparing for my GRE. I \nhope \n&gt; to get into a Phd program where I can continue my work with NEAT. \n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone of you is interested in my work, feel free to ask :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I will probably be just a reader of this group unless I get time \nto \n&gt; restart my work. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; - Umer\n\n\n"}}
