I th=\r\nink it will be very interesting for \npeople to see how this community has s=\r\nupported its software and each \nother through this decentralized approach. =\r\n \n\nIn that spirit I plan to highlight all the existing public releases to \n=\r\ngive people a sense of the breadth of what&#39;s available.  \n\nTherefore, if yo=\r\nu have a public NEAT version (or spinoff project such \nas genetic art) that=\r\n you believe I don&#39;t know about and would like \nmentioned, please feel free=\r\n to let me know and I will mention your \nwork as well.  \n\nPlease note that =\r\nprivate projects can&#39;t be included because after all \nthe workshop is about=\r\n &quot;open source&quot; software.\n\nI&#39;m looking forward to letting people know about =\r\nall the great work a \nlot of you have done!\n\nthanks,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
