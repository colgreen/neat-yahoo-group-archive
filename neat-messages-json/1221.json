That&#39;s really interesting.\n\nBut MURDER on my server! :)\n\n&gt;It would be really cool\n&gt;also if you could also view the current champ topology and what it\n&gt;does.  (as of you haven&#39;t already done enough!)\n\nIt&#39;s planned.  But here&#39;s why I&#39;m in no hurry:\n\nThe fitness range is 0 to 144.  1 represents ability to do a 1/9th \nreduction.  144 represents ability to do a 16x enlargement.  It&#39;s based on \nhow big of a pixel area the output is.  I could explain it in detail if you \ncared, but the bottom line is, it&#39;s got to reach a fitness of 137 before it \nis actually performing 2x enlargement.  Its current fitness of around 60 \nmeans it can (accurately) reduce to a little less than 0.2x.  It&#39;s got a \nLONG way to go before it is of any interest to me.  But on the bright side, \nit&#39;s getting there.  And faster than I was afraid it would, which is good.\n\nUnless I get bored and do it before then, I&#39;ll implement those features once \nit reaches a fitness of around 125.\n\n\n\n"}}
