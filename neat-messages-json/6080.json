Think about a typical\nentropic force such as diffusion of a gas in a tube (see the diagram\non the wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropic_force) - so we\nhave a barrier in the tube with some gas to the left of it and a\nvacuum to the right. We remove the barrier and the gas as a whole\nmoves from left to right as if there is a force pulling it (or\npushing), but in reality each particle is exhibiting brownian motion\n(random motion), but the random movements to the left or more likely\nto hit another particle and retard progress in that direction, so the\noverall effect of this is that the gas as a whole moves to the right.\n\nAnother representation of this idea is in figure 1(b) of the paper:\n\n    http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf\n\nIn the EC world we could see this as being akin to applying very light\nselection pressure applied by removing some of the offspring genomes\nthat have higher entropy, e.g. where the inverted pendulum falls. So\nwe aren&#39;t directly measuring number of possible future paths for each\ngenome (as this would be expensive), but nudging the population away\nfrom genomes we know have less future paths. The end (&#39;macroscopic&#39;)\nresult is maximising future paths in the population as a whole.\n\nSo in an EC context my takeaway point here is that instead of\nselecting a few &#39;of the fittest genomes to seed the next generation,\nwe (A) eliminate a small proportion of poor genomes and (B) measure\nfitness as avoidance of known high entropy states (collapsed pendulum,\nfallen walker, stuck in &#39;dumb&#39; part of the maze, etc). Or in other\nwords, we apply light pressure away from dumb regions of the fitness\nspace rather than strong pressure towards godo regions - which we know\ntends to lead to local optima that are globally poor.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
