Can I take you up on your offer to release the source=\r\n code for the demos? I&#39;m interested in co-evolutionary approaches with an a=\r\ngent and an antagonistic environment, so your demos would be very interesti=\r\nng to me.\n\nRegards\n\nIain \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; =\r\n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy that you like my=\r\n demo. This particular experiment was set \n&gt; up to answer some questions I =\r\nhad in mind. The first one is obvious, \n&gt; is there a geometric regularity i=\r\nn the predator/prey task that \n&gt; HyperNEAT can possibly exploit. And there =\r\nis. I can see some \n&gt; meaningful behaviors emerging with HyperNEAT as early=\r\n as the 4th or \n&gt; 5th generation. My next question was, what is the differe=\r\nnce between \n&gt; the indirect encoding and the direct encoding. Let me make i=\r\nt more \n&gt; clear. In your experiments in the robot duel domain, both robot N=\r\nNs \n&gt; are encoded directly and complexifying. They elaborate on previous \n&gt;=\r\n strategies by incrementally adding more structure, right? \n&gt; What about Hy=\r\nperNEAT, does it preserve the same dynamics, where the \n&gt; CPPNs complexify =\r\nbut the substrate is fixed? Does it lead to endless \n&gt; alteration of strate=\r\ngies instead of elaboration? I can predict that \n&gt; HyperNEAT can discover s=\r\nome complex connectivity patterns between \n&gt; hidden nodes to develop some k=\r\nind of &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior, but is \n&gt; that limited? \n&gt; Well this questio=\r\nn is still not answered because, as you mentioned, \n&gt; the predator/prey tas=\r\nk is too easy to learn, though there is room for \n&gt; the predator and prey t=\r\no learn tricks to fool each other. For example \n&gt; the prey can learn to hid=\r\ne behind walls, etc. \n&gt; Yes I compared it to direct encoding NEAT and gener=\r\nally I can conclude \n&gt; that HyperNEAT develops strategies faster. Especiall=\r\ny in the case of \n&gt; many many inputs. Scaling works as well, but it is not =\r\nperfect. \n&gt; Let me tell you about the source code. Unfortunately the core N=\r\nEAT \n&gt; library I wrote and use is locked under an NDA but it is equivalent =\r\nto \n&gt; the rtNEAT modification I released with the NEVH project. The \n&gt; visu=\r\nalization routines are basically the same there, there is nothing \n&gt; new at=\r\n all. But I can release the source code for the demos \n&gt; themselves. Please=\r\n ask me about any details, I will be happy to help \n&gt; anyone. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Peter, thanks for this HyperNEAT coevolution demo.  I see some\n&gt; &gt; inter=\r\nesting behaviors evolving, but I am curious about your own\n&gt; &gt; conclusions?=\r\n  What did you learn from this experiment?  Did you try\n&gt; &gt; comparing it to=\r\n regular NEAT in the same domain?  I am not sure\n&gt; &gt; whether the difference=\r\n would be great since I am not sure if this \n&gt; task\n&gt; &gt; is sufficiently com=\r\nplex to exhibit a significant difference between\n&gt; &gt; the methods.  That is,=\r\n there is probably only so good that you can \n&gt; get\n&gt; &gt; before new skills s=\r\ntop really mattering in this domain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, do you plan relea=\r\nsing source code for your various\n&gt; &gt; experiments and AI code?  It seems li=\r\nke you have a nice system set \n&gt; up\n&gt; &gt; and other people might like tinkeri=\r\nng with it.
