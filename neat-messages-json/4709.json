In the multiplayer mode, the evolution of CPPN-con=\r\ntrolled weapons in the game is influenced by all the players online, making=\r\n it (as far as I know) the first example of real online content evolution i=\r\nn a multiplayer game.  The algorithm is called cgNEAT, for content-generati=\r\nng NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both game client and online server (for hosting your own =\r\ngalaxy) are available.  We are also hosting an official GAR server with hig=\r\nh capacity because of our fast connection at UCF.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This project was=\r\n very complex, in effect involving the implementation of not just a game, b=\r\nut an online service and a novel evolutionary algorithm, so there could be =\r\na few unanticipated hiccups in the first release, but I think you will find=\r\n it entertaining and interesting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
