I have been\n&gt; &gt; planning to start with a sharp threshold function\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; the activation function, rather than a sigmoidal\n&gt; &gt; function.  My reasoning is that, since the inputs\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; final outputs are binary, why not use binary\n&gt; &gt; neurons? \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, an interesting opportunity for experiment. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s obviously no need for your input and output\n&gt; layer to be anything but binary, but I&#39;m not sure that\n&gt; you want all your hidden units to be binary as well.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m also not sure you&#39;d want your hidden units to be binary.\nMaking them binary just means that for certain functions,\nwhich we don&#39;t know whether or not will be needed,\nit would take more hidden nodes to represent.  That is,\nthe simpler the activation function the more nodes it takes\nto represent a complex function.  But in the end it depends\nwhat the actual function is that you need to to represent,\nwhich we don&#39;t know.  So it&#39;s worth experimenting.\n\n&gt; &gt; The weight & thresholds will be the only floating\n&gt; &gt; point numbers in the ANN.  Everything else will be\n&gt; &gt; 0&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; and 1&#39;s, and integers to boot.  I think this will\n&gt; &gt; allow me to code a faster calculating ANN, which in\n&gt; &gt; turn speeds up the number of generations per hour.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t think efficiency would be an overriding\n&gt; concern, at least until you scale the domain up to\n&gt; large numbers of cards.  I think the most interesting\n&gt; aspect of experimenting in this domain is seeing how\n&gt; the topology of the net evolves to handle memory, not\n&gt; really the computational efficiency of the solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; And you shouldn&#39;t have a problem doing fairly large\n&gt; runs in short periods of times, no matter which\n&gt; activation function you use on your hidden nodes, as\n&gt; long as the population size isn&#39;t huge and you keep\n&gt; your domain fairly scaled down.\n&gt; \n\nGoing along with what Derek said here, the real concern is \nnot the efficiency of the solution but rather how easy it is \nto find it in the entire space of possible networks.  \nAnd that we really don&#39;t know.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
