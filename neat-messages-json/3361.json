Besides, I used FS-NEAT and only \n4 outputs for the legs. Very sim=\r\nple. :)\nWith this approach, NEAT was able to find NNs that have just about =\r\n5-\n6 connections, oscillating the 4 outputs and moving the legs. It was \nwa=\r\nlking (running forward in fact) and I was very very happy :) \nMy problems s=\r\ntarted when I added the head, the arms and the feet. \nFrom 4 outputs they b=\r\necame 15. This enlarged the search space a lot, \nand the FS-NEAT approach u=\r\nsually connected.. like your left feet \nconnected to your neck and I want y=\r\nou to walk - it doesn&#39;t work :) \nUsing a fully connected CTRNN is like a fi=\r\nxed-genome evolution so I \ndropped that as well. \nI decided to use HyperNEA=\r\nT and give it a substrate that is close to \nthe human&#39;s actual geometry in =\r\nspace. Left is left, right is right, \nup and down... \nThe inputs are locate=\r\nd in the center and are a 3D vector, \nrepresenting the head&#39;s current veloc=\r\nity. It&#39;s like the.. organ found \nin the middle ear (can&#39;t recall how to ex=\r\npress that in english :)) \nThe hidden neurons are organised in a circle aro=\r\nund these inputs. \nThe outputs have green color and: the topmost is the nec=\r\nk&#39;s joint \ndesired angle. The arms are located below it in the left and rig=\r\nht \nsides of the substrate. Each arm has 3 outputs. The legs are \norganised=\r\n in a similar manner, and each leg has 4 outputs. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; I beli=\r\neve the challenge in this domain is indeed the fitness \nfunction \n&gt; as oppo=\r\nsed to the learning method.  The problem is that it is very \n&gt; difficult to=\r\n describe exactly what should be rewarded early on.  \n&gt; Rewarding # of step=\r\ns tends to encourage a single flailing step yet \n&gt; misses better oscillator=\r\ny behavior.  Even if an individual does \nlearn \n&gt; a leg-based oscillation, =\r\nit will likely fall and therefore never be \n&gt; noticed.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Tyler Stre=\r\neter was working on this problem in his Verve \nproject \n&gt; (http://www.vrac.=\r\niastate.edu/~streeter/verve/gallery.html), which \n&gt; used NEAT with leaky-in=\r\ntegrator neurons, I discussed this problem \n&gt; with him often.  I believe he=\r\n ended up finding a clever way to \nreward \n&gt; oscillatory behavior.  That is=\r\n the most important thing, since it&#39;s \n&gt; really the key to walking: it&#39;s ne=\r\ncessary for the circuit to \nproduce \n&gt; an oscillating pattern.  I may be re=\r\nmembering wrong, but I think he \n&gt; may have started getting it to work by h=\r\nanging the biped from an \n&gt; invisible &quot;string&quot; from the ceiling, so that it=\r\n could not fall, and \n&gt; simply training it to oscillate its legs.  Have you=\r\n tried \ndiscussing \n&gt; it with Tyler?\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, can you please remind=\r\n me what the inputs and outputs \nare \n&gt; on your substrate?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fitness function used in the binary is Avera=\r\nge_Head_Height * \n&gt; &gt; Number_of_FootSteps_Taken. The second multiplier rewa=\r\nrds \n&gt; individuals \n&gt; &gt; that tend to walk around instead of staying still. =\r\nI know it is \n&gt; maybe \n&gt; &gt; wrong to assign 0.000 fitness, but I usually hop=\r\ne that in early \n&gt; &gt; generations at least some individuals will get a score=\r\n above \nzero, \n&gt; &gt; and therefore survive. Is this a right thing to do or I =\r\nshould \n&gt; &gt; translate all fitnesses above 0.000 ? Like Total_Fitness +=3D \n=\r\n1.0; ? \n&gt; &gt; The Number_of_FootSteps_Taken is actually an integer and it mak=\r\nes \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; fitness landscape look like stairs... This is not good, but =\r\nI \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; think of another way to encourage walking around.. Rewarding =\r\n\ncyclic \n&gt; &gt; activity in the output neurons didn&#39;t help me much.. It is the=\r\n \nsame \n&gt; &gt; thing. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am experimenting with a lot of fitness funct=\r\nions every day. The \n&gt; &gt; best individual I got for the balancing task was a=\r\nctually the \nsame \n&gt; as \n&gt; &gt; the one found using regular NEAT - just standi=\r\nng. A way to \nprevent \n&gt; &gt; this is may be to choose random initial position=\r\ns for the model.. \n&gt; Or \n&gt; &gt; the ground plane can be made moving randomly..=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, it seems that the fitness function is wrong, since this \nway =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of achieving the goal is too easy for the evolution to find.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI am currently trying out how good are they to walk. I replaced \nthe \n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nverage_Head_Height with Total_Distance_Travelled in the fitness \n&gt; &gt; functi=\r\non. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe that HyperNEAT is able to handle such complex dynam=\r\nic \n&gt; &gt; control tasks, given the right substrate geometry. Results so far \n=\r\n&gt; do \n&gt; &gt; not show a big progress. But there are a lot of parameters to \ntw=\r\neak \n&gt; &gt; and play with.
