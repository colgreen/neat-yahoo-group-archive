In fact, Darren Izzard has\ndone this, and his explanation is posted in the NEAT FAQ under the\nquestion, &quot;How do I compile your Linux version of NEAT in such and\nsuch operating system?&quot;  The FAQs are on the NEAT Users page: \n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n\nAlso, I expanded the introduction on the Users Page to give more\ninformation on how to choose the best implementation of NEAT for your\npurposes.\n\nI think one thing that NEAT could really use is a nice experimental\ncontrol interface.  Ugo&#39;s JNEAT is currently the only version that has\nsomething like this, where you can change parameters and run\nexperiments and so forth from the same GUI.  Mattias Fagerlund has\nsome great visualization routines in his Delphi NEAT experiments, as\ndoes Mat Buckland in Windows NEAT.  My own version of NEAT can create\nspecies visualizations, but experimental control comes from parameter\nfiles and through GUILE commands.  I can imagine some master GUI \ninterface that kind of combines the ideas from all these variants that\nwould be extremely useful for running experiments.\nIt would be cool to hear about anything like this that people have\nworked on or thought about.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Chris Christenson &lt;cc57@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I plan to use the Windows C++ version.\n&gt; \n&gt; C++ because that is the language I am best at, and since I plan to alter\n&gt; the code a little that seemed the best plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Windows because I like XP.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Chris C\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Derek James [mailto:blue5432@y...] \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 03, 2003 1:01 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Implementations and Languages\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Chris mentioned that he&#39;s working with NEAT for his\n&gt; Master&#39;s thesis...which implementation do you plan to\n&gt; use?  Or do you plan to write your own?\n&gt; \n&gt; There are now multiple implementations of NEAT\n&gt; available in different languages, and as I mentioned\n&gt; in my introduction, Philip and I are nearly finished\n&gt; with a Java implementation, which we plan to\n&gt; open-source.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those of you who have implemented your own version of\n&gt; NEAT...why did you choose the particular language or\n&gt; platform that you did?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n\n\n\n"}}
