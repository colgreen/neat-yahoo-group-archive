But they were mostly \n  very uninteresting exper=\r\niments, such as classification.  I think the \n  most interesting neuroevolu=\r\ntion outside of NEAT is coming from \n  Floreano and his group, who do evolu=\r\ntionary robotics using \n  neuroevolution.  Our own group from UT also had s=\r\neveral \n  presentations, including one by Faustino Gomez on transferring \n =\r\n neuroevolved controllers to the real world.\n\n  It&#39;s true that half of GECC=\r\nO is Genetic Programming.  That&#39;s \n  becausee GECCO is a combination of the=\r\n old GA and GP conferences, \n  which used to be separate.  GP is kind of st=\r\nrange in that it&#39;s just \n  one method yet it is treated like a whole area. =\r\n This distinction \n  between GA and GP may be fading though over the long t=\r\nerm as \n  indirect encoding becomes more prominent.\n\n  In fact, attention t=\r\no indirect encoding was the big thing I noticed \n  changing at this confere=\r\nnce.  For the first time since I started \n  attending 4 years ago, it got a=\r\n lot of attention and communities are \n  starting to form.  People seem to =\r\nhave suddenly taken notice that \n  it&#39;s going to be a big deal.\n\n  Coevolut=\r\nion is also getting a lot of attention, but mostly at a more \n  theoretical=\r\n level than practical.  Still, there was interesting work \n  on cooperative=\r\n and competitive coevolution, which are definitely \n  both relevant to neur=\r\noevolution, and most of the leaders in this \n  area go to GECCO.\n\n  ken\n\n\n\n=\r\n  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n  &gt; On Tue,=\r\n 06 Jul 2004 21:04:55 +0100, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; \n  wrote:\n  &gt; &gt; Did =\r\nyou discover any new NEAT or NEAT like research going on or \n  any\n  &gt; &gt; in=\r\nteresting commercial connections?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Not really.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I attended =\r\na &quot;Genetic Algorithms in Industry&quot; tutorial, which \n  actually\n  &gt; turned o=\r\nut to be two guys from Dow Chemical, so it was \n  really &quot;Genetic\n  &gt; Algor=\r\nithms in the Chemical Industry&quot;.
