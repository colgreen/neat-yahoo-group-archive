The idea that a kind of organized set of data that come=\r\ns from outside is useful for another purpose is interesting.  Or it could j=\r\nust be that the adaptive properties of the brain make it resilient to a ran=\r\nge of starting conditions, which means that mutations that activate arbitra=\r\nry bits of &quot;junk&quot; DNA during early organization have no harmful effect, so =\r\nthey just tend to accumulate because they don&#39;t matter.

But one thing I find a little confusing is the=\r\n idea that there is a special\n&gt; &gt; kind of random distribution that is bette=\r\nr than other random distributions. If that is true,\n&gt; &gt; then doesn&#39;t it req=\r\nuire some information to encode what that distribution is? And if it\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nes need to be chosen from some special distributions, and those distributio=\r\nns are\n&gt; &gt; captured by Junk DNA, which ends up being expressed, then why is=\r\n it called &quot;Junk\n&gt; &gt; DNA?&quot; Couldn&#39;t we essentially tell the same story in a=\r\n simpler way by saying, &quot;a\n&gt; &gt; subset of DNA encodes the initial weight dis=\r\ntribution in the brain?&quot; What then makes it\n&gt; &gt; junk? And why use the word =\r\nrandom either?\n&gt; \n&gt; Junk DNA is a horrible term with multiple connotations,=\r\n so perhaps\n&gt; some clarification would help here (drawing from what I know)=\r\n.\n&gt; Originally DNA was considered to code for proteins and nothing else,\n&gt; =\r\nso all the DNA that didn&#39;t code for proteins (which is quite a lot I\n&gt; beli=\r\neve) was thought to be junk that was just &#39;in it for the ride&#39; so\n&gt; to spea=\r\nk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later on it turned out that some of this junk DNA had regulatory ro=\r\nles\n&gt; - e.g. controlling the expression of protein coding genes. Think of\n&gt;=\r\n the distinction between program data and program instructions in\n&gt; compute=\r\nrs - that&#39;s probably a crude generalisation but that&#39;s the\n&gt; general princi=\r\nple. (If anyone wants to step in and correct me here I&#39;d\n&gt; be more than hap=\r\npy).\n&gt; \n&gt; This stilll left a load of other DNA which came about through\n&gt; a=\r\nccumulated replication errors and chunks of ancient viruses that\n&gt; perhaps =\r\ninfected our ancestors in the recent past (up to 100&#39;s of\n&gt; thousands of ye=\r\nars ago) or much further back when we were still worms\n&gt; crawling around in=\r\n mud :)  The point is that it&#39;s DNA that has no\n&gt; functional use, it doesn&#39;=\r\nt normally get expressed in any way. This to\n&gt; me is closest to being true =\r\njunk DNA and it&#39;s possible that it just\n&gt; got replicated and not used throu=\r\ngh much of our evolutionary\n&gt; history... then we started to evolve big brai=\r\nns and (the theory goes)\n&gt; some parts of this junk start to get used as a s=\r\nource of arbitrary\n&gt; complexity for brain physiology.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the theory is=\r\n true then some of that junk DNA came to be used and\n&gt; is therefore no long=\r\ner junk (albeit interpreted in a novel new way\n&gt; distinct from it&#39;s origina=\r\nl context and purpose). Essentially it&#39;s not\n&gt; part of the &#39;main-sequence&#39; =\r\nDNA that was functional for our entire\n&gt; evolutionary history - the DNA tha=\r\nt optimised and accumulated slowly\n&gt; and incrementaly.\n&gt; \n&gt; ----\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeh t=\r\nhe word random is not really appropriate either - I think\n&gt; &#39;arbitrary comp=\r\nlexity&#39; is a more accurate term, but perhaps others\n&gt; disagree or have a be=\r\ntter description? Also as a side note I want to\n&gt; point out that distributi=\r\non curves are not complete descriptors of\n&gt; types of randomness - I&#39;m not s=\r\nure to what degree I&#39;m stating the\n&gt; obvious to folks on here, but just to =\r\nbe clear - there are other\n&gt; factors at play, e.g. you can have two RNGs wi=\r\nth the same distribution\n&gt; curve but very different properties, so taking g=\r\naussian curves, an RNG\n&gt; might emit extreme values all clumped together and=\r\n then mid values all\n&gt; clumped together so that it&#39;s only seen to be gaussi=\r\nan when a very\n&gt; large number of samples are observed, but it is gaussian a=\r\nnd very\n&gt; distinct from a typical gaussian process/sequence.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a=\r\nny case, it still does bring up whether a special activation function inspi=\r\nred by this\n&gt; &gt; idea might be helpful in establishing some aspect of initia=\r\nl connectivity. I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; &gt; that if that is true, then the advantage w=\r\nould probably show up more in plastic networks\n&gt; &gt; than static ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ngreed. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily black and white but it would\n&gt; seem t=\r\no be less applicable to fixed weight networks than plasticity\n&gt; nets that a=\r\nre using this arbitrary connectivity as a starting point\n&gt; instead of somet=\r\nhing that needs to be immediately functional.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
