If your add connection\n&gt; &gt; mutation rate is 0.02 and you&#39;ve got 100 individuals, and there are\n&gt; &gt; 100,000 possible places for a new connection to be added, there \n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; be a total of 2,000 new connections added.  Are you saying that \n&gt; only\n&gt; &gt; 100 should be added, one for each individual?  And that if an\n&gt; &gt; individual has already had a connection added, then no add node\n&gt; &gt; mutations are allowed to act upon it (or vice versa if your add \n&gt; node\n&gt; &gt; mutation operators are carried out first)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is not my understanding of how NEAT works.  Ken?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ah, we may have hit on a reason for some of our disagreements!  The \n&gt; add_connection mutation rate is the probability that an *individual \n&gt; genome* might have a single connection added.  In other words, in a \n&gt; population of 100 individuals and a 0.02 rate, you would expect to \n&gt; get on average 2 new connections over the entire population in a \n&gt; single generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition, it is also true that only one add connection mutation \n&gt; can happen to a single individual in a generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that your interpetation was that the mutation rate is \n&gt; on a &quot;per empty slot&quot; basis.  That&#39;s radically different than my \n&gt; NEAT implementation...interesting though that that works at all...is \n&gt; that how ANJI has been working?\n&gt; \n&gt; But anyway absolutely Colin is right: one structural mutation at a \n&gt; time is the usual rule.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
