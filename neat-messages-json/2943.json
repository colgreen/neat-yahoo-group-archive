I don&#39;t really know whi=\r\nch is slower, evolving\n&gt; multiple sets of similar nets or evolving one mono=\r\nlithic net and using\n&gt; separate boolean input nodes (or negative values to =\r\nthe optional\n&gt; nodes) to indicate when nodes should be ignored.  For exampl=\r\ne, you\n&gt; would need betting information about the flop and turn on the rive=\r\nr,\n&gt; but would need some way to indicate that the information is no longer\n=\r\n&gt; relevant on the earlier rounds.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to think evolving separate ne=\r\ntworks is the better approach\n&gt; because it will tell us more about the game=\r\n itself.  As networks grow\n&gt; in size and complexity, the ability to underst=\r\nand the &quot;why&quot; behind\n&gt; their structure diminishes.\n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m guessing a lo=\r\nt of these tournaments would have to be played.  In\n&gt; which\n&gt;&gt; case, it is =\r\ninsufficient to say &quot;a fraction of a second&quot;.  I am\n&gt; forced to\n&gt;&gt; ask, whi=\r\nch fraction?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a framework which I have used already which is=\r\n not in any way\n&gt; as fast as poker eval (I wrote it before finding poker ev=\r\nal).  This is\n&gt; what I used to do my simulations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to calcul=\r\nate all the stats I mentioned previously in my\n&gt; past experiments (using ex=\r\nhaustive evaluation of all possible hands to\n&gt; find your overall hand rank)=\r\n.  A session would consist of a 6 handed\n&gt; game of limit hold em which last=\r\ned 1000 hands.  Each bot would play a\n&gt; session against a randomly selected=\r\n group of 5 other bots.  I used a\n&gt; fixed size population of 50 bots, (i.e.=\r\n, 50,000 hands per generation).\n&gt;  The total time for evaluating 1 generati=\r\non, performing selection and\n&gt; mutation, and serializing the bots to file (=\r\nin case of a system crash)\n&gt; using a AMD 3500+ was about 40 seconds on aver=\r\nage.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to run several hundred generations overnight and wake =\r\nup to\n&gt; lovely and horrible results. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; But I agree parallelizing it=\r\n would be hella cool.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is going to be my first step.  =\r\nIt will certainly help to\n&gt; familiarize myself with the details of NEAT.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt;&gt; For anyone who&#39;s interested, I&#39;ve posted it under &quot;maverick&quot; (what I\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; named\n&gt;&gt; it long ago) on the neat group file page.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really se=\r\ne much in terms of an actual poker engine for this.\n&gt; How did you run hand =\r\nsimulations?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t really play well with others but if people ar=\r\ne serious, I&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; contribute.  But I hate yahoo messenger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I gues=\r\ns we&#39;ll stick to this for now then.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
