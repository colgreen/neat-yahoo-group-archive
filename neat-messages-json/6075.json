In this regard, my question whether =\r\na maximum of evolvability exists was more of general nature.\n\n&gt; The way I t=\r\nhink about it currently is that perhaps there is no ultimate tension, and t=\r\nhat evolvability can generally increase without limit. The reason is that c=\r\nanalization of low-level mechanisms can act to increase evolvability. For e=\r\nxample, many of the mechanisms behind development are heavily conserved, bu=\r\nt can generate much phenotypic variability through being combined and modul=\r\nated in various ways. In other words, modulating conserved features of deve=\r\nlopment gives evolution higher-level levers that enable small genetic chang=\r\nes to be amplified and have a large meaningful phenotypic effect. Thus thro=\r\nugh continued evolution of the genotype/phenotype map, perhaps evolvability=\r\n can continually increase (through exploiting canalization of lower-level m=\r\nechanisms to generate increasingly high-level features).\n\nYep, when I read =\r\nthis I noted that this is actually also my opinion about generative encodin=\r\ngs. From this perspective, I would also assume that evolvability can contin=\r\nuously increase in the sense that the genome can become more powerful (or m=\r\nore flexible) in generating new meaningful phenotypes. Maybe my implicit as=\r\nsumption was not correct that evolvability in a phenotype map could be depi=\r\ncted as iso-oriented point-cloud:\n\nleft image in http://www.martinpyka.de/w=\r\np-content/uploads/2013/04/evolvability.png\n\nAccording to this illustration,=\r\n increased evolvability would increase the size of the point cloud. I think=\r\n I had this picture in mind when I argued in my previous post that evolvabi=\r\nlity cannot increase infinitely because genotype-phenotype mappings should =\r\nbecome instable when a certain degree of evolvability has been reached. How=\r\never, maybe a 2d-depiction of the evolvable phenotype-space would rather lo=\r\nok like in the right image (I am sorry for my poor artwork). Through canali=\r\nzation, not all phenotypes in the 2d-space are evolvable but evolvability i=\r\ntself can still increase!?\n\nMaybe, both pictures can also illustrate what c=\r\nanalization means. The left picture could depict all possible points in the=\r\n genotype space that can be reached through mutation and recombination and =\r\nthe right image all possible points in the phenotype space that can be gene=\r\nrated from it. While each bit in the (2d)-genotype has equal probability of=\r\n been mutated, in canalized encodings only a well-ordered subspace of pheno=\r\ntypes can be reached.\n\nThank you for this inspiring discussion. :-) I enjoy=\r\n thinking about how all this fits together.\n\nBest,\nMartin \n\n\n\n\n"}}
