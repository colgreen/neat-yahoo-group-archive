Or does anybody know if there any Neat implementations/code\nsnippe=\r\nts etc out there (SharpNeat or otherwise) that support\ncross-validation? \n\n=\r\nAs I am fairly new to NEAT, I begun by searching around for SharpNeat\nand n=\r\noticed that there are at least three different implementations:\nSourceForge=\r\n, codeplex and a version supporting HyperNeat/.NET 2.0.  Is\nthere by chance=\r\n a central CVS/Subversion repository coordinating these\ntogether where the =\r\nSharpNeat project is maintained and/or the patches\nfor update versions avai=\r\nlable? \n\nThanks,\nKeith.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petervermont&quot; &lt;pandr=\r\news@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In the recent thread &quot;New To NEAT - A few Newbie Questi=\r\nons&quot; Ken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;What you do is evaluate each\n&gt; &gt;generation on the tra=\r\nining set and test the champion of each\n&gt; &gt;generation on the validation set=\r\n. When the validation scores start\n&gt; &gt;going down, you stop evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI am using SharpNEAT and am new to all this so I would appreciate a\n&gt; littl=\r\ne more detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have implemented two interface, IExperiment and INetw=\r\norkEvaluator.\n&gt; Neither interface appears to have any concept of a generati=\r\non or of a\n&gt; champion. It looks to me like I might want/need to subclass\n&gt; =\r\nSingleFilePopulationEvaluator so that I can override\n&gt; EvaluatePopulation. =\r\nI can then call the superclass&#39; EvaluatePopulation\n&gt; and after it completes=\r\n do my validation testing on the\n&gt; EvolutionAlgorithm&#39;s BestGenome. I was t=\r\nhen thinking\n&gt; that once I wished to stop evolution, I could set the\n&gt; Evol=\r\nutionAlgorithm SearchCompleted boolean. Finally, I can modify\n&gt; SharpNeatGu=\r\ni&#39;s SearchThread to check the ea&#39;s SearchCompleted flag so\n&gt; that the threa=\r\nd will stop.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I on the right track here? How have others handled cro=\r\nss-validation\n&gt; and prevention of over-fitting?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
