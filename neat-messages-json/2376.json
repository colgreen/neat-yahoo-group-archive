If you&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;connecting nodes A & B, then start with B and traverse the net to see\n&gt; &gt;if you connect to A.  If you do, disallow the connection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Thanks, this is an option I&#39;ll keep in mind if I decide to attempt the\n&gt;Othello comp. Of course this approach will probably start eating CPU\n&gt;cycles as the genomes become more complex so it&#39;s something I&#39;d prefer\n&gt;to leave out of the code base in the long term - being somewhat obsessed\n&gt;with optimisations as I am :)\n&gt;\n&gt;One possible optimisation is to keep a list of a genome&#39;s neurons in the\n&gt;order that they are connected, so that again we can safely assume that\n&gt;making a connection between some neurons with some index to some higher\n&gt;index in the list is OK. Elsewhere though I have code that assumes\n&gt;neurons are in innovation ID order, as this allows finding of neurons\n&gt;with a binary search over the list - so probably the solution is to\n&gt;maintain two lists.\n\nHi,\n         You might already be thinking this, but one cheap way to do \nthis is to keep a &quot;depth parameter&quot; in each neuron.  Depth is defined \nas zero in the input layer, and for any other neurone is the highest \ndepth amongst its inputs plus one.  All you need do then is (i) never \nconnect from higher to lower depth (equal is OK) and (ii) scan the \nneurones recalculating the depth after any connection change.  This \nis a simple form of dynamic programming....\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
