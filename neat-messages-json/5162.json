However, it would be interesting t=\r\no look closely at how it affects internal population dynamics over time.  O=\r\nne risk of penalizing complexity in fitness explicitly is that you will cre=\r\nate niches for mediocre individuals who are simple.  These individuals can =\r\nsubsist by outperforming (in fitness) individuals of higher complexity who =\r\nare actually trying to solve the problem but do so poorly.  So it can cause=\r\n some of your resources to be allocated to strategies that have little to d=\r\no with anything interesting.  One of my inspirations for complexification i=\r\nn NEAT was to introduce a heuristic that aims for the right complexity with=\r\nout needing to make complexity part of fitness.\n\nHowever, since you are tal=\r\nking about changing such a penalty over time, that makes the dynamics more =\r\ncomplex and is more interesting than a simple complexity penalty alone.  So=\r\n my overall concern above does not necessarily apply to the same extent.  Y=\r\net what I wonder is whether you observe transient pockets of simpletons tha=\r\nt mainly survive by doing nothing and just being simple.  Of course, other =\r\nbenefits that you cite may in practice overshadow the cost of such a concer=\r\nn.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is an idea I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while. Consider a\n&gt; fit=\r\nness landscape with local maxima that we tend to get stuck in. NEAT\n&gt; gives=\r\n us some ways of getting out of the local high points:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Speciation. =\r\nMaintains multiple search &#39;areas&#39; on teh landscape and\n&gt; balances search ef=\r\nfort between them. However, speciation by itself\n&gt; doesn&#39;t provide a means =\r\nof discovering new promising areas on the\n&gt; landscape.\n&gt; 2) Random mutation=\r\ns. Allow us to &#39;hop&#39; to new but relatively proximate\n&gt; points on the landsc=\r\nape, e.g. single new connections/nodes and random\n&gt; resetting of connection=\r\ns weights.\n&gt; 3) Crossover. Attempts to find new areas, but that are close t=\r\no both\n&gt; parents (typically by searching in some higher dimensional space t=\r\nhan\n&gt; either of the parents). Hence crossover provides access to a lot of\n&gt;=\r\n new search space by bringing it nearer to our current search\n&gt; points(geno=\r\nmes) in terms of &#39;edit distance&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m proposing that another way of=\r\n opening up the fitness landscape is\n&gt; to modify that landscape such that t=\r\nhe arrangement of landscape\n&gt; barriers changes and opens up pathways to new=\r\n areas, but in a way that\n&gt; still leads to promising areas. E.g. One techni=\r\nque I have experimented\n&gt; with is to factor the size of a genome into the f=\r\nitness function,\n&gt; motivation for this comes from mathematical regularizati=\r\non - simply\n&gt; that simpler models/genomes are more generalised and thus fit=\r\nter than\n&gt; more complex models (depending on the problem domain).\n&gt; \n&gt; If I=\r\n enforce selection pressure against complexity I see the search\n&gt; becoming =\r\noverly constrained, but if I lessen that pressure or remove\n&gt; it, allow sea=\r\nrch to continue for a while and then re-impose the\n&gt; pressure then I&#39;ve fou=\r\nnd that this to be successful. You can imagine\n&gt; that I&#39;ve removed a barrie=\r\nr in the landscape, some of the genome shave\n&gt; migrated to new areas and th=\r\nen I&#39;ve put back the barriers and the\n&gt; genome snow settle into new local m=\r\naxima and continue searching from\n&gt; there.\n&gt; \n&gt; This idea overlaps with pha=\r\nsed search (alternating between\n&gt; complexifying and simplifying) and could =\r\nbe framed as an extension of\n&gt; that approach, essentially adding more phase=\r\ns or more axes to the\n&gt; complex-simple axis. I also think rather than switc=\r\nhing certain types\n&gt; of fitness criteria on/off that a smoother transition =\r\nwould be a more\n&gt; general solution. You can imagine the landscape as undula=\r\nting and the\n&gt; genomes as ball bearings rolling around as the landscpae cha=\r\nnges\n&gt; (except ball bearings would follow valleys instead of peaks/ridges).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics=\r\n%29\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
