I agree with you that one of\n&gt; the interesting things the =\r\nHybrID paper does is get us thinking about what\n&gt; we want out of encodings.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are a few reactions to your comments:\n&gt; \n&gt; Initially, I fully ac=\r\nknowledge (and even trumpet the fact) that HyperNEAT\n&gt; can produce many typ=\r\nes of variations on themes and irregularities. If I have\n&gt; given a differen=\r\nt impression somewhere, that was unintentional. You are\n&gt; right that HyperN=\r\nEAT just seems to have difficulties making *certain types*\n&gt; of exceptions,=\r\n however I still think the exceptions it has trouble making\n&gt; are ones that=\r\n we want it to be able to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; You have convinced me (in previous con=\r\nversations) that we do not need (nor\n&gt; want) our encodings to have the abil=\r\nity to match an arbitrary target.\n&gt; However, the experimental results from =\r\nthe quadruped domain in the HybrID\n&gt; paper show that the ability to make ex=\r\nceptions boosts fitness, even in a\n&gt; complicated, real-world problem. That =\r\nis the type of problems that nature\n&gt; (with DNA) did solve, so my guess is =\r\nthat we still have some work to do when\n&gt; it comes to creating encodings th=\r\nat simultaneously generate regularities and\n&gt; exceptions. I am guessing tha=\r\nt the solutions HybrID produced that HyperNEAT\n&gt; alone did not produce were=\r\n not the only possible solution (such as might be\n&gt; described as a pre-set =\r\ntarget), but instead were instances of a class of\n&gt; solutions that were les=\r\ns-regular than the HyperNEAT-only gaits. To me that\n&gt; indicates that HyperN=\r\nEAT is not only constrained from discovering arbitrary,\n&gt; ad-hoc, academic =\r\nirregularities, but instead has difficulty producing some\n&gt; irregularities =\r\nwhich help on normal, everyday, complex problems.  My\n&gt; instincts tell me t=\r\nhat to get to true AI we are going to need to make these\n&gt; types of excepti=\r\nons.\n&gt; \n\nBut is the quadruped really representative of &quot;real-world&quot; problem=\r\ns that nature solved?  I don&#39;t think the quadruped solution is anything lik=\r\ne nature&#39;s solutions to quadruped walking.  The HybrID quadruped was allowe=\r\nd to *further* evolve to adjust to joint faults, whereas real-life quadrupe=\r\nds would simply adapt during their lifetime, which is a major difference.  =\r\nIn fact, walking solutions in the real world are adaptive and malleable, no=\r\nt canned circuits that only produce a single gait.  If a dog hurts its knee=\r\n, it changes how it walks.  The HyrbrID quadruped can&#39;t do that.  Even an i=\r\nnsect that loses a leg can adjust and keep walking.  \n\nThus my guess is tha=\r\nt the underlying encoding in nature is regular after all, and the irregular=\r\nity that may ultimately arise within the brain is because of changes that a=\r\nre guided by adaptive rules.  But what the DNA codes for are those *rules*,=\r\n not the changes that the rules produce.  Thus the rules themselves can cer=\r\ntainly be distributed in a regular pattern.  If an irregular fault then ari=\r\nses, the rules for how that local area should change will cause changes for=\r\n that area.  In fact, the rules must be distributed in a mostly regular man=\r\nner:  How could it be that you should somehow adapt differently to a right =\r\nknee fault than to a left one?  The underlying concept of adaptation is sym=\r\nmetric.\n\nSo I still do not see evidence that CPPNs, nor nature for that mat=\r\nter, should be expected to encode for ad hoc irregularities such as a creat=\r\nure that is born with a single gait attuned to an asymmetric body with a ba=\r\nd knee.  That is, creatures derive their gaits from their bodies, not vice-=\r\nversa.  They sense their limbs once they are alive and adapt the way they m=\r\nove to the limbs with which they find themselves.  Hopefully those limbs ar=\r\ne intact, but if not, or if they become disabled, they adapt.\n\n\n&gt; You raise=\r\n the issue that getting better at making exceptions also makes us\n&gt; worse a=\r\nt creating regularities.  But is it necessarily the case that there\n&gt; is a =\r\nnon-zero-sum tradeoff in encoding regularities and exceptions? I can\n&gt; conc=\r\neive of a different activation function set for HyperNEAT in which we\n&gt; add=\r\n functions that help it make exceptions in small areas of the geometric\n&gt; s=\r\npace. This enlarged function set would still have all of the same power to\n=\r\n&gt; generate regularities as the standard set, but it would also have the\n&gt; a=\r\ndditional ability to create exceptions. Especially if this activation\n&gt; fun=\r\nction was rarely used (either because it mutated in at a lower rate, or\n&gt; b=\r\necause evolution chose to use it sparingly), the overall type of solutions\n=\r\n&gt; might not be biased back into the chaos of direct encodings. Clearly ther=\r\ne\n&gt; is some bias back in that direction, but I am wondering (out loud) if i=\r\nt\n&gt; really has to be non-zero-some in the sense that whatever you gain in\n&gt;=\r\n exception-making you lose in regularity-making. Might an elegant solution\n=\r\n&gt; get us a lot of one without too much loss of the other?\n&gt; \n\nIt certainly =\r\ncould be possible that some new set of activation functions or augmentation=\r\ns of CPPNs could be better at producing the kinds of regularities and excep=\r\ntions that are most effective for building brains.  But I do think that it =\r\nis incorrect to frame this issue as a problem with capturing exceptions.  I=\r\n mean, I guess I don&#39;t accept the premise of the question of whether it is =\r\na zero-sum game.  That question assumes that somehow we need more exception=\r\ns, but I do not see evidence for that.  I can think of innumerable possible=\r\n &quot;exceptions&quot; for animal body plans, but nature would be able to evolve vir=\r\ntually none of them, even with proper selection pressure.  How about finger=\r\ns coming out of one ear, or a tongue on the bottom of one foot?  Or maybe o=\r\nne half side of the body entirely covered in hair but the other bald?  Or m=\r\naybe we could breed babies to be born with a nice smiley-face tattoo on one=\r\n cheek?  \n\nThese are ridiculous, but I do not see any clear a priori distin=\r\nction that you have articulated between what is ridiculous and what isn&#39;t. =\r\n You seem to have the intuition that what HybrID produces is exactly in the=\r\n class of &quot;not ridiculous&quot; exceptions, but in my view just because somethin=\r\ng worked does not mean it has any relation to nature at all.  Still, ok, it=\r\n doesn&#39;t have to be like nature, but the question is whether it somehow set=\r\ns up a new ideal vision for indirect encodings.  And I don&#39;t see that becau=\r\nse I think the quadruped born with the broken joint is no less arbitrary th=\r\nan a baby with a smiley-face tattoo.   \n\nSo you might wonder what irregular=\r\nities I would think are not arbitrary.  The things that are not arbitrary a=\r\nre those irregular motifs that I intuitively observe in nature such as impe=\r\nrfect symmetry (e.g. the heart on one side or right-handedness) and repetit=\r\nion with variation (e.g. receptive field patterns in the brain or fingers o=\r\nn the hand).  \n\nIt&#39;s hard for me to think of major exceptions.  Maybe the l=\r\nobster&#39;s claw?  But of course in all the immensity of nature there will be =\r\nhere and there a bizarre occurrence, but those do not make a rule.  (And an=\r\nyway, to my intuition the lobster&#39;s claw is more a kind of imperfect symmet=\r\nry than an arbitrary exception.)\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of what I&#39;m going on he=\r\nre is intuition rather than logic. \n\n&gt; In fact, isn&#39;t HybrID an example of =\r\nthis? Mutation-selection balance aside,\n&gt; FT-NEAT should only make a change=\r\n to a pattern HyperNEAT produced if the\n&gt; change helps fitness. I realize H=\r\nybrID is not the long-term solution (partly\n&gt; because of the scaling issues=\r\n you mentioned), but isn&#39;t it at least an\n&gt; example of how an algorithm can=\r\n make advances on the exception-making front\n&gt; without losing much, if anyt=\r\nhing, on the producing-regularity front?\n&gt; \n\nThat&#39;s a really good question/=\r\nargument, and it is worth thinking about.  But ultimately I would not draw =\r\nthat conclusion from HybrID.  Rather, I would say that it simply works in p=\r\nractice on lower-dimensional structures, and I would not draw any more gene=\r\nral lesson from it on the potential for representing more exceptions.  My g=\r\nuess is that if such a power were available at much higher dimensionalities=\r\n, it would add a kind of noise on top of whatever regularity might be disco=\r\nvered, thereby handicapping the ability to discover regularity.  That is, m=\r\ny guess is that the ability to make completely arbitrary regular exceptions=\r\n probably would not scale well.  Since scaling to massive sizes is part of =\r\nwhat interests me, I would need more evidence to convince me that there is =\r\na need for such exception-making at large scales.\n\nLet me conclude by empha=\r\nsizing that I am *not* suggesting that CPPNs in their present form are the =\r\nbest encoding we will ever get.  There may indeed be better ones (and it&#39;s =\r\nworth investigating), but what I think would make them better is not trying=\r\n to get &quot;more exceptions&quot; but rather trying to figure out what kinds of exc=\r\neptions there should be and what kinds of regularities there should be and =\r\nwhere they would all fit into the big picture.  That is, to me it is more a=\r\n question of kind than a question of degree.  And unfortunately, arguments =\r\nabout kind are much more specific and hair-splitting than general arguments=\r\n about degree.\n\nken \n\n\n&gt; Thanks again for your interesting comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Universit=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nReply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sun, 26 J=\r\nul 2009 23:29:15 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HybrID: A Hybridization of Indirect and Direct En=\r\ncodings\n&gt; &gt; for Evolutionary Computation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeff knows some of my tho=\r\nughts on the issue of regularity vs. irregularity in\n&gt; &gt; neuroevolution and=\r\n also that I recognize the nice results with HybrID, so this\n&gt; &gt; post is ju=\r\nst my attempt to put out some thoughts on this important issue,\n&gt; &gt; rather =\r\nthan a challenge to the HybrID concept.  Basically, HybrID creates a\n&gt; &gt; go=\r\nod opportunity to discuss these issues.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Taking a long term view, w=\r\nhat I would like to question is the idea that there\n&gt; &gt; is a problem with a=\r\n method that has &quot;trouble&quot; discovering arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; irregularities.  It im=\r\nportant to note that HyperNEAT has no trouble\n&gt; &gt; representing &quot;irregularit=\r\ny&quot; in the general sense.  In my 2007 paper on CPPNs\n&gt; &gt; (http://eplex.cs.uc=\r\nf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html), I included explicit\n&gt; &gt; examples of ir=\r\nregularities and how easy they are to represent.  For example,\n&gt; &gt; see the =\r\n&quot;Warped Symmetry&quot; panel in figure 9 on page 24.  So I think the issue\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns definitively *not* that HyperNEAT (or more specifically, CPPNs with a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n certain set of activation functions) has trouble representing or discoveri=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; irregularity, but that it has trouble discovering *particular* irreg=\r\nularities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet such trouble may actually be a good thing.  If it w=\r\nere too easy to\n&gt; &gt; represent any arbitrary irregularity, then you would ha=\r\nve an encoding that is\n&gt; &gt; poor at discovering regularities.  So this argum=\r\nent could go in circles.  But\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s important to recognize that we are l=\r\nooking at a trade-off.  Nature faces\n&gt; &gt; the same trade-off.  It is difficu=\r\nlt to say for sure whether DNA is biased\n&gt; &gt; towards regularity or irregula=\r\nrity, but I would guess looking at biological\n&gt; &gt; organisms that regularity=\r\n reigns, and that irregularities are of certain\n&gt; &gt; *types*, that is, you w=\r\nould be hard pressed to &quot;breed&quot; a human with a hand\n&gt; &gt; protruding from his=\r\n or her right knee, no matter how many generations were\n&gt; &gt; available.  Yet=\r\n we see things like the heart on one side, right-handedness,\n&gt; &gt; etc.  But =\r\nthose do not mean that the encoding can simply bend to the arbitrary\n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nims of a random target.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I think what you need if you want to ev=\r\nolve a really interesting artifact\n&gt; &gt; is not an encoding that is entirely =\r\nflexible with respect to irregularity.  If\n&gt; &gt; a particular encoding would =\r\noften fail to meet ad hoc irregular targets, that\n&gt; &gt; is probably a sign of=\r\n its long term potential, rather something we&#39;d want to\n&gt; &gt; fix.  If we did=\r\n &quot;fix&quot; it, we&#39;d be heading back towards the chaos and entropy\n&gt; &gt; of direct=\r\n encoding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, we should be careful about whether we consid=\r\ner difficulty achieving\n&gt; &gt; specific irregularities a problem to solve or a=\r\nn asset in the long run.\n&gt; &gt; Certainly there should an ability to create &quot;r=\r\nepetition with variation,&quot; but\n&gt; &gt; CPPNs (as well as nature) exhibit that c=\r\nonsistently.  So it&#39;s important to be\n&gt; &gt; careful what we consider to be a =\r\npathology versus an asset.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That said, HybrID is a good practical i=\r\ndea.  It is clear that in some problems\n&gt; &gt; it is just what is needed to pe=\r\nrfect solutions with particular irregular\n&gt; &gt; needs.  Of course, when the n=\r\networks become really big, e.g. with millions of\n&gt; &gt; connections, HybrID mi=\r\nght begin to lose some of its ability to cope with the\n&gt; &gt; very high dimens=\r\nionality, even if it is just tweaking on top of preexisting\n&gt; &gt; regularitie=\r\ns encoded by the CPPN.  Nevertheless, at lower dimensionalities, as\n&gt; &gt; Jef=\r\nf&#39;s paper shows, it can really help.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case, my main point is=\r\n that the issue of what we actually *want* in an\n&gt; &gt; encoding with respect =\r\nto regularity and irregularity is quite subtle and\n&gt; &gt; deserves considered =\r\ncontemplation.  The CPPN with the usual set of activation\n&gt; &gt; functions may=\r\n not ultimately be the very best representation to bias towards\n&gt; &gt; what we=\r\n want, but if there is something better, it would not be better by\n&gt; &gt; virt=\r\nue of simply being able to capture irregularities more easily.  Rather,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n any advantage would be gained through a much more subtle argument, which\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; likely refers to both regularities and irregularities of certain types, =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; why they are appropriate for the kinds of neural structures we hope=\r\n to evolve.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;=\r\njclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Recently I have shown that=\r\n HyperNEAT has trouble making exceptions to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rules it discovers (Cl=\r\nune et al. PPSN 2008). I would like to introduce a new\n&gt; &gt;&gt; paper that will=\r\n be at ECAL 2009 which shows one way to remedy this problem:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; combining=\r\n a generative encoding (HyperNEAT in this case) with a direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; encoding=\r\n (FT-NEAT in this case).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The resulting algorithm, which we call =\r\nHybrID (Hybridization of Indirect and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Direct Encodings), combines the =\r\nbest of both encodings, and outperformed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT on all of the probl=\r\nems we tested it on, sometimes by as much as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 40%. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;d be r=\r\neally interested to hear what the people on this list think of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wor=\r\nk. For example, I&#39;ll bet there are interesting ways to remedy the problem\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; of making exceptions within HyperNEAT, and it would be interesting for =\r\nus as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a community to explore them. But in the interim, if any of you a=\r\nre deploying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT on some task and want a possible performance bo=\r\nost, HybrID is easy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to implement and may lead to a significant improve=\r\nment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here is a link to the paper:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jcl=\r\nune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HybrID-ECAL-2009.pdf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here is the=\r\n abstract from the paper:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Evolutionary algorithms typically use =\r\ndirect encodings, where each element\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the phenotype is specified ind=\r\nependently in the genotype. Because direct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; encodings have difficulty e=\r\nvolving modular and symmetric phenotypes, some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; researchers use indirec=\r\nt encodings, wherein one genomic element can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; influence multiple parts =\r\nof a phenotype. We have previously shown that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT, an indirect e=\r\nncoding, outperforms FT-NEAT, a direct-encoding\n&gt; &gt;&gt; control, on many probl=\r\nems, especially as the regularity of the problem\n&gt; &gt;&gt; increases. However, H=\r\nyperNEAT is no panacea; it had difficulty accounting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for irregularitie=\r\ns in problems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hybridized=\r\n Indirect and Direct encoding (HybrID), which discovers the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regularity=\r\n of a problem with an indirect encoding and accounts for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; irregularitie=\r\ns via a direct encoding. In three different problem domains,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; HybrID ou=\r\ntperforms HyperNEAT in most situations, with performance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; improvements =\r\nas large as 40%. Our work suggests that hybridizing indirect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and direc=\r\nt encodings can be an effective way to improve the performance of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evol=\r\nutionary algorithms.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclun=\r\ne@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
