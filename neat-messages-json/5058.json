By &quot;geometric information&quot;,\n&gt; are you referring to metrics of a spatio-temporal nature, such as time,\n&gt; location or orientation? And by &quot;environmental information&quot; are you\n&gt; referring to thermodynamic information, such as temperature, pressure,\n&gt; energy, entropy?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The reason I ask has to do with understanding exchanges (perturbations) of\n&gt; energy, information and entropy between the network representing the system\n&gt; of interest, through the network of interfaces (input, output, hidden, bias)\n&gt; and its context, representing the sources and sinks of that energy,\n&gt; information, and entropy in space-time.  The contexts I speak of may\n&gt; represent your &quot;increasingly complex coordinate frames&quot; - as measureable,\n&gt; meaningful spaces, topologies, manifolds or domains.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The CPPN can encode category theoretic functors, but in doing so it needs to\n&gt; encode both the category and its objects (say, by using tensor-functions in\n&gt; its ordering schema). As such it may encode elements, structure, behavior\n&gt; and morphism.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ken Lloyd\n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jeff\n&gt; Clune\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, January 16, 2010 5:57 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Is environmental information helpful for\n&gt; developmental complexity?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Ken-\n&gt; \n&gt; I am fully on board with the idea that using global geometric information\n&gt; makes development easier. The question is, as you point out, whether we\n&gt; should take the hard view that such information is the only thing that\n&gt; evolution needs. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thinking along these lines, there are two related but importantly distinct\n&gt; questions: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Can evolution produce all desired forms only with geometric information?\n&gt; 2) Does evolution have an easier time if you combine both geometric\n&gt; information and environmental information?\n&gt; \n&gt; My post was more getting at the second question. My hunch is that it may in\n&gt; some cases be easier to base heuristics off of environmental information\n&gt; than to make the same distinction only using geometric information. But,\n&gt; even if that is true, it does not undermine the huge advance of your CPPN\n&gt; work that shows how much easier development is if we provide global\n&gt; geometric information (and evolve increasingly complex coordinate frames\n&gt; from it). \n&gt; \n&gt; So we are in full agreement about this statement:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Yet I believe such functionality can complement and extend CPPNs without\n&gt;&gt; replacing their central role in encoding neural structures.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also agree with you that we need to get learning working in conjunction\n&gt; with evolution to produce intelligent neural networks. This statement is\n&gt; largely true because the learning takes care of figuring out things that are\n&gt; changing on a timescale that is too fast for evolution to get a bead on.\n&gt; \n&gt; -jeff\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, Jeff Clune\n&gt; &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; The article below is interesting. It suggests that lung cells know to\n&gt; become\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lung cells based on the air passing back and forth over them. It is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; intriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows that sometimes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nature does not use geometric position (provided by complex protein\n&gt;&gt;&gt; patterning) to make differentiation decisions, but uses environmental\n&gt; cues.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, HyperNEAT could create the same end product just with\n&gt; positional\n&gt;&gt;&gt; information, but it might be easier to accomplish this with simple\n&gt;&gt;&gt; environmental-based tricks like this one. Thoughts?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; New Scientist\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Breath of fresh air transforms stem cells\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; 14:32 09 November 2009 by Andy Coghlan\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mimicking the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; transform stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such\n&gt; &quot;physical&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; techniques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth\n&gt; factors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alone aren&#39;t enough.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Lindsey Van Haute of the Free University of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; colleagues spread human embryonic stem cells onto a porous membrane. The\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cells were fed from beneath by nutrients and from above by a fluid that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; encouraged them to multiply. Removing two chemicals from the growth fluid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; kickstarted differentiation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Four days later, the team removed the fluid covering the cells, leaving\n&gt; them\n&gt;&gt;&gt; open to the air while still being sustained and supported from below, as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; they would be in the trachea. After 24 days the cells had developed\n&gt; surface\n&gt;&gt;&gt; proteins that identified them as specific types of lung cell, including\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alveolar cells, which allow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bacteria and dirt.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Physical influence\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Our study proves differentiation into lung cells is influenced by\n&gt; physical\n&gt;&gt;&gt; forces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have been made to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; differentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different growth\n&gt; factors,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; but Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Physical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung lining to be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London, who has\n&gt; made\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth factors alone. &quot;But I\n&gt; find\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it difficult to believe that raw stem cells would differentiate through\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; these uncommon types of cells solely in response to physical forces.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Haute&#39;s team plans to use the cells they created to study lung diseases,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; such as cystic fibrosis. Such cells might one day be used to treat people\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with damaged lung tissue, but only if the cells can be made from a\n&gt; person&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt; own tissue. This could be done by converting the cells first into induced\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pluripotent stem cells.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Journal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI: 10.1186/1465-9921-10-105\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
