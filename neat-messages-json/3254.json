For all other genomes in th=\r\ne new generation, assign them\n&gt; &gt; into one\n&gt; &gt; of the existing species usin=\r\ng the compatibilty distance formula\n&gt; &gt; delta =3D c1E/N +c2D/N + c3.W  . if=\r\n no compatibility match found, \n&gt; start\n&gt; &gt; a new species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So=\r\n far so good (I hope)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next Ken&#39;s phd thesis refer to a calculated =\r\nfitness sharing \n&gt; function fi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This function gets adjusted to f(d=\r\nash)i by using the formula\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; f(dash)i =3D fi/Sigma (j=3D1 to n) sh(d=\r\nelta)(i,j)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bit I don&#39;t understand is what the the origina=\r\nl fitness fi is \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; how its calculated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Is it supposed to =\r\nrepresent the phenotype/networks closeness to the\n&gt; &gt; target output?\n&gt; &gt; i.=\r\ne. if a network was 90% accurate, would fi =3D 0.9 ??)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Appreciate =\r\nany clarification\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
