If you&#39;re\n&gt;connecting nodes A & B, then start with B and traverse the net to see\n&gt;if you connect to A.  If you do, disallow the connection.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks, this is an option I&#39;ll keep in mind if I decide to attempt the \nOthello comp. Of course this approach will probably start eating CPU \ncycles as the genomes become more complex so it&#39;s something I&#39;d prefer \nto leave out of the code base in the long term - being somewhat obsessed \nwith optimisations as I am :)\n\nOne possible optimisation is to keep a list of a genome&#39;s neurons in the \norder that they are connected, so that again we can safely assume that \nmaking a connection between some neurons with some index to some higher \nindex in the list is OK. Elsewhere though I have code that assumes \nneurons are in innovation ID order, as this allows finding of neurons \nwith a binary search over the list - so probably the solution is to \nmaintain two lists.\n\nOh and on a different subject, when I said this:\n\n&gt;&gt; expand the ANN model in use to allow for neurons with\n&gt;&gt;multiple incoming connections. \n&gt;&gt;\nI did of course mean multiple incoming connection *points* - each point \n(or sink or whatever) supplying a parameter to an activation function. \nWhich is something that was discussed a while ago now.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
