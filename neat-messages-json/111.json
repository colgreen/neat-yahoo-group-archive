Protection of simple structure is only \nassured \n&gt; while evolution is progressing, I think that is where the source \nof our \n&gt; disharmony lies. :)\n&gt; \n\nActually I think it&#39;s more complicated than this.  There are two \ncases: 1) Where the compatibility threshold is fixed, and 2) Where \nthe compatibility threshold is dynamically adjusting to attain a \ngoal # of species.\n\nIn case 1, if no species are improving, then more and more species\nwill be created as topology is added, and all the species will be\nshrinking in size.  After a large numberof generations, species will \nbegin to be so small that some species simply will not get a chance \nto reproduce by chance.  However, note that there is no particular \nbias in this probability of extinction towards species of smaller \ntopologies.  In fact, for any particular species, it is unlikely it \nwill go extinct.  Thus, on average, you would expect the simple \nspecies to persist.  Over an extremely long timescale, you would \nexpect to lose the simplest species a few times, but this bottom-\nlevel complexity would increase extremely slowly over an enormous \ntimescale.  This is not what is generally considered bloat.  In \nfact, in the hypothesized situation where everything is stagnant, it \ncannot be said whether adding topology is &quot;functional&quot; \nor &quot;nonfunctional&quot; since we don&#39;t know why no one can solve the \nproblem.  Thus it is probably *correct* to very slowly abandon the \nsimplest topologies after hundreds of generations of no progress.\n\nIn case 2, if no specie are improving, once the target # of species \nis obtained, new topology will tend to get added within each \nspecies, because there is no room to create new species.  But \nremember many times adding topology decreases fitness.  And by our \nhypothesis, it does not increase fitness.  Thus, the majority of \nadded topology will not be selected as parents, since they are \ninferior to their simpler counterparts in the same species. So you \nwill see a churn inside all the species where most of the new \ntopology innovations get thrown out.  Once in a while, new topology \nmay have no effect on performance.  Such topology then has a \nprobability of getting reproduced.  So you would see again a very \nslow increase in complexity in all the species.  But again, this \nmakes sense, since you are by hypothesis completely stuck, and it \nwouldn&#39;t make sense to stay in the simplest spaces forever.\n\nOverall, the point is, the &quot;bloat&quot; in a stagnating population is \nreally just appropriate incrementation of the search space after \nvery long periods of time.  It is not clear there is any reasonable \nalternative.  For instance, if you were searching for lost money in \nyour living room for 5 hours, wouldn&#39;t eventually add some new rooms \nto your search?  It wouldn&#39;t make sense to keep the search only in \none room just for the sake of simplicity.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
