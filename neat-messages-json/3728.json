I was \nhavi=\r\nng trouble with the torrent myself when I was trying to refresh \nmy memory =\r\nof their responses.\n\nI agree with what you said about Wolpert.  I cannot un=\r\nderstand how he \ncould so superficially respond to a question that probes d=\r\nirectly to \nthe core of his own expertise.  It makes me think that developm=\r\nental \nbiologists do not appreciate the significance of their own field, or=\r\n \nperhaps more specifically they do not realize what it is significant \ntow=\r\nards.\n\nYour research direction with cortical columns makes sense and has \np=\r\nromising support in the literature. I&#39;ll be interested to see what \nkind of=\r\n results you get.  I think it&#39;s great that you took your \ninterest in this =\r\narea and shifted career gears to make it into a \nPh.D.  \n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Update: I asked Pet=\r\ner Bentley if it would be all right to upload the\n&gt; video to Google Video, =\r\nand he said yes, as long as I linked back to\n&gt; his site and didn&#39;t edit it =\r\nin any way.

I \nenjoyed\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  having the opportunity to ask my question to such illustrious\n&gt; &gt;  sci=\r\nentists, but like you, I was kind of disappointed with their\n&gt; &gt;  answers. =\r\nLike you said, they sort of answered accurately, but \nthere\n&gt; &gt;  was no rea=\r\nl insight or thoughtfulness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It&#39;s interesting th=\r\nat you point out this exchange because I \nthink it\n&gt; &gt;  highlights a weakne=\r\nss in how biologists have been dealing with \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  question of complexit=\r\ny. It&#39;s such a fundamental question yet it\n&gt; &gt;  hasn&#39;t really received the =\r\ntreatment it deserves, even from the\n&gt; &gt;  field&#39;s luminaries. I think part =\r\nof the problem is that a genuine\n&gt; &gt;  treatment requires a kind of algorith=\r\nmic and representational \ntheory,\n&gt; &gt;  which is perhaps better attacked fro=\r\nm a computational \nperspective,\n&gt; &gt;  putting evolutionary computation resea=\r\nrchers at an advantage \nbecause\n&gt; &gt;  we think about search spaces, encoding=\r\ns, mappings, etc. \nroutinely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I think you&#39;re right that EC resear=\r\ncher probably come at the\n&gt; problem from an angle that might be more produc=\r\ntive, but I&#39;m\n&gt; especially disappointed in Wolpert, who was the main voice =\r\nfor\n&gt; developmental biology on the panel. Your question gets to issues \ntha=\r\nt\n&gt; a developmental biologist should primarily be interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even =\r\nif he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the development \nof\n&gt; the hu=\r\nman brain, he should have been able to give other examples \nwith\n&gt; which he=\r\n was more familiar.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 pap=\r\ner &quot;A small step \nfor\n&gt; the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of=\r\n neocortical\n&gt; expansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=3DArticleURL&_udi=3DB6T0V-\n3Y6PF=\r\nXS-\n1P&_user=3D10&_rdoc=3D1&_fmt=3D&_orig=3Dsearch&_sort=3Dd&view=3Dc&_acct=\r\n=3DC000050221\n&_version=3D1&_urlVersion=3D0&_userid=3D10&md5=3D4eba37dec70f=\r\n1bb0d9022402f97ae\ne43\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; The more than 1000-fol=\r\nd increase in the cortical surface without a\n&gt; comparable increase in its t=\r\nhickness during mammalian evolution is\n&gt; explained in the context of the ra=\r\ndial-unit hypothesis of cortical\n&gt; development. According to the proposed m=\r\nodel, cortical expansion is\n&gt; the result of changes in proliferation kineti=\r\ncs that increase the\n&gt; number of radial columnar units without changing the=\r\n number of \nneurons\n&gt; within each unit significantly. Thus, mutation of a r=\r\negulatory gene\n(s)\n&gt; that controls the timing and ratio of symmetric and as=\r\nymmetric modes\n&gt; of cell divisions in the proliferative zone, coupled with =\r\nradial\n&gt; constraints in the distribution of migrating neurons, could create=\r\n \nan\n&gt; expanded cortical plate with enhanced capacity for establishing new\n=\r\n&gt; patterns of connectivity that are validated through natural \nselection.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;m personally working under the assumption that the cortical\n&gt; minicol=\r\numn is the primary module, that repeatable bit of code that\n&gt; Dawkins talke=\r\nd about, and there are a number of good work by\n&gt; biologists out there, inc=\r\nluding Rakic, who give support to such an\n&gt; idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Perhaps they were=\r\n just being curt or did not take the audience\n&gt; &gt;  seriously enough to elab=\r\norate their thoughts. Yet I find that\n&gt; &gt;  explanation doubtful given that =\r\nwe were after all at a &quot;debate&quot; \nabout\n&gt; &gt;  evolution and complexity, which=\r\n is precisely the substance of my\n&gt; &gt;  question. I also agree that Dawkins =\r\nseemed closest to really\n&gt; &gt;  thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would=\r\n be very interested \nin\n&gt; &gt;  our area of EC if only there was an opportunit=\r\ny to tell him about\n&gt; &gt;  it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of exper=\r\nience with it\n&gt; &gt;  beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess you d=\r\nidn&#39;t have a chance to corner him and talk things over?\n&gt; :) Dawkins does s=\r\neem like he would be interested in a lot of the \nwork\n&gt; being presented at =\r\nGECCO. Did he just show up for the panel, or was \nhe\n&gt; around the conferenc=\r\ne at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also thought the other really interesting exchange was=\r\n at \n33:45\n&gt; in the video, when the question of whether or not you could ev=\r\nolve a\n&gt; mouse with feathered wings came up, and Wolpert and Jones both sai=\r\nd\n&gt; no, while Dawkins seemed to say probably not, but not for any of the\n&gt; =\r\nreasons the other guys came up with.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
