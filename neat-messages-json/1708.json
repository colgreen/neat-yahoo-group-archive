I&#39;ve seen this implemented in a few\nGAs...it&#39;s not a bad idea in general, I think.\n\n&gt; 2) Some kind of hybrid evaluation scheme might be useful. e.g. Consider\n&gt; the following eval scheme:\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Use random tests as normal.\n&gt;  - If a genome is encountered that scores 100% then test it against a\n&gt; more exhaustive test set (or just a lot more random tests).\n&gt;  - Note any tests that fail - hopefully there won&#39;t be too many - these\n&gt; are now &#39;special&#39; test cases..\n&gt;  - Subsequent evaluations can now use random tests *and* the set of\n&gt; previously failed tests.\n\nYes, that sounds like a good plan, to flag the outliers and keep them\nin a special test set.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
