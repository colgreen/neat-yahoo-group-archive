Is the latter because of the skewing?\n\nWe think that the general strategy for this individual is to stay\naffixed to an object and sample its edge in order to spit out negative\naffinity.  Once it identifies a triangle, it trails away from it,\nthen, upon hitting an edge, spits out a constant output of 1.  So we\nthink it always spits out 0 affinities while oscillating its location,\nand always spits out 1 if it hits an edge.  We think it basically\noscillates when it identifies circles and squares, and disengages when\nit sees a triangle.\n\nIf so, it&#39;s a pretty strange strategy, but it seems to work well.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
