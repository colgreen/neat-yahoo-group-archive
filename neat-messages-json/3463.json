Is that the goal?\n\nWhat inputs are=\r\n you sending in?  Are they deterministic or stochastic \nfor each individual=\r\n who is being evaluated?  It is relevant because \nthe outputs depend on the=\r\n input.\n\nI dont know Mat Buckland&#39;s code, but I am not sure that an index \n=\r\nabove 1 is possible.  Usually, sigmoid activation functions max out \nat 1. =\r\n So your final case may never occur.\n\nYou also only assign fitness to integ=\r\ner outputs.  Neural networks \noften output numbers between zero and one.  T=\r\nherefore, it appears \nyour fitness assignment does not assign any value for=\r\n scalar values \nbetween zero and one, which may throw off your fitness assi=\r\ngnment \nscheme.  You may need to consider a continuous function that assign=\r\ns \nfitness on a sliding scale.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mridul =\r\nP &lt;p_mridul@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to compare a Reinforcement=\r\n Learning algorithm against \nNEAT, and I&#39;m trying to test NEAT in a simple =\r\ndomain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Inputs =3D 1.\n&gt; Outputs =3D 4.\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrespective of the input =\r\nvalue, the fitness is calculated by:\n&gt; \n&gt; index =3D argmax(outputs)\n&gt; if (i=\r\nndex =3D 0)\n&gt;    fitness +=3D 10\n&gt; if (index =3D 1)\n&gt;    fitness +=3D 5\n&gt; i=\r\nf (index =3D=3D 2) or (index =3D=3D 3)\n&gt;   fitness +=3D 0\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using M=\r\natt Buckland&#39;s windowsNeat code to test this, and I \nfind that the total ut=\r\nility increases to a certain point & then \ndrops. \n&gt; \n&gt; At what point can I=\r\n conclude that learning has occurred?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mridul.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n     \n&gt; \n__________________________________________________________________=\r\n____\n______________\n&gt; Get the free Yahoo! toolbar and rest assured with the=\r\n added \nsecurity of spyware protection.\n&gt; http://new.toolbar.yahoo.com/tool=\r\nbar/features/norton/index.php\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
