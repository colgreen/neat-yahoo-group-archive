For example, if i run neat on th=\r\ne same problem on different computers at the same time, the results each wi=\r\nll produce, will not be genetically compatible , is that correct? Because i=\r\nf one computer names link node139-&gt;node293 as gene #422, another may name i=\r\nt as gene #12102. So, in order to run neat, say, on 3 computers, I will hav=\r\ne to change the function that generates innovation number:\n//Return last in=\r\nnovation number in Genome\ndouble Genome::get_last_gene_innovnum() {\n  retur=\r\nn ((*(genes.rbegin()))-&gt;innovation_num)+1;\n}\nto shared among all computers =\r\nand give a unique innovation number for any computer in the set.\nI am corre=\r\nct?\n\nThanks to all in advance.\n\n\n\n"}}
