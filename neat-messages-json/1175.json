I&#39;ll have to \nmanually reduce the current (bogus) maximum in order to make use of it, \nthough.  The current maximum was before I fixed a bug in the fitness \nevaluator that was converting errors to integers when it wasn&#39;t supposed to. \n  Oops...\n\n&gt;Also, a fitness over generations graph would be great though it would take \n&gt;extra effort.\n\nI&#39;ve added code to track the fitness from generation to generation so I can \ngenerate the graph.  And I&#39;ve downloaded a perl module for generating the \ngraph itself.  Once I have enough data to actually graph something, I&#39;ll \nbuild that.\n\nAnd in another e-mail, Ken wrote:\n\n&gt;Can you explain a little about the graph...\n\nSure.  Each gray vertical bar is one fitness value.  Height represents \nrelative fitness.  The shortest bar (1 pixel) represents the worst fitness \nof any network in the population, and the top (200) represents the best \nfitness in the population.  The networks are grouped by topology, in the \norder in which they were created (older topologies first).  The wider, \ndarker bar represents the average for all the members of the topology \n(species).\n\nNote how the graph is mostly flat near the top except for a few scattered \nexceptions?  That is an indicator that something isn&#39;t quite right...most of \nthe networks have nearly the same fitness, but a few are WILDLY bad.  Those \nexceptions artificially increase the dynamic range of the graph, hiding the \nreal dynamic range of the results.  My guess as to where those bad networks \ncome from is the min/max weight values used when creating all-new weights, \nas opposed to minor tweaks.  It would create a new weight between min and \nmax.  But min/max might be way off from what is actually appropriate, \nbecause once min/max goes up, it never goes back down.  So I changed that... \n  I re-calculate the min/max weight values with each generation based on \nactual min/max connection weights.  And I only look at the connections of \nthose networks that scored better than average for their topology.\n\nAnd that&#39;s the other thing I added:  Before, there was a chance that a \nreally unfit network might breed.  No longer.  I now only include networks \nthat are higher than the average for consideration for breeding.\n\nThe hope is that between those two changes, the dynamic range might actually \nscale back a bit so we can actually see the variance between the specimens.  \nIf not, then I&#39;ll probably choose a different graph layout.\n\n&gt;I think it would be great to have a\n&gt;graph of generational average fitnesses, or better max fitnesses.\n\nI figured I&#39;d do a combination of the two.  Typical non-peak fitnesses in \none color, new max values in another color that makes them stand out, so you \ncan see whenever it makes a forward motion.  But at this point, it&#39;s not \nmaking much progress.  It&#39;s still in the &#39;not much better than random&#39; \nstage.  It&#39;ll take some time for the random fluctuations in fitness to keep \nfrom making it look like it is improving, so that current topologies die \nout.\n\n\n\n"}}
