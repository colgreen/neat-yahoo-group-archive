But since it&#39;s not going to work with distributed NEAT\n&gt;and also if say you load a seed population that already has matching\n&gt;connections. I think I will have to do as you say - and maybe try and\n&gt;maintain innovation numbers across the population as well if I can.\n\nHere&#39;s a thought...  Why give connections a unique innovation number at all? \n  Why not assign their unique ID based on the innovation numbers of the \nnodes they connect?  If you create a new connection between nodes 253 and \n275, then the ID for the connection could be &quot;253:275&quot;.  Store the \nconnections in a hash table, and you have instant prevention of duplicates.  \nThen, even if a connection is created 10 generations later, if it connects \nthe same nodes, it&#39;s the same gene.  Even if the organism has subsequently \ngone off and formed its own species.\n\nAny reason why that wouldn&#39;t work?\n\n\n\n"}}
