I have \ncreated a new folder in the files area, in it are 3 files:\n\nneat-run-output.xml        [An example output file]\nneat-run-output.xsd        [An XML Schema Definition file that formally \ndescribes the proposed dialect]\nneat-run-output-xsd.gif   [A diagram of the XSD - hopefully a lot easier \nto understand than the raw XSD]\n\nAs I work through the C# implementation I expect to initially hard code \nthe config parameters and to output the results as XML. This then lays a \nfoundation for authoring new XSLTs (and perhaps modifying existing ones) \nto create some nice reports and SVG diagrams.\n\n\nIf you look through these files you will see that I have retained the \nconfig data but I  have made it optional. This gives the opportunity for \nan XML saving routine to output this data if you want to - I think it&#39;s \nquite useful to have this at the top of an output file so that it can \neasily be seen which domain, config parameters, etc where used to \ngenerate the output file.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
