For\n&gt; example, A-B-Z and A-C-Z \n&gt; where C and B are siblings.  The only way you could\n&gt; construct such a network \n&gt; with this approach is to support removing nodes\n&gt; and/or connections.\n\nI&#39;m pretty sure that the A-B-Z and A-C-Z could evolve\njust fine.  They just have to come from both mutation\nand crossover not strictly mutation of one individual.\n\nI have been working on an implementation of NEAT in\npython.  It tracks uniqueness of structural\ninnovations from start to finish.  \n\nWhen a new node is added via mutation it is assigned\nan id based on the connection it split.  If that\nconnection has been split previously the new node gets\nthe same id as the last time it was split.  If the\nconnection hasn&#39;t been split before the next\nsequentially available node id is used.\n\nWhen a new connection is added it checks to see if a\nconnection between the chosen endpoints has been made\nbefore, the same innovation number is used, if no prio\nconnection between the endpoints has been made, the\nnext sequentially available innovation number is used.\n\nThe implementation checkpoints the entire state of the\nevolutionary process every N generations and can be\nrestarted from any checkpoint.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how my handling of new structure relates\nto the ongoing discussion exactly but it may be of use\nto someone.\n\nThis isn&#39;t a finished product but it works reasonably\nwell.   \n\nThe code can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.wooleyrhino.com/pyn.html\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
