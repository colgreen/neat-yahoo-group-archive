It took me a long time to hunt the bug down, because the effect was\ninter-generational.  I just noticed that my ANNs would start off capable of beating a random\nopponent and then rapidly descend to lose ALL games, including those versus random.  OMG, that was\nconfusing.\n\nMy problem ended up being I had done a *shallow* copy of my weight values array so the parent\nplayer and child player were referring to the same array.  So, when the child&#39;s weight array was\nmutated, the parent&#39;s changed as well (and of course should not have) due to the shallow copy. \nThis subtle little bug wasted an enormous amount of time.\n\nWell, I say wasted.  I went through all of my code from top to bottom so many times and ended up\nfinding a number of small bugs, errors and time wasters.  Additionally, I built a bunch of test\ncases and a great report output mechanism so I could try and find the problem.  So, it was\nmarginally wasteful.  I just would have preferred to have done all that other work AFTER I had\ngotten some results.\n\nI did eventually find the bug after spending both weeks of my Christmas/New Years vacation hunting\nfor it (10+ hours a day).  And when I did, I realized the many gigabytes of data I had accumulated\nwas completely useless.  So I dumped, restarted and my ANNs finally learned.  YAY!\n\nI think it is just part of the learning process - slow but sure progress in moving towards the\ngoal!  :^)  And the lesson I learned is how much JUnit ROCKS in allowing one to automatedly\nvalidate an enormous number of conditions after a small change!  :^)\n\nGood luck on your next round.\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- John Arrowwood &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I can&#39;t believe I forgot that critical step...\n&gt; \n&gt; And I told myself... &quot;Don&#39;t forget to update the variable inputs inside the \n&gt; evaluation loop...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But when I went in to add some code to weight the errors more heavily closer \n&gt; to the center and less towards the outside, I was quite amazed to find that \n&gt; the code for doing that wasn&#39;t there...I can&#39;t believe I did that!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; So, the last 500+ generations are a total loss.  All it was learning to do \n&gt; is take the average of all the inputs.  Which it was definitely learning to \n&gt; do!  That&#39;s why it leveled out at 50%!  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, yeah, turns out there was a major problem with my fitness sharing \n&gt; calculations, too.  That&#39;s fixed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, so I&#39;m back at square one.  But now I actually stand a chance of \n&gt; accomplishing what I set out to accomplish.  *sigh*\n&gt; \n&gt; As for Colin and Ian, the auto-client-update code was still broken.  I fixed \n&gt; (and tested) it now, but it&#39;s too late for your copy.  Please update the \n&gt; client like so:\n&gt; \n&gt; $ rm get_latest.sh\n&gt; $ wget http://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/iex_client/get_latest.sh\n&gt; $ chmod 755 ./get_latest.sh\n&gt; $ ./get_latest.sh\n&gt; $ ./iex_client.sh\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!  And thanks again for your donations of CPU time!\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
