I was\n&gt; curious what&#39;s in the update?\n\nNothing major, I don&#39;t even remember what it was ;)  \n\nOh, now I recall, I had to change the way I find a innovation because I \nused to keep innovation in an unsorted list which meant that finding \nmatching innovations was a case of searching unsorted lists O(m * n). \nWhen I tried with LARGE genotypes, the process became very expensive, so \nI changed the innovation list to a sorted list so I could match them in O\n(m * ln(n)) instead.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t improve the performance of neat, nor does it speed up the \nregular cases of neat (where m and n are small). But for large very \ngenotypes, it&#39;s a good speed increase.\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
