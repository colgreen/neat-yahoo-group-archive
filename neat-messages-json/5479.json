Additionally, methods from\ncomputational intelligence promise to have a big impact on game\ntechnology and development, assisting designers and developers and\nenabling new types of computer games.\n\nThe 2011 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games\nbrings together leading researchers and practitioners from academia\nand industry to discuss recent advances and explore future directions\nin this quickly moving field.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n   * Learning in games\n   * Coevolution in games\n   * Neural-based approaches for games\n   * Fuzzy-based approaches for games\n   * Player/Opponent modeling in games\n   * CI/AI-based game design\n   * Multi-agent and multi-strategy learning\n   * Applications of game theory\n   * CI for Player Affective Modeling\n   * Intelligent Interactive Narrative\n   * Imperfect information and non-deterministic games\n   * Player satisfaction and experience in games\n   * Theoretical or empirical analysis of CI techniques for games\n   * Comparative studies and game-based benchmarking\n   * Computational and artificial intelligence in:\n         o Video games\n         o Board and card games\n         o Economic or mathematical games\n         o Serious games\n         o Augmented and mixed-reality games\n         o Games for mobile platforms\n\nThe conference will consist of a single track of oral presentations,\ntutorial and workshop/special sessions, and live competitions. The\nproceedings will be placed in IEEE Xplore, and made freely available\non the conference website after the conference.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\nTutorial and special session proposal deadline: March 15, 2011\nPaper submission deadline: March 30, 2011 -- extended!\nDecision notification: May 15, 2011\nCamera-ready submission: June 15, 2011\nConference dates: August 31-September 3, 2011\n\nGeneral Chair : Sung-Bae Cho\nProgram Co-Chairs: Simon Lucas and Phllip Hingston\nCompetitions Chair: Julian Togelius\nPublicity Chair: Clare Bates Congdon\nProceedings Chair: Mike Preuss\nTutorials and special sessions chair: Georgios Yannakakis\nLocal Chairs: Kyung-Joong Kim, Kyu-Baek Hwang, Eun-Youn Kim\n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark\nmail: julian@..., web: http://julian.togelius.com\nmobile: +46-705-192088, office: +45-7218-5277\n\n"}}
