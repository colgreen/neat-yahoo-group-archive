One thing I started\nto question when working on this was whether the actual cards you had\nmattered so much as did their relationship to each other.  I think\ncodifying the cards well is obviously part of the trick.  But at any\nrate, I still wonder if there isn&#39;t a formula (albeit a potentially\nmessy one) that would give an approximation of the &quot;goodness&quot; of a\nhand at any given stage.  Maybe we need a neural net to do that :)\n(half joking).\n\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t really see much in terms of an actual poker engine for this.\n&gt;  &gt; How did you run hand simulations?\n&gt;  &gt;\n\nno, as I said I didn&#39;t actually do much in terms of poker in my code.\nI did a lot of whiteboarding.  I did play with the eval engine but\nthere&#39;s nothing relating to that in what i posted.\n\nregards,\n\njeff\n\n-- \n...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\ninteresting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\nin, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\nwell, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\nidea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\ngradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\nhanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\nbecause this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\nin it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\nthink this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n\n-- Douglas Adams\n\n"}}
