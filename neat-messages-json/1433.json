Actually I think you answered this question yourself in your\n&gt;&gt;response to John -  crossover. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, this still doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  How are you handling\n&gt;crossover?  ANJI works as the original NEAT paper described--when two\n&gt;individuals mate, the topology of the fitter individual is used, while\n&gt;weight values for common connections have a 50/50 chance of coming\n&gt;from either parent.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs far as I can remember this is what SharpNEAT is doing - taking all of \nthe excess and disjoint genes from the fittest parent. However, (wait \nfor it) I just had a quick look at the code and it /looks/ like it might \nactually be taking excess and disjoint genes from *both* parents. I&#39;ll \nhave to investigate further &#39;cause that bit of code is a bit fidly and \nrequires a clear head to debug, but it seems that your suspicions may be \nwell founded!\n\nThis could well be the source of the ongoing disagreements about bloat, \nand how much of a problem it is.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
