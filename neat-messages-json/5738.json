Understanding the delphi example is touch alread=\r\ny, doing it again in C++ would be a disaster for me.\n\nI have a problem that=\r\n has 4x14 2D matrix filled with 14  balls (14 different colors), each with =\r\nother attributes e.g. numbers printed on it, color of font, colored dots on=\r\n it etc. (actually the problem is more complicated with other attributes). =\r\n The same ball can appear more than once, some slot may be emptied, and the=\r\n matrix depth is dynamic(varies and may be smaller than 14 rows) in trainin=\r\ng sets.\n\nThis is not a lottery problem, but an analogy that is easier to un=\r\nderstand.\n\nThe problem is kind of seek and hide of result placed in the mat=\r\nrix, of course everyone can see the result on the matrix, but complicated t=\r\no pick as the matrix is partially filled with all sort of colored balls.\n\n\n=\r\nThe problem is kind of seek and hide of color balls, that is result being p=\r\nlaced in the matrix with some pattern of unfilled slot, and hotspot slot th=\r\nat everyone can see.  The first thinking is similar to tic-tac-toe and pred=\r\nator/prey. \n\nThe tic-tac-toe being programmed with no training sets, I dont=\r\n know how to implement neural network type problem (training sets, predict =\r\nresult type problem) using existing program codes (worse, delphi version di=\r\nd not implement tic-tac-toe example, I dont know why, thats another hurdle =\r\nthat I have to overcome).\n\nWould appreciate very much  anyone pointing me a=\r\n direction.\n\nJimmy\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, adeleh ebrahimi &lt;adlh_e=\r\nbrahimi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Drew,\n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt; \n&gt; I chose Mr. Bookland book j=\r\nust because of its easy and simple codes, but I am working in the area of &=\r\n#65533;&quot;Games&quot;, and I think Bookland implementation is &#65533;not a proper=\r\n choice.\n&gt; &#65533;I want to implement my project with &#65533;a Visual Pro=\r\ngramming language, maybe &quot;C#&quot;!, but As I said I do not have enough experien=\r\nce in C# and I could not understand some of C# codes of NEAT implementation=\r\n.

If you&#39;re particular about sticking with his implementation a=\r\nnd C++ (his is a relatively simple implementation of NEAT from what I under=\r\nstand) I can send you my code if you want (buggy work in progress).&#65533;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s not a simple example at all (competitive coevolution), but it wo=\r\nuld give you some code examples and bug fixes to Mat Buckland&#39;s original im=\r\nplementation (mine is a Linux port). Probably only useful to you for lookin=\r\ng at the changes I made to Mr. Buckland&#39;s code, but that would be easy as m=\r\nost of the code is the same, and the classes retained their names from thos=\r\ne described in his book.&#65533;\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to start with getting =\r\nhis minesweeper (was that it?) example application running, and try putting=\r\n in some of the bug fixes folks have recommended in his implementation (I t=\r\nhink I can help find those). Once you have that working, you might want to =\r\ntry the XOR test, and perhaps pole balancing. I believe those are common ta=\r\nsks to undertake.&#65533;\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know if you want any code, or have an=\r\ny questions I might be able to help with. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m far from a NEAT gu=\r\nru, but I don&#39;t think too many folks are working with Mat Buckland&#39;s implem=\r\nentation now. I think that&#39;s a great book, and that chapter helped me consi=\r\nderably in getting started working with NEAT.&#65533;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Drew\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 2:01 AM, adeleh ebrahimi &lt;adlh_ebrahimi@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&#65533; \n&gt; &gt;Hi everybody\n&gt; &gt;I am new in learning NEAT.
