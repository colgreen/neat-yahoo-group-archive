I \nenjoyed\n&gt; &gt;  having the oppo=\r\nrtunity to ask my question to such illustrious\n&gt; &gt;  scientists, but like yo=\r\nu, I was kind of disappointed with their\n&gt; &gt;  answers. Like you said, they =\r\nsort of answered accurately, but \nthere\n&gt; &gt;  was no real insight or thought=\r\nfulness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  It&#39;s interesting that you point out thi=\r\ns exchange because I \nthink it\n&gt; &gt;  highlights a weakness in how biologists=\r\n have been dealing with \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  question of complexity. It&#39;s such a funda=\r\nmental question yet it\n&gt; &gt;  hasn&#39;t really received the treatment it deserve=\r\ns, even from the\n&gt; &gt;  field&#39;s luminaries. I think part of the problem is th=\r\nat a genuine\n&gt; &gt;  treatment requires a kind of algorithmic and representati=\r\nonal \ntheory,\n&gt; &gt;  which is perhaps better attacked from a computational \np=\r\nerspective,\n&gt; &gt;  putting evolutionary computation researchers at an advanta=\r\nge \nbecause\n&gt; &gt;  we think about search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc. \nr=\r\noutinely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I think you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably come a=\r\nt the\n&gt; problem from an angle that might be more productive, but I&#39;m\n&gt; espe=\r\ncially disappointed in Wolpert, who was the main voice for\n&gt; developmental =\r\nbiology on the panel. Your question gets to issues \nthat\n&gt; a developmental =\r\nbiologist should primarily be interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have sp=\r\necific insights related to the development \nof\n&gt; the human brain, he should=\r\n have been able to give other examples \nwith\n&gt; which he was more familiar.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A small step \nfo=\r\nr\n&gt; the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical\n&gt; expan=\r\nsion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.science=\r\ndirect.com/science?_ob=3DArticleURL&_udi=3DB6T0V-\n3Y6PFXS-\n1P&_user=3D10&_r=\r\ndoc=3D1&_fmt=3D&_orig=3Dsearch&_sort=3Dd&view=3Dc&_acct=3DC000050221\n&_vers=\r\nion=3D1&_urlVersion=3D0&_userid=3D10&md5=3D4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\ne4=\r\n3\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; The more than 1000-fold increase in the co=\r\nrtical surface without a\n&gt; comparable increase in its thickness during mamm=\r\nalian evolution is\n&gt; explained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis=\r\n of cortical\n&gt; development. According to the proposed model, cortical expan=\r\nsion is\n&gt; the result of changes in proliferation kinetics that increase the=\r\n\n&gt; number of radial columnar units without changing the number of \nneurons\n=\r\n&gt; within each unit significantly. Thus, mutation of a regulatory gene\n(s)\n&gt;=\r\n that controls the timing and ratio of symmetric and asymmetric modes\n&gt; of =\r\ncell divisions in the proliferative zone, coupled with radial\n&gt; constraints=\r\n in the distribution of migrating neurons, could create \nan\n&gt; expanded cort=\r\nical plate with enhanced capacity for establishing new\n&gt; patterns of connec=\r\ntivity that are validated through natural \nselection.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m personally w=\r\norking under the assumption that the cortical\n&gt; minicolumn is the primary m=\r\nodule, that repeatable bit of code that\n&gt; Dawkins talked about, and there a=\r\nre a number of good work by\n&gt; biologists out there, including Rakic, who gi=\r\nve support to such an\n&gt; idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Perhaps they were just being curt or =\r\ndid not take the audience\n&gt; &gt;  seriously enough to elaborate their thoughts=\r\n. Yet I find that\n&gt; &gt;  explanation doubtful given that we were after all at=\r\n a &quot;debate&quot; \nabout\n&gt; &gt;  evolution and complexity, which is precisely the su=\r\nbstance of my\n&gt; &gt;  question. I also agree that Dawkins seemed closest to re=\r\nally\n&gt; &gt;  thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would be very interested =\r\n\nin\n&gt; &gt;  our area of EC if only there was an opportunity to tell him about\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of experience with it\n&gt; &gt;  b=\r\neyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess you didn&#39;t have a chance =\r\nto corner him and talk things over?\n&gt; :) Dawkins does seem like he would be=\r\n interested in a lot of the \nwork\n&gt; being presented at GECCO. Did he just s=\r\nhow up for the panel, or was \nhe\n&gt; around the conference at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; I was=\r\n also thought the other really interesting exchange was at \n33:45\n&gt; in the =\r\nvideo, when the question of whether or not you could evolve a\n&gt; mouse with =\r\nfeathered wings came up, and Wolpert and Jones both said\n&gt; no, while Dawkin=\r\ns seemed to say probably not, but not for any of the\n&gt; reasons the other gu=\r\nys came up with.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
