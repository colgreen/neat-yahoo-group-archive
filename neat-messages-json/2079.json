All I really mean is that all rotations and transforms of a board\n&gt; &gt;are actually identical and have the same correct move.  So there is no need\n&gt; &gt;for your net to learn them each separately.  I&#39;ve need doing to analysis of\n&gt; &gt;TTT and to avoid processing identical boards twice I&#39;ve simply:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1) define each board as a base-3 code number (top-left is first digit,\n&gt; &gt;top-middle is second..., empty = 0, cross = 1, naught = 2)\n&gt; &gt;2) when a board appears calculate than number for each of its 8 transforms\n&gt; &gt;3) then file and process the board only under the _lowest_ of those codes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m having trouble decoding your english, I think your brain is working\n&gt;faster than you can type :) I get the essence of what you&#39;re suggesting,\n&gt;I suppose it&#39;s a little like the ego-centric agent idea where you\n&gt;effectively reduce the number of input signal combinations by ensuring\n&gt;that the agent is always oriented in a certain way with respect to some\n&gt;object of interest. Here you are collapsing the complete set of possible\n&gt;board states into a more compact set that still represents the same\n&gt;number of strategic states.\n\nExactly.\n\n&gt;Actually if this concept could be applied to\n&gt;the &#39;Go&#39; board state then we might have the basis of a real advance in\n&gt;AI Go playing - something of a holy grail.\n\nIt can be applied to Go, but I think it helps a _lot_ less than you \nimagine.  e.g. there are somewhere in the region of 2^350 Go board configs \nand this reduces it by a bit under 8 fold....  Now if we could exploit the \ntranslation and rotation of _parts_ of the Go board...\n\n&gt; &gt;So the simplest way I would remove mirroring and rotation from a network&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;consideration would be just to do the same thing.  Always transform the\n&gt; &gt;board to its lowest coded variant before showing it to the network.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;This idea sounds vaguely like a technique used in designing logic\n&gt;circuits or something. I almost get it but I think I need to absorb some\n&gt;concrete examples.\n\nOK, lets look at a 2x2 board.  There are four cells, which we can label \nwith letters:\n\na b\nc d\n\nAnd each cell has a value 0 (empty), 1(X) or 2 (O) these values are \nunrelated to ANN input values...\n\nAny board can be encoded as a base-3 number using a function:\n\nCode = a + 3 * b * 9 * c + 27 * d\n\nSo an empty board has a code of zero, and\n\nX _\n_ _  = 1\n\n_ X\n_ _ = 3\n\n_ _\nO _ = 18\n\netc etc.\n\nSo, to find a &quot;canonical&quot; form for any board, all we do is calculate this \nvalue for every flip/rotate of the board and then choose the one with the \nlowest code.\n\nSo, for this:\n\nX O\n_ O = 33\n\n_ X\nO O = 65\n\nO _\nO X = 47\n\nO O\nX _ = 17\n\nX _\nO O = 63\n\n_ O\nX O = 69\n\nO O\n_ X = 35\n\nO X\nO _ = 23\n\nSo code:17 is chosen to represent all of these boards and networks which \nare about to be presented with any board in this set actually gets shown \nthat one.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t matter how you select the canonical board, any consistent \napproach will do.  Obviously there may be some benefit to the networks if \nthe boards are chosen with some sort of systematic approach and for that \nthis way is quite good, because it is equivalent to attempting to place as \nthe filled squares first at the top, and then on the right.  You can even \ntweak the encoding to give even more geometric choices, as long as no \nambiguities (boards with the same code) are introduced.\n\nIn practise, you might want to encode using 0 (empty), 1 (me), 2 (him) and \n-1 might be better for the last case so that enemy pieces tend to get \nsorted to the opposite corner.\n\n         Ian\n\n &gt;&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n &gt;I bet I can get there before you... 2mins :)\n\nThe milestone for delivery of the future has been put back again.\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
