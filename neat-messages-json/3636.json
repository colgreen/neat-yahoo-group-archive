This \nusually =\r\nrepresents the best &quot;knowledge&quot; to date, a product of user \nexperience or p=\r\nrior evolutionary runs. The ability to start a NEAT \nevolution with best &quot;k=\r\nnowledge&quot; to date is profoundly more effective \nas a consequence of not &quot;re=\r\ninventing-the-wheel&quot; each run, and is \nbeneficial to the user as evidenced =\r\nby useful results sooner.\n\nThe example is comprised of (1) input bias node =\r\nand (8) output nodes, \nthe values of which are used in the fitness determin=\r\nation. This \nparameter estimation problem is utilized to demonstrate a mini=\r\nmalist \napproach to this class of problems, but does not represent a \nlimit=\r\nation of the approach to the more general (x) input and (y) \noutput problem=\r\ns.\n\nThe procedure is the determination of connection weights between the \ns=\r\ningle bias node to each of the (8) output nodes, such that the \nnetwork act=\r\nivation will result in each of the output&#39;s activation \ncorresponding to th=\r\ne normalized version of the desired starting \noutput.\n\na) The Start, Max an=\r\nd Min values of each output are normalized to \nwithin the range of 0 to 1 (=\r\nor 0.1 & 0.9, etc.).\nb) For the selected bias value (usually 1.0), solve fo=\r\nr the weight \nvalue such that fsigmoid of the product of bias x weight is e=\r\nqual to \nthe normalized value of Start.\nc) Perform (a) and (b) above for ea=\r\nch output.\n\nFor a bias value of 1.0, Normalize_min =3D 0.1 and Normalize_ma=\r\nx =3D 0.9:\n\nInput\tStart\tMax\tMin\tWeight\n1\t37.8\t50.0\t22.5\t0.0367272\n2\t2.8\t10.=\r\n0\t0.01\t-0.149887\n3\t60\t500.0\t0.5\t-0.287548\n4\t0.072\t1.0\t0.001\t-0.341533\n5\t28.=\r\n1\t35.0\t0.1\t0.214351\n6\t79.44\t100.0\t0.1\t0.207536\n7\t52.33\t100.0\t0.5\t0.0135897\n=\r\n8\t52.33\t100.0\t0.5\t0.0135897\n\nThe corresponding start genome would be:\n\ngeno=\r\nmestart 1\ntrait 1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\ntrait 2 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\ntrait 3 0.3 0=\r\n 0 0 0 0 0 0\nnode 1 0 1 3\nnode 2 0 0 2\nnode 3 0 0 2\nnode 4 0 0 2\nnode 5 0 0=\r\n 2\nnode 6 0 0 2\nnode 7 0 0 2\nnode 8 0 0 2\nnode 9 0 0 2\ngene 3 1 2  0.036727=\r\n2 0 1 0 1\ngene 3 1 3 -0.149887  0 2 0 1\ngene 3 1 4 -0.287548  0 3 0 1\ngene =\r\n3 1 5 -0.341533  0 1 0 1\ngene 3 1 6  0.214351  0 2 0 1\ngene 3 1 7  0.207536=\r\n  0 3 0 1\ngene 3 1 8  0.0135897 0 1 0 1\ngene 3 1 9  0.0135897 0 2 0 1\ngenom=\r\neend 1\n\nFor the more general problem of (x) inputs and (y) outputs:\ni) # In=\r\nputs equals (x) + (1) bias, where all (x) inputs are left \nunconnected.\nii)=\r\n # Outputs equals (y).\niii) # weights equals (x), each from the single bias=\r\n node to each of \nthe output nodes respectively.\niv) Procedure for determin=\r\nation of start genome weight values is same \nas above.\n\nIt is required that=\r\n the same normalization methodology utilized in \nthe above procedure is emb=\r\nedded in the corresponding Experiment \nfitness method.\n\n\n\n"}}
