There are definitely conferences in the states, as well\nas journals, if you are interested.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t specifically remember trying the &quot;discrimination between complex\n&gt; non-solid shapes&quot; experiments without incremental scaling, however I seem to\n&gt; remember per-generation performance being much better when starting with a\n&gt; higher resolution (but despite this the use of scaling reduced the total\n&gt; run-time of the experiments). I suppose that at higher resolutions the\n&gt; (representation of the) shapes become increasingly different (up to a point\n&gt; depending on the similarity and complexity of the images, anyway) and so it&#39;s\n&gt; easier to evolve a function that can differentiate between them.\n\nInteresting. Thanks.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t know how I forgot the 3D representation experiment you performed; I\n&gt; read that paper (at least once), but I guess some time before I wrote my\n&gt; thesis! I just had another look at it, and am wondering what the results would\n&gt; have been like for:\n&gt;  * differently engineered 3D representations, eg the &quot;The HipIO joint was\n&gt; placed just below the HipFB joint in the Z dimension&quot;, what would have\n&gt; happened if these were more widely separated?, and\n\nThat would be interesting to try. There were so many different ways to\nengineer 1D, 2D, and 3D representations that we did not have the time to try\nthem all. My code is available, however, so if you want to try your\nsuggestion that would be great. If you do, I&#39;d enjoy hearing how it goes.\n\n&gt;  * randomised 3D representations.\n\nWe did do this. The results are in the paper in figure 6 (black vs. blue):\nthe 3D engineered representation significantly outperformed the 3D\nrandomized representation.\n\n&gt; Did you perform any other experiments (in large or small numbers) using 3D\n&gt; representations? This is an area I&#39;d like to explore some more.\n\nNo. In fact, I originally expected the 3D to outperform 2D (which it did not\nsignificantly do), so I think it would be interesting to try different 3D\nrepresentations and find out if I just happened to choose a poor one. Please\nlet us know if you do conduct such tests.\n\nCongrats again on the great work.\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Laboratory\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n**Call for papers!
