Perhaps it would be interesting if the NEAT core could\nbe used from languages and platforms other than those already supported\nthough NEAT ports (for example Smalltalk) without having to endure a new\nNEAT port. I was wondering if NEAT could work in a client-server scheme with\nthe NEAT &quot;engine&quot; being the server and the client managing the experiments.\nSo far a command-line NEAT seems close to this and sounds good to me ;-)\n\nI was asking if a client-server approach would be possible because as ken\npointed out there may be some complications.\n\nBest Regards.\n\nGV\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 30, 2004 7:36 PM\nSubject: Re: [neat] Command-line NEAT\n\n\n&gt; &gt;From: German Viscuso &lt;netquake@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So perhaps it would be better to have NEAT acting as a TCP server, define\na\n&gt; &gt;communication protocol and then connect with your client of choice (from\n&gt; &gt;any\n&gt; &gt;platform). Would it be possible/desirable ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Depends on what you mean.  Yes, I could make some complicated application\n&gt; for managing connections and stuff.  But why?  A simple CGI script is far\n&gt; easier.  And just as effective.  I would still be able to have a client of\n&gt; choice.  But the communication protocol then is already defined...http.\nAnd\n&gt; then I can leverage existing http communication libraries.\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason for the command-line version of NEAT is specifically to support\n&gt; that mode of operation.  A CGI script only lives for the duration of the\n&gt; request.  So, state of the experiment will have to be maintained on disk.\n&gt; That&#39;s easy enough.  And once it&#39;s ready, just hand it to NEAT to do the\n&gt; evolutionary part.  Clean, simple, effective. :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
