It addresses the big \nassumption =\r\nthat symmetry is beneficial to a lot of cognitive \nprocessing.  By making s=\r\nymmetry explicity, I think it allows you to \nget to the heart of the matter=\r\n.  It also does a really good job of \nfitting NEAT into the context of your=\r\n cognitive science program.\n\nI&#39;m a little unsure if I&#39;m covering all the po=\r\nssibilities properly \nin my mind. I think a few activation examples might h=\r\nelp make it \nconcrete.  For example, what if I made a network with just one=\r\n \nsymmetric input and the none asymmetric output?  Is that different \nfrom =\r\na network with an asymmetric input and an asymmetric output?  \nHow do you r=\r\nead a symmetric output?  Is it interpreted as two \noutputs?\n\nSomething that=\r\n would be a great debugging tool is a visualization \nthat shows the transla=\r\ntion from the specially-encoded network to its \nnormal graph (i.e. two side=\r\n-by-side pictures).  In the second \npicture, &quot;symmetric&quot; pieces would now b=\r\ne (I assume) pairs of \nstructures, one on each side.  Then maybe you could =\r\nsee the \ncontralateral crossing visually, among other things.  But it would=\r\n \nalso make sure that the system means what you think it means.\n\nI once had=\r\n a different idea about symmetry in NEAT, which was to \ntake a NEAT network=\r\n that is &quot;one-sided&quot; and reflect the entire \nnetwork (with the reflection h=\r\naving all new historical markings), \nand then concatenate the two networks =\r\n(the original and its \nreflection) into one genome.  By &quot;one-sided&quot; I mean =\r\nthose irritating \nbots that tend to only do thing by turning way way or ano=\r\nther (or \nthings like that).   What I was wondering is whether once NEAT \nd=\r\niscovers a one-sided strategy, it can be fairly easily duplicated \non the o=\r\nther side with little difficulty.\n\nOf course I can see problems there.  It =\r\ncould create an \nunintentional opponent process that causes the network to =\r\nfight with \nitself in some cases and end up doing nothing.  The failure cas=\r\nes \ncan be subtle and hard to visualize, but I think that&#39;s true in your \na=\r\npproach as well, which is why I bring this up.  What I&#39;m wondering \nis whet=\r\nher what you&#39;re doing better avoids the potentially sloppy ad-\nhocness of m=\r\ny idea.  I&#39;m also wondering what you see as the pluses \nand minuses in gene=\r\nral, since you&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot \nrecently.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;m su=\r\nre I&#39;ll have more thoughts but hearing more about \nactivating your networks=\r\n would give me a better intuitive \nunderstanding.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Just tho=\r\nught I&#39;d post an update on what Philip and I have been \nworking on\n&gt; lately=\r\n, to get some feedback, but also to help me articulate the\n&gt; implementation=\r\n and some of the ideas behind it (since I&#39;m in grad \nschool now\n&gt; and will =\r\nhave to explain this to a lot of people soon anyway).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have to =\r\ndo a first year project as part of the PhD program I&#39;m \nin right\n&gt; now, Cog=\r\nnitive Science at the University of Louisiana at \nLafayette.  I\n&gt; decided t=\r\no focus on a particular aspect of indirect encoding in \nthe context\n&gt; of NE=\r\nAT, specifically bilateral symmetry.  Most animals exhibit a \nhigh\n&gt; degree=\r\n of bilateral symmetry in their overall body plan, as well \nas their\n&gt; neur=\r\nal systems.  It seemed like a logical starting point for a \nforay into\n&gt; in=\r\ndirect encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;m interested in several theoretical q=\r\nuestions:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To what extent is bilateral symmetry in an agent&#39;s neu=\r\nral system \nnecessary?\n&gt; \n&gt; And for what kinds of cognitive tasks?\n&gt; \n&gt; To =\r\nwhat extent is contralateral connectivity (connections which \ncross the\n&gt; m=\r\nidline of the neural system, i.e., are interhemispheric) \nimportant, as\n&gt; o=\r\npposed to ipsilateral connectivity (connections which do not \ncross the\n&gt; m=\r\nidline, i.e., are intrahemispheric)?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To try to start answering s=\r\nome of these questions, we extended \nNEAT in the\n&gt; following ways:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Before, the experimenter would declare the number of input and \noutput u=\r\nnits.\n&gt; Now there are four parameters:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; inputs.asymmetrical\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\noutputs.asymetrical\n&gt; \n&gt; inputs.symmetrical\n&gt; \n&gt; outputs.symmetrical\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll use XOR as a running example.  To simply run XOR as before, \nthe\n=\r\n&gt; experimenter would declare 3 asymmetrical inputs (for the two data \ninput=\r\ns\n&gt; and the bias), and one asymmetrical output.  Per the NEAT \nparadigm, th=\r\ney\n&gt; would initially be fully-connected with feedforward connections, \nall =\r\nwith\n&gt; different random initial weights.  Everything else would work as \nbe=\r\nfore.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To run XOR under a symmetrical condition, the experimenter=\r\n would \ndeclare 1\n&gt; asymmetrical input (bias), 1 symmetrical input (for the=\r\n 2 data \ninputs), and\n&gt; 1 asymetrical output. Let&#39;s call the asymmetrical i=\r\nnput, neuron 0, \nthe\n&gt; symmetrical neuron 1, and the output neuron 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; When constructing the initial network, all asymmetrical neurons \nwill=\r\n default\n&gt; to the &quot;left&quot; of the network.  So the network now has a spatial =\r\n\nstructure,\n&gt; whereas before it was arbitrary.  So neuron 0 is on on the le=\r\nft, \nalong with\n&gt; output neuron 2.  When reading the chromosome and buildin=\r\ng the \nnetwork,\n&gt; neuron 1 is split into 2 copies: 1left and 1right, with i=\r\ndentical\n&gt; attributes.  The initial network is still fully-connected feed-\n=\r\nforward, but\n&gt; there are only 2 connection genes in the intial chromosome: =\r\n\nasymmetrical\n&gt; connection 4 (which connects 0 and 2), and symmetrical conn=\r\nection \n5 (which\n&gt; connects 1 and 2).  When constructed, connection 4 makes=\r\n a single \nconnection\n&gt; with a random initial weight.  Connection 5 makes 2=\r\n connections, \n5left and\n&gt; 5right, connecting 1left to 2 and 1right to 2, a=\r\nnd both \nconnections have the\n&gt; same random initial weight.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope=\r\n that makes sense.  There are lots of ways to encode bilateral \nsymmetry.\n&gt;=\r\n We chose to make symmetry an attribute of individual genes.  It \nmay not b=\r\ne\n&gt; the most biologically-inspired encoding, but we felt that it fit \nbest =\r\nwithin\n&gt; the context of NEAT and allowed for good control over the amount \n=\r\nand type of\n&gt; symmetry in the evolving population.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So all neuron=\r\n genes now have a symmetry attribute, and all \nconnections have\n&gt; 2 new att=\r\nributes, symmetry and lateralization (indicating whether \nthey cross\n&gt; the =\r\nmidline or not).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, about mutations:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Perturb con=\r\nnection weight remains unchanged, although if it \naffects a\n&gt; symmetrical c=\r\nonnection, it will affect both copies created in the \nresulting\n&gt; network.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Add neuron basically works the same as well.  If a neuron is \nmu=\r\ntated on top\n&gt; of an existing asymmetrical connection, it creates the new n=\r\neuron \nand the\n&gt; new incoming and outgoing connections per NEAT, and all 3 =\r\nnew \nfeatures are\n&gt; asymmetric.  If the mutation occurs on top of a symmetr=\r\nic \nconnection, the\n&gt; new resulting neurons and connections will have the s=\r\name symmetry \nand\n&gt; lateralization attributes of the connection gene they r=\r\neplaced.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Add connection mutations are fairly complicated.  There=\r\n are 2 new \nmutation\n&gt; rates, which control the amount of symmetry and late=\r\nralization in \nthe newly\n&gt; mutated connections.  First, the add connection =\r\nmutation rate \ndetermines how\n&gt; many new connections should be added.  Of t=\r\nhose, the symmetry rate\n&gt; determines the ratio that are symmetric.  Of each=\r\n of those two \nratios, the\n&gt; lateralization rate determines the ratio of ne=\r\nw \ncontralateral/ipsilateral\n&gt; connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; New connections betw=\r\neen 2 asymmetrical neurons are asymmetrical.  \nNew\n&gt; connections between an=\r\n asymmetrical neuron and a symmetrical \nneuron can\n&gt; either be asymmetrical=\r\n or symmetrical.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For a mutation between 2 symmetrical neurons, t=\r\nhere are four \nactual neurons\n&gt; in the resulting network, and we allow 6 po=\r\nssible types of \nconnectivity to\n&gt; mutate:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; symmetrical/ipsilater=\r\nal    ||\n&gt; \n&gt; symmetric/contralateral    X\n&gt; \n&gt; asymmetric/ipsilateral left=\r\n   |-\n&gt; \n&gt; asymmetric/ipsilateral right   -|\n&gt; \n&gt; asymmetric/contralateral =\r\nleft  /\n&gt; \n&gt; asymmetric/contralateral right  &#92;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So by adjusting t=\r\nhe symmetry rate, we can control the amount of \nsymmetry\n&gt; that evolves amo=\r\nng new connections, and by adjusting the \nlateralization\n&gt; rate, we can con=\r\ntrol the amount of connectivity that crosses the \nmidline of\n&gt; the network.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure there are weaknesses to this encoding scheme (as I&#39;m s=\r\nure \nsome of\n&gt; you will point out...please do).  It&#39;s now nearly completely=\r\n \nimplemented in\n&gt; ANJI (though there&#39;s still a lot of testing to be done, =\r\nand we&#39;re \nnot going\n&gt; to release it yet).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m applying it to an=\r\n active vision symmetry detection task \n(discriminating\n&gt; between sets of s=\r\nymmetrical and asymmetrical letters).  I&#39;ve got \nsome\n&gt; preliminary results=\r\n, but I&#39;m not particularly confident that \neverything&#39;s\n&gt; working the way i=\r\nt&#39;s supposed to.  This testbed is nice, since it \ninvolves\n&gt; both control a=\r\nspects and pattern processing, so I&#39;m interested to \nsee if\n&gt; there are qua=\r\nlitative differences in the way symmetrically-encoded \nand\n&gt; asymmetrically=\r\n-encoded populations solve the problem (or fail to \nsolve the\n&gt; problem).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I hope to present this research at GECCO this summer, but=\r\n \nI thought\n&gt; I&#39;d expose the group to it as well and see what thoughts peop=\r\nle \nmight have.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
