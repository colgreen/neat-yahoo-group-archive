It seems like the information inherent in the =\r\nimage should include points along the black-white edge of the outer black r=\r\negion, but band pruning removes them all.  The figure explains &quot;In effect, =\r\nthe CPPN speaks a language through its pattern that denotes exactly which w=\r\neights within the hypercube should be expressed.&quot;  I am curious why &quot;langua=\r\nge&quot; is used here.  \n\nMy goal is to add iterated ES-HyperNEAT to the C++ ver=\r\nsion at https://github.com/MisterTea/HyperNEAT.  I am presently a hobbyist =\r\n(my profession is embedded software engineering) but considering to someday=\r\n pursue a PhD involving HyperNEAT, etc.\n\nThanks,\nTony Wilson\n\n\n"}}
