Hope you are doing well too.\n\nRTS games a=\r\nre very particular with respect to real-time learning via\nneuro-evolution; =\r\nnot only you interact with opponents quite rarely\n(both few opponents and f=\r\new meetings) but also real-time replacement\nmakes fitness evaluation rather=\r\n tricky. Replacement does not just\nintroduce a position for the offspring b=\r\nut a whole game state\n(buildings, warriors, resources) which might correspo=\r\nnd to a local\noptima. So, yes, I agree that game design per se has a seriou=\r\ns impact\non the performance of real-time neuro-evolution.\n\nGeorgios\n \n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Geor=\r\ngios, I hope things are well.  Thanks for sharing your paper. \n&gt; The proble=\r\nm that rtNEAT requires a high level of interaction indeed\n&gt; constrains the =\r\ntypes of scenarios in which it can be effective.  If\n&gt; the NPCs don&#39;t get e=\r\nnough interaction, the evaluation is impoverished.\n&gt;  Thus there is clearly=\r\n a challenge when a single player is the only\n&gt; focal point of interaction.=\r\n  However, if that single player is is in\n&gt; control of a set of agents, eac=\r\nh one of which is a point of\n&gt; interaction, I think there is hope that the =\r\nnet interaction can be\n&gt; sufficient.  However, the balance is delicate and =\r\nthe specifics of the\n&gt; game obviously become important.  Your paper makes a=\r\n good point by\n&gt; highlighting this issue and showing that it needs to be co=\r\nnsidered in\n&gt; the game design if real-time evolution is to be successful.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;g.yannakakis&quot; &lt;yannakakis@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I thought the following might be of interest to=\r\n some of you. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We recently presented a paper at the IEEE Computati=\r\nonal Intelligence\n&gt; &gt; and Games 2008 symposium where NEAT and rtNEAT are us=\r\ned to dynamically\n&gt; &gt; adjust the challenge level of a real-time strategy ga=\r\nme.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is the article:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.itu.dk/~yannakakis/cig08_1=\r\n.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a few words, NEAT worked just fine in generating diverse N=\r\nPC\n&gt; &gt; behaviors like &#39;win-fast&#39; and &#39;produce-maximum-numbers-of-warriors&#39;.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; rtNEAT, on the other hand did not perform that well and that fast due\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to insufficient interaction in the RTS game under investigation. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Comments and feedback are more than welcome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Georg=\r\nios\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
