I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s probably a book in there somewhere if someone had the energy\n&gt; &gt;to write it...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Wow, that&#39;s dedication! I hope you don&#39;t mind if we all start asking you\n&gt; questions on stuff we can&#39;t recall :)\n\nThe dedication was in the reading - which was fun. The technology was\na Word macro (oh, and a VB program for grabbing the messages).\n\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve played around with various domains over time (XOR, OCR and some\n&gt; &gt;simple games) but my most recent area of &quot;research&quot; has taken me back\n&gt; &gt;to an old love betting on football matches (that&#39;s soccer to our\n&gt; I&#39;m certainly interested in this, although I would imagine that the\n&gt; outcome of sporting events is even more unpredictable than financial\n&gt; markets. Having said that I see no reason to use the confidence output\n\nNo reason to use or no reason *not* to use? I was rather keen on the\nconfidence output - I thought for a while that it was going to be my\nmajor contribution - until I read the messages discussing the idea on\nthis list...\n\n&gt; technique to pick up on any patterns that do occur, even if they only\n&gt; occur rarely. Hopefully the code underlying the fitness functions for\n&gt; these types of experiments will be transferable to different domains\n&gt; relatively easilty, so I see no reason to try investigate a whole range\n&gt; of domains.\n\nUnpredictable yes, but estimation of likelihood is doable: I built an\nExcel-based model that does a fair job of calculating odds. But not\ngood enough to be consistently profitable. And I don&#39;t know that the\nmethod is actually valid because it&#39;s evolved as a population of one\nwith a mutation operator of dubious value (me).\n \n&gt; &gt;non-UK colleagues). My interest has largely been rekindled by the rise\n&gt; &gt;and rise of the betting exchanges, where the margin to be overcome is\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Have you looked at spread betting at all? It gets (or has had) bad\n&gt; press, but there&#39;s no reason you should loose a lot of money if you&#39;re\n&gt; careful and know what you&#39;re doing. Just so long as you&#39;re not prone to\n&gt; compulsive gambling :)\n\nThe problem with spread betting is the lack of useful data for testing\nagainst a profitability-based fitness function. Although simpler\nmarkets such as total goals are probably doable. For most of the\nspread markets I don&#39;t have data, or there aren&#39;t long enough\nhistories yet. I would dearly love, if only for personal amusement, to\nsee a total shirt number market traded successfully by NEAT.\n\nFor fixed-odds, however, I already have a good history of bookmakers\ncoupon odds - if a model can produce acceptable results against the\n12% bookies&#39; margin, then taking its selections to the exchanges ought\nto be a no-brainer.\n\nBut it doesn&#39;t have to be hugely profitable (although I wouldn&#39;t say\nno :-)) - it&#39;s the combination of  several areas of interest (GAs,\nNNs, simulations, programming and footie) that makes the whole thing\nfun.\n\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m currently engaged (in between tasks associated with settling in to\n&gt; &gt;a new house) in amusing myself with the consideration of various ways\n&gt; &gt;of approaching my problem domain and familiarising myself with\n&gt; &gt;existing NEAT implementations, Ken&#39;s &quot;canonical&quot; C++ and Colin&#39;s C# in\n&gt; &gt;particular. I expect to &quot;roll my own&quot; code because as a professional\n&gt; &gt;developer that&#39;s where much of the fun lies, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m in\n&gt; &gt;any hurry.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; OK well fire away if you have any questions on the C#.\n\nI&#39;m already working my way through SharpNEAT (lovely job, by the way).\nI think the sensible approach is to build the model around your code\nto start with and consider my wackier ideas later once that&#39;s all\nrunning. I&#39;ve followed the optimisation threads with great interest\n(and learned a lot) - have you come across ArithEMITic\n(http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard/archive/2004/01/24/742.aspx)? It&#39;s\nan approach that uses Reflection.Emit to compile the\nperformance-optimised code for a network on the fly. I don&#39;t claim to\nunderstand it, and I don&#39;t suppose it would enhance something like\nXOR, but larger models might benefit. Just in case you were suffering\nfrom an excess of spare time...\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike\n\n"}}
