But not =\r\nforever.  Given enough\ntime with zero inputs, the values of the network wou=\r\nld die down to\nzero, and all &#39;memory&#39; would be lost.\n\nPeople remember thing=\r\ns forever, even if they lose the ability to\nrecall it.  And if they spend t=\r\nime with zero inputs, they hallucinate.\n (which by the way can be explained=\r\n by raised sensitivity or lowered\nfiring thresholds causing the network to =\r\nreact to more subtle inputs).\n Point is, it doesn&#39;t return to zero.  And th=\r\ney have SHOWN that\nexposing a brain to stimulus causes it to grow structure=\r\n.\n\nBut biological brains aren&#39;t everything.  There are other ways of doing =\r\nthings.\n\nSo I&#39;m curious why it is you think that a fixed topology network i=\r\ns\ncapable of learning.  How would it learn?\n\n&gt; I think that would make for =\r\nan\n&gt; extremely complex brain and might even call phrenology back into vouge=\r\n\n&gt; depending on how radical the topoligical changes were :)\n\nphrenology?  O=\r\nH, that!  NOT!  \n\nThough you never know...  :)\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
