The 2013 IEEE Conference on Computational\nIntelligence and Games brings together leading researchers and\npractitioners from academia and industry to discuss recent advances\nand explore future directions in this field. The financial support of\nthe IEEE Computational Intelligence Society is pending.\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION 15 March 2013\nACCEPTANCE NOTIFICATION 15 May 2013\nCAMERA READY SUBMISSION 15 June 2013\nCONFERENCE START 11 August 2013\n\n\nORGANIZING COMMITTEE:\n\nGeneral Chair:  Dan Ashlock/University of Guelph\nTechnical Chairs:  Julian Togelius/IT University of Copenhagen\nGraham Kendall/University of Nottingham\nCompetitions Chair:  Philip Hingston/Edith Cowan University\nFinance Chair:  Wendy Ashlock/York University\nProceedings Chair:  Joseph Brown/University of Guelph\nTutorial Chair:  Clare Bates Congdon/University of Southern Maine\n\nGeneral Contact: dashlock@...\nContest Proposals: phi@...\nTutorial Proposals: congdon@...\n\nSUBMISSIONS:\n\nResearchers are invited to submit high quality papers on original\nresearch in the intersection of computational intelligence and games.\nComputational intelligence must play a strong role in any accepted\npapers.
