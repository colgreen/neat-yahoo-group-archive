Do you see nice smooth curves where a small change in a \n&gt;parameter means a small change in the # of needed generations, or do you \n&gt;get some big jumps?  Also, do any of the curves have multiple extrema? \n&gt;I did a series a while back with varying the mutation rate and noticed \n&gt;two local maxima, although with a single run needing a day or so, I lost \n&gt;patience with it quickly once a clearly-best rate emerged.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sounds like interesting stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Brian,\n\nI don&#39;t have any graphs but yes I did notice some smooth curves while \nadjusting some of the parameters manually and noting numbers on scraps \nof paper. For instance the meta-algorithm found that good mutation rates \nfor XOR were:\n\nMutate weights : 0.5 (Normally I use a figure above 0.9)\nAdd Node :0.0005\nAdd Connection: 0.5\n\n From this starting point I noticed a steep improvement by increasing \nthe relative rate of &#39;add node&#39;, the gain started to asymptotically \nlevel off at between 0.03 and 0.04. Adjusting the balance between weight \nmutation and &#39;add connection&#39; caused a gentle drop off in both directions.\n\nThere was probably a linear improvement in increasing the asexual \nmutation rate - ultimately this went to 1.0 and the sexual reproduction \nrate went to 0.0, which perhaps isn&#39;t surprising for a problem that \nrequires such a small network.\n\nA slightly more subtle benefit was had by tweaking the weight mutation \nscheme. The Meta-algorithm assigned a high rate to weight resetting, so \nI tried discarding weight pertubation altogether and this worked well. \nAlso the proportion of weights that are reset per mutation seems to have \na plateau between 0.1 and 0.2, higher or lower than this and the \nimprovement starts to drop off slowly.\n\nSo perhaps nothing really unexpected here, but it&#39;s nice to see \nhard(ish) facts and figures.\n\nOh and no I didn&#39;t see any multiple optimal points, but then I didn&#39;t \nperform a detailed analysis so there could well be some hiding in there \nsomewhere.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
