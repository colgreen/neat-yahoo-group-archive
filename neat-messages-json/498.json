If this problem i=\r\ns not addressed in some\nway, it is unlikely you will get very impressive re=\r\nsults.

The c=\r\nonclusion is the the code will NOT\n&gt; compile with g++ 3.3.2. But after inst=\r\nalling g++ 3.2.3 I could\ncompile\n&gt; Vinod Valsalam&#39;s version of the code. I =\r\nactually also compiled with\n&gt; version 3.3.2 using the backward compatible c=\r\nompiler named g++296\nbut\n&gt; it would not link, so that was no good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now=\r\n I will try to find out if an Othello player evolved with NEAT\ncan\n&gt; beat o=\r\nur Sane, Joone and JooneGap players.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mikkel=\r\n Baun Kj=E6rgaard\n\n\n"}}
