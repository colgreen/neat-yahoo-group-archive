Specifically, we compare DS=\r\nE to HyperNEAT with\n&gt; respect to each encoding&#39;s tendency to produce networ=\r\nks that are modular,\n&gt; regular, scale-free, and scalable. In general, we fi=\r\nnd that DSE produced\n&gt; networks that were more modular and scale-free than =\r\nHyperNEAT. We also found\n&gt; that DSE outperformed HyperNEAT on a pattern-rec=\r\nognition problem.\n&gt; I think you&#39;ll enjoy looking at the visualizations of t=\r\nhe networks evolved\n&gt; by DSE and HyperNEAT, and noting their differences. O=\r\nverall, I think this\n&gt; work raises interesting questions as to what types o=\r\nf encodings produce what\n&gt; types of network properties. For example, are it=\r\nerative growth/rewrite\n&gt; encodings more likely to produce modular networks?=\r\n Does HyperNEAT need\n&gt; growth or recursion to increase its modularity? Etc.=\r\n What do you think?\n&gt; The DSE encoding is also an interesting and promising=\r\n encoding in its own\n&gt; right.\n&gt; Here is a link to the paper and the abstrac=\r\nt:\n&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/2011-SuchorzewskiAnd=\r\nClune-DSE-Gecco.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; A Novel Generative Encoding for Evolving Modular, R=\r\negular and Scalable\n&gt; Networks\n&gt;\n&gt; Suchorzewski M and Clune J. To appear in=\r\n the Proceedings of the Genetic and\n&gt; Evolutionary Computation Conference. =\r\n=A02011.\n&gt;\n&gt; Abstract:=A0In this paper we introduce the Developmental Symbo=\r\nlic Encoding\n&gt; (DSE), a new generative encoding for evolving networks (e.g.=\r\n neural or\n&gt; boolean). DSE combines elements of two powerful generative enc=\r\nodings,\n&gt; Cellular Encoding and HyperNEAT, in order to evolve networks that=\r\n are\n&gt; modular, regular, scale-free, and scalable. Generating networks with=\r\n these\n&gt; properties is important because they can enhance performance and\n&gt;=\r\n evolvability. We test DSE=92s ability to generate scale-free and modular\n&gt;=\r\n networks by explicitly rewarding these properties and seeing whether\n&gt; evo=\r\nlution can produce networks that possess them. We compare the networks\n&gt; DS=\r\nE evolves to those of HyperNEAT. The results show that both encodings can\n&gt;=\r\n produce scale-free networks, although DSE performs slightly, but\n&gt; signifi=\r\ncantly, better on this objective. DSE networks are far more modular\n&gt; than =\r\nHyperNEAT networks. Both encodings produce regular networks. We further\n&gt; d=\r\nemonstrate that individual DSE genomes during development can scale up a\n&gt; =\r\nnetwork pattern to accommodate different numbers of inputs. We also compare=\r\n\n&gt; DSE to HyperNEAT on a pattern recognition problem. DSE significantly\n&gt; o=\r\nutperforms HyperNEAT, suggesting that its potential lay not just in the\n&gt; p=\r\nroperties of the networks it produces, but also because it can compete with=\r\n\n&gt; leading encodings at solving challenging problems. These preliminary res=\r\nults\n&gt; imply that DSE is an interesting new encoding worthy of additional s=\r\ntudy.\n&gt; The results also raise questions about which network properties are=\r\n more\n&gt; likely to be produced by different types of generative encodings.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; PS.=A0Because there is not a current working distribution of Cellular\n&gt; =\r\nEncoding, this encoding can serve as a descendent of CE if people wish to\n&gt;=\r\n compare against this type of encoding. We&#39;d be happy to make the code\n&gt; av=\r\nailable.\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;\n&gt; Postdoctoral Fellow\n&gt; Hod Lipson&#39;=\r\ns Creative Machines Laboratory\n&gt; Cornell University\n&gt; jeffclune@...=\r\n\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n"}}
