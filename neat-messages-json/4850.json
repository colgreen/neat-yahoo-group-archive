However, I still don&#39;t have the\ncorrect equation for calculating a centroid when using Manhattan\ndistance. My initial attempt at the maths suggests there is a single\nanalytical expression and I strongly suspect that the arithmetic\naverage is a good approximation for now anyway.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
