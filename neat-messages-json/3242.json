For example, \nyou mi=\r\nght have a single 2D input layer connecting to a single output \nnode (yes/n=\r\no); or you could have a multilayer 3D input field (where \neach 2D layer is =\r\na type of object) connecting to a 2D output field \n(where each pixel answer=\r\ns the question, is there overlap here?).  \nYou might have a hidden layer, a=\r\nnd you might not.  You might allow \nthe hidden layer to express lateral con=\r\nnections, and you might not.  \nYou might have a 3D hidden layer or a 2D hid=\r\nden layer.  You might \nembed everything in 3D, or you might map a 3D coordi=\r\nnate to a 2D, or \na 2D or a 3D, etc..\n\nIn each case, the implications are d=\r\nifferent about how proximities \nare incorporated or expressed.  In some cas=\r\nes it can be explicit \nwithin parts of the substrate; in some cases it is i=\r\nmplicit.  For \nexample, if there is only a single output node and a 2D shee=\r\nt of \ninputs, then the CPPN does not even need to take a target location \na=\r\ns input, since there is only one target.  In that case you just \nquery for =\r\neach input node what weight is coming out of it.  In such \na case, it is tr=\r\nue that you do not explicitly provide a proximity \ninput to the CPPN; howev=\r\ner proximity is still implicit within the \nrepresentation since input nodes=\r\n that are near each other are also \nnearby in the function domain of the CP=\r\nPN, that is, it can use that \nnearness even though it is not explicitly pro=\r\nvided as input.  \n\nPlease let me know if I didn&#39;t answer adequately and I c=\r\nan try to be \nmore specific, but I might need more detail on the precise sc=\r\nenario \nyou are considering.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; =\r\n&lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt;    One troubling &quot;detail&quot; is that of diff=\r\nerences in dimensionality \n&gt; between substrate inputs and outputs. In the e=\r\nxamples used in the \n&gt; various papers, the dimensionality of the substrate =\r\ninput and \noutput \n&gt; nodes, as applied to the Hypercube inputs, were identi=\r\ncal (i.e. \nx_in, \n&gt; y_in, x_out, y_out). This simplifies the concept of dis=\r\ntance. But \nthe \n&gt; problem could just as easily have been: Do the two squar=\r\nes on the \n&gt; visual field overlap? (yes/no). In this case, dimensionality o=\r\nf \nthe \n&gt; substrate input and output nodes, as applied to the Hypercube \nin=\r\nputs, \n&gt; have differing dimensionality, even though the answer is strongly =\r\n\n&gt; dependent on proximity in the input visual field. Any experience \nor \n&gt; =\r\ncomments on this seemly more common general condition?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    An=\r\ndy Carl \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Andy, I&#39;d say this is a about right.

So you=\r\n might for example output a \n&gt; high \n&gt; &gt; resolution representation of your =\r\npossible decisions, which is \n&gt; &gt; something you normally wouldn&#39;t do in reg=\r\nular NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) Hypercube Network: (i) Inputs: Other \ndescriptors=\r\n/parameters \n&gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; geometric coordinates being a subset thereof)=\r\n, associated with \na \n&gt; &gt; given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate network node (i.e. like a =\r\ntimestamp associated with \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinate point comprising a trajector=\r\ny), mutually exclusive \nof \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; descriptor/parameter expressly i=\r\ndentified in the substrate \nnode, \n&gt; &gt; each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; being collected together=\r\n and collectively identified as either \n&gt; &gt; a &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;to&quot; termina=\r\ntor of a link between any two substrate nodes; \nand \n&gt; &gt; (ii) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Output=\r\n: Weight of link between the currently identified &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; and &quot;to&quot; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; substrate nodes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think this characterizes it well, alt=\r\nhough there is even more \n&gt; &gt; flexibility.  You can for example use additio=\r\nnal outputs on the \n&gt; CPPN \n&gt; &gt; to represent additional attributes of links=\r\n and/or nodes.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The timestamp idea is interesting- if I understan=\r\nd correctly it \n&gt; would \n&gt; &gt; cause the network to change over time in a det=\r\nerministic way.  \n&gt; &gt; Although maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding.  But certainly t=\r\nhings like \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; are possible.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s difficult to write an=\r\n accurate general description of \nexactly \n&gt; &gt; what goes in and comes out o=\r\nf the CPPN at this point because I \nhave \n&gt; &gt; no doubt that at this early s=\r\ntage that new ideas are going to \n&gt; broaden \n&gt; &gt; the possibilities beyond w=\r\nhat I am currently aware of.
