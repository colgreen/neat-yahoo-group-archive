It was indeed correct. I&#39;ve scaled\nthe input values, which were typically close to or at +/- 1.0. I used\nthe number of input nodes as the scaling value, as the value is\navailable at data normalization time and it&#39;s one less parameter to\nworry about when setting up a model. Doing the scaling, enables rapid\ntraining to immediately get under way, while retaining the typical\nweight parameter of 3.0 max and 0.2 min.\n\nThat reference, to your paper, was particularly apposite. I already had\na copy but it &#39;disappeared&#39; a couple of weeks ago, and I couldn&#39;t, for\nthe life of me, remember the reference details.\n\n&gt; it may indeed be desirable to normalize the incoming weights to individual nodes\nThis seems like a worthwhile investment that would lead to more\nconsistent performance from model to model. I have put it on my list.\n\n&gt; Which version of HyperNEAT is it, by the way?\nA very good question :-). It&#39;s our own C++ version modelled very\nclosely on HyperNEAT v3. We&#39;ve tailored it to make it easier to plug in\ndifferent models and set-ups. The &#39;powers that be&#39; permitting, I hope\nto be able to make the code available publicly, but I&#39;ll need\npermission to include some of our libraries, or re-write the relevant\nbits of code. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t include any of our models. I&#39;ll\nhave to works something up there, as I think a good working example\nwould be very helpful. If I manage all this, I&#39;ll post details here.\n\nOnce again, thanks for your assistance.\n\nRob Marsden.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
