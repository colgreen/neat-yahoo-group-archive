Got it.  What you are talking about is taking the results of a\n&gt; long run and turning it into something optimal after you have a\n&gt; solution you find desirable.  That makes sense.\n\nYep, that&#39;s it.\n \n&gt; It appears we have different goals - yours is after you have done some\n&gt; number of NEAT runs and produced a result you then want to exploit in a\n&gt; completely separate way (apart from NEAT).  And mine is to further\n&gt; reduce the amount of time required *during* a NEAT run so you can get\n&gt; to your result more quickly.  These goals are compatible with each\n&gt; other.  And with the XML description definitions, it is likely they can\n&gt; even be complimentary.\n\nAs ken has pointed out, it&#39;s rarely the NEAT process that takes time - \nit&#39;s almost always the simulation. \n\n&gt; You wrote:\n&gt; 1. The precompiled code would be (slightly) faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is accurate, if you are saying the Delphi dynamic\n&gt; evaluation code would be slower than the Delphi pre-compiled code.\n\nI meant a compiled neural network will be faster than traversing the \nnodes and connections. \n\n&gt; However, you may be saying, precompiled code is faster than\n&gt; &quot;interpreted&quot; code.  If this is an accurate view of your statement, I\n&gt; would recommend you research the current IBM and Sun JVMs. \n\nI&#39;ll have to take your word for it, because I&#39;m not leaving my Delphi, \nno siree!\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
