In other words, one might ask you,\n&gt;&quot;why not have incoming connections to the input array?&quot;  But the point\n&gt;is, at some level, the inputs are just the inputs.  In NEAT, the\n&gt;&quot;input nodes&quot; are that level.\n&gt;\n&gt;My advice is to follow the NEAT conventions unless there is a very\n&gt;good functional reason not to, because that way it will be easier for\n&gt;you to ask questions, since then the less your system diverges from\n&gt;the ones that already exist.  On the other hand, if some design\n&gt;decision I made was really poor, it is certainly reasonable to try\n&gt;something different.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree it&#39;s a good idea to not stry too far from the pack. As you say \nit&#39;s really just semantics, if I use an input signal array then \nconnections have to carry an extra bit to distinguish between node \nconenctions and input signal connections. It&#39;s a /slightly/ clearer way \nI suppose but not significantly moreso than placing an input bit on the \nnode structure.\n\nThanks again for the feedback. I have a week clear now to put something \ntogether.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
