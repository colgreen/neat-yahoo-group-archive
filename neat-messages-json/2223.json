As soon as it\nbecomes recurrent, you have to make a decision ab=\r\nout how to order the\nfiring, because there is no &#39;correct&#39; way.  Here&#39;s the=\r\n gotcha:  When\nyou add topology to an existing network, it may cause you to=\r\n make a\ndifferent choice of what order to activate it.  Topology and weight=\r\ns\nthat may have been tuned to a particular firing order may suddenly get\nfi=\r\nred in a different order, which may cause it to take a huge hit in\nfitness.=\r\n  For a discriminator network, that shouldn&#39;t ever be a\nproblem.  For a con=\r\ntroller, it may very well present a problem to the\nevolution of the network=\r\n.\n\nThe solution, of course, is to have a deterministic approach to\ndetermin=\r\ning firing order that will NOT have any possibility of the\naddition of new =\r\ntopology changing the firing order of any of the old\ntopology that is not c=\r\nonnected to that new topology.  When you have a\nloop, and you need to deter=\r\nmine which path to activate first, you have\nsome choices to make:\n\n1. You c=\r\nan&#39;t choose randomly, because that&#39;s not deterministic\n2. You could choose =\r\nto activate the longest path first, but then you\nrun the risk of new topolo=\r\ngy changing the firing order\n3. Or the best option:  Choose based on AGE of=\r\n the topology.  \n\nWith option 3, you get a deterministic method of determin=\r\ning firing\norder that will not be suceptable to the problems that the evolu=\r\ntion\nof new topology might cause.\n\nHowever, that said, it is entirely possi=\r\nble that having such a firing\npattern might make a controller network harde=\r\nr to evolve, as you might\npotentially lose the ability to have a &#39;time dela=\r\ny&#39; circuit.\n\nIf I were you, I would retain the ability to fire the networks=\r\n using\neither method.  Choose the firing-order optimizer for classifier\nnet=\r\nworks, to speed up your evolution, and use the real-time firing\nmethod for =\r\ncontrollers that need to have time-based processing.\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
