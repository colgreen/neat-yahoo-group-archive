That&#39;s essenti=\r\nally what a CPPN does.  So if you tried to train a CPPN to answer correctly=\r\n for your particular graph, then you&#39;d be getting a CPPN encoding of that g=\r\nraph.  The part I am a little fuzzy about is how that would help with a dif=\r\nferent such graph.  To the extent the two graphs overlap, it would work, bu=\r\nt if they don&#39;t, I&#39;m not sure how learning from the first graph would gener=\r\nalize to the second.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mridul P &lt;p_mridul@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; The testing data is related to the same graph.=\r\n I believe that there is some \n&gt; underlying geometry between the nodes in t=\r\nhe graph, and there should be some \n&gt; regularities in the connectivity.

Is it from a different graph or the s=\r\name graph?  \n&gt; The reason I ask is that it probably matters whether the nod=\r\nes will be the same \n&gt; nodes (i.e. because they are from the same graph) or=\r\n nodes from an entirely \n&gt; different graph.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, it does sound =\r\nlike you could create an array of 9000 inputs and \n&gt; highlight the ones tha=\r\nt you are asking about.  The main question for HyperNEAT \n&gt; is whether thos=\r\ne 9000 inputs can be situated in a meaningful geometry?  For \n&gt; example, is=\r\n it naturally 300x300?  Or maybe something else?  If there is a \n&gt; geometry=\r\n to them, and if there are regularities in their connectivity, then in \n&gt; p=\r\nrinciple HyperNEAT might be a good choice for learning that pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlso, note that with 9000 inputs, there will generally be a computational co=\r\nst \n&gt; to activating the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;p_mridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am working on a bioin=\r\nformatics problem, but it&#39;s easier to talk about it in \n&gt; &gt;graph theory ter=\r\nms....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a graph with a large number of nodes (~9000), and ab=\r\nout 3000 edges \n&gt; &gt;between the nodes...
