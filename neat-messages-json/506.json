However I do think that if the overall \nproblem is broken down into smaller problems then each in turn is doable \n- some moreso than others. You say that your model is a greatly \nsimplified version of a real world task, which is true but I think that \nif you removed the simulation of motors and motor control signals from \nyour model you would have something which matches what I described in my \nemail as the high-level control. With a few modifications this could \nthen be pluged-in to a larger system (each part developed/evolved \nlargely indepently of the others) to form part of a real world solution.\n\nThe is basically the approach that has been tried with soccerbots - as \nmentioned on this group recently. With a clear breakdown of the larger \nproblem and one or two of the smaller sub-problems solved I see no \nreason why an existing darpa challenge team couldn&#39;t integrate them into \na real vehicle. To me it looks like most of the teams could use some \nhelp in precisly the areas where NN&#39;s would be a good solution.\n\nOne thing that does bother me though is that to be /really/ good some \nkind of adaptive (e.g. hebbian)network would be required. So if for \nexample there was a partial mechanical failure the NN could adapt (as a \nhuman would) to controling the system with it&#39;s new dynamics - so say \nfor example the engine lost power or the brakes weren&#39;t working so good \nor the part of the suspension broke, etc.\n\nColin.\n\nMitchell Timin wrote:\n\n&gt;Ken and Colin are thinking much bigger than I am here.\n&gt; Although my model does include the momentum and\n&gt;velocity effects that Colin mentioned, in general I am\n&gt;planning a highly simplified model, but yet one that\n&gt;simulates the most important aspects of navigation in\n&gt;a desert race.  As an aside, I might mention that\n&gt;TORCS code is available for anyone that wants a much\n&gt;more detailed vehicle and terrain simulation.\n&gt;\n&gt;In my approach the ANN receives inputs of velocity,\n&gt;and distance coordinates to any nearby obstacles and\n&gt;the goal.  The coordinates would be in the vehicle\n&gt;centered frame of reference, i.e., distance and\n&gt;azimuth.  Perhaps angular velocity is needed as well.\n&gt;All of those values are available from the physical\n&gt;model.  The ANN converts those inputs into steering\n&gt;and throttle values, which feed into the physical\n&gt;model.  These calculations are repeated with short\n&gt;time steps, perhaps 1/20 of a simulated second per\n&gt;step.  This results in a trajectory, which is then\n&gt;assigned a fitness value.  The fitness is initially\n&gt;just the distance traveled before crashing, or\n&gt;traveling in a totally wrong direction.  For vehicles\n&gt;that reach the goal, then the fitness is further\n&gt;increased according to the average speed of the\n&gt;journey.\n&gt;\n&gt;I plan to base the physical model on RARS, which I\n&gt;developed 9 years ago, and has been thouroughly\n&gt;tested.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
