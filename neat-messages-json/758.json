What I was intending to do is allow saving of the whole \npopulation or just the best genome, the user can then load entire \npopulations back in and continue searching. SharpNEAT doesn&#39;t currently \nuse the seed genome approach that original NEAT does. Instead I use a \nGenomeFactory class that generates random genomes with all of the inputs \nconnected to all of the outputs. What I was intending to do was specify \ndifferent GenomeFactory classes for each experiment, but actually I \nthink providing a &#39;seed&#39; genome might be a more user-friendly way of \ndoing things.\n\n If I get chance I might do this over the weekend.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
