This kind of structure can accrue over time and\n&gt; make the chromosome sizes very large (which increases the number of\n&gt; dimensions in the search space). To make the evolved networks more\n&gt; understandable/computationally efficient, some systems simplify the output\n&gt; of overly complex genetic code at the &quot;end&quot; of evolution. For example, if\n&gt; neuron A is connected to neuron B by link 1 and also link 2, then the\n&gt; weights of these two links are summed and the connection is simplified to\n&gt; one link. This &quot;simplifies&quot; the neural network but doesn&#39;t result in a\n&gt; loss in functionality.\n\nHonestly I haven&#39;t seen much of this approach in stuff I&#39;ve read.  Is\nthere a name for this type of technique?\n\nI would think more common would be network pruning, as Colin has\nbrought up.  Isn&#39;t pruning (i.e. incrementally removing toplogical\nfeatures) more common than trying to &quot;fuse&quot; topological features?\n\n&gt; Ken&#39;s hypothesis was that if we could somehow avoid adding this kind of\n&gt; redundant structure in the first place, then the GA search takes place\n&gt; over a smaller space, and therefore can be more efficient.\n\nThe only way to know if you&#39;ve got redundant features would be to use\none of the above approaches, correct?  Has any of this type of\nanalysis been done?  That is, how do we know that the champions from\nexperiments such as double pole-balancing or the robot duels could not\nperform as well with 25% or more of their topology removed?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
