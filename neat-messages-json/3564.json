There is elitism in t=\r\nhe \nversion\n&gt; &gt; of NEAT you mention. Check out the species::reproduce() met=\r\nhod. \nThere\n&gt; &gt; is a comparison of poolsize with 5 in order to produce the =\r\n\nchamp.. At\n&gt; &gt; least I remember that :) So basically this means that when =\r\na \nspecies\n&gt; &gt; size is greather than 5, the champ is cloned into the next \n=\r\ngeneration\n&gt; &gt; unchanged.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have incorporated the population of NEAT =\r\nin our framework (so \nwe  \n&gt; may have made some mistakes) but I observe tha=\r\nt the fitness of \nthe  \n&gt; best individual in the population decreases somet=\r\nimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to  what you are writing, this should not be possible,=\r\n  \n&gt; isn&#39;t it ?\n&gt; \n\nIt is possible to lose the champion if the best species=\r\n itself has a \nsize of less than 5 (I think 5 is the number- it could be 4)=\r\n.  Then \nits champion will not be duplicated.  If that is happening, it may=\r\n \nindicate that your species are too small (because the best species \nshoul=\r\nd after all not be so small), which suggests that the \ncompatibility thresh=\r\nold is not set well.  You may consider making it \nmore inclusive (i.e. sett=\r\ning it higher) to get bigger species, or, \nprobably better, to use a dynami=\r\nc threshold that changes in order to \nmaintain a target # of species.\n\nken\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; --\n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; http://animatlab=\r\n.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
