What elements of it do you think are\nimportant to evolve?\n\nI can think of at least three options (am I missing any?)\n\n1) The number of hidden layers\n2) The number of hidden nodes per layer\n3) The geometric placement of the nodes in every layer\n\nIf you think all of them are important, how would you prioritize them? In\nwhat order would you prefer researchers tackled them? I am just curious what\ndifferent people think about these questions.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
