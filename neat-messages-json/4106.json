It seems like never ch=\r\nanging the novelty\n&gt; scores would create attractors around old behaviors in=\r\nstead of new\nones. \n&gt; \n&gt; For example, imagine an individual that reaches a =\r\nnew area in\n&gt; behavioral space. It is assigned a high novelty score. Severa=\r\nl new\n&gt; individuals arrive in the same area, and get lower novelty scores (=\r\nthe\n&gt; first one maintains its high score). What we want is to explore the\n&gt;=\r\n individuals on the &#39;fringe&#39; of this new area, in hopes of finding\n&gt; furthe=\r\nr areas of novetly. However, with constant novelty scores, the\n&gt; bias will =\r\nbe to investigate the area in the proximity of the first\n&gt; individual, even=\r\n though the ones on the fringe may be more promising.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you consisten=\r\ntly get better performance with constant novelty\n&gt; scores over a variety of=\r\n maps perhaps it is worth looking into more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jo=\r\nel,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Novelty search is one really inspiring idea. \n&gt; &gt; It is intere=\r\nsting to note that when I added the dynamic adjustment of \n&gt; &gt; the sparsene=\r\nss/novelty score, the performance was actually worse than \n&gt; &gt; without adju=\r\nsting the novelty score, i.e. an individual always stays \n&gt; &gt; with the nove=\r\nlty score it was born with. \n&gt; &gt; I hypothesize that this is because it enco=\r\nurages such species that \n&gt; &gt; produce more novel behaviors frequently.

In our implementation =\r\nit is \n&gt; &gt; allowed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get stale for a few evaluations (in the same fr=\r\nequency that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals are respeciated according to rtNEAT). In our=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; experiments,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; allowing for a bit staleness did not effect the re=\r\nsults.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, in the scenario you describe, each of the ind=\r\nividuals \n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now have a lower novelty, the original individual=\r\n included. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflects that the area around these individuals in be=\r\nhavior space is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more dense than it previously was. As more individual=\r\ns come into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular area, the novelty of all of them drops, and =\r\nprovides\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pressure for individuals to do something new in order to be =\r\nseen as \n&gt; &gt; novel.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me know if you have any more implement=\r\nation questions, I&#39;ll be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; releasing my source based off the rtNEAT pac=\r\nkage in the next few \n&gt; &gt; weeks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Joel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I implemented novelty search and the ma=\r\nze navigation task (it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works! :)), but I need to ask you about som=\r\nething. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So when a new individual is spawned from the popu=\r\nlation, its \n&gt; &gt; novelty is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computed based on the domain-specific =\r\ndistance measure to all \n&gt; &gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors in the population and=\r\n the archive, right. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But what about the population itself=\r\n, should every individual \n&gt; &gt; there \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recompute its sparseness on e=\r\nvery evaluation, based on the new \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I ask this because when I observe the sparseness (I assume \n&gt; &gt; sparseness=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equals fitness) of the individuals, say one happens to be in a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sparse area so it receives a high fitness score.
