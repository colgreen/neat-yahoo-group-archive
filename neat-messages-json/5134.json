If it didn&#39;t do this, all substrates\n&gt; created by CPPNs would be fully connected.  If you look at\n&gt; NEAT_LayeredSubstrate.h, you will see convertOutputToWeight(...), which\n&gt; converts the output form the CPPN into a substrate weight magnitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe part of the reason why values are set to -3 or 3 is more complex:\n&gt; Because there isn&#39;t normalization in the basic HyperNEAT algorithm, there is\n&gt; competition between the link weights to have influence, so there&#39;s an arms\n&gt; race towards very high (or low) link weights.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also note that if you do not have a bias code in your CPPN, the connection\n&gt; going from (0,0) to (0,0) will be 0 every time because the network has no\n&gt; inputs of value.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason G.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I was just looking at some NEAT genomes and noticed that they have many link\n&gt;&gt; values of exactly -3 (min), 3 (max), and 0.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Does NEAT have something that facilitates the production of max, min and 0?\n&gt;&gt; I know HyperNEAT facilitates the production of zeros...does NEAT?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; PS. I am using Jason&#39;s HyperNEAT C++ package, in case that is different in\n&gt;&gt; this respect. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If anyone has any thoughts, I would appreciate it.
