The\n&gt; DNA string could could contain instructions for\n&gt; building particular structures, and developmental rule\n&gt; sets, right?\n\nYeah, sure, and this is the way its normally done I think. I want to split\n them up in order to take advantage of coevolution. Also this way different\n developmental systems can be applied to a bunch of different chromosomes.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is along the lines of some of\n&gt; &gt; DeJong&#39;s and also Ficici&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; work over at Brandeis (coevolving teacher/learner\n&gt; &gt; pairs).\n&gt; \n&gt; Not familiar with this work, but I&#39;ll head on over to\n&gt; CiteSeer and have a look. \n\nMost of this is available online on Prof. Pollack (at Brandeis)&#39;s website.\n Couldnt tell you the URL off hand, sorry.\n\n&gt; &gt; This dichotomy is really important in biology, i.e.,\n&gt; &gt; DNA is almost\n&gt; &gt; completely useless information without the\n&gt; &gt; developmental system that it is\n&gt; &gt; paired with. And the two definately evolved\n&gt; &gt; together.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the DNA encodes for the developmental system in\n&gt; resides in, doesn&#39;t it?  I guess I don&#39;t see a clear\n&gt; dichotomy...maybe you could elaborate.\n\nYeah, but without an already existing system to utilize the DNA(e.g. the\n mother), it will never turn into a baby. So there is this coevolutionary\n chicken-and-egg problem.\n\n&gt; &gt; Personally, I&#39;d love to do a PhD thesis on this idea\n&gt; &gt; if I can get into a\n&gt; &gt; good graduate school.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re a senior at UT now?  Where are you thinking of\n&gt; applying to grad school?\n&gt;\n\nYup. The pickings are kinda slim for this evolutionary and developmental\n systems stuff. I&#39;m gonna apply to some UK schools: University College\n London, Sussex, and Birmingham. In the US: Brandeis and MIT. And maybe some\n others, havent really decided yet. \n\nJoe\n\n"}}
