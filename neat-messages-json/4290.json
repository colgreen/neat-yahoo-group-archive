However, it\nis indeed important, and I=\r\n emphasized it because when thinking about\nCPPNs it has been common to focu=\r\ns on the compositional aspect.  The\nadding and subtracting can be thought o=\r\nf as a way of combining shapes.\n For example, a circle and a square can com=\r\nbine to create a circle\nwith a square hole (i.e. circle minus square).  In =\r\nthis way, you can\nget very complex shapes easily that conform in ways that =\r\nmay not look\nlike the original activation functions from which they derive.=\r\n\n\nHowever, composition is clearly still critical because these &quot;cutout&quot;\nsha=\r\npes are the outputs of individual nodes that then become coordinate\nframes =\r\nfor even higher functions.  In this way, composition is still\ngoing on, but=\r\n it involves intermediate steps that may be difficult to\nvisualize.\n\nThe ut=\r\nility I spoke about simply allows you to visualize all the\nintermediate ste=\r\nps.  It&#39;s fairly simple to implement.  Just think of\nany hidden node in the=\r\n CPPN as being the output and then just draw a\npicture corresponding to wha=\r\nt *that* node&#39;s activation is at any given\n(x,y).  In this way, every hidde=\r\nn node in the network has an internal\n&quot;picture&quot; that we can easily see if w=\r\ne simply render it.  You can then\ncreate visualizations that attempt to sho=\r\nw the order of the creation\nof the ultimate pattern, picture by picture, fr=\r\nom bottom to top (of\ncourse, it is only a partial order unless the network =\r\nis a perfect\nchain).   \n\nIf you wanted to be really creative, you could cre=\r\nate a big virtual\nwindow with scroll bars in which each node is shown with =\r\nits internal\npicture rendered entirely inside it.  Then the user could just=\r\n\nnavigate up the network at leisure and see how one thing leads to\nanother.=\r\n  This kind of visualization is analogous to watching\nembryonic &quot;developmen=\r\nt&quot; from start to finish.\n\nWhen you ask if we can analyze this in a determin=\r\nistic way without\nusing evolution, could you provide more detail on that qu=\r\nestion?  As I\nam thinking of it, this type of analysis is performed on the =\r\nproduct\nof evolution, i.e. on a particular genome, so I am not sure what yo=\r\nu\nmean by &quot;without&quot; evolution.  If you mean that you&#39;d like a kind of\ntheor=\r\netical explanation of the way the space of possible patterns is\nencoded, I =\r\nthink it&#39;s an interesting question, but I don&#39;t have a good\nanswer other th=\r\nan intuitive explanations such as the one above.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFrom what I see, this app should be a really good tool to help me \n&gt; unders=\r\ntand the internal workings of the CPPNs. Would you provide me a \n&gt; brief gu=\r\nideness on how to implement that myself and use it? \n&gt; \n&gt; So what matters t=\r\nhe most is the additions and subtractions of the \n&gt; values that get into th=\r\ne hidden nodes? I assume you mean the &quot;output \n&gt; =3D function( sum(i1 * w1 =\r\n+ i2 * w2 + ... + in * wn + bias) )&quot;. Then \n&gt; actually the weights of the c=\r\nonnections inputting into the node are \n&gt; really more important than the pr=\r\neceeeding functions above it. Of \n&gt; course, if a weight is close to zero th=\r\nen it has almost no influence \n&gt; to the node. In a stream of conciosness I =\r\nam continuing with some \n&gt; questions. OK then when 2 or more links output t=\r\no the same node, it \n&gt; is combining them or in other words, adding/subtract=\r\ning them, right. \n&gt; Did you see any difference with lower &quot;add-link&quot; mutati=\r\non rates? \n&gt; Where more nodes are being added with only one input and one o=\r\nutput \n&gt; link? \n&gt; I know what the weights themselves mean, they are scalars=\r\n of the \n&gt; coordinate frames. I am also aware of what happens when a functi=\r\non (a \n&gt; coordinate frame) is laid on top of another. But how do you explai=\r\nn \n&gt; the situation where 2 or more coordinate frames are being added \n&gt; tog=\r\nether? Are we able to actually analyze that in a deterministic way \n&gt; witho=\r\nut using evolution to see stuff? See, I know this is possible, \n&gt; but I am =\r\nlooking for the easy and clean way, you know.. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We actually =\r\ndid at one time create an internal app that lets you do\n&gt; &gt; this with Picbr=\r\needer images.  We could click on a node in a CPPN and\n&gt; &gt; see the pattern g=\r\nenerated at that internal node (which is like an\n&gt; &gt; intermediate stage of =\r\ndevelopment).  It&#39;s very enlightening.  One\n&gt; &gt; thing it taught me is that =\r\na lot of the shapes are created through\n&gt; &gt; additions and subtractions, in =\r\naddition to compositions.  But those\n&gt; &gt; additions and subtractions are ver=\r\ny important.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately that app has not been further develop=\r\ned at this time \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; is no longer compatible with Picbreeder.  Perhap=\r\ns we will get back \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; it so that it can be made available at some po=\r\nint.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I&#39;m thinking that the benchmark result is less im=\r\nportant \n&gt; than the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehension of how the encoding built its res=\r\nults.  CPPNs \n&gt; have the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice property that they are fairly straigh=\r\ntforward.  You can \n&gt; look at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each hidden node and look at the inte=\r\nrmediate structure that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produces.  In e.g. a GRN-based system, o=\r\nn the other hand, it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significantly more opaque and difficult to e=\r\nxplain, and \n&gt; therefore more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to bias.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have =\r\nyou done this Ken? Was it helpful to understand what was \n&gt; going on?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you guys have a tool that makes this easy to do? I think it \n&gt; w=\r\nould\n&gt; &gt; be very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instructive to be able to look at the contribution o=\r\nf hidden \n&gt; nodes and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subgraphs of the CPPN network.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jef=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
