Why give connections a unique innovation number at \n&gt;all?\n&gt; &gt;   Why not assign their unique ID based on the innovation numbers of the\n&gt; &gt; nodes they connect?  If you create a new connection between nodes 253 \n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; 275, then the ID for the connection could be &quot;253:275&quot;.  Store the\n&gt; &gt; connections in a hash table, and you have instant prevention of \n&gt;duplicates.\n&gt; &gt; Then, even if a connection is created 10 generations later, if it \n&gt;connects\n&gt; &gt; the same nodes, it&#39;s the same gene.  Even if the organism has \n&gt;subsequently\n&gt; &gt; gone off and formed its own species.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any reason why that wouldn&#39;t work?\n&gt;\n&gt;I think there is a problem to appear. You idea supposes some global pool \n&gt;for connections information. Right? So there is no way to keep connections \n&gt;that do link the same neurons but have different weights. It&#39;s just because \n&gt;such connections are always the same for hash function as they have similar \n&gt;IDs.\n\nI originally thought of one hash per organism.  But now I think it would be \none hash per node.  Too much work in C/C++, but very easy in Perl...\n\n$network = {\n  &#39;id&#39; =&gt; &#39;1234&#39;,  # give each network a unique number out of the \n&#39;innovation&#39; pool\n  &#39;species&#39; =&gt; 13, # same thing with species\n  &#39;fitness&#39; =&gt; 0.121356,  # store the fitness value of this network, once it \nis known\n  &#39;node&#39; =&gt; {\n    &#39;bias&#39; =&gt; {\n      &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;input&#39;,\n      &#39;connections&#39; =&gt; {}  # none\n    },\n    &#39;one&#39; =&gt; {\n      &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;input&#39;,\n      &#39;connections&#39; =&gt; {}  # none\n    },\n    &#39;two&#39; =&gt; {\n      &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;input&#39;,\n      &#39;connections&#39; =&gt; {}  # none\n    },\n    &#39;output&#39; =&gt; {\n      &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;output&#39;,\n      &#39;connections&#39; =&gt; {  # weights are just made up...\n        &#39;bias&#39; =&gt; 0.5,\n        &#39;one&#39; =&gt; 0.5,\n        &#39;two&#39; =&gt; 0.5,\n        &#39;65&#39; =&gt; -1.0   # the one hidden node\n      }\n    }\n    &#39;65&#39; =&gt; {  # ID is the unique innovation number\n      &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;hidden&#39;,\n      &#39;connections&#39; =&gt; {\n        &#39;one&#39; =&gt; 1,\n        &#39;two&#39; =&gt; 1\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nMakes building the directed graph extremely easy.  But it does presuppose \nsomething about how mutations and crossover take place...That a connection \nfrom a node with the same node/innovation ID to a node with the same \nnode/innovation id, though they may not have the same weights, are a \ncompatible structure, for the sake of speciation.  Do I understand \ncorrectly?\n\n\n\n"}}
