Here is information on the parameters that you won&#39;t find there:=\r\n\n\nFitnessCoefficient 0.0 [?]\n\nThis is a compatibility coefficient based on =\r\nthe fitness. If two individuals have different fitness, they will be put in=\r\nto different species.  If you wanted to use this, you would have to set it =\r\nlow enough that is done not overpower the other coefficients.  I didn&#39;t fin=\r\nd it very effective, so I suggest leaving it at 0.\n\nSpeciesSizeTarget 8.0 1=\r\n &lt; x &lt; PopulationSize\n\nThis is the expected # of species.  The compatibilit=\r\ny threshold will dynamically adjust to try to fit the species into that siz=\r\ne.  I recommend  PopulationSize/8.  This will put about 8 individuals per s=\r\npecies.\n\nAgeSignificance 1.0 [?]\n\nThis is a multiplier to the fitness of yo=\r\nung individuals.  It does not mix will with elitism since it makes fitness =\r\nbased on individual age which is independent of the evaluation, so I recomm=\r\nend leaving it at 1, effectively disabling age significance.\n\nAdultLinkAge =\r\n18.0 [?]\n\nIf an individual is chosen to be mutated, links that are less tha=\r\nn this number in age are mutated 100% of the time, whereas the other links =\r\nare mutated based on the mutation rates.\n\nAllowRecurrentConnections 0.0 [bo=\r\nolean]\nAllowSelfRecurrentConnections 0.0 [boolean]\n\nThese allow for recurre=\r\nnt and self recurrent (self loop) connections.\n\nForceCopyGenerationChampion=\r\n \n\nThis turns on/off elitism\n\nLinkGeneMinimumWeightForPhentoype 0.0\n\nIf the=\r\n absolute value of a link is less than this number, the link will not be ex=\r\npressed in the neural network, even though it exists in the genome.\n\nGenera=\r\ntionDumpModulo 10.0\n\nEvery &lt;x&gt; generations in the xml output will contain e=\r\nvery individual in the population.  All other generations (except the final=\r\n one) only contain the generation champion.  This saves disk space and make=\r\ns searching through the xml file faster.\n\nExtraActivationUpdates 9.0\n\nWhen =\r\na network is first created, there are zeroes in all of the activation level=\r\ns.  This parameter encodes the number of times to activate the network when=\r\n activating a fresh network.\n\nExperimentType 15.0\n\nThis parameter is discus=\r\nsed in the HyperNEAT manual.  Basically, it is used in the ExperimentRun cl=\r\nass to decide which experiment to run.\n\nHope this helps, let me know if you=\r\n have any additional questions,\n\nJason G.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J=\r\nan v.d. Lugt&quot; &lt;janlugt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Jan van=\r\n der Lugt and I am doing some exploratory work together\n&gt; with Evert Haasdi=\r\njk on the parameters used by HyperNEAT (version 2.6). One\n&gt; of my concerns =\r\nis the ranges for the parameters used by HyperNEAT. Some of\n&gt; them were qui=\r\nte easy to figure out (e.g. the probabilities), but for others\n&gt; I don&#39;t ha=\r\nve the slightest clue about a sensible range. Below are the\n&gt; parameters an=\r\nd my ideas about sensible ranges:\n&gt; \n&gt; PopulationSize 120.0 [positive int]\n=\r\n&gt; MaxGenerations 600.0 [positive int]\n&gt; DisjointCoefficient 2.0 [?]\n&gt; Exces=\r\nsCoefficient 2.0 [?]\n&gt; WeightDifferenceCoefficient 1.0 [?]\n&gt; FitnessCoeffic=\r\nient 0.0 [?]\n&gt; CompatibilityThreshold 6.0 [?]\n&gt; CompatibilityModifier 0.3 [=\r\n?]\n&gt; SpeciesSizeTarget 8.0 1 &lt; x &lt; PopulationSize\n&gt; DropoffAge 15.0 [?, pro=\r\nbably generations?]\n&gt; AgeSignificance 1.0 [?]\n&gt; SurvivalThreshold 0.2 [?]\n&gt;=\r\n MutateAddNodeProbability 0.03 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateAddLinkProbability 0.05 [0=\r\n.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateDemolishLinkProbability 0.00 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateLinkWeightsP=\r\nrobability 0.8 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateOnlyProbability 0.25 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutateLin=\r\nkProbability 0.1 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; AllowAddNodeToRecurrentConnection 0.0 [boolean=\r\n]\n&gt; SmallestSpeciesSizeWithElitism 5.0 1 &lt; x &lt; PopulationSize\n&gt; MutateSpeci=\r\nesChampionProbability 0.0 [0.0-1.0]\n&gt; MutationPower 2.5 [?]\n&gt; AdultLinkAge =\r\n18.0 [?]\n&gt; AllowRecurrentConnections 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; AllowSelfRecurrentConn=\r\nections 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ForceCopyGenerationChampion 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; LinkGen=\r\neMinimumWeightForPhentoype 0.0 [?, spelling error?]\n&gt; GenerationDumpModulo =\r\n10.0 [?]\n&gt; RandomSeed -1.0 [positive int, -1 for random]\n&gt; ExtraActivationF=\r\nunctions 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; AddBiasToHiddenNodes 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; SignedActivat=\r\nion 1.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ExtraActivationUpdates 9.0 [?]\n&gt; OnlyGaussianHiddenNode=\r\ns 0.0 [boolean]\n&gt; ExperimentType 15.0 [0, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 24,=\r\n 26]\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone can (partially) complete this list, I would be very gra=\r\nteful! I\n&gt; don&#39;t need detailed explanations for each parameter, just some s=\r\nensible\n&gt; ranges (ideally not too big) where good values might lie.\n&gt; \n&gt; Re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Jan van der Lugt\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
