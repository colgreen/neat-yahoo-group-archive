The arbitrary restriction to a\n&gt;[-1,1] interval is potentially restricting, too.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d suggest it might be worth your while looking at using &quot;standard&quot;\n&gt;or &quot;Z&quot; scores (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) and\n&gt;using the daily return (price today / price yesterday) as the value.\n&gt;The Z-score then restates each movement as a number of standard\n&gt;deviations away from the mean, which (a) lets the outliers take really\n&gt;large values without over-compressing the more mundane values and (b)\n&gt;removes trend information.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just a thought...\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHi Mike, Emyr, All\n\nThis definitely seems to be the most sound approach to take to me. It \ndoes introduce the problem of having to calculate (sample) the mean and \nstandard deviation from a sample set of data which, as I was saying \nbefore, you should then avoid for training and testing purposes - which \nis a problem if, like me, you already have limited data.\n\nCurrently I&#39;m using the daily percentage change in price as an input \nsignal as you suggested, but I use the raw figure as it&#39;s typically  \nwithin the range -1 to 1 anyway (in fact more like +-0.1 of course), \nwith the occasional outlying figure which could be anywhere from +-0.5 \nto +3. Using the number of standard deviations would generate a similar \nnumber for these outlying cases, instead of the rather arbitrary number \nthat would get used (input to an ANN) otherwise.\n\nFor volume and # of trades Z-scores are even more appropriate since we \ncannot really use daily percentage change for these signals because they \ncan change by such large amount from day to day. E.g. you might have a \nquiet trading day with a few thousand shares traded and several million \ntraded the next day due to some news/event. Currently I use \nlog10(volume) to generate a signal appropriate for feeding into an ANN, \nbut on reflection a Z-score is a far more mathematically sound choice.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
