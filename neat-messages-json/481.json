Or are you going to\n&gt;write your own, or perhaps use another Java version of NEAT?\n\nI&#39;m thinking hybrid.  I want to do a more passive system, like SETI@home, \nwhere clients ping the server to get work to do.  That way, I can put \ncomputers to work that are outside my firewall.\n\nI&#39;m actually thinking of making the client/worker component a java applet in \na web page.  The page contains the network topology and input/output sample \nembedded as parameters to the applet.  The applet runs until it produces a \nresult, and then that result is posted back to the server via a submit form \nthat is automatically activated as soon as the evaluation is done.  One \nreason for this is that the applet is (hopefully) automatically updated on \nevery client as soon as I update it on the server.\n\nI&#39;m picturing an applet that shows 6 squares (all the same size).  One is \nthe original input sample, shown at, say, 3 inches square.  The next is the \nhigher-resolution expected output, also 3&quot;x3&quot; but with more pixels.  In a \nthird square, the output of the network is painted into the corresponding \nlocation in the square, thus it is always changing.  The fourth square is \nthe difference between the actual output and the expected output (the error \nimage).  The fifth and sixth squares are spatial error transformations \nperformed on the error image.  They will highlight certain kinds of errors, \nlike stairstepping and halos.\n\nThen, on the form in the web page is a field that holds the current running \nfitness value.  With each completion of a pass (at different levels of \nenlargement), it will update the spatial error images and then use them to \nhelp with creating a fitness value.  Once the process is complete, a \nJavaScript function will automatically post/submit the form, and the results \nare sent back to the server.  The reply, of course, is the next \nnetwork/sample to evaluate.  And the graphics are mostly eye-candy to keep \nit interesting.  It would probably be faster without it, but because it \nprovides feedback on how good it is (or is not) doing, it helps with the \npatience factor.\n\nWhen the data is sent to the server, it is received by a perl or php script \nwhich dumps it into a database (sql or xml or file or something).  It then \nchecks to see if all of the networks have been evaluated against that \nparticular sample.  If so, it then calls out to an external NEAT executable \nthat evaluates the scores and determines which specimens would reproduce, \nand whether enough evaluation has been done so far, and all that jazz.  If \nwe have done enough, it generates a new population.  Either way, it produces \na new input/output sample.  Future requests then evaluate against a new \ninput/output sample and possibly a new generation of specimens.\n\nThe back-end will probably be a mix of perl or php and either C++ or Java.   \nThe one part is modified existing NEAT code that does the checks to see who \nshould reproduce, and does the actual creation of the next generation from \nthe current generation based on fitness values.  Everything else is done \nusing whatever gets the job done fastest.  Meaning, easiest to write.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nCreate a Job Alert on MSN Careers and enter for a chance to win $1000! \nhttp://msn.careerbuilder.com/promo/kaday.htm?siteid=CBMSN_1K&sc_extcmp=JS_JASweep_MSNHotm2\n\n\n"}}
