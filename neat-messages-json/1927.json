The fifth one, however, has not\nbeen successful to this point.\n\nI have not found any material that covers a problem like this, so I&#39;m\ntaking a shot in the dark here with my approach, but it seems sound to\nme.  As mentioned, I provide 4 inputs, one for each direction, that\ntells the cat how &#39;desirable&#39; it is to go in a particular direction -\nbased upon how long ago he was on the tiles in that direction.  -1.0\nmeans there is only a wall in that direction, 0.0 means he was just\nthere (so it&#39;s not so desirable) and +1.0 means he has never been\nthere (so it&#39;s very desirable).\n\nOriginally I tried using my genomes evolved through the first 4\nscenarios on scenario 5 with no luck.  So then I evolved some genomes\nthrough scenario 1 and tried them on scenario 5.  No luck.  So at the\nmoment I am evolving newly created genomes on scenario 5 and it isn&#39;t\ngoing so hot thus far.  The &#39;desirability&#39; inputs don&#39;t seem to be\ndoing the trick.  Out of the 36 starting positions, the cat can solve\n32 at best, but there is still a lot of pulsating back and forth for\nseveral ticks here and there.  It seems plain to me that I am in need\nof a better input system to have searching behaviour emerge.\n\nOf course even if the cat does evolve to solve all 36 starting\npositions, I am not optimistic about its chances with the other\nscenarios on top of it.  With another input (4-7: U,R,D,L) for\nproximity to mouse that needs to drive the cat&#39;s direction, it seems\nthat it is too difficult for the cat to have two separate sets of\ninputs controlling its direction (when mouse not present, then use\n&#39;desirability&#39;).\n\nHere&#39;s a screenshot illustrating 3 cat start positions and 3 mouse\nstarting positions.  The two that start in intersections go together\nand then others go with the appropriate position that would require\nthe cat to change directions after initially choosing one.\n\nhttp://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatAndMouse_Search.jpg\n\nI only have 4 more days for my experiments after this, so it&#39;s all\ncoming to a close shortly, but I figured that I&#39;d put this out there\nto see if anyone has any ideas.  I could mess around with the inputs\nand perhaps change these 4 that I use for &#39;desirability&#39;, but there is\nno time for major overhauls.\n\nAgain, the restrictions on the experiment are that he can only receive\ninputs that would be available to a cat in a real scenario (no\ncheating) and he must decide on a movement every game tick (no using\nlast direction and moving continually until told to stop).\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
