So you would basically duplicate the n=\r\node and its incoming and outgoing connections.  That might be sort of like =\r\ngene duplication that can then lead to a divergence.  However, the new weig=\r\nhts would perhaps need to be calibrated since it would double the power of =\r\nthe prior single-node output.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Gree=\r\nn &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The standard NEAT approach for adding nodes=\r\n is to split a connection, e.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1------&gt;2\n&gt; Split connection to give\n&gt;=\r\n 1----&gt;3----&gt;2\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering if splitting nodes would have additiona=\r\nl worth.
