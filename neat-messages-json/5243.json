The multiplication examples are indeed interesting. Have you\n&gt; tried running the inputs to neurons (after they run over their incoming connections) through\n&gt; logarithms? I wonder what networks would do with logs at all their inputs. Maybe the nodes\n&gt; would then only need to be linear summations (because logs provide nonlinearities). Or maybe\n&gt; they could still run their usual activation function set.\n\nI think if we acknoweldge the possibility that there is some (possibly\nsignificant) functionality in dendritic trees then the traditional ANN\nmodel isn&#39;t as &#39;broken&#39; as that might suggest - so long as we accept\nthat single ANN nodes aren&#39;t a simplification of single neurons but\nrather a representation of a fundamental unit of processing. That is,\nwe let go of the one-to-one mapping of neuron==ANN node.  From there\nwe could e.g. add a log(x) activation function to our set of CPPN\nactivation functions (as a first experiment).\n\n&gt; In general, there is definitely room for the neural model to be improved. The main impediment\n&gt; to progress in this area is probably just that it is not very glorious work to be fiddling with\n&gt; different function sets and network models and hoping to see a breakthrough, but it is true\n&gt; there could be a payoff.\n\nSure. The fact that Christof Koch wrote a whole book subtitled\n&quot;Information processing in single neurons&quot; suggests there might be\nmore to neurons than a simple sigmoid input-response behaviour :)\n\n\n&gt; But I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t something better. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s hard to tell if there is a problem or\n&gt; not that needs fixing. There may be and I would be very interested if something superior was\n&gt; demonstrated. Will the new SharpNEAT provide an ability to play with such ideas?\n\nYes it&#39;s certainly more geared up for experimenting with different\ntypes of genome without having to hack about in the core code at all.\nIn short I&#39;ve used generics (similar concept to C++ templates) to\nabstract away the core algorithms (evolution, speciation) from the\ngenome implementation. So the idea is you devise whatever genome you\nwant along with the &#39;phenome&#39; implementation and then plug in some\ncode that &#39;decodes&#39; the genome to the phenome\n(IGenomeDecoder&lt;TGenome,TPhenome&gt; interface). The speciation\nabstraction works by defining the genomes position in an N dimensional\nspace - that is, you have to translate the &#39;guts&#39; of the genome into a\nN-dimensional position and teh speciation works on those positions -\nit&#39;s completely abstracted away from the genome classes.\n\nI&#39;ll respond to one of your other points in a further post.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
