Members of a species would consume a similar set of\n&gt;resources.

Actually this sort of pattern appears in nature \nif you think about how the various attraction and repulsion forces from \nthe sub-atomic to astronomical scale work in unison to keep everything \nin a state of balance.\n\n\n&gt;This is also another way for species to compete and cooperate\n&gt;in complex ways, especially if agents are able to produce resources.\n&gt;(Possibly linked to their fitness evaluation.)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis would be a mechanism allowing species to define their own degree of \nclustering. I understand this also happens in nature, see this recent \nnews article about buterflies that vary the complexity of their wing \npatterns depending on the size of the population they are within, which \nin turn varies who they mate with:\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4708459.stm\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
