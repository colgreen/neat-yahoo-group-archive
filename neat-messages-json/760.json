Is that speciation visualization\n&gt; built into your release, Ken?  Is this what Tyler&#39;s referring to?\n&gt; \n\nYeah my release produces the visualizations.  I don&#39;t really know \nthat there is any way of producing these visualizations that&#39;s \neasier than just writing the code to do it.  Perhaps it would be \neasier to generate XML and then have it turned into a picture like \nDerek and Philip do....I personally generated screen graphics using \ngtk.  But the work of keeping track of species sizes and borders \n(for the purposes of visualizing) has to be done somewhat in code so \nthe data is there at the end (or as it runs, if you are trying to \nvisualize during a run).\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
