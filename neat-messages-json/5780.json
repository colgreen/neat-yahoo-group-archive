I&#39;m hoping in the next\nfew weeks I can get the paper up here, and get all of the source code\nposted (it&#39;s all C++ written for Linux boxes).\n\nI have 10 conditions in my experiment, which is basically a repeat of\nKen&#39;s competitive coevolution complexification experiment from a few\nyears back. The conditions are standard objective neat, random search,\nand then 4 different methods of novelty search using NCD, repeated\nwith and without minimal criteria. A few of these novelty search\napproaches stand out in particular in their performance in finding\ndominant strategies and objective performance.\n\nMuch thanks to Ken and the rest of you for answering my questions the\npast year or so, this users group has provided much useful guidance.\nHopefully the paper doesn&#39;t turn out as badly as I think it will, and\nis of interest to some here. Too much time coding, not enough time\nwriting.\n\n\n-Drew\n\n"}}
