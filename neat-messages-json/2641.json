It works by feeding the player every\n&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; board and assessing their response against a full\n&gt; &gt; knowledge fo the game tree.  Thus if a win is\n&gt; &gt; possible, they score 1.0 for picking any move that\n&gt; &gt; evenually leads to a win.  Optionally they score\n&gt; less\n&gt; &gt; for a move that leads to a stalemate (partial\n&gt; &gt; success).  Also optionally, illegal moves attract\n&gt; -ve\n&gt; &gt; scores.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I may have to dig around in the archives and see if\n&gt; there&#39;s a more detailed\n&gt; explanation of this technique (did you post one\n&gt; before?).\n\nYup, look for something with &quot;TTT PPS&quot; in the title, I\nthink.\n\nI think I even posted example code at one point...\n\n&gt; This certainly seems like a better evaluation method\n&gt; than some I&#39;ve seen (if\n&gt; I&#39;m understanding it correctly).  Seems like you&#39;re\n&gt; rewarding very generic,\n&gt; and not very good, play, though.  Let&#39;s say this is\n&gt; the board:\n&gt; \n&gt; 123\n&gt; 456\n&gt; 789\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say the ANN is playing X&#39;s.  It plays at 9. \n&gt; You give it 1 point for\n&gt; that move, correct?  Then for all other possible\n&gt; next moves, you evaluate\n&gt; its responses.  What about the branch where O plays\n&gt; at 5?  Does the ANN\n&gt; receive the same score for a move at 4 as it does\n&gt; for a move at 7, 8, 6, or\n&gt; 3?  4 could eventually lead to a win, but it&#39;s a\n&gt; poorer move (in general)\n&gt; than one that makes a potential win for the next\n&gt; move, right?\n\nI don&#39;t care how far away in the future the win might\nbe...\n\nBut I do make the assumption that neither player will\never make a mistake (beyond the one that might be in\nthe mobve we are assessing).  So that ony moves that\nlead to a _certain_ win are rewarded, because if the\nwin is not certain then we know that the opponent will\ntake advantage.\n\nYou can do this in TTT because the whole game graph is\nrelatively small...\n\n&gt; It would seem if you&#39;re not making these\n&gt; distinctions that the quality of\n&gt; evolved play could actually be very bad.  Have you\n&gt; then tested the player\n&gt; after using this kind of evaluation, e.g., by\n&gt; playing it yourself or putting\n&gt; it against a random player?\n\nI did in the past.  I have to upgrade the code to the\nlatest SLEAT before I can do it again, but I must do\nthat....\n\nI expect it to play well, but with the odd blindspot. \nUnlike a human, of course, the blindspots could easily\nbe for some of the simplest situations.  I can also\nget a print out of all the boards that a player gets\nwrong...\n\n    Ian\n\n\nSend instant messages to your online friends http://uk.messenger.yahoo.com \n\n"}}
