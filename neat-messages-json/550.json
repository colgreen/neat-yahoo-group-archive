I am still not able to see its value for\n&gt; &gt; scientific work.  \n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t see any value in being able to share data\n&gt; between NEAT implementations written in different\n&gt; languages?\n\nI don&#39;t see that it&#39;s a problem using the original\ndefinition of the data, perhaps written out as a text\nfile.  \n \n&gt; Or having a platform/language-independent way of\n&gt; visually rendering networks or run data?\n\nA NEAT network is defined by the original NEAT.  If it\nis expressed as a text file if can be read with any\nlanguage.  Run data can be anything at all and is not\nstandardized just by using XML.\n\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t forget\n&gt; &gt; that learning about the various software systems\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; mentioned requires time.  \n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s not really much to learn.  For instance,\n&gt; using\n&gt; XSL is just a matter of installing Xalan and\n&gt; generating the SVG file with a single command-line\n&gt; argument.  If you wanted to write your own style\n&gt; sheets, then you&#39;ve have to learn XSL, but there&#39;s\n&gt; no\n&gt; need.\n\nHere are acronyms and phrases that I would have to\nlearn about, in addition to the precise definition of\nXML.  These are copied from the messages in this\nthread:\n\nXSD\nXSL\nSVG\nXHTML\nXSLT\nDOM & Doc. Obj. Model Framework\nXalan\nXML dialect\n\nI know nothing about any of these.  I have no idea if\nmost NEAT users are similar to myself in this respect.\n\n&gt; And of course, if you don&#39;t want to do any of this,\n&gt; you don&#39;t have to.  But I think there is a desire\n&gt; among some in the group to develop a standard way of\n&gt; representing data that&#39;s independent of how it was\n&gt; evolved/generated.  If you have a better suggestion\n&gt; for such a format than XML, please let us know.\n\nI would prefer a plain text format, similar to that\nwhich Ken has shown in one of his messages.  Of course\nyou can take XML and remove all of the angle brackets\nand other extraneous symbols and you will get one\npossible text representation.\n\nOf course, I am commenting as an interested outsider,\nsince I am not currently running NEAT.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
