I think it is extremely important to be\n&gt; conceptually clear, for two primary reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) To communicate more effectively with others in the\n&gt; field, so that the exchange of ideas is more efficient\n&gt; and fruitful\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) To understand which features of the process you are\n&gt; emulating are inherent in your algorithm.  For\n&gt; example, understanding that artificial populations are\n&gt; subject to genetic drift just as natural populations\n&gt; are helps you better understand the dynamics of your\n&gt; system and helps you determine better starting points\n&gt; for parameters to try.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re working with Fogel&#39;s paradigm, which uses an\n&gt; extremely small population size (30, correct?).  This\n&gt; made me suspicious of Fogel&#39;s claims right off the\n&gt; bat...a population this small seems like a bad idea\n&gt; for a number of reasons, including genetic drift\n&gt; (Fogel doesn&#39;t actually use a genotype-&gt;phenotype\n&gt; mapping, but the basic concept still applies).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We may end up having to find our own words to\n&gt; &gt; describe the process we are choosing to use, because\n&gt; &gt; strictly speaking...we are not technically\n&gt; &gt; using nature&#39;s version of evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, but in those cases where the dynamics of natural\n&gt; systems map relatively well to what we&#39;re doing, we\n&gt; would want to capture that in the language we use,\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t we?\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, why would I use a term other than\n&gt; &quot;cooperative coevolution&quot; if that describes the\n&gt; dynamics of my system reasonably well?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
