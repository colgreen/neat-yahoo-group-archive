But the information should be u=\r\np-front going in rather than \n&gt; withheld and unanswered.\n\nAndy, I&#39;m trying =\r\nto figure out what&#39;s bothering you.  You express\nimpatience that every poss=\r\nible question has not been answered within\none year of the debut of a compl=\r\netely new methodology.  It verges on\nparanoia to suggest that we are &quot;withh=\r\nolding&quot; information (the source\ncode is released; anyone can perform any ex=\r\nperiment that they wish). \nI suppose you just don&#39;t realize how much effort=\r\n goes into running\nexperiments and writing papers. \n\nNotice that others in =\r\nthis group ask questions that are couched as\nfriendly discussion.  Yet you =\r\ntake the attitude that someone is hiding\nsomething from you and you are the=\r\nrefore &quot;disturbed.&quot;  \n\nYou should change your tone.  Instead of attacking t=\r\nhe source for not\nhaving answered every question that you have and performe=\r\nd every\nexperiment that you personally believe we should ever perform, why =\r\nnot\nput it more like, &quot;It would be interesting to see if...&quot;  or &quot;One\nexper=\r\niment I&#39;d like to perform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting question is\nwhether...=\r\n&quot; In other words, what is accomplished by your aggressive,\nconfrontational =\r\ndemeanor?\n\nI remember hearing once, though I do not remember the source, an=\r\n\ninteresting quote on scientific research.  To paraphrase: &quot;Good\nscientific=\r\n research answers hard questions.  However, the best\nscientific research ra=\r\nises entirely new questions that we never could\nhave even asked before.&quot;  T=\r\nhink of quantum physics.  The uncertainty\nprinciple has led to endless disc=\r\nussion of paradoxes and\nimpossibilities, with no end in sight, but we do no=\r\nt see people\naccusing Heisenberg of trying to hide the &quot;truth.&quot;  Instead, i=\r\nt is a\ncredit to his discovery that we are now asking such profound questio=\r\nns.\n\nSo let me suggest to you that you change your tone and drop the\nconfro=\r\nntational demeanor.  That is not an appropriate way to speak to\ncolleagues,=\r\n or to anyone else for that matter, and I sincerely hope to\nmaintain the ex=\r\nceptional positive atmosphere this group has maintained\nthroughout 5 years =\r\n(believe it or not!) of fruitful and interesting\ndiscussion.\n\nLet me also a=\r\ndd that I am not the moderator (who is Derek James, who\nhas done an excelle=\r\nnt job), and therefore this is just my personal\nsuggestion.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
