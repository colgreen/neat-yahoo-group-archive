This would be hand-crafter in most real r=\r\nobots, or achieved via some form of reinforcement; opening evolutionary con=\r\ntrollers to external environment inputs, and paying for coordinated, situat=\r\nion-specific behavior, like navigating a corridor, possibly a maze, means p=\r\nlaying a different game altogether.  However, achieving (modular) behavior =\r\nthis particular with neuro-evolution, via one genome, is an exciting resear=\r\nch track for us, which we have just began to investigate. \n\nBest regards,\nA=\r\nndrei\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Evert Haasdijk &lt;evert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nHi Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the interest and kind words. It was a fun experime=\r\nnt and we are enthusiastically moving forward with it. I&#39;ll try and get som=\r\ne videos out this week.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your paper prompted a few questions in my mi=\r\nnd:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Why did you use the &#39;habituation&#39; model for inputs (where y=\r\nou only\n&gt; &gt; generate inputs values for new stimuli)? Did you only try this =\r\nafter the\n&gt; &gt; more traditional way of doing it (just feeding the raw range-=\r\nfinder inputs\n&gt; &gt; into the network) did not work?\n&gt; \n&gt; As you suggest, it w=\r\nas the result of some trial-and-error; it is fairly straightforward to achi=\r\neve steady -i.e., non-reactive- locomotion without any sensors. It proved m=\r\nuch harder to get any reactivity (i.e., negotiating obstacles) into the beh=\r\naviour. Using raw range-finder inputs didn&#39;t produce that, that led us to t=\r\nry the habituation model. That being said, we&#39;re still working towards more=\r\n prominent obstacle avoidance/negotiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) I really liked yo=\r\nur idea of having a default behavior (controlled by the\n&gt; &gt; biases in the o=\r\nutput layer), with the rest of the ANN only getting non-zero\n&gt; &gt; inputs whe=\r\nn objects are sensed. Did you evolve the biases too, or hand code\n&gt; &gt; them =\r\nin some way? If you evolved them, what method did you use (what were\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne coordinates of the source/from node fed into the CPPN when querying for\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; a bias value)?\n&gt; \n&gt; All the substrate weights were determined by the evo=\r\nlved CPPN. I&#39;m not entirely sure about the technical detail of the biases, =\r\nI hope Andrei (who&#39;s on this mailing list as well) will answer this one in =\r\nmore detail.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) You say that the fact that some of the lines ar=\r\ne different in figure 9\n&gt; &gt; indicates that the ANN modules are different (i=\r\nn their wiring and function).\n&gt; &gt; But wouldn&#39;t you see different lines even=\r\n with identical controllers in each\n&gt; &gt; module because different modules ar=\r\ne getting different inputs (e.g. when one\n&gt; &gt; leg moves close to a wall)?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The spikes in the graphs are caused by obstacles coming into or disappe=\r\naring from sensor range. The base levels of the graphs (particularly differ=\r\nent in 9c) differ only because of modular differentiation. I think, but can=\r\n&#39;t be certain without further analysis, that the direction and magnitude of=\r\n the spikes differs in part because of modular differentiation, as well.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Did you see any symmetry (e.g. left-right) or other form of=\r\n regularity in\n&gt; &gt; the gaits (like I see in my HyperNEAT-evolved gaits)?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Yes we did: typically, after a certain  amount of evolution, we would se=\r\ne symmetrical movement between the left and right legs. Not at all somethin=\r\ng that we pressed for; it just emerged.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Evert\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Overall I loved the work and look forward to more.
