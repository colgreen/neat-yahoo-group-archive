It&#39;s\nreally fun to watch! I am leaving it running overnight to see what happens.\nSo far the best I have seen has been about a five mini-step shuffle\nbackwards...although I have seen a few three mini-step forward shuffles.\n\nCan you post either the genome and or a movie of the best org you&#39;ve seen so\nfar? \n\nI second the notion that it would be cool to browse the archive, especially\nif you could choose archive members to view based on max distance from 0,0\nor something like that.\n\nIt might help you to visualize things if you added another viewing mode that\nput a dot in the 3D viewer for every x,y,z coordinate in the archive (one\ncolor) and in the current population (another color).\n\nWatching this also makes me wonder about the population losing its gradient\nand disengaging. Here is the potential concern (and I think mattias and ken\ndiscussed this already): Once all the easy to access points are found, if\nmost of the orgs are not getting somewhere new, they will all have equal\nfitnesses and the search will not be focused on the outside edge. Do you\nthink this is happening (and might this be why David mentioned that he saw a\nlot of repeats toward the end)? The visualization I just proposed might help\non this front. Do the points added in the archive tend to be further and\nfurther away from 0,0....or is it just filling in the spaces in the nearby\nvicinity? \n\nDespite these concerns/suggestions, it is very fun stuff to look at...and\nits exciting that you are hybridizing these ideas so quickly and testing\nthem. \n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: David D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:46:57 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New file uploaded to neat\n&gt; \n&gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I thought it would be awhile\n&gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combined.  I ran it while I\n&gt; was working on other stuff for a bit over 50,000 evaluations, checking\n&gt; in on it periodically.  The behavioral diversity was really\n&gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby steps and guys that were\n&gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them did &quot;the chair&quot;), although there\n&gt; were still a good number of repeats, especially near the end (falling\n&gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty common).  No one that I saw had a good\n&gt; walking gait, but I guess it&#39;s possible that one could have when I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an option to browse the archive. I&#39;m\n&gt; curious about a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing:\n&gt; \n&gt; -What did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems like there are a\n&gt; number of viable options here.\n&gt; \n&gt; -What do the nodes on the substrate mean, and are they just on a flat\n&gt; plane?  I used your older version when it was first released, and if I\n&gt; remember right the two on the left are inputs and the stuff on the\n&gt; right is various joints, but I wanted to make sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Similarly, what do you use as the 5th input on the CPPN?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt;&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the neat\n&gt;&gt; group.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;   File        : /novelty_nevh.rar\n&gt;&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Description : Novelty Search applied to evolving HyperNEAT\n&gt; leaky-integrator substrates controlling a 3D humanoid model.
