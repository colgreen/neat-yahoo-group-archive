But that=\r\n had the effect of making it hard to\n&gt; reduce the number of species when it=\r\n was too high.  This was because\n&gt; all existing species continued to receiv=\r\ne some proportion of new\n&gt; individuals, however wide the threshold is set. =\r\n This makes it hard\n&gt; to drive them to extinction.  Two points arise from t=\r\nhis:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1a) in the traditional scheme, reduction of species number tends t=\r\no\n&gt; happen by crow-baring all new individuals into the first few species,\n&gt;=\r\n so that the last few go extinct.  This is not what I intuitively\n&gt; thought=\r\n was happening and I&#39;m not sure I like it.\n\nIsn&#39;t that handled by the assig=\r\nnment of number of offspring to a\nspecies?  If species X is sceduled for ex=\r\ntinction, then the number of\noffspring that it is allowed to have in the ne=\r\nxt generation is a\nspecific number.  Of course, if the mating of two others=\r\n result in\ncreating an offspring that should rightly be in species X, then =\r\nso be\nit.  But the longer species X goes without improvement, the bigger it=\r\ns\npenalty, the fewer offspring it can have.  The fewer offspring it can\nhav=\r\ne, the less likely its individuals will reproduce.  Over time, the\nspecies =\r\nis penalized out of existence.  If it comes back because of\nhappenstance, t=\r\nhat&#39;s okay.\n\nBut that presumes that reproduction is on a species by species=\r\n basis. \nThat is, species X has a fitness of N that is adjusted by the\npopu=\r\nlation size and the time since last improvement.  Based on\ncalculations, it=\r\n is determined that the species should have P\noffspring in the next generat=\r\nion.  So, you generate 1 or 2 through\nelitism, some percentage through weig=\r\nht mutation, and the rest through\ncrossover, with a percentage of those bei=\r\nng to an extra-species mate. \nEvery offspring that is NOT due to crossover =\r\nwith an extra-species\nmate is guaranteed to be in the same species as it wa=\r\ns before, is it\nnot?\n\nIf those offspring created through extra-species mati=\r\nng should be in a\nnew species, so be it.  The question of species is one of=\r\n how much\ndiversity of structure is still close enough to be similar?  The\n=\r\nnumber of species then really just controls who mates with whom.  But\nisn&#39;t=\r\n that a bit of a backwards and/or arbitrary way of doing so?\n\nIt would be a=\r\n pain in the butt, computationally speaking, but perhaps\nthe decision of wh=\r\no should reproduce with who should be determined\nthrough some algorithm.  S=\r\nome genetic similarity metric (much like the\nspecies control is now) couple=\r\nd with a social status metric (fitness).\n A mating &#39;ritual&#39; (algorithm) all=\r\nows them to pair up based on &#39;best\nmatch&#39; with some inherent flexibility to=\r\n allow for search space\nflexibility. Then instead of keeping a number of sp=\r\necies, and worrying\nabout how many there are, you simply forgoe the &#39;specie=\r\ns&#39; metric, and\nadjust the mating algorithm so that it maintains genetic div=\r\nersity.\n\nFirst, track each distinct topology.  Each time a new topology is\n=\r\ncreated, calculate its difference to every other topology that\ncurrently ex=\r\nists in the population.  If a topology disappears and\nre-appears, then you =\r\nstill have the difference metric to those that\nwere processed before, so yo=\r\nu only have to recalculate it for those\ntopologies that appeared while that=\r\n topology was not present in the\npopulation.\n\nThen, devise a simple formula=\r\n that combines the topology difference\nmetric with the difference in fitnes=\r\ns metric.  Bias it so that it\nalways tries to seek someone close to themsel=\r\nves, but better than\nthemselves.  For each individual, create a list of who=\r\n they would most\nlike to mate with.\n\nThen go through and assign pairs.  For=\r\n the sake of argument, no\nindividual can mate more than once (or maybe twic=\r\ne?).  Once you have a\nlist of pairs, decide which pairs to breed based on t=\r\nhe idea of\nmaintaining genetic diversity.\n\nIt&#39;s just an idea.  I&#39;m not sure=\r\n if it has any benefits over the\nexisting system or not.  Nor do I have a c=\r\nlear idea of how it might be\nimplemented.  But maybe there is merit to the =\r\nidea.  Anybody have any\nthoughts or comments?\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
