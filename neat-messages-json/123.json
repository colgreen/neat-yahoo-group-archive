I&#39;m suggesting that the\n&gt; inputs to the network each turn are only for the two\n&gt; positions on the tableau that it is &quot;choosing&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, with the following tableau:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1  3  1\n&gt; 3  2  2\n&gt; \n&gt; As you suggested, you could either start out by\n&gt; inputting the values for two random positions, or you\n&gt; could always start in the upper left corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; And let&#39;s stick with your binary representation.  The\n&gt; values of the cards could be represented by two input\n&gt; nodes:\n&gt; \n&gt; Card value of 1: 1 0\n&gt; Card value of 2: 0 1\n&gt; Card value of 3: 1 1\n&gt; \n&gt; To represent an occupied space or not you only need\n&gt; one input node:\n&gt; \n&gt; No card present: 0\n&gt; Card present:    1\n&gt; \n&gt; To represent the position on the tableau, you could\n&gt; also use binary representation, e.g. with two rows and\n&gt; three columns, as above, you could use:\n&gt; \n&gt; X1: 0 0\n&gt; X2: 0 1\n&gt; X3: 1 0\n&gt; \n&gt; Y1: 0\n&gt; Y2: 1\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this representation scheme, you would have six\n&gt; input nodes for each position on the tableau (2 for\n&gt; the value of the card, 1 for whether or not there is a\n&gt; card, 2 for the X coordinate, and 1 for the Y\n&gt; coordinate), and you only need to input two tableau\n&gt; positions each turn, so your neural net only needs 12\n&gt; inputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; The outputs would be the X and Y coordinates of the\n&gt; next two positions to pick, so you would need a total\n&gt; of 6 outputs.\n&gt;  \n\nHey Derek, is the idea here that the X and Y coordinates\nwould be &quot;picked&quot; or just looked at next?  In other words,\nis the net &quot;looking around&quot; at all the cards as it chooses?\nThat would seem to be a way of doing this- have a limited \ninput field but allow it move it around and look at\nall the cards, and then make a decision (with a separate output\nnode) when it wants to.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
