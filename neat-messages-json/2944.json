I don&#39;t really know which is slower, evolving\n&gt; multipl=\r\ne sets of similar nets or evolving one monolithic net and using\n&gt; separate =\r\nboolean input nodes (or negative values to the optional\n&gt; nodes) to indicat=\r\ne when nodes should be ignored.  For example, you\n&gt; would need betting info=\r\nrmation about the flop and turn on the river,\n&gt; but would need some way to =\r\nindicate that the information is no longer\n&gt; relevant on the earlier rounds=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tend to think evolving separate networks is the better approach\n&gt; =\r\nbecause it will tell us more about the game itself.  As networks grow\n&gt; in =\r\nsize and complexity, the ability to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind\n&gt; their str=\r\nucture diminishes.\n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m guessing a lot of these tournaments would hav=\r\ne to be played.  In\n&gt; which\n&gt;&gt; case, it is insufficient to say &quot;a fraction =\r\nof a second&quot;.  I am\n&gt; forced to\n&gt;&gt; ask, which fraction?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a f=\r\nramework which I have used already which is not in any way\n&gt; as fast as pok=\r\ner eval (I wrote it before finding poker eval).  This is\n&gt; what I used to d=\r\no my simulations.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to calculate all the stats I mentioned pr=\r\neviously in my\n&gt; past experiments (using exhaustive evaluation of all possi=\r\nble hands to\n&gt; find your overall hand rank).  A session would consist of a =\r\n6 handed\n&gt; game of limit hold em which lasted 1000 hands.  Each bot would p=\r\nlay a\n&gt; session against a randomly selected group of 5 other bots.  I used =\r\na\n&gt; fixed size population of 50 bots, (i.e., 50,000 hands per generation).\n=\r\n&gt;  The total time for evaluating 1 generation, performing selection and\n&gt; m=\r\nutation, and serializing the bots to file (in case of a system crash)\n&gt; usi=\r\nng a AMD 3500+ was about 40 seconds on average.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was able to run seve=\r\nral hundred generations overnight and wake up to\n&gt; lovely and horrible resu=\r\nlts. :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; But I agree parallelizing it would be hella cool.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n think this is going to be my first step.  It will certainly help to\n&gt; fami=\r\nliarize myself with the details of NEAT.\n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; For anyone who&#39;s interested=\r\n, I&#39;ve posted it under &quot;maverick&quot; (what I\n&gt;&gt; named\n&gt;&gt; it long ago) on the n=\r\neat group file page.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t really see much in terms of an actual pok=\r\ner engine for this.\n&gt; How did you run hand simulations?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t re=\r\nally play well with others but if people are serious, I&#39;ll\n&gt;&gt; contribute.  =\r\nBut I hate yahoo messenger.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I guess we&#39;ll stick to this for now th=\r\nen.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
