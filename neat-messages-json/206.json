Whoever uses it is going to\nhave to write their own fitness function in Java (or\nmodify one of the existing examples).  But hopefully\nthe code will be reasonably clear and well-documented.\n:)\n\nWe&#39;re using JavaParty\n\nhttp://www.ipd.uka.de/JavaParty/\n\nfor the distributed environment, and hopefully between\nour Tic-Tac-Toe example, their benchmark examples, and\nour documentation, it shouldn&#39;t be *too* difficult to\nprogram a fitness function for a distributed\nenvironment (we&#39;re not distributing everything, just\nthe fitness evaluations).  \n\nSince it&#39;s Java-based, there shouldn&#39;t be any problems\nrunning it in a heterogenous distributed environment\n(we&#39;re currently developing and testing it in a 5-node\nenvironment with both WinXP on the master node and\nRedhat 9.0 on the slaves).\n\n&gt; In other words, are you\n&gt; trying to have an easy-to-use interface?\n\nOur first version will probably just have to be run\nfrom a command line, but all the evolutionary\nparameters can be defined in a single text file.  But\none of the earliest features we want to implement is\nan HTML interface in which you can enter values for\nparameters (such as mutation rates, compatibility\nthreshold values, etc.), and just click a &quot;run&quot;\nbutton.  We liked the way Ugo&#39;s version displays the\ntopology of individuals, so we&#39;ll be doing something\nsimilar (a dedicated browser window which displays the\nfittest individual, in SVG format).\n\nIf you&#39;re not familiar with SVG, check here:\n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/svg/main.html\n\nWe&#39;ve got two SVG layout algorithms for the ANN\ntopologies, one that displays the neural net in\nlayers, the other in a spiral pattern.  I&#39;ve uploaded\nsamples of one small and one larger network displayed\nboth ways into the Photos section of our Yahoo Group\npage:\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst\n\nThese are GIFs.  The actual SVGs are better quality\nand since they&#39;re rendered in vector graphics, they\nscale without loss of visual quality.\n\nWe hope that the technology and the approach we&#39;re\nusing will make for a relatively easy-to-use,\neasy-to-modify, Java-based implementation.  We&#39;re\nplanning on opensourcing it on SourceForge, hopefully\nby the end of year, but we don&#39;t really know when. \nI&#39;ll definitely announce here when that happens.  I\nhope some people will find it useful, and accumulate\nmore domains/fitness functions for it, but we&#39;ll see.\n\nDerek\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
