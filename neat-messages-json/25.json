Just\n&gt; as with biological organisms, the body and mind could\n&gt; complexify in a sort of feedback loop. \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re pretty far from being able to do something like\n&gt; this, but would such a domain be open-ended enough for\n&gt; you? :)\n\nWe&#39;re not far from doing this, it has been done, Karl Sims did it in \n1994. See http://web.genarts.com/karl/evolved-virtual-creatures.html . To \nmy mind, his work still stands out as the coolest in that particular \nfield. Implementing something similar wouldn&#39;t even take very long \ntime... (using existing physics libraries etc) \n\nHowever, this wasn&#39;t done using NEAT, if that was what you meant.\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
