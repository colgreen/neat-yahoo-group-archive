Each paper submitted to the GDS Track will b=\r\ne reviewed by experts in the field. The size and prestige of the GECCO conf=\r\nerence will allow many researchers to learn about your work, both at the co=\r\nnference and via the proceedings (GECCO has the highest impact rating of al=\r\nl conferences in the field of Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life)=\r\n.\n\nTRACK DESCRIPTION\n-----------------\n\nThe continuing growth in systems&#39; s=\r\nize and complexity has rendered the engineering traditions of rigid top-dow=\r\nn planning and control unsustainable. Understanding the evolution of natura=\r\nl complex systems - large sets of elements interacting locally and giving r=\r\nise to collective behavior =97 can help create a new generation of truly au=\r\ntonomous and adaptive artificial systems. Biological evolution has produced=\r\n the astounding complexity and diversity of living organisms based on rando=\r\nm mutations, nonrandom selection and self-organization. The Generative and =\r\nDevelopmental Systems (GDS) track seeks to unlock the full potential of &quot;in=\r\n silico&quot; evolution as a design methodology that can scale to systems of gre=\r\nat complexity. It aims to create complex and diverse artifacts that meet ou=\r\nr specifications with minimal guidance and programming effort.\n\nIndirect an=\r\nd open-ended representations: Representing more than the information needed=\r\n to produce a single individual, the genotype is a layered repository of ma=\r\nny generations of evolutionary innovation, and is shaped by two requirement=\r\ns: to be fit in the short term, and to be evolvable over the long term thro=\r\nugh its influence on the production of variation. &quot;Indirect representations=\r\n&quot; such as morphogenesis or string-rewriting grammars, which rely on develop=\r\nmental or generative processes, may allow long-term improvement via accumul=\r\nated elaborations and emergent new features. &quot;Direct representations&quot; are n=\r\not capable of open-ended elaboration because they are restricted to predefi=\r\nned features.\n\nComplex environments encourage complex phenotypes: While com=\r\nplex genotypes are not necessarily favored in simple environments, they may=\r\n enable unprecedented phenotypes and behaviors that can later successfully =\r\ninvade new, uncrowded niches in complex environments =97 which can create p=\r\nressure toward increasing complexity. Many factors may affect environmental=\r\n (hence genotypic) complexity, such as spatial structure, temporal fluctuat=\r\nions, or competitive co-evolution.\n\nMore is more: Today&#39;s typical numbers o=\r\nf generations, sizes of populations, and components inside individuals are =\r\nstill too small. Just as physics needs higher-energy accelerators and farth=\r\ner-reaching telescopes to understand matter and space-time, evolutionary co=\r\nmputation needs a strong boost in computational resolution and scope to und=\r\nerstand the spontaneous generation of complex functionality. Biological evo=\r\nlution involved 4 billion years and untold numbers of organisms. We expect =\r\nthat datacenter-scale computing power will be applied in the future to prod=\r\nuce artificially evolved artifacts of great complexity. How will we apply s=\r\nuch resources most efficiently?\n\nOver 150 years after Darwin&#39;s and Mendel&#39;s=\r\n work, and the subsequent &quot;Modern Synthesis&quot; of evolution and genetics, the=\r\n developmental process that maps genotype to phenotype is still poorly unde=\r\nrstood. Yet, development cannot remain an abstraction if we wish to encoura=\r\nge open-ended evolutionary novelty in artificial systems. The GDS track at =\r\nGECCO 2013 seeks to understand the full evolution-of-development (&quot;evo-devo=\r\n&quot;) picture. It stresses the importance of the generative and developmental =\r\nprocesses that generate the raw material for selection; such representation=\r\ns are uniquely capable of producing ongoing, open-ended innovation.\n\nWe inv=\r\nite all papers related to the evolution of complexity, including in the are=\r\nas of:\n*   artificial development, artificial embryogeny\n*   evo-devo robot=\r\nics, morphogenetic robotics\n*   evolution of evolvability\n*   gene regulato=\r\nry networks\n*   grammar-based systems, generative systems, rewriting system=\r\ns\n*   indirect mappings, compact encodings, novel representations\n*   measu=\r\nres of complexity, theories of scalable design\n*   morphogenetic engineerin=\r\ng\n*   neural development, neuroevolution, augmenting topologies\n*   spatial=\r\n computing, amorphous computing\n\nAdditionally, papers in the following area=\r\ns will be considered if they have a particular focus on representations and=\r\n/or scaling to high complexity:\n*   competitive co-evolution (arms races)\n*=\r\n   complex, spatially structured, and dynamically changing environments\n*  =\r\n diversity preservation, novelty search\n*   large numbers of generations, i=\r\nndividuals, and internal components\n*   unconventional computing, natural c=\r\nomputing, organic computing\n*   synthetic biology, biological and chemical =\r\nIT, artificial chemistry\n\nVENUE\n-----\n\nThe track and conference will be hel=\r\nd in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n---------------\n\n* Januar=\r\ny 23, 2013  - Paper submission deadline (Historically, the GECCO conference=\r\n chairs have granted a two week extension on the due date; please check the=\r\n GECCO website for the final deadline.)\n* April 17, 2013    - Camera-ready =\r\nversion of accepted articles\n* July 06-10, 2013  - GECCO 2013 Conference in=\r\n Amsterdam\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n--------------------\n\nMore information on =\r\nthe GDS track is at: http://iscpif.fr/gds2013\nand on the GECCO conference a=\r\nt: http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2013\n\nTo submit your paper to the GDS track,=\r\n visit http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2013/papers.html\n\nWe look forward to rea=\r\nding your paper.\n\n -- Michael Palmer, Ren=E9 Doursat, and Joshua Bongard, G=\r\nDS track chairs\n\n\n\n"}}
