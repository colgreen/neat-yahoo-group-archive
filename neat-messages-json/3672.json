It also was the first learning algorithm of \nany \n&gt; type that I k=\r\nnow of to solve double pole balancing without velocity \n&gt; inputs.  Another =\r\nthing that was interesting was that Gruau proved \nin \n&gt; his thesis that the=\r\n encoding can produce any graph structure, so it \n&gt; is complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; Howev=\r\ner, compared to more modern approaches I do not think it is a \n&gt; good choic=\r\ne today.  I think the focus was too much on completeness \n&gt; and too little =\r\non efficiency.  Being complete is not a great \n&gt; advantage if it takes too =\r\nlong to find the solution.  In fact, the \n&gt; more important issue is *bias*,=\r\n i.e. to what kinds of structures is \n&gt; any particular indirect encoding bi=\r\nased.  CE seems biased towards \n&gt; rigid iterative repreating structures, in=\r\ncluding hierarchies.  For \n&gt; example, it can solve parity problems of arbit=\r\nrary arity.  That can \n&gt; be impressive, but I don&#39;t believe partity problem=\r\ns are \n&gt; representative of most interesting problems.  CE also seems slow i=\r\nn \n&gt; terms of # of evaluation to a solution from the reported results.  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; All indirect encodings including CPPNs have some kind of bias \ntowards \n=\r\n&gt; producing certain kinds of structures.  Usually this bias is good \n&gt; fora=\r\n certain level fo complexity.  However, at low complexity, you \n&gt; may just =\r\nwant a direct encoding like regular NEAT.  For example, in \n&gt; pole balancin=\r\ng, there is no need for indirect encoding because the \n&gt; problem is small, =\r\nso NEAT will be much faster than CE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, CE is not in use very mu=\r\nch today as far as I know and is \n&gt; mainly a historical achievement that in=\r\nspired further work in \n&gt; indirect \n&gt; encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rafael C.P.&quot; &lt;kurama.youko.br@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Stanl=\r\ney, I&#39;d like to know if you&#39;ve analyzed the Cellular \nEncoding \n&gt; approach\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; while developing NEAT and what&#39;s your view about Cellular \nEncoding \n&gt; =\r\nX Direct\n&gt; &gt; Encoding, please.\n&gt; &gt; Reference:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://citeseer.ist.p=\r\nsu.edu/cache/papers/cs/13526/http:zSzzSzearth.cs.\n&gt; ttu.eduzSz~pyeattzSzpap=\r\nerszSzgp96.pdf/gruau96comparison.pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; Rafael C.P.\n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
