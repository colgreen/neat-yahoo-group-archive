And it&#39;s not necessarily the easiest thing in \nthe world to \n&gt; read.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also included is a line on the status of each of the client \nmachines \n&gt; participating in the experiment.  Colin, if you update to the \nlatest version \n&gt; of the client, your machine will show up there, too.  &lt;hint, \nhint&gt;  ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Take a look.  Let me know if you have any suggestions for \nimprovement.  \n&gt; Other than the obvious, like a champion topology visualization, a \nsample \n&gt; enlargement using the champion network, and a more scientific \nevaluation of \n&gt; how close the network is in its enlargement (signal to noise ratio \nand all \n&gt; that stuff).\n&gt; \n&gt; If it takes a while to load, it may be because my upstream \nbandwidth is kind \n&gt; of burdened at the moment.
