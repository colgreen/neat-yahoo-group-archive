So I guess I was straying into the area of 3, whereas you were \nlooking at 1...\n\n&gt; &gt;       Node creation would then be, I guess, a probability on each \n&gt; connection,\n&gt; &gt;maybe (waves hands vaguely)...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;I think we&#39;re all getting carried away a bit here. As Derek points out,\n&gt;the parameters probably don&#39;t effect a search that much anyway so\n&gt;co-evolving parameters will probbaly cause them to drift all over the\n&gt;shop, whilst having the same effect as the far simpler system we started\n&gt;out with! Probably the best we can hope for is to discover some &#39;ball\n&gt;park&#39; numbers for each of a given set of problem domains - so we can\n&gt;just pick a set that is best suited to a given problem domain each time\n&gt;we want to do a search.\n\nI take your point about getting carried away (it&#39;s always my first reaction \nto an area of research to go &quot;ah!  but what bout these 17 other related \nareas...&quot;) but I&#39;m not sure adding a mutability to each gene is quite the \nsame as adding a lot of global parameters (it&#39;s more like adding one \nmeta-parameter -- it is only one &quot;concept&quot;, but implemented separately on \neach gene)...  But it probably is for a different question from the one you \nwanted to look at :)\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
