The word &quot;layer&quot;\nis terribly ambiguous, and only becomes more =\r\nambiguous when you try to\nmerge neural networks with something like the sub=\r\nsumption\narchitecture, where layer means something completely different.\n\nT=\r\nhat being said, it should definitely be possible to start without any\nconne=\r\nctions from the inputs, or any connections at all really. Modular\nNEAT star=\r\nted with just one connection per module. I am myself at the\nmoment trying t=\r\no evolve simulated car controllers with very high\ndimensional (visual) inpu=\r\nt, and (although I am not using NEAT per se)\nstarting with an empty network=\r\n seems to be a more promising avenue\nthan starting with all inputs connecte=\r\nd.\n\nJulian\n\nOn 5/11/05, Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  =\r\n--- Philip Tucker &lt;ptucker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If, by input co=\r\nnnections, you mean connections\n&gt;  &gt; incoming to the input\n&gt;  &gt; layer,  tho=\r\nse don&#39;t have weights, they serve only to\n&gt;  &gt; pass the input\n&gt;  &gt; values t=\r\no the input neurons. \n&gt;  &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Whoa!
