All the attention shows t=\r\nhere&#39;s something intuitively appealing that feels natural about this domain=\r\n. Maybe it could also succeed on Slashdot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThanks Ken.

I have been hoping=\r\n it might happen on its own, but if it doesn&#39;t we may try to submit somethi=\r\nng early next week. \n\n&gt; I also wanted to make a slightly more controversial=\r\n point of praise, which I hope you don&#39;t mind, but one of my favorite parts=\r\n of the paper is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Because it is notoriously difficult to quantif=\r\ny attributes\n&gt; such as &quot;impressiveness&quot; and &quot;complexity&quot;, we make no effort=\r\n\n&gt; to do so here. Instead, we attempt to visually represent\n&gt; the interesti=\r\nng diversity of morphologies and behaviors that\n&gt; evolved once evolution wa=\r\ns provided with more materials\n&gt; and a sophisticated encoding.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I real=\r\nly appreciated the open acknowledgment of the potential pretense of these k=\r\ninds of measures. Given the recognition this paper is already receiving, it=\r\n&#39;s nice to see that sometimes people can agree that something is interestin=\r\ng simply by looking at it rather than through a mysterious quantification t=\r\nhat no one really understands. (Although of course that doesn&#39;t mean measur=\r\ning something is always bad either, but it does tend to be overemphasized i=\r\nn many cases.)\n&gt; \nThanks. I agree. But, as you&#39;ve said many times, reviewer=\r\ns don&#39;t like evaluating subjective things on their own, and they lean on p-=\r\nvalues and demand meaningless quantitative comparisons because they are unc=\r\nomfortable not having an excuse to accept/reject a paper. I love quantitati=\r\nve measures and p-values when they help, but I think it is unfortunate that=\r\n many reviewers think that they are *necessary* for publication. \n\nI actual=\r\nly submitted another paper to GECCO that was rejected that was similar to t=\r\nhis work in that it showed interesting visual results, but did not attempt =\r\nto force a quantification or experimental comparison that would have been u=\r\nninformative. The response? A rejection, with comments like this one:\n\n&quot;The=\r\n paper is grammatically well written, and organized. There are many illustr=\r\nations showing the a variety of evolved results. They all look very impress=\r\nive, and the system certainly seems to have promise.\n\nUnfortunately, there =\r\nis absolutely no empirical analysis included in the paper to support this r=\r\nesearch. Therefore, this paper is not suitable for academic publication in =\r\nits current form. A scientifically rigorous analysis must be given, which i=\r\ns expected for all scientific papers in evolutionary computation, and GECCO=\r\n in particular. Issues that must be addressed include: evolutionary perform=\r\nance; statistical likelihood of solution quality; effects of experimental p=\r\narameters; effects of target models; etc.&quot;\n\nWhen I read that I thought: &quot;Th=\r\nis is exactly what Ken has been complaining about!&quot; It&#39;s everything you&#39;ve =\r\nbeen saying about reviewers distilled into one comment. They like the ideas=\r\n and results, and thought the technical advance was impressive and new, but=\r\n because I didn&#39;t present numbers and p-values they rejected it. Apparently=\r\n if I had fiddled with the parameters a bit and showed them plots and p-vla=\r\nues=85which would not have shed any light on the main innovation of the pap=\r\ner=85then they would have had an excuse to accept the paper.

One hypothesis for the lack of in=\r\ncreased complexity is that most work, including Sims&#39;, evolves morphologies=\r\n composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting th=\r\ne design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work =\r\nhave been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation.=\r\n Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materia=\r\nls and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-produc=\r\ning network (CPPN).

We also find that locomotion performance increas=\r\nes as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be =\r\nincreased with different cost functions without stifling performance, and t=\r\nhat organisms can be evolved at different levels of resolution. These findi=\r\nngs suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards e=\r\nvolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures.

Thes=\r\ne findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale to=\r\nwards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatu=\r\nres. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CP=\r\nPN-encoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversity-encouraging te=\r\nchniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex an=\r\nd interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As always, please let me know if you have any comments or questi=\r\nons!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; PS.
