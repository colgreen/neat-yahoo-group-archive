But if there is no recurrency,\n&gt;=\r\n then it should be possible to activate it in ONE time step by just\n&gt; activ=\r\nating each of the nodes in the proper order.  That&#39;s what I \ndid. \n&gt; For a =\r\ngiven topology, I do a dependency analysis.  From that, I \nfigure\n&gt; out wha=\r\nt the proper order should be in order to activate individual\n&gt; nodes.  If I=\r\n activate the nodes in that order, then the inputs will\n&gt; reach the outputs=\r\n in a single activation of the network.  This, in\n&gt; turn, reduces the numbe=\r\nr of calculations required for an \nactivation.\n&gt; \n&gt; For recurrent networks,=\r\n you can do it in much the same way.  \nHowever,\n&gt; if node A has an input co=\r\nming from node B, but node B hasn&#39;t been\n&gt; calculated, you use an assumed o=\r\nutput of 0 for node B.  On the next\n&gt; activation of the network, node B *ha=\r\ns* been calculated.  Let&#39;s say\n&gt; it&#39;s output was X.  So A will use X as the=\r\n value of the input from \nB.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mind you, if you use this technique, you =\r\nwill save a great deal on \nCPU\n&gt; resources, since you don&#39;t have to do near=\r\nly as many calculations. \n&gt; However, you can&#39;t (necessarily) mix the paradi=\r\ngms.  You can&#39;t \ndevelop\n&gt; a topology using Ken&#39;s activation technique and =\r\nexpect it to \nperform\n&gt; identically using mine, and vice versa.  It might, =\r\nbut it might \nnot! \n&gt; So whatever you decide on, stick with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Realis=\r\ntically, how you do it isn&#39;t that important.  The network \nwill\n&gt; learn (or=\r\n evolve) to solve the problem using whatever method you\n&gt; decide upon.  The=\r\n only advantage of one method over another is in \nhow\n&gt; much computational =\r\nresources are required either during testing or \nin\n&gt; final implementation.=\r\n  My NEAT was written in Perl, which is an\n&gt; interpreted language, and so c=\r\nould benefit from as much \naccelleration\n&gt; as I could find.  That&#39;s why I o=\r\npted for the less computationally\n&gt; intensive activation method.  If you do=\r\nn&#39;t care about CPU resources\n&gt; during the firing of the network, then go wi=\r\nth whatever is easiest \nfor\n&gt; you to code.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/24/05=\r\n, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Kevin,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me add to =\r\nCharles comments a bit...although Charles does a \ngood\n&gt; &gt; job giving some =\r\nbackground, I believe there are some things \nCharles\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t mention you=\r\n should be aware of.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, see the question, &quot;How are networks wi=\r\nth arbitrary \ntopologies\n&gt; &gt; activated?&quot; in the NEAT FAQ located at:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That question=\r\n gives some background on your own question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The short answer is t=\r\nhat every node is activated on every \ntimestep\n&gt; &gt; from ALL incoming connec=\r\ntions.  Any node that has not yet \nreceived\n&gt; &gt; input it assumed to be outp=\r\nutting a zero.  In other words, time\n&gt; &gt; delay does not enter into it at al=\r\nl (I have never actually used \nthe\n&gt; &gt; time-delay code).  Also, activation =\r\ndoes not travel all the way \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; inputs to outputs in a single timeste=\r\np unless there is a direct\n&gt; &gt; connection from inputs to outputs.  But acti=\r\nvation traveling over\n&gt; &gt; intervening nodes will take extra time to get the=\r\nre.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what happens is that a node that connects to itself receive=\r\ns \nthe\n&gt; &gt; activation that itself output on the *previous* timestep.  \nNetw=\r\norks\n&gt; &gt; are activated over a series of timesteps.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is important=\r\n to note that you should *not* be relaxing a \nnetwork\n&gt; &gt; during a control =\r\ntask like food gathering.  Charles mentions\n&gt; &gt; relaxation but that is only=\r\n appropriate for classification tasks\n&gt; &gt; where the network is trying to de=\r\ncide on a final answer.  See the\n&gt; &gt; question, &quot;How do I ensure that a netw=\r\nork stabilizes before \ntaking\n&gt; &gt; its output(s) for a classification proble=\r\nm?&quot; in the NEAT FAQ for\n&gt; &gt; more info on this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a continual cont=\r\nrol task like food gathering (or most tasks \nNEAT\n&gt; &gt; is used for) there is=\r\n always new input coming in and new output\n&gt; &gt; coming out, so the network w=\r\nill never relax, since there is\n&gt; &gt; no &quot;final&quot; answer.  The only question t=\r\nhat comes up is how many\n&gt; &gt; times (steps) to activate the network per worl=\r\nd tick.  Almost any\n&gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;ve heard of activates once per tick, b=\r\nut it is \npossible\n&gt; &gt; to imagine activating &gt;1 time per tick, which is equ=\r\nivalent to\n&gt; &gt; speeding up the rate of thought.   However, note that more\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; activations also means more CPU time per world tick.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope thi=\r\ns help; feel free to ask any other questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Charles Tarun &lt;ctarun@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Hello Maitrikaruna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to offer any help I can, and I&#39;m =\r\nsure others will\n&gt; &gt; also help,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also don&#39;t have any training =\r\non NN either, but I&#39;ve been \nread a\n&gt; &gt; lot about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them.
