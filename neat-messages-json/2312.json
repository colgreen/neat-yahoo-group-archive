A sort of  EP-NEAT fusion, this is basically \nwhat I\n&gt; &gt;was describing a while ago in the discussion about good benchmark\n&gt; &gt;functions. Does anyone have a good argument for/against this? I \nsuppose\n&gt; &gt;aligning the input/output value ranges of different functions is \none\n&gt; &gt;problem, but that could be solved by with a bit of normalisation \nI suspect.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is also an idea on my todo-list and will fit very easily into \nthis \n&gt; framework...\n&gt; \n\nI also think this is a good idea, and on my todo list as well.  \nThere is no reason sigmoids should be the only activation function, \nand the more I have thought about this, the more convinced I have \nbecome that it would help, though the question of what those other \nfunctions should be is important.  Have you guys look at Mattias \nFagerlund&#39;s DelphiNEAT function approximation demo?  I believe he \nused several non-sigmoid activation functions in that version of \nNEAT, and as can be seen, it approximates some pretty diverse \nfunctions quite well.\n\nken\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; In 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n"}}
