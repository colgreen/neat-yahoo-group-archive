So even if you only used random\n&gt; selection, you would end up with larger, more complex\n&gt; individuals at the end of your run.  They may not be\n&gt; able to *do* anything meaningful, but they would still\n&gt; be significantly different from their ancestors.\n\n\nThis is not entirely true.  We have actually done this experiment.  \nWhat NEAT actually does under these conditions is expand its *range*\nof complexity, but the simplest species generally remains intact since\nit does just as well as the more complex ones that continue to appear.\nIt is true that over 500 generations or so the simplest species may\ngain 5 or 10 connections, but this is trivial, since the most complex\nspecies gain hundreds.  In other words, simplicity is protected in\nNEAT by speciation as long as its competitive, just as complexity is\nprotected!\n\n(these results are reported in a very-soon-to-be-published paper)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
