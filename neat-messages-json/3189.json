If it \n&gt; doesn&#39;t exist, then you create a new innovatio=\r\nn ID.\n&gt; \n&gt; How you store innovations so that you can do these searches quic=\r\nkly is \n&gt; up to you.  It may vary depending on your implementation language=\r\n, \n&gt; programming paradigm, or personal preference.  Commonly, you might\nuse=\r\n a \n&gt; hash table (std::map&lt;&gt; in C++) or maintain an ordered list of \n&gt; inno=\r\nvations (thereby making a binary search possible).\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, in C++,=\r\n I keep two innovation lists.  One is my global\nlist, \n&gt; the other is the l=\r\nist of new innovations for the current generation.\n It \n&gt; works something l=\r\nike this.\n&gt; \n&gt; GetInnovationId\n&gt;    Binary search global Innovation list - =\r\nif found return id\n&gt;    Linear search generation Innovation list - if found=\r\n return id\n&gt;    Add new id to generation Innovation list\n&gt; \n&gt; At end of eac=\r\nh Generation\n&gt;    Copy generation Innovation list to global Innovation list=\r\n\n&gt;    Clear generation Innovation list\n&gt;    Sort global Innovation list\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In words..  Any new innovations, within a single generation, are \n&gt; maint=\r\nained in an unsorted list.  At the end of each generation, that \n&gt; unsorted=\r\n list is merged into the master sorted list.  The advantage of \n&gt; this sche=\r\nme is that searching for Innovations remains very fast and \n&gt; storage remai=\r\nns O(n).  One disadvantage is that it&#39;s slightly more\ncomplex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope th=\r\nat helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\nSteve,\n\nThanks for the quick response.\n\nThe idea =\r\nof the two innovation lists is interesting and one I hadn&#39;t\nthought of.\n\n&gt;I=\r\nf it does exist, then you should simply reuse that innovation ID\nThis is th=\r\ne bit I&#39;m still not clear on. In my example, things work OK\nup to & includi=\r\nng adding innovation number 6 (link 3 to 5). \nBut for the second genome whe=\r\nn we try to add innovation number 7 (5 to\n4) should we simply resuse innova=\r\ntion number 5 (5 to 4)?\n(even though when we draw out the resulting phenoty=\r\npes the 5 to 4\nlinks are in two different places on the network).\n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
