If \nit does exist, then you should simply reuse that innovation ID.  If it \ndoesn&#39;t exist, then you create a new innovation ID.\n\nHow you store innovations so that you can do these searches quickly is \nup to you.  It may vary depending on your implementation language, \nprogramming paradigm, or personal preference.  Commonly, you might use a \nhash table (std::map&lt;&gt; in C++) or maintain an ordered list of \ninnovations (thereby making a binary search possible).\n\nPersonally, in C++, I keep two innovation lists.  One is my global list, \nthe other is the list of new innovations for the current generation.  It \nworks something like this.\n\nGetInnovationId\n   Binary search global Innovation list - if found return id\n   Linear search generation Innovation list - if found return id\n   Add new id to generation Innovation list\n\nAt end of each Generation\n   Copy generation Innovation list to global Innovation list\n   Clear generation Innovation list\n   Sort global Innovation list\n\nIn words..  Any new innovations, within a single generation, are \nmaintained in an unsorted list.  At the end of each generation, that \nunsorted list is merged into the master sorted list.  The advantage of \nthis scheme is that searching for Innovations remains very fast and \nstorage remains O(n).  One disadvantage is that it&#39;s slightly more complex.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
