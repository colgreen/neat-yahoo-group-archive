I was trying to point out that \nto me, &quot;made a decision&quot; was a bit strong for what I thought the lemurs \nwere doing.  Obviously &quot;decision&quot; is a vague term and covers a range of things:\n\n- simple mechanical effects, such as &quot;impacts with outer balls decided \nwhich pocket the cue ball would land in\n\n- information theory &quot;choices&quot; such as &quot;the algorithm decides on a set of \nvalues which...&quot;\n\n- GAP\n\n- conscious choices where some entity is aware of the choice\n\nAnd in the GAP we have a whole range of other distinctions which don&#39;t \nusually come up, but which we are getting into here:\n\n- complex but inflexible behaviour (e.g. Sphex)\n\n- unconscious decisions (where a lot of processing has gone on but nothing \never separated out a single choice and labelled it as such -- example, \nunconsciously avoiding furniture whilst crossing a room)\n\n- learned exact mimicry (e.g. where an entity does what it was trained \nwithout a question of doing otherwise)\n\n- learned variable behaviour (e.g. the lemur, the sequence is variable but \npersonally I don&#39;t think the lemur has the choice of not matching it, it \nwas trained to match it)\n\n- &quot;intelligent&quot; decisions where some entity is has internal structures \nrepresenting the choice and could be queried as to what choice it was \nmaking (awkward phrasing here to avoid using the loaded word &quot;aware&quot; -- \ne.g. we have no proven examples but an intelligent but non-conscious AI \nwould be categorized here)\n\n- conscious choices using learned reasoning (e.g. applying known maths \ntechniques)\n\n- conscious choices involving ad hoc reasoning (e.g. when you meet a \nlogical but previously unknown problem)\n\nSo what I was trying to do was distinguish between &quot;learned variable \nbehaviour&quot; which is where I think the lemurs are, and any of the &quot;higher&quot; \ndefinitions, such as &quot;conscious choice using learned reasoning&quot;.\n\nTo put it another way, the lemur has been &quot;trained&quot; to repeat the sequence, \nit did not &quot;learn&quot; to repeat the sequence.  The difference being that the \nlatter comes with understanding of what one is doing (understanding which \ncould, for example, be used to adapt the ability to types of sequence).\n\nExperiments of this sort have to be treated very carefully.  They only as \ndemonstrate the thing they were designed to demonstrate.  This one \ndemonstrates short-term sequence memory.  That is the one component that \nthe lemur could not perform without.  It is tempting to try to draw further \nconclusions about how the lemur&#39;s mind works or how it learns or what \nexactly it is doing (I&#39;m not saying you were), but history is dotted with \ncases where folk did that and came unstuck.  Animals are very complex \nsystems which do sophisticated things.  And we are programmed to interpret \ndetailed mind-state information from the actions of other humans.  Its very \nvery easy to unconsciously apply that interpretation to animals and assume \nthat they are achieving things the same way we do.  Whereas in fact the \nhistory of such studies has generally been about discovering that they do \nnot.  e.g. chimps and sign language, or even Clever Hans.\n\n-\n\nAnyway, to get back to the interesting stuff.  Do you think that sequence \nmemory is achieved by having a central &quot;sequencer&quot; which temporarily wires \nits &quot;first, second, third&quot; outputs to the sub-nets for the concepts in the \nsequence?  Or would you think that different types of sequence are \nprocessed in different ways?  I know that when I learn music it feels very \ndifferent from memorizing (say) a phone number.\n\n\tIan B\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
