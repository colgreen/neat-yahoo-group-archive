So, what you describe isn&#39;t the case.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThink of it as each node having a pair of coordinates on a 2D  \n&gt; Cartesian=\r\n grid.  If your network starts out with, for example, one  \n&gt; input node, o=\r\nne bias node, and one output node, you might assign them  \n&gt; initial positi=\r\nons of:\n&gt; \n&gt; Node0: Input: 0,0\n&gt; Node1: Bias: 0,1\n&gt; Node2: Output: 1,0.5\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not going to attempt ASCII art b/c Yahoo groups botches  \n&gt; everythi=\r\nng.  But basically, this network is flowing from left to right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, s=\r\nay you split 1 and 2.  You get a node between them; it&#39;s at  \n&gt; (0.5,0.75) =\r\nusing our imaginary 2D system.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, Node3 is always refers to a single =\r\nspecific node.  Hence NodeX  \n&gt; does as well...  and so, Link (x,y) should =\r\nalso always be the same,  \n&gt; and so yes, it should share the innovation num=\r\nber.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry that I did not explain this very eloquently; but, I hop=\r\ne I  \n&gt; got everything correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\nSteve,\n\nThanks again for the=\r\n quick reply\n\nSo, to take your example. I think the innovations table looks=\r\n like:\n\nInn no   node from-to    xy from     to\n1             0   2        =\r\n0,0       1,0.5\n2             1   2        0,1       1,0.5 \n3             1=\r\n   3        0,1       0.5,0.75\n4             3   2        0.5,0.75  1,0.5\n\n=\r\n\nNow, for a 2nd genome, instead of splitting from node 1 to 2, we split\nnod=\r\ne 0 to 2\nand get node 3 in a different position, the innovations table beco=\r\nmes\n\n\nInn no   node from-to    xy from     to\n1             0   2        0,=\r\n0       1,0.5\n2             1   2        0,1       1,0.5 \n3             1  =\r\n 3        0,1       0.5,0.75\n4             3   2        0.5,0.75  1,0.5\n5  =\r\n           0   3        0,0       0.5,0.25\n6             3   2        0.5,0=\r\n.25  1,0.5\n\n\nSo really its the xy co-ord from and to that distinguishes the=\r\n links,\nrather than the\nnode numbers from-to ?\n\nDoes it follow that, if at =\r\nsome point we tried (on another genome) to\nadd the following :\n\nInn no   no=\r\nde from-to    xy from     to\n7             4   2        0.5,0.25  1,0.5\n\nNE=\r\nAT would say &#39;that innovation already exists as innov number 6&#39;. So\nwe igno=\r\nre the node \nnumbers & just work off the grid references?\n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
