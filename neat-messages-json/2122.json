Consider this case: two modules (A and B)\n&gt;compose network X. Under your algorithm (if I understand correctly) A gets\n&gt;an evolution phase, B gets an evolution phase, and then X evolves one\n&gt;generation. So now when we come back to A&#39;s evolution phase, the\n&gt;population fitness rankings may have completely changed, because fitness\n&gt;is dependent on B&#39;s evolution is well. In modular NEAT this proved to be\n&gt;the biggest weak point in the algorithm, since it yielded no real module\n&gt;evolution (if you read the paper: modules evolved to be /highly/\n&gt;generalist, and then it turned out that only bindings really mattered for\n&gt;fitness).\n\nThis depends a great-deal on what type of modules you are attempting to \nimplement.  Remember the discussion of &quot;modularity and interfaces&quot; from \nearlier in the year (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/message/1871).  If \nthe modules were just encoded by parts of the genome, then no fitness \nseparate from the fitness of the whole would be required (just as, even \nthough the same gene might be present in multiple genomes, there&#39;s no need \nto try to calculate a cross-population fitness for it).\n\nIn fact, even if the modules are not contained in the genome, if they are \nsimply inherited from the genomes parent(s) then they will act as if they \nwere contained in the genome.  In this case, the only special handling \nrequired would be to delete a module once no genomes reference it.\n\nI have the impression you are considering some scheme which tries to \ncalculate the fitness of individual modules.  Presumably so that you can \nvary the frequency of the modules in the population accordingly?  A scheme \nlike this comes up against the &quot;credit assignment problem&quot; which is a \nfundamental problem of AI and insoluble in the general case ((because \nunderstanding the allocation of an algorithm&#39;s success/failure amongst the \nparts of the algorithm is at least as complex as the algorithm itself; and \nthus at least as complex as the solution to the (presumably general) \nproblem you are setting it)).\n\nHowever, in the specific case here, one can calculate instantaneous, \nrelative fitnesses for different alleles of the same module.  The fitnesses \nwon&#39;t carry over to a context where the module&#39;s usage has changed (e.g. \nanother generation).  And it won&#39;t allow comparison with a different \nmodule.  What you would need to do would be to hold the rest of the system \nconstant, and try every allele of the module in every genome (or at least \nall the genomes which use this module).  The difference in the average \nfitness of the population when using module-1 allele-1 and when using \nmodule-1, allele-2 is the instantaneous difference in the fitness of those \ntwo alleles.\n\nHowever, I wonder if such an approach is useful.  Examining the \ninstantaneous fitness is akin to using a steepest descents approach -- e.g. \nit looks at one point on the fitness surface and chooses a (OK stochastic) \ndirection based on the point.  Also this type of module fitness provides no \ninformation about the insertion of modules into genomes, or the choice of \nmodule type (as opposed to allele) when the insertion happens -- so its \nonly helping with a small part of the problem.\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
