Yet\n&gt; trade-offs always seem to emerge when we try to bestow such capabilities explicitly. For\n&gt; example, if we added multiplication, it may theoretically allow certain key computations to be\n&gt; represented easily, yet it also gives evolution a new power to more easily destroy what it has\n&gt; built through trivial mutations (because multiplication is more powerful than summation).\n\nPoint acknowledged.\n\n&gt; I am sure that CPPNs as a representational formalism can be improved, yet the presence of\n&gt; these nagging trade-offs makes me think that the idea of a super-powerful representation is a\n&gt; false ideal. It seems to me at this point that evolution in nature succeeds despite the limited\n&gt; nature of its representation rather than because DNA is somehow near perfect.\n\nI accept you chain of reasoning but I don&#39;t accept the\nfoundation/axiom that natural neurons don&#39;t perform multiplication and\ncomparison (and possibly quite a few other operations) at the neuronal\nlevel. Christoph Koch&#39;s work is a good starting point to learn more\nabout what functionality is present in individual neurons (see\nBiophysics of Computation, section 21.1.1 Many Ways to Multiply). I&#39;ll\npick one example which I think is the most significant -\nmultiplication via addition and logarithms:\n\n    log(x*y) = log(x) + log(y)\n\nThus:\n\n   x*y = e^(log(x) + log(y))\n\nLogarithms occur naturally by decay of some neurotransmitter\nconcentration over the length of an axon or dendrite.\n\nAnother compelling example is the non-linear interation of\nneurotransmitters in dendrites. Say we have incoming signals x and y\nwhich connect at sites X and Y on the dendritic tree. Those two sites\nproduce two different neurotransmitters when excited and the resulting\nexcitation of the neuron is the *product* of the two neurotransmitter\nconcentrations. Why? Because one neurotransmitter acts chemically and\nelectrically in improving the flow of the other (or more specifically,\nimproving the flow of ions produced by the stimulating effects of the\nother). This setup is much like a transistor, and one use of\ntransitors is of course amplification AKA multiplication.\n\n\n&gt; Of course, these thoughts don&#39;t contradict anything you said. The length input trick also\n&gt; shows that to some extent we can provide dramatic bias through a priori knowledge, which is\n&gt; a good thing (e.g. if it means skipping 10,000 years of evolution).\n\nMy concern is that this was a simple test case where simple euclidean\ndistance applied in an obvious way. Ideally I want HyperNEAT to learn\nwhat distance metrics apply to the problem rather than me suppling\nthem precomputed.\n\nI think there&#39;s a strong case for taking a fresh look at what\ncomputations we perform at the neuronal level and whether traditional\nsigmoid based ANNs are deficient in some significant ways. I hope you\ncan see where I&#39;m coming from here.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
