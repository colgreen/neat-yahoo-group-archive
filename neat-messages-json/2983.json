It is only meant for people=\r\n using real-time NEAT.   I \nsuggest you cut out the &quot;rt&quot; code before distri=\r\nbuting and then use the \nregular GPL license that comes with NEAT.\n\n2) If y=\r\nou do want to use rtNEAT, I do not control the license.  The \nUniversity of=\r\n Texas at Austin owns the license and the technology \n(i.e. the real-time d=\r\nerivative of NEAT) is patent pending.  Thus, the \nlicense is unlikely to ch=\r\nange.  However...\n\n3) The current rtNEAT license allows you to distribute y=\r\nour work and \nhave others build on it for research purposes.  The only rest=\r\nriction \nis on commercialization, in which case you&#39;d need to contact UT \nA=\r\nustin.  Thus, for most purpoes, the current rtNEAT license is not \nrestrict=\r\nive.\n\nI am guessing in your particular case you are just using regular NEAT=\r\n \nand therefore the rtNEAT license is a moot point.  You only downloaded \nt=\r\nhe &quot;rtNEAT&quot; code to because it contains within it a more easy-to-\ncompile v=\r\nersion of regular NEAT.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chris Spencer&quot; =\r\n&lt;chrisspen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Would it be possible to release rtNEAT=\r\n under the GPL, LGPL, or \nsimilar\n&gt; open source license? I&#39;d like to eventu=\r\nally release my work under one\n&gt; of these open source licenses, but I don&#39;t=\r\n think the current UT\n&gt; Research License would permit that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Chris\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
