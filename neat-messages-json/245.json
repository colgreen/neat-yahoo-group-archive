It&#39;s a bit of a concocted scenario but there it is.\n\nI outlined in a previous mail my simulations where I let the agents \ndecide on what they thought was sexually attractive, and how that gave \nrise to child-eaters. Child-eaters have many children, because a lot of \nthe energy they spend on having children is regained when they eat their \noffspring. But as the child eaters quickly took over the population, it \nwould quickly be wiped out. Lots of fun! Die, child-eaters, die!\n\nI also tried sexual selection, where the sex of the offspring was \ndetermined genetically (not 50-50). As you may have guessed, being a \nmale turned out to be very popular, because of the amount of energy \nneeded for each child (tiny compared to that of the female). The \npopulation became heavily dominated by filandering males, and thus the \npopulation died out. My papa was a rolling stone...\n\nPopulation dynamics is a delicate thing, and great fun to play with.\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
