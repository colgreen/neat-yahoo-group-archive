The papers will be reviewed on a short time\nschedule by a small grou=\r\np of dedicated reviewers, and due to the time\nlimits no extensions can be g=\r\nranted.\n\nThe main restriction is that each paper needs to describe a submis=\r\nsion\nto one of the competitions associated with CIG 2011. The focus of the\n=\r\npaper can be on the architecture of the submission, comparative\nstudies, un=\r\nderlying ideas etc., but the software described must enter\none of the compe=\r\ntitions. As with regular papers, at least one author\nof a successful paper =\r\nneeds to attend the conference and present the\npaper.\n\nFor 2011, we have an=\r\n exciting range of competitions open, providing a\nrange of challenges for C=\r\nI and AI techniques (including playing\nvarious games as well as possible, h=\r\numan-like playing and procedural\ncontent generation). The following competi=\r\ntions are offered:\n\nSimulated Car Racing Championship\nMario AI Championship=\r\n\nStarCraft competition\nMs Pac-Man Screen Capture Competition\nPac-Man vs Gho=\r\nst Team Competition\n\nPlease see http://cilab.sejong.ac.kr/cig2011/?page_id=\r\n=3D100 for more\ninfo on competitions.\n\nNote that it is NOT necessary to sub=\r\nmit a competition paper in order\nto participate in a competition. While we =\r\nencourage participants to\nwrite papers about their entries, you can submit =\r\nan entry to any of\nthe competitions without an accompanying paper.\n\nCompeti=\r\ntion participation deadline: different for each competition\nCompetition pap=\r\ner submission deadline: June 27, 2011\nDecision notification: July 4, 2011\nC=\r\namera-ready submission: July 8, 2011\nConference dates: August 31-September =\r\n3, 2011\n\nGeneral Chair : Sung-Bae Cho\nProgram Co-Chairs: Simon Lucas and Ph=\r\nllip Hingston\nCompetitions Chair: Julian Togelius\nPublicity Chair: Clare Ba=\r\ntes Congdon\nProceedings Chair: Mike Preuss\nTutorials and special sessions c=\r\nhair: Georgios Yannakakis\nLocal Chairs: Kyung-Joong Kim, Kyu-Baek Hwang, Eu=\r\nn-Youn Kim\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenh=\r\nagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark\nmail: julian@togeliu=\r\ns.com, web: http://julian.togelius.com\nmobile: +46-705-192088, office: +45-=\r\n7218-5277\n\n"}}
