That&#39;s interesting that you highlighted t=\r\nhe fact\nthat EASy is more interested in A-Life. I suppose my interests are\n=\r\nstarting to lean more towards A-Life as well... but I&#39;m not well\nversed eno=\r\nugh in the subject matter yet to know exactly where it\ndeviates significant=\r\nly from &quot;adaptive neural networks&quot; research.\n\nAre there other Universities =\r\nthat you feel are more in-line with the\nA-Life focus of the EASy programme?=\r\n\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt; \n&gt; You could also look at Simon Lucas&#39; or Riccardo Poli=\r\n&#39;s groups at\n&gt; University of Essex:\n&gt; http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/lucas/\n=\r\n&gt; http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/poli/\n&gt; \n&gt; And I must of course also recomm=\r\nend the institution where me and\n&gt; Faustino Gomez currently work, IDSIA in =\r\nLugano:\n&gt; http://www.idsia.ch\n&gt; We do plenty of research in evolutionary co=\r\nmputation and related\n&gt; fields, both in Juergen Schmidhuber&#39;s and Luca Gamb=\r\nardella&#39;s group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think you should not constrain yourself to English-=\r\nspeaking\n&gt; countries. Any good research lab will have a very international\n=\r\n&gt; workforce and outlook, and the working language will be English.\n&gt; Myself=\r\n, I speak English at work and (very bad) Italian in the\n&gt; supermarkets...\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; You should only look at funded PhD positions that pay you a salary you\n=\r\n&gt; can live on. The way it works is that professors apply for grants for\n&gt; s=\r\npecific projects from funding agencies, and if they obtain their\n&gt; grant th=\r\ney employ the best person they can find as a PhD student or\n&gt; postdoc. Typi=\r\ncally, it does not matter where you come from (though\n&gt; there are exception=\r\ns).\n&gt; \n&gt; I did my MSc at Sussex as well, and while it is a good program, it=\r\n is\n&gt; quite ALife-oriented.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck with your studies and research!\n=\r\n&gt; Julian\n&gt; \n&gt; 2008/8/12 Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; Mike,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n&#39;d guess there are others in the group with similar questions so I\n&gt; &gt; thin=\r\nk it&#39;s probably useful to the group. (By the way, by &quot;Adaptive\n&gt; &gt; Networks=\r\n,&quot; I assume you are referring to adaptive neural networks?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any =\r\ncase, another option is the University of Texas at Austin,\n&gt; &gt; which is whe=\r\nre I did my Ph.D. under Prof. Risto Miikkulainen, who has\n&gt; &gt; a leading gro=\r\nup in the area:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another good lab is=\r\n Prof. Jordan Pollack&#39;s DEMO Lab at Brandeis:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.demo.cs.br=\r\nandeis.edu/\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~pollack/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, Jorda=\r\nn tells me that he will be renaming and revamping his\n&gt; &gt; lab soon, so it w=\r\nill no longer be called &quot;DEMO.&quot; However, it is\n&gt; &gt; undoubtedly still a good=\r\n place to be.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are some newer places too with groups led by ne=\r\nw professors,\n&gt; &gt; including Prof. Bobby Bryant&#39;s &quot;Neuroevolution and Behavi=\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; Laboratory&quot; at the University of Nevada at Reno\n&gt; &gt; (http://nebl.cse=\r\n.unr.edu/) and Prof. Josh Bongard&#39;s new group at the\n&gt; &gt; University of Verm=\r\nont (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Prof. Hod Lipson at Cornell=\r\n formerly worked with Prof. Pollack and\n&gt; &gt; runs the Cornell Computational =\r\nSynthesis Lab:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, that l=\r\nab is a focused on emergent phenomena in general, with\n&gt; &gt; a broader scope =\r\nthan some of the others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One other important group is Prof. Dario F=\r\nloreano&#39;s Laboratory of\n&gt; &gt; Intelligent Systems. This lab is in Switzerland=\r\n, so I am not sure if\n&gt; &gt; it conducts its day-to-day work in English (it mi=\r\nght), but in any case\n&gt; &gt; it is very prominent in the area:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://=\r\nlis.epfl.ch/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not all these groups have an explicit focus on neural =\r\nnetworks, but\n&gt; &gt; most have done some good work with them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Note tha=\r\nt any Ph.D. program in North America should be willing to\n&gt; &gt; support you f=\r\ninancially if you get in.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;frayn.michael&quot; &lt;frayn.michael@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am about to head over to the University of Sussex (in Brighton,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n England) to do their MSc in Evolutionary & Adaptive Systems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; How=\r\never, as I am Canadian, the concept of doing a PhD there is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little d=\r\naunting because of the cost. Unfortunately, I am not aware of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many oth=\r\ner Universities that would be interested in funding a PhD of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; such rese=\r\narch focuses (let alone would be able to comprehensively\n&gt; &gt;&gt; support stude=\r\nnts along the way). This assumes, of course, that my MSc\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is wildly suc=\r\ncessful and I come up with a research question worthy of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; funding.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyhow, I was hoping that some of the members here might be able to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; point out other Universities (in North America or English-speaking\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Europe) that may be appropriate to do such a PhD in. These are the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on=\r\nes I&#39;m familiar with now:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; University of Edinburgh\n&gt; &gt;&gt; University=\r\n of Sussex\n&gt; &gt;&gt; University of Central Florida\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I realize this isn&#39;=\r\nt directly related to NEAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a more knowledgeabl=\r\ne group on the subject matter a hand. If there\nis a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more appropriate g=\r\nroup, then please just point me in the right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; direction and I&#39;ll not po=\r\nst about this again here.
