Although I feel slightly humbled by Tyler&#39;s 3D walker, not to \nmention the Natural Motion stuff. :)\n\n&gt;-Why is the default pmutate_add_connection setting at 77%?  That \n&gt;seems extremeley high..so almost every mating leads to a new \n&gt;connection?  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;-Why is pmutate_connections_weights on the other hand at only 0.2?  \n&gt;Does that mean only 20% of matings have any mutation of weights?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nerr, no that&#39;s not right, the two text boxes got switched around \nfollowing a slight disaster in the form designer. So add_connection is \nat 20% and weight mutation at 77%, does that sound about right?\n\n&gt;-What is &quot;elitism proportion?&quot; The standard NEAT use of elitism is \n&gt;to just keep one clone of the champ of every species that has been \n&gt;alotted over 5 offspring in the next generation.  So it is species-\n&gt;based elitism.  But what does yours do?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nNot sure I follow there. Do you mean you take each species&#39; best and \ncreate 5 offspring from it? or just keep it in the next gen unchanged?\n\nSharpNeat also implements species based elitism. It&#39;s probably easiest \nto describe the whole process:\n\n1) Using p_selection_proportion create a offspring per species and store \nthem all in a seperate list away from the main population.\n2) Cull the weakest n% of each species, where n = 100-p_elitism\n3) Add the offspring into the population.\n4) Back to 1\n\nI happen to create precisely the correct amount of offsprng to make up \nfor the genomes that are lost by the culling. So the population size \nremains constant(ish) - there is some variation because the size of each \nspecies is calculated indepedently and therefore you may get a few more \nor less offspring in the popualtion as a whole due to rounding.\n\nAnother point here is that you can choose to set p_elitism to be larger \nor smaller than p_selection_proportion. If you set it larger then you \nare creating offspring from the same set of elite genomes until some \nbetter genomes come along.  I do however sort the species by fitness and \nthen by age, so older good genomes are more likely to be culled than new \nones.\n\nAlso if eleitism is a very small value (or even 0) then I will always \nleave a minimum of 1 genome in a species. Therefore I think maybe that \nsetting p_elitism to zero would make SharpNeat equivalent to origianl \nNEAT in this area.\n\n&gt;-The selection proportion of 0.1 is very low and will likely cause \n&gt;premature convergence.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk, I need to experiment with this value. What sort of range are people \nusing?\n\n&gt;-My version of NEAT generally solves the single pole balancing \n&gt;problem (with velocities) in under 1000 evaluations...so some of the \n&gt;differences between the implementations probably are worth looking \n&gt;into.  It looks like it takes maybe 10 times longer or more in \n&gt;SharpNEAT.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI have seen SharpNEAT spontaneously jump to a perfect solution after \nonly 30 gens or so, but in general yes it can take a while.  I actually \nported pole balancing precisely so that I could compare with origianl \nNEAT (I&#39;ll call it oNEAT for short), so this is good feedback. Also I&#39;m \ngoing to try and compile NEAT here (thanks Darren) so I can make more \ndetailed comparisons.\n\n&gt;-What is the weight mutation power and rate, i.e. how much do you \n&gt;perturb weights and how likely is it any particular weight will be \n&gt;perturbed?  Also, is there a max weight?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFollowing your posting I did implement weight capping - currently set to \n+-3.0.\n\nThe weight mutation does currently differ from oNEAT.  I do use \npColdGaussian /pGaussian roughly as in oNEAT. 10% of the time 30% of the \nweights are reset to random values (-3 to 3), but normally only 10% of \nweights are reset.\n\nAll of the of the other weights are &#39;jiggled&#39;, for this I use a function \nthat generates numbers from a standard distribution curve. Currently I \nuse a sigma of 0.025 which generates weight-delta&#39;s between about -0.1 \nand 0.1, bu the bulk of the deltas are between +-0.05\n\nOh and in total only 20% of the weights in a genome affected, whereas I \n/think/ oNEAT mutates 100%.\n\nHope that all made sense, you did ask :) \n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
