Output A and B.  A is the real \noutput.  There is an expected output for A.    There is an error value for \nA.  The expected output of B is then the error value of A.\n\nWhy bother?  Well, suppose that you have evolved 100 solutions to a problem. \n  Some are better for one kind of input, others are better at another.  You \ncould let the networks themselves decide which one is best suited for a \nparticular input, and you could use the correlation between estimated error \nand output values to calculate a more precise output for the whole network.\n\nFor example, network 1 has an output of 5 with an error value of (e.g.) 2.  \nThat means, for the sake of illustration, that the real output will be \nsomewhere between 3 and 7.  A second network has an output of 7 with an \nerror of 0.5.  So the real value is between 6.5 and 7.5.  If you took the \naverage of the output values, the result is 6.  But if you took the center \nof the overlap, the output becomes 6.75.  That value might be much closer to \nthe correct value than just the average of the two networks.\n\nAdmittedly, it forces the network to calculate a more complex function.  But \nit might be useful, who knows?\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet tax tips, tools and access to IRS forms ï¿½ all in one place at MSN Money! \nhttp://moneycentral.msn.com/tax/home.asp\n\n\n"}}
