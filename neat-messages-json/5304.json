I know we&#39;ve talked about it of=\r\nf the list, but I wanted to mention on the list that I think that it makes =\r\na lot of sense to sometimes use novelty search to collect a diversity of be=\r\nhaviors (for various possible reasons) rather than to try to find a best on=\r\ne.  This paper is a great example that such an interesting-behavior-collect=\r\ning application can work and it may turn out that this type of application =\r\nultimately becomes more common than the &quot;best-solution&quot; variety.\n\nken\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, Heather Goldsby &lt;hjg@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Everyone:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m pleased to announce a new novelty search paper that will be\n&gt; appe=\r\naring in the proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Conference\n&gt; on Mode=\r\nl Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MoDELS 2010), a\n&gt; software engi=\r\nneering conference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Heather J.

One difference from previous novelty\n=\r\n&gt; search papers is that our end objective is to collect a suite of  \n&gt; solu=\r\ntions,\n&gt; rather than looking for one ideal solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m very interest=\r\ned in hearing what the novelty search community\n&gt; thinks of these results.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Heather Goldsby\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Laboratory\n&gt; Michi=\r\ngan State University\n&gt; www.cse.msu.edu/~hjg\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
