We have graphical tools that lay\n&gt; out our raw chromosome XML in a spiral pattern, but\n&gt; while it looks kind of cool, it isn&#39;t very readable.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; So if we have a network, evolved with NEAT, that has\n&gt; 10 input nodes, 10 output nodes, and 35 hidden nodes,\n&gt; with dozens of connections (self, recurrent, and\n&gt; forward), how does it make the most sense to:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; --Represent this phenotype in XML?\n&gt; --Graphically represent this phenotype?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNormally I would resist placing extra data into an XML dialect that\ncould be inferred from other data, it&#39;s effectibely redundant. \nHowever I understand it may be a pain to do complex logic in XSLT \nand as such I think it&#39;s reasonable to define, say, an attribute on \nneuron tags such as hintLayer=&quot;1&quot;. Infact a number of different \nhint* attributes might be useful for different types of \nrepresentations. I think these sort of &#39;hint&#39; attributes should be \ndefined as being optional though. We would would then be able to \ntake existing phenotype XML and pass it through a network structure \nanalysis tool - analysing the &#39;core&#39; XML and annotating it with \nhint* attributes. If you want to define a new type of visualisation \nthen just create your own hint* tags, update the tool and the XML \nwill still conform to the dialect definition (XSD).\n\n\n&gt; Should the neuron tags also include an attribute\n&gt; assigning them to a particular layer?  We use XSL to\n&gt; parse the XML into SVG, and in and of itself, XSL\n&gt; really isn&#39;t useful for determining layout logic. It&#39;s best to \nhave the layout structure inherent in the\n&gt; XML.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHad you thought about the best way to determine the layer? I guess \nyou could calculate the shortest number of &#39;hops&#39; for each hidden \nneuron to an input neuron? Trouble is you might end up with all of \nthe neurons in layer 1 !!\n\n\nColin \n\n\n"}}
