But it sounds\n&gt; like your approach alters the threshold based on the amount of\n&gt; topological variation in the population...is that right?\n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t you get similar results by having a floating SCT value and a\n&gt; fixed number of species?\n\nVery similar. But there are some differences. Under this method there does\nexist a kind of &quot;optimal&quot; number of species, but it can be changed. I\nthink this method allows for a little more flexibility than just clamping\nthe number of species. Also it responds better to &quot;explosions of\ntopological innovation&quot; ... i.e. if there is a lot of topological\ninnovation around a certain epoch, things will still be speciated\ncorrectly, even if the optimal number of species is exceeded.\n\nExperimentally it is mostly the same, it just frees me from having to set\nthe number of species explicitly.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
