Regardless, I&#39;ll soon find out.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Many of=\r\n the more important people there seem to have a penchant for\n&gt; small, fully=\r\n connected, continuous networks, such as CTRNNs and\n&gt; spiking models. I mys=\r\nelf think that having a network fully \nconnected\n&gt; can be disastrous to evo=\r\nlvability, as a change in any connection \nwill\n&gt; affect every neuron in the=\r\n network. Epistasis is the word. What is\n&gt; interesting about CTRNNs and sim=\r\nilar nets is that every neuron has\n&gt; state and decay properties, which can =\r\nbe used for some interesting\n&gt; integration of information over time. The te=\r\nnd to be quite\n&gt; computationally expensive, though, and I go with much simp=\r\nler \nneuron\n&gt; models for my current experiments with very large networks.\n&gt;=\r\n \n\nSome interesting things about CTRNNs:  It&#39;s worth pointing out that \nthe=\r\ny don&#39;t need to be fully-connected and they are really quite cool \nin my op=\r\ninion.  In fact, NEAT can evolve CTRNNs, although this \npossibility has not=\r\n been thoroughly investigated.  But I think it&#39;s \nfascinating since CTRNNs =\r\ncan act as internal pattern generators, \nwhich means they can produce thing=\r\ns like regular gaits or swimming \nmotions.\n\nIn fact, Tyler Streeter actuall=\r\ny produced a CTRNN version of NEAT a \nwhile ago.  Tyler&#39;s since moved on to=\r\n experimenting with other \nmethods (such as temporal difference RL learning=\r\n) but his July 2004 \nvideos in his gallery are actually taken from a NEAT-e=\r\nvolved CTRNN \nnetwork:\n\nhttp://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/verve/gallery=\r\n.html\n\nSomeday I&#39;d like to get serious about learning about evolving the \nt=\r\nopology and temoral dynamics of CTRNNs and the kinds of complex \npattern ge=\r\nnerators that might be possible.\n\n&gt; Having said that, several of the people=\r\n there have done forays into\n&gt; artificial embryogeny, and Gruau (of Cellula=\r\nr Encoding fame) was \nthere\n&gt; for a while. And you are very much free to do=\r\n whatever you want in \nthe\n&gt; EASy programme - they probably wouldn&#39;t object=\r\n too much if you \nhanded\n&gt; in an oil painting or something you built out of=\r\n matchsticks and\n&gt; crumbled bread instead of an essay... (Well, they might =\r\nnot be that\n&gt; liberal, but almost.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Examining the Universities in B=\r\nritish Columbia (EA \nheadquarters), I\n&gt; &gt;  see a lot of AI possibilities bu=\r\nt nothing that mentions \nanything close\n&gt; &gt;  to NE.  Shame.\n&gt; \n&gt; J=F6rg Den=\r\nzinger works with EA on evolutionary approaches\n(unintended\n&gt; acronym pun t=\r\nhere) to finding &quot;sweet spots&quot; in games amongst other\n&gt; things - interestin=\r\ng research. I don&#39;t know how much he is into \nneural\n&gt; networks, though. Th=\r\ne work I&#39;ve seen by him is on evolving action\n&gt; sequences.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://page=\r\ns.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~denzinge/\n&gt; \n\nJulian, do you remember seeing J=F6rg at =\r\nthe CIG conference in\nApril?  \nHe gave a couple talks there about this work=\r\n.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
