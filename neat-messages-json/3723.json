I enjoyed \nhavin=\r\ng the opportunity to ask my question to such illustrious \nscientists, but l=\r\nike you, I was kind of disappointed with their \nanswers.  Like you said, th=\r\ney sort of answered accurately, but there \nwas no real insight or thoughtfu=\r\nlness in what they said.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting that you point out this exchange=\r\n because I think it \nhighlights a weakness in how biologists have been deal=\r\ning with the \nquestion of complexity.  It&#39;s such a fundamental question yet=\r\n it \nhasn&#39;t really received the treatment it deserves, even from the \nfield=\r\n&#39;s luminaries.  I think part of the problem is that a genuine \ntreatment re=\r\nquires a kind of algorithmic and representational theory, \nwhich is perhaps=\r\n better attacked from a computational perspective, \nputting evolutionary co=\r\nmputation researchers at an advantage because \nwe think about search spaces=\r\n, encodings, mappings, etc. routinely.  \n\nPerhaps they were just being curt=\r\n or did not take the audience \nseriously enough to elaborate their thoughts=\r\n.  Yet I find that \nexplanation doubtful given that we were after all at a =\r\n&quot;debate&quot; about \nevolution and complexity, which is precisely the substance =\r\nof my \nquestion.  I also agree that Dawkins seemed closest to really \nthink=\r\ning about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would be very interested in \nour area of=\r\n EC if only there was an opportunity to tell him about \nit.  But I don&#39;t th=\r\nink he has a great deal of experience with it \nbeyond his old Blind Watchma=\r\nker demo.\n\nOn the bright side, the lack of clarity among the experts sugges=\r\nts a \nrare open opportunity to crack a major problem in biology and AI. \n\nk=\r\nen\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I ju=\r\nst got around to viewing the video of the keynote discussion \nfrom\n&gt; GECCO =\r\n2007, and it was nice to see that Ken had asked a question of\n&gt; the panel. =\r\nHere&#39;s the link to the download:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.bentl=\r\ney/evodebate.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken asked: &quot;How is it possible for 30,000 human gene=\r\ns to encode the\n&gt; connectivity of a 100 trillion-connection brain? And how =\r\nis it\n&gt; possible for evolution to search a space of such astronomical\n&gt; com=\r\nplexity to discover such a structure?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering what Ken though=\r\nt of the answers to the question. I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t much impressed with them. Admi=\r\nttedly it&#39;s a difficult \nquestion,\n&gt; and the panel admitted that nobody rea=\r\nlly knows. Jones seemed to say\n&gt; that there might be a lot more information=\r\n in DNA than we&#39;re giving \nit\n&gt; credit for, although he brought up Mandelbr=\r\not sets as examples of\n&gt; complicated patterns that can arise from very simp=\r\nle rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wolpert didn&#39;t have much to say, though he seemed to say the=\r\n answer\n&gt; may lie in combinatorics. And Dawkins used the computer code \nana=\r\nlogy,\n&gt; talking about the reuse of particular sections of code, which \nprob=\r\nably\n&gt; came closest to providing a decent answer, but none of them seemed\n&gt;=\r\n very satisfactory to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
