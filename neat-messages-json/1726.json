A recent science program on TV showed\n&gt; this same approach being used with face recognition in Vegas casinos, in\n&gt; order to identify known card counters - a manual operator guides the\n&gt; whole process, measuring relative distance between the eyes, etc. So\n&gt; yeh, I guess automatic categorisation is still a problem that is out\n&gt; there - which is interesting in itself.\n\nYeah, as far as I know, there&#39;s no such thing as a completely automated system.\n\nAnd what we&#39;re doing is just the first cut, dividing the prints into\nbins to make the one-to-many search more efficient.\n\nAutomated fingerprint recognition is one of the oldest pattern\nrecognition tasks, but there&#39;s still a need to make it better and more\nefficient, and it&#39;s nice to have a wealth of previous research to\ncompare results to.\n\n&gt; Watching the animation you posted I found it surprising how successful\n&gt; the networks are at zooming in on the critical area of the images -\n&gt; where the most distinct identifying features are. Very promising indeed.\n\nYeah, I was happily surprised at how well our early cuts have been.\n\n&gt; I presume this is using almost the same setup as the shape recognition,\n&gt; but with a different set of images? Are you using the same resolution\n&gt; for the eye?\n\nIt&#39;s a very similar setup to the shape recognition experiments, though\nwe&#39;ve disabled rotation and are using a 7x7 eye instead of 5x5. \nWe&#39;ved tweaked the parameters a bit as well, and Philip has added a\nfew efficiencies and improvements over the code from the stuff in our\npaper.  But it&#39;s basically the same stuff.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
