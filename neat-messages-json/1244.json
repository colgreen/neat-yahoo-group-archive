What if there were other such &#39;utility&#39; \ninputs.\n\nFor example, a random input node.  Either assign it a random value at the \nbeginning of an each activation, or have its value change every time it is \nread.  The network will, of course, evolve to minimize the weights to the \nrandom node.  But the presence of random fluctuations in the environment \nwill force it to adopt a different strategy of execution.\n\nWithout it, the network could (and is likely to) evolve into something that \njust replays a set of motions that happen to work while in the fitness \nevaluation environment.  Change any factor, and it may completely fail.  You \ncould get around that by testing it in a variety of environments.  Then, an \nalready lengthy fitness evaluation cycle is magnified many times over.  But \nforcing it to evolve in the presence of noise within its own system will \nforce it to adopt a more adaptive approach to accomplishing what it is being \nasked to do.  You will get a network that can accomodate obstacles or rough \nterrain without necessarily having to test for it from the beginning.  Not \nonly that, but the presence of minor variations, imperfections within the \ngait, may make the result look more natural.\n\nAnother idea is &#39;oscillation&#39; nodes.  An input node that returns sin(x+=n) \nwhere n controls how fast it oscillates.  Or a hidden node that does the \nsame thing, but where the value of &#39;n&#39; is based on the inputs, so it can \nspeed up or slow down depending on what the rest of the network indicates.  \nThe oscillating input will give it a sense of time.  The oscillating hidden \nnode will give it the ability to go through cycles, but adapt those cycles \nas needed, and in a way that is probably more adaptive than a recurrent \nnetwork could accomplish.  It might well accomplish more with less topology \nwith the availability of such structures.\n\nSuch variations would be almost trivial to implement, and could potentially \nhave far-reaching influence on the resulting evolutions.  Of course, the \nonly way to know if the benefits outweight the increase in search-space is \nto actually implement them and see.  I would be willing to bet that the \nrandom input would be worth the effort for you.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
