My understanding is that parallel\nextensions were added to version 2.6:\n\n    http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.6\n\n&quot;This release includes some components of the ParallelFx framework\nthat were developed as part of Google Summer Of Code 2008 & 2009. More\nprecisely, it contains the Task Parallel Library and Data Structures\nFor Coordination.&quot;\n[...]\n&quot;To use this code you have to manually enable the .NET 4 profile using\nthe --with-profile4=yes switch at configure stage.&quot;\n\nSo potentially you just need to enable the .Net 4 profile.\n\nWesley&#39;s option is a good fall-back option if that doesn&#39;t work.\nEither way you should be able to get the latest SharpNEAT working on\nMono, I believe I tested it on mono using the preliminary parallel\nextensions code they released back in 2008.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
