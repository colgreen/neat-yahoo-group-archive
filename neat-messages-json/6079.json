The paper can be viewed at: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://dx.plos.org/10.137=\r\n1/journal.pone.0062186\n&gt; \n&gt; The article applies both abstract simulations a=\r\nnd neuroevolution to explore a non-adaptive explanation for increasing evol=\r\nvability in nature. Interestingy, understanding evolvability (the capacity =\r\nto further evolve) might lead not only to better understanding how complex =\r\norganisms evolve in nature, but may also provide insight into how to design=\r\n evolutionary algorithms that are better able to evolve complex artifacts.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Most existing theories for evolvability increase depend upon particula=\r\nr selective scenarios, such as a species surviving through constantly chang=\r\ning environments. However, the insight in the article is that evolvability =\r\ncan instead arise spontaneously without natural selection acting at all. Th=\r\ne main idea is that if evolvability is heritable, then evolvable organisms =\r\nseparate themselves naturally from less evolvable organisms over time simpl=\r\ny by their children becoming increasingly diverse and thereby spreading fur=\r\nther through the space of possible phenotypes. That is, the space of phenot=\r\nypes itself can act like a filter that distinguishes evolvability.\n&gt; \n&gt; In =\r\nthis way, when novel phenotypes appear in the future, they are most likely =\r\ndescendents of those that were evolvable in the past. The result is that ev=\r\nolvable species accumulate over time even without selective pressure. This =\r\nidea is supported by a variety of simulations where evolvability increases =\r\nwithout any pressure for organisms to out-compete each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those fa=\r\nmiliar with novelty search will notice some conceptual parallels with Ken&#39;s=\r\n and my previous work on searching without objectives. Like novelty search,=\r\n the proposed non-adaptive hypothesis for evolvability may invite some cont=\r\nroversy because adaptive explanations for evolvability are intuitive and wi=\r\ndely-held. For example, researchers often worry about what kind of selectiv=\r\ne pressure will lead to evolvability, even in discussions in this group. On=\r\ne implication of this work could be that such worrying is unwarranted becau=\r\nse the best way to get evolvability may sometimes be to stop trying to sele=\r\nct for it. In any case, despite any potential controversy, we hope that thi=\r\ns alternate perspective leads to constructive discussion and demonstrates t=\r\nhe need to question the assumption that evolvability requires particular se=\r\nlective scenarios for it to increase.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
