This is why squaring the fitness=\r\n is often a way to force more aggressive evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Chris Garrett&quot; &lt;garrerc@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For my experiment, I h=\r\nave positive and negative contributions to my fitness function.  After a fe=\r\nw iterations, I noticed that NEAT does not like fitness values less than 0.=\r\n000001 (1e-6).  I feel like I may be losing information if I simply clip th=\r\nings at this value.  What would be the effect of simply padding the fitness=\r\n with some large value?  Would there be any ill effects?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
