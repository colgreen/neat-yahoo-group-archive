We&#39;ve tried several\ndifferent approaches to the fitness function, but no\nmatter what we try, the average network size rises to\n20-30 genes within a 15 or 20 generations, and by the\nend of a typical run we have 80-100 gene networks.\n\nPresumably, we should be getting XOR networks that\nhave a very small number of genes...correct?  \n\nDid anyone else run into this issue when implementing\nNEAT?  Did those of you who implemented a version of\nNEAT verify its functionality with XOR?\n\nWe could lower the mutation rates (we&#39;re using the\ndefault parameters from Ken&#39;s original paper), but\nwe&#39;d like to duplicate similar results with the same\nexperimental parameters.\n\nThanks,\nDerek James\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
