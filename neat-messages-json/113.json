It is probably\n&gt; &gt; quite difficult since it involves long term \n&gt; &gt; accurate and discrete memory.  But the input\n&gt; &gt; representaiton,\n&gt; &gt; i.e. how you represent the cards to the network,\n&gt; &gt; is probably a major issue.  And it&#39;s not clear\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; the right way would be, so it needs careful\n&gt; &gt; consideration\n&gt; &gt; since some representations are likely impossible\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; an ANN to\n&gt; &gt; deal with.  \n\n--- Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; About the inputs & outputs, I&#39;m envsioning 2 input\n&gt; lines for every card position.  One would be binary\n&gt; to\n&gt; tell whether there is a card there or not.  The\n&gt; other\n&gt; would go through steps of 1/N to identify the card.\n&gt; Or I might use all binary with N+1 lines for each\n&gt; position.  So a deck of 6 cards of 3 kinds would\n&gt; have\n&gt; 24 binary input lines.\n\nI agree with Ken that the representation of the cards\nis a major issue, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t quite\nunderstand your explanation of how you&#39;re handling it.\n In this case:\n\nKing/clubs     2/hearts     10/spades\n10/spades      King/clubs   2/hearts\n\nHow many inputs does your NN have?  It sounds like 12\nfrom your explanation...is that right?  So for the\nfirst row/first column, you&#39;re going to have one\nboolean input, either 0 or 1 depending on whether\nthere&#39;s a card there?  But what is the other input\ngoing to be?  \n\nIf your inputs range from 0 to 1, are you representing\neach type of card as a value range (e.g. King/clubs is\nfrom 0 to 0.33, 2/hearts is from .33 to .66, etc.)?\n\nI also think that Concentration sounds like an\ninteresting test domain, and I&#39;m interested in how\ncard games are represented.  \n\nPhilip and I are still trying to get our NEAT\nimplementation off the ground.  Hopefully our design\nwill make it easier to plug new domains in, and we&#39;ll\nhave a chance to mess around with Concentration a\nlittle.  But we&#39;re also avid Bridge players, and have\nthought some about trying to apply neuroevolution to\nit.  \n\nIn the case of Bridge, the cards are ranked in power\nfrom 2 to Ace (though the relative power of a given\ncard is also contextual).  I&#39;m thinking that it will\nbe necessary to represent each card with multiple\ninputs, but I&#39;m not really sure.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
