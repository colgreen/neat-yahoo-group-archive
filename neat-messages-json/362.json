Therefore,\n&gt; outputting one number and forgetting about learning\n&gt; how to play the game\n&gt; and make legal moves etc.\n\nThis works for game domains with a managable branching\nfactor (e.g., Checkers), where there are a relatively\nsmall number of potential moves on any given turn.\n\nBut a MinMax search is not going to work with games\nwith enormous branching factors (like 19x19 Go, which\nhas 361 possible moves on the first turn, 360 on the\nnext, and so on).  \n\nAnd incidentally, neither in Joseph&#39;s project or our\nresearch are we evolving networks that learn to make\nlegal moves (illegal moves are simply ignored).\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
