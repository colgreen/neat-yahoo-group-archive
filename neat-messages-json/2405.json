I think I&#39;m right in saying that in =\r\nbiological\n&gt; evolution mass extinction events are thought to give evolution=\r\n a bit of\n&gt; a kick. E.g. the cambrian explosion\n&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/=\r\nwiki/Cambrian_explosion&gt;. Then there&#39;s the\n&gt; argument about how far dinosau=\r\nrs would have developed if they hadn&#39;t\n&gt; been zapped by a comet and that ma=\r\nmmals (or some slug like ancestor of\n&gt; mammals anyhow) were able to fill in=\r\n the gap left behind, amongst other\n&gt; lifeforms.\n&gt;\n&gt; So all we need is some=\r\n routine that randomly similarly zaps (I believe\n&gt; that&#39;s the technical ter=\r\nm) our populations/species every once in a\n&gt; while. You can do this automat=\r\nically if a search has stagnated for N\n&gt; generations ans/or hours, or just =\r\nhave some way of allowing the user to\n&gt; trigger an extinction manually.
