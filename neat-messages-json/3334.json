When I wa=\r\ntch \nan \n&gt; &gt; animaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it looks=\r\n \nlike \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; exibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be describe=\r\nd as a \n&gt; mexican \n&gt; &gt; wave travelling across the hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; As the=\r\n CPPNs complexify, so do the activity patterns exibited. \nWhen \n&gt; &gt; using r=\r\negular NEAT for the problem of keeping the humanoid model \n&gt; &gt; balanced, it=\r\n has moslty erratic behaviour, and the lucky ones \n(with \n&gt; &gt; high fitness)=\r\n usually find a way to trick the system and stay in \na \n&gt; &gt; balanced positi=\r\non forever, without moving at all. \n&gt; &gt; But when HyperNEAT is used for this=\r\n, it looks really interesting \n&gt; and.. \n&gt; &gt; natural! The model is trying to=\r\n balance using its arms, and it is \n&gt; &gt; moving.. It looks like a drunk guy,=\r\n but you note the difference. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve arranged the nodes in a geometric w=\r\nay.. Let me explain - the \n&gt; left \n&gt; &gt; and right arm&#39;s outputs are separate=\r\nd in the left and right in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; substrate space, and close to each oth=\r\ner. So do the legs. The \n&gt; hidden \n&gt; &gt; nodes are in the center in a star/ci=\r\nrlular shape. I also included \n3 \n&gt; &gt; inputs (head velocity) in the center =\r\naround 0.0, but with smaller \n&gt; &gt; radius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
