You say that the s=\r\nensor is set to &quot;200-d.&quot;  Is that literally the value that is input, or is =\r\nit normalized to a number between 0 and 1?  Note that for a neural network =\r\nwith regular sigmoid functions, an input with a magnitude over 2 or so will=\r\n simply lead to saturation, making it hard for the network to make any usef=\r\nul distinctions.  Therefore, normalization is very important before inputti=\r\nng sensor values. \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mark Ahlstrom &lt;lists@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The food foraging experiment is the dangerous food foraging=\r\n example  \n&gt; from &quot;Evolving Adaptive Neural Networks with and without Adapt=\r\nive  \n&gt; Synapses&quot;.    The sensors have been tried a few different ways.  Th=\r\ney  \n&gt; are arranged around the robot as described in the paper.  If there i=\r\ns  \n&gt; no food item in the arc of the sensor, it is input to the network as =\r\n \n&gt; 0.  Otherwise, since I have a 100x100 grid constraining the space of  \n=\r\n&gt; the objects, the sensor is set to 200-d where d is the distance to the  \n=\r\n&gt; nearest food item in that sensor arc. Other was that sensors was  \n&gt; impl=\r\nemented was as a count of the number of food items that the sensor  \n&gt; coul=\r\nd detect. The outputs are rate of left turn, rate of right turn (I  \n&gt; just=\r\n take the difference to determine which way to turn) and the  \n&gt; forward sp=\r\need of the robot.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is related to a larger experiment I have been r=\r\nunning over the  \n&gt; last couple years (at 1.5 months time per run, it took =\r\na while,  \n&gt; particularly to debug a late run memory corruption).

My hunch there wa=\r\ns  \n&gt; that the complexity of the environment and controlled entity left a  =\r\n\n&gt; relatively naive (in the sense that it just took position and attitude  =\r\n\n&gt; as input, and generated control settings as output) neat approach  \n&gt; un=\r\nable to discover a suitably complex control function.  Now Im not as  \n&gt; su=\r\nre.\n&gt; \n&gt; To Anthony&#39;s questions: 8 environments are generated for each  \n&gt; =\r\ngeneration, and each network is tested on all 8 environments.   \n&gt; Multithr=\r\neading isn&#39;t an issue, since Im keeping it single threaded for  \n&gt; the mome=\r\nnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mark Ahlstrom\n&gt; On Nov 10, 2009, at 5:42 PM, Ken wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Mark, which food foraging experiment are you implementing?

My  contr=\r\nol  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiment (i.e. the one I think should definitely give a solutio=\r\nn)  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a re-implementation of the food foraging problem.  The fitness=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; function is the same.  So doing nothing nets a fitness of 32, and  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; max fitness is 60.  Instead what Im seeing is a small improvement  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; to average best fitness of about 35, and then almost every  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; gener=\r\nation I have a couple outliers with a fitness around 40-45.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This =\r\nis all using rtNeat.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So, my question is whether or not I likely h=\r\nave some parameters  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tuned badly (not unlikely) and if so, what the l=\r\nikely culprits  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; would be.  I&#39;ve tweaked those several times to no ava=\r\nil.
