It main cool features are :\n  * configuration with plain text file\n  * OOP & plugin modular architecture : provide your\nown operators, problems, listeners with your own\nplugin that register your classes.\n  * genotypes could encode several networks\n  * really fast neural network implementation\n  * not yet a gas factory\n\nI have not spoken before your message because TaoNeat\nis already stable but too young (a couple of month)\nand not that documented. The XOR, the double pole\nbalancing and some other nice problems are included,\nwith some tools to extract infos from log files.\n\nI will be at GECCO, my paper was accepted, and is\nabout an experiment where NEAT is involved.\n\n--- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; a �crit :\n\n&gt; Hi everyone, I am going to be speaking about NEAT\n&gt; software at an \n&gt; interesting workshop at GECCO 2007 called the &quot;2007\n&gt; GECCO Workshop on \n&gt; Open-Source Software for Applied Genetic and\n&gt; Evolutionary Computation&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the website for the workshop:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.epistasis.org/softgec2007.html\n&gt; \n&gt; This workshop is a unique opportunity to highlight\n&gt; what&#39;s been going \n&gt; on with NEAT as a software platform as opposed to\n&gt; talking about the \n&gt; academic research side of it (which is usually all I\n&gt; have a chance to \n&gt; do).  \n&gt; \n&gt; I think something pretty unique and special has\n&gt; happened in this \n&gt; community that I&#39;ve never really seen elsewhere in\n&gt; the Evolutionary \n&gt; Computation world, which is basically a\n&gt; decentralized proliferation of \n&gt; NEAT platforms and spinoffs.  I think it will be\n&gt; very interesting for \n&gt; people to see how this community has supported its\n&gt; software and each \n&gt; other through this decentralized approach.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In that spirit I plan to highlight all the existing\n&gt; public releases to \n&gt; give people a sense of the breadth of what&#39;s\n&gt; available.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, if you have a public NEAT version (or\n&gt; spinoff project such \n&gt; as genetic art) that you believe I don&#39;t know about\n&gt; and would like \n&gt; mentioned, please feel free to let me know and I\n&gt; will mention your \n&gt; work as well.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Please note that private projects can&#39;t be included\n&gt; because after all \n&gt; the workshop is about &quot;open source&quot; software.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking forward to letting people know about all\n&gt; the great work a \n&gt; lot of you have done!\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n_______________________________\nMarmakoide aka Alexandre Devert \n_______________________________\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________________________ \nD�couvrez une nouvelle fa�on d&#39;obtenir des r�ponses � toutes vos questions ! \nProfitez des connaissances, des opinions et des exp�riences des internautes sur Yahoo!
