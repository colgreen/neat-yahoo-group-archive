A family tree,\n&gt; basically, showing parent-child relationships, when\n&gt; particular offspring arose, etc.  I&#39;m not exactly sure\n&gt; how I want to format this information yet, but I\n&gt; believe it would be useful information to represent\n&gt; graphically.\n&gt; \n\nOne thing I&#39;ve wanted to do but haven&#39;t gotten around to is make the\nspeciation graphs also show lineage.  It is entirely possible to do. \nNotice in my speciation graphs I introduce new species on the\nright-hand side.  Instead, you could instroduce them as flowing out of\nthe species from which they originated (since we can know that).  Then\nyou would see kind of &quot;splits&quot; in species as they flow downward where\nnew species broke off.  There are some special cases, such as two\ndifferent species both producing the same new species at the same\ntime, but in general those don&#39;t have to be depicted since they are so\nrare anyway.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
