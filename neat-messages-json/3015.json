But that doesn&#39;t really matter. IMHO it sounds\nl=\r\nike you are trying to get it to do too much: &quot;one output that indicates\nthe=\r\n optimal action and conviction&quot;. I have not built a billion dollar\ntrading =\r\nsystem but if it was me I would scale it back a bit. There is a\nlot of inte=\r\nlligence needed to even guess if the market is going to move\nup or down in =\r\nthe next five minutes. Much less to make complex trading\nstrategy decisions=\r\n. I would maybe try and break the problem into parts.\n\nIs the market bid pr=\r\nice going to move up or down?\nIs the market ask price going to move up or d=\r\nown?\nIs the market bid volume going to move up or down?\nIs the market ask v=\r\nolume going to move up or down?\nIs bid price going to be higher than ask pr=\r\nice?\netc.....\n\nI bet you can use time-series analysis for the above type of=\r\n problems.\nThough I am sure it won&#39;t be a trivial. Then use the resulting A=\r\nNNs as\ninput into a decision making network(s).  Maybe try and dissect the\n=\r\ndecision making problem into other decision making problems. Plus I\nwould p=\r\nrobably look at some of the  research into incremental evolution.\nTry and s=\r\nlowly evolve up the complexity of the problem and the\nintelligence of the n=\r\network  by starting with simpler problems.\n\nAdditionally maybe start by gai=\r\nning expertise in another domain of\ndecision making problems. One where you=\r\n have more control before moving\nonto the stock market. One thing about the=\r\n stock market is that you\ndon&#39;t have any control over it and anything can h=\r\nappen. So it isn&#39;t a\nvery controlled environment for experiments. So even i=\r\nf you evolve a\nnetwork that deals very well with one set of data or even se=\r\nveral. These\nsets might not be indicative of the behavior of future markets=\r\n.  For my\ntime series work I am investing much simpler well researched/docu=\r\nmented\nproblems and trying to understand them. Before moving on to\nincremen=\r\ntally more complex problems.\n\n&gt; Do you learn over various time windows to r=\r\nemove specific window bias?\n&gt;\nRight now I am learning over just one time wi=\r\nndow. The number of inputs\nI am using is huge already. So I down want to in=\r\ncrease them. But I am\nthinking of looking into that. But because I am using=\r\n a recurrent\nnetwork, the network itself can develop a sort of rudimentary =\r\nmemory\nthat allows it to improve its prediction based on the previous patte=\r\nrns\npresented. To see a very basic example of this solve for the two input\n=\r\nxor problem with recurrent links enabled. If you take the resulting\nnetwork=\r\n and present the four training patterns to it in the same order\nas during t=\r\nraining it will produce the correct output. If you start\nmixing up the orde=\r\nr of the patterns then you will get totally different\noutputs. This is beca=\r\nuse the net has either learned the order of the\npatterns and is using its m=\r\nemory to say I just saw pattern X so X+1 must\nbe next. Or it is using some =\r\nother aspect of the previous pattern to\nproduce its next output. Either way=\r\n it has developed a memory of the\npreceding event(s) that it is using to pr=\r\noduce its results for the\ncurrent event.\n\nDon&#39;t know if that is any help bu=\r\nt those are my verbose opinions on the\nmatter.\n\nThanks,\n\nShane\n\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas McCallum&quot; &lt;termcc@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I have done th=\r\ne same thing under NEAT and rtNEAT using the C++\n&gt; version.
