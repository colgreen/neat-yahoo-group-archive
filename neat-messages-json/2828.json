We think of learning across evolutionary time (where the\n&gt; genome changes) and learning within a life (with no genomic change). The\n&gt; same can be said of the word &#39;adapting&#39; and its synonyms.\n&gt;\n&gt; I prefer to use the word &#39;intralife&#39; and contrast it with &#39;interlife.&#39; Using\n&gt; this terminology, BP is intralife and EC (evolutionary computation) is\n&gt; generally interlife (unless evolution evolves the capacity for intralife\n&gt; learning, or is explicitly given it).\n&gt;   \n\nWith regards to that later point look up &#39;epigenetics&#39; on wikipedia. An \nexample of this in the NEAT world would be to run BP on evolved ANN&#39;s \nand to then store the discovered connection weights back into the genome.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
