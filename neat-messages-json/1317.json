Photo album IEX has two images.  Ignore the thumbnails, look at the\n&gt; actual images.  The first image is a 9x9 input image, what is being input\n&gt; into the network.  The other is the target image, what the network wants to\n&gt; be able to reproduce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every activation returns ONE pixel.  Which pixel, and how big that pixel is\n&gt; is determined by the top,left,right,bottom inputs.  a top,left of 0,0 and\n&gt; bottom,right of 1,1 means return one pixel that corresponds to the average\n&gt; intensity of the whole target image.  With a bottom,right of 0.5,0.5 it\n&gt; means return the average intensity of the region that is the upper left\n&gt; quadrant of the target image.  Make sense?\n\nYup...thanks for the images.
