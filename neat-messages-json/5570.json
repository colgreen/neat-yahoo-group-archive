Ken and I have had some discuss=\r\nions about possible ways to do it in the past, but haven&#39;t done any experim=\r\nents. \n\nThe main complication when combining both techniques is that the be=\r\nhavior of a particular individual is no longer statically well-defined in c=\r\noevolution, but is dependent on what individual(s) it is evaluated with. Fo=\r\nr example, the board states that a checkers-playing agent proceeds through =\r\ndepends on its opponent.\n\nA similar issue would arise when applying novelty=\r\n search in a noisy environment; its behavior might then be probabilistic. Y=\r\nou could do multiple evaluations and have a behavioral characterization tha=\r\nt is related to the distribution of behaviors. Alternatively, novelty searc=\r\nh might be robust enough that nothing special needs to be done.\n\nThis direc=\r\ntion of research is very interesting though, and I hope that you follow up =\r\non it. I think it is particularly promising if done right because competiti=\r\nve coevolution is a potential a path to open-ended evolution (e.g. the red =\r\nqueen hypothesis). However, in practice coevolution is subject to coevoluti=\r\nonary forms of &quot;deceptive local optima&quot; (e.g. mediocre stable states, disen=\r\ngagement ,etc.) which novelty search has proved effective with dealing with=\r\n in other non coevolutionary domains.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nze_dakster&quot; &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious about merging nov=\r\nelty search with competitive coevolution, and haven&#39;t been able to find any=\r\n papers describing such an undertaking yet. Anyone aware of any papers cove=\r\nring that topic?\n&gt; \n&gt; Much thanks in advance for any tips.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
