A po=\r\npular quick\nstart guide:\nhttp://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/22/QuickstartGu=\r\nidetoSubversiononSourceForge.aspx\nfor SVN on sourceforge (http://sourceforg=\r\ne.net/docs/E09).\n\n&gt;I really like\n&gt; the support for these repositories in Ec=\r\nlipse (www.eclipse.org), and\n&gt; even if you make it very restricted access i=\r\nt can still be useful to\n&gt; see detailed revision histories for files. It&#39;s =\r\nanother level of\n&gt; transparency (after providing the source code) that can =\r\naid in using\n&gt; the codebase and confirming/finding bugs.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; The othe=\r\nr aspect I&#39;m fuzzy on is CVS/SVN support in MS Visual Studio\n\nhttp://ankhsv=\r\nn.tigris.org/ &quot;AnkhSVN: A Subversion addin for Microsoft\nVisual Studio .NET=\r\n&quot;. I use it extensively, works beautifully (much\nbetter than the inbuilt Vi=\r\nsual Source Safe) although its still handy\nto have tortoisesvn installed as=\r\n well for the off rare chore.\n\nThere is a .NET plugin for Eclipse floating =\r\naround but have never used\nit myself.\n\n--\nKeith\n\n\n"}}
