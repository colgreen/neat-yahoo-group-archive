My research group certainly does a lot of work with NEAT so we \nwou=\r\nld actually purchase something like that (assuming funds were \navailable) i=\r\nf the price was sufficiently competitive to be faster for \nthe dollar compa=\r\nred to something more simple like a regular CPU \ncluster.\n\nSo I think that =\r\nis the main pricing question:  For $10,000, if you \nare efficient, you can =\r\nbuy maybe a 20-core cluster, which in effect \nis a 10x speedup from a regul=\r\nar 2-core CPU.  So a 20x speedup sounds \neconomical if it is genuine.\n\nYet =\r\nI am not clear how such gains would be made specifically with \nNEAT in mind=\r\n?  One of the biggest expenses with running experiments \nwith NEAT comes du=\r\nring evaluation in the task domain, which includes \na lot of code (aside fr=\r\nom the ANN activation method) that is not \nspecific to NEAT.  In fact, in m=\r\nany domains, it is task the domain \nsimulation itself that takes the vast m=\r\najority of CPU.  For example, \na task trained in a robot simulator spends m=\r\nore time simulating the \nrobot than doing anything NEAT-specific.  Of cours=\r\ne, in some \nsupervised applications (e.g. financial data) it is possible th=\r\nat \nnetwork activation takes up more CPU than the domain since the domain \n=\r\nis in effect just a bunch of numerical comparisons.\n\nSo the questions is wh=\r\nat exactly is being accelerated and how, so \nthat a purchaser can be confid=\r\nent that they are going to get the \noffered speedup overall, and not just w=\r\nhen NEAT-specific code is \nbeing called?\n\nAnyway, sounds really interesting=\r\n and I&#39;d enjoy hearing more about it.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;shanemcdonaldryan&quot; \n&lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My company is in th=\r\ne process of developing a NEAT accelerator. This \n&gt; would be a combination =\r\nof hardware and software that accelerates \nthe \n&gt; process of evolving a pop=\r\nulation of networks for a particular NEAT \n&gt; application.\n&gt; \n&gt; We anticipat=\r\ne a 20 fold reduction in training time compared to a \n&gt; system running on a=\r\n single CPU Dual Core Pentium system. But this \n&gt; would of course depend gr=\r\neatly upon the problem at hand.\n&gt; \n&gt; The product will consist of an API wri=\r\ntten in C that will interface \n&gt; with a hardware system and accelerate the =\r\ncore functionality of the \n&gt; NEAT algorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; A feature set and pricing=\r\n model has not been finalized.  Though to \n&gt; make the product financially v=\r\niable a tentative price of $10K USD \nhas \n&gt; been estimated.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason=\r\n I am posting is to gauge interest. If you or your \ncompany \n&gt; would be int=\r\nerested in this product please send me an e-mail to: \n&gt; ShaneR at RyanCapit=\r\nal dot EU. Additionally if you have any \nquestions \n&gt; or concerns please e-=\r\nmail me or post on this forum and will try and \n&gt; answer them as quickly as=\r\n possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shane\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
