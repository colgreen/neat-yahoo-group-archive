I enjoyed\n&gt;  having the opportunity to ask my question to such illustrious\n&gt;  scientists, but like you, I was kind of disappointed with their\n&gt;  answers. Like you said, they sort of answered accurately, but there\n&gt;  was no real insight or thoughtfulness in what they said.\n&gt;\n&gt;  It&#39;s interesting that you point out this exchange because I think it\n&gt;  highlights a weakness in how biologists have been dealing with the\n&gt;  question of complexity. It&#39;s such a fundamental question yet it\n&gt;  hasn&#39;t really received the treatment it deserves, even from the\n&gt;  field&#39;s luminaries. I think part of the problem is that a genuine\n&gt;  treatment requires a kind of algorithmic and representational theory,\n&gt;  which is perhaps better attacked from a computational perspective,\n&gt;  putting evolutionary computation researchers at an advantage because\n&gt;  we think about search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc. routinely.\n\nYes, I think you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably come at the\nproblem from an angle that might be more productive, but I&#39;m\nespecially disappointed in Wolpert, who was the main voice for\ndevelopmental biology on the panel. Your question gets to issues that\na developmental biologist should primarily be interested in.\n\nEven if he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the development of\nthe human brain, he should have been able to give other examples with\nwhich he was more familiar.\n\nBy the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A small step for\nthe cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical\nexpansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T0V-3Y6PFXS-1P&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97aee43\n\nHere&#39;s the abstract:\n\nThe more than 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface without a\ncomparable increase in its thickness during mammalian evolution is\nexplained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis of cortical\ndevelopment. According to the proposed model, cortical expansion is\nthe result of changes in proliferation kinetics that increase the\nnumber of radial columnar units without changing the number of neurons\nwithin each unit significantly. Thus, mutation of a regulatory gene(s)\nthat controls the timing and ratio of symmetric and asymmetric modes\nof cell divisions in the proliferative zone, coupled with radial\nconstraints in the distribution of migrating neurons, could create an\nexpanded cortical plate with enhanced capacity for establishing new\npatterns of connectivity that are validated through natural selection.\n\nI&#39;m personally working under the assumption that the cortical\nminicolumn is the primary module, that repeatable bit of code that\nDawkins talked about, and there are a number of good work by\nbiologists out there, including Rakic, who give support to such an\nidea.\n\n&gt;  Perhaps they were just being curt or did not take the audience\n&gt;  seriously enough to elaborate their thoughts. Yet I find that\n&gt;  explanation doubtful given that we were after all at a &quot;debate&quot; about\n&gt;  evolution and complexity, which is precisely the substance of my\n&gt;  question. I also agree that Dawkins seemed closest to really\n&gt;  thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would be very interested in\n&gt;  our area of EC if only there was an opportunity to tell him about\n&gt;  it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of experience with it\n&gt;  beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n\nI guess you didn&#39;t have a chance to corner him and talk things over?\n:) Dawkins does seem like he would be interested in a lot of the work\nbeing presented at GECCO. Did he just show up for the panel, or was he\naround the conference at all?\n\nI was also thought the other really interesting exchange was at 33:45\nin the video, when the question of whether or not you could evolve a\nmouse with feathered wings came up, and Wolpert and Jones both said\nno, while Dawkins seemed to say probably not, but not for any of the\nreasons the other guys came up with.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
