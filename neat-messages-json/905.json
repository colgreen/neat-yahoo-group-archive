Is this because the experiments\n&gt; you compare against also do this?\n\nXOR we&#39;re comparing against Ken&#39;s data, and he clamps the # of\nspecies.  The Tic-Tac-Toe experiments aren&#39;t directly compared with\nany other results, and none of the papers I cite besides the ones\npertaining to NEAT use speciated populations anyway.\n\nI don&#39;t know how big a difference clamping the number of species\nmakes.  We thought leaving the number unclamped seemed a bit more\norganic.  Perhaps it&#39;s a detriment, though.  Don&#39;t know.\n\n&gt; 2) You square the fitness value obtained for XOR. What is the thinking\n&gt; behind this?\n\nIt&#39;s a standard method of amplifying errors in order to make easier\ndistinctions between outputs that are way off the mark and those that\nare only slightly off the mark.\n\n&gt; 3) The Tic-Tac-Toe experiment uses the &quot;standard hyperbolic tangent&quot;\n&gt; activation function. Again, is this to give a more accurate comparison\n&gt; with other experiments?\n\nNo.  It was a somewhat arbitrary choice.  A sigmoid activation\nfunction could just as easily have been used.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
