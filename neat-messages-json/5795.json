But what does that mean for algorithms that do not work on huma=\r\nn-level intelligences?   Can an abstract social-learning algorithm exhibit =\r\nthe same benefits, or will it tend more towards convergence because of the =\r\nrapid proliferation of the highest-fitness &quot;wisdom&quot; throughout society?\n\nke=\r\nn\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ke=\r\nn,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; We did actually try leveraging the species created by =\r\nNEAT, but\n&gt; unfortunately that wasn&#39;t useful for two reasons. First, the di=\r\nstribution\n&gt; of the population was heavily lopsided. We had a population of=\r\n 100 genomes\n&gt; and 10 species, but the size of species 0 was usually around=\r\n 80 genomes.\n&gt; Second, even accounting for this, we saw better performance =\r\nfrom randomly\n&gt; selecting individuals for subcultures.\n&gt; \n&gt; This makes intu=\r\nitive sense to me, since speciation is intended for the\n&gt; opposite of what =\r\nsubcultures should be doing. Speciation is aimed at\n&gt; grouping similar indi=\r\nviduals in genome space, thereby protecting (with the\n&gt; help of fitness sha=\r\nring) innovation in the population and allowing it to\n&gt; flourish. Subcultur=\r\nes, however, are intended to create diverse groups of\n&gt; individuals in phen=\r\nome space and thus promote the sharing of innovations\n&gt; among the populatio=\r\nn. In this light, I think it&#39;s clear why randomly\n&gt; composed subcultures wo=\r\nuld outperform species-based: individuals in the\n&gt; same species, with simil=\r\nar genomes, are more likely to have similar\n&gt; phenotypic behavior and obser=\r\nvations of similar individuals really won&#39;t\n&gt; help social agents outside of=\r\n some minor local optimization on the\n&gt; sub-policies they have already disc=\r\novered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Philosophically, I think the results are actually very encoura=\r\nging when\n&gt; applied to human society. We show that the notion of learning o=\r\nnly from\n&gt; what those in power tell you is actually a suboptimal strategy. =\r\nRather,\n&gt; everyone-- rich, poor, young, old, etc-- may have something to co=\r\nntribute\n&gt; and even if overall they aren&#39;t as &quot;fit&quot; as everyone else, their=\r\n individual\n&gt; actions can still have worth and add value to society.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\npecifically to novelty, I believe social transmission is crucial in human\n&gt;=\r\n societies. Generally when biologists study learning paradigms in nature,\n&gt;=\r\n there are a few levels of cognitive ability. In our experiments we were\n&gt; =\r\neffectively applying  an emulation paradigm, where agents learn to mimic\n&gt; =\r\nexact behaviors. Humans fortunately function at a higher level, imitation,\n=\r\n&gt; because we can observe a behavior and then acquire new skills or talents =\r\nby\n&gt; combining it with other knowledge or experiences we&#39;ve previously acqu=\r\nired,\n&gt; resulting in an entirely new behavior. So from my perspective, soci=\r\nal\n&gt; learning among humans is one not a threat to novelty, but rather one o=\r\nf the\n&gt; greatest sources of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Apr 1=\r\n9, 2012 at 6:48 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi Wesley, congrats on the GECCO paper and also thanks for sharing the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n software. I do have a couple questions/comments:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The subculture id=\r\nea is interesting but did you consider aligning the\n&gt; &gt; subcultures with th=\r\ne NEAT-determined species divisions? It seems strange\n&gt; &gt; that a &quot;subcultur=\r\ne&quot; could cut across species, though I suppose the\n&gt; &gt; existence of dogs and=\r\n cats in human households is sort of analogous. On the\n&gt; &gt; other hand when =\r\nyou can actually &quot;learn&quot; to be almost identical to another\n&gt; &gt; species (as =\r\nyou can when you are just a neural network) maybe it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; really mat=\r\nter that much what species you started from.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On a more philosophica=\r\nl level, it&#39;s interesting that teaching in general\n&gt; &gt; is a kind of converg=\r\nent force towards conformity. Obviously some of that is\n&gt; &gt; necessary in so=\r\nciety, but it raises the question of whether societies\n&gt; &gt; transmit creativ=\r\nity through teaching (or at least can avoid damaging\n&gt; &gt; creativity when te=\r\naching). This question is a bit abstract, but it does\n&gt; &gt; relate to novelty=\r\n search - the kind of divergent proliferation of stepping\n&gt; &gt; stones seen i=\r\nn non-objective search is potentially inhibited in a social\n&gt; &gt; learning so=\r\nciety. So it raises the question of whether you can actually\n&gt; &gt; have both =\r\nsocial transmission and non-objective divergence together.\n&gt; &gt; Interestingl=\r\ny, human society seems to have both ingredients working very\n&gt; &gt; effectivel=\r\ny together.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tan=\r\nsey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m proud to announce =\r\nmy first GECCO paper!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Title: Accelerating Evolution via Egalita=\r\nrian Social Learning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Authors: Wesley Tansey, Eliana Feasley, and Rist=\r\no Miikkulainen\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abstract:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Social learning is an extension =\r\nto evolutionary algorithms that enables\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agents to learn from observat=\r\nions of others in the population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Historically, social learning algor=\r\nithms have employed a student-teacher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model where the behavior of one=\r\n or more high-fitness agents is used to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; train a subset of the remaini=\r\nng agents in the population. This paper\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presents ESL, an egalitarian =\r\nmodel of social learning in which agents are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not labeled as teachers =\r\nor students, instead allowing any individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; receiving a sufficiently=\r\n high reward to teach other agents to mimic its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recent behavior. We v=\r\nalidate our approach through a series of experiments\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a robot forag=\r\ning domain, including comparisons of egalitarian social\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning with=\r\n baseline neuroevolution and a variant of student-teacher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; social lear=\r\nning. In a complex foraging task, ESL converges to\n&gt; &gt; near-optimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\ntrategies faster than either benchmark approach, outperforming both by\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; more than an order of magnitude. The results indicate that egalitarian\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; social learning is a promising new paradigm for social learning in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; intelligent agents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paper page: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-v=\r\niew.php?PubID=3D127157\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Github repository for all source code:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; https://github.com/tansey/social-learning\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A couple of thin=\r\ngs to note here that I believe will be very helpful to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone using S=\r\nharpNEAT in general:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - If you&#39;re looking to do Lamarckian evolu=\r\ntion, it turns out to be very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy: https://gist.github.com/2410490\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - We implemented backpropagation through time for the FastCyclic=\r\nNetwork.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Using the SharpNeatV2 that is in the github repo, you can pe=\r\nrform\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supervised learning on a NEAT network very easily, enabling onl=\r\nine\n&gt; &gt; learning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms to be incorporated into SharpNEAT experim=\r\nents:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; https://gist.github.com/2410545\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Colin, I&#39;d love if =\r\nyou could take a look at the backprop implementation\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potentia=\r\nlly integrate it into a future release of SharpNEAT.
