If it&#39;s better and more efficient than using the \ngraphical API for whatever language you&#39;re working in, great.\n\n&gt; Speaking of which, I finally got my network visualization algorithm \ntuned \n&gt; properly, with the forces of attraction vs. repulsion balanced so \nas to \n&gt; create the appropriate shape.  I&#39;ve uploaded a sample to the files \nsection \n&gt; of the group so you guys can see it.  This is the &#39;simplified&#39; one, \nwith \n&gt; only 147 nodes and their relationships.  The full data set has 63k \n&gt; nodes...there&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever be able to view that one!!!\n\nHmm...looks pretty cool.  Is every node connected to every other one, \njust with different strengths?  That would make over 20K connections, \nwhich is going to take a long time to render.  \n\nAnd I don&#39;t think there would any really feasible way to represent a \nsingle graph of 63K nodes.  The conceptual linking does remind me \nsomewhat of The Brain (Enterprise Knowledge Platform), a conceptual \nhyperlinking engine (http://www.thebrain.com/).  It&#39;s used by \nKurzweilAI.com as a subject index...here&#39;s the page on AI:\n\nhttp://www.kurzweilai.net/brain/frame.html?startThought=Artificial%\n20Intelligence%20(AI)\n\n&gt; Do you have a good SVG online reference that you use?  \n\nThe W3Schools tutorial is pretty good:\n\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/svg/default.asp\n\nIt does a good job of relating the attributes of each of the \ngraphical tags.  Honestly, when I was learning the basics of SVG, I \nbought the O&#39;Reilly book and mostly tinkered with examples from the \ntext.  You can do all sorts of fancy stuff with SVG, including \nanimation, but I&#39;ve stuck to just rendering basic shapes, paths, and \ntext.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
