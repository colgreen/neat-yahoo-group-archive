After 7 years going back an=\r\nd trying to understand the old code for setting up these configurations is =\r\na challenge.  I believe what is going on is that we divide the left side of=\r\n the board into a 3 column and 4 row grid (giving 12 cells).  The same is d=\r\none for the right side of the board (so 12 cells there).  For the 144 combi=\r\nnations, we step through all the 12 possible positions on the left side and=\r\n place a good there for the outer loop, and all the 12 possible positions o=\r\nn the right side and place a food there on the inner loop.  Recall that eac=\r\nh configuration involves only the placement of two pieces of food (one on t=\r\nhe left side and one on the right), and all the other food are in their usu=\r\nal static positions at the start.  Then we get to 288 by flipping the start=\r\ning positions of the robots themselves and doing all the 144 configurations=\r\n again.\n\nThe one thing I&#39;m a little uncertain about is if it was really 3 b=\r\ny 4, or perhaps 4 by 3 on each side.  Or even 6 by 2, or maybe 2 by 6.  I&#39;m=\r\n but I don&#39;t think it really matters for the purposes of this test since th=\r\ne point is just to try a lot of different starting scenarios so the exact c=\r\nolumns and rows shouldn&#39;t be critical.\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nken\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ze_dakster&quot; &lt;drew.kirkpatrick@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I&#39;m wondering if you had any detail on the food placements you used for yo=\r\nur dominance tournament in the original competitive coevolution robot duel?=\r\n I&#39;m looking over the paper &quot;The Dominance Tournament Method of Monitoring =\r\nProgress in Coevolution&quot;, and it gives a little more detail on the approach=\r\n taken. I&#39;m still fuzzy on how you arrange the food items to get 144 positi=\r\nons per starting side, for 288 total evaluations. \n&gt; \n&gt; I suppose it&#39;s not =\r\ncritical for my purposes to *exactly* recreate the layouts as long as the d=\r\nominance tournament works, but if you have any documentation detailing the =\r\nexact locations I might as well throw them in there for good measure. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -Drew Kirkpatrick\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
