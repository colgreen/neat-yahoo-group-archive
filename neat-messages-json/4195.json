That is similar to what\nhappens wh=\r\nen two connections have different weights and you simply\npick one of the we=\r\nights (as in multipoints crossover).  You could use\nfitness to decide which=\r\n one to pick, or simply pick randomly.  I don&#39;t\nthink it will cause too muc=\r\nh trouble either way because in general\nthere will not be a huge amount of =\r\ndisparity unless the mutation rate\non activation functions is too high, and=\r\n what disparity there is will\nsimply be dealt with through natural selectio=\r\nn.\n\nI agree however that changing innovation numbers of multiple pieces of\n=\r\nstructure would be adding a lot of unnecessary baggage to the algorithm.\n\nk=\r\nen\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;godin.gregory&quot; &lt;godin.gregory@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your Feedback.\n&gt; I see your point, but if I le=\r\nave the innovation number as you \n&gt; suggests, how do I choose the activatio=\r\nn function during mating?\n&gt; Maybe I can take the activation functions of th=\r\ne genome with the \n&gt; higher fitness and risking to lose the mutation.\n&gt; Ano=\r\nther solution would be to disable both neuron and its connections \n&gt; and co=\r\npy them with new innovation numbers. But this solution has the \n&gt; drawback =\r\nto increase very quickly the distance between two genome.\n&gt; \n&gt; The benefits=\r\n of adding this kind of mutation may be not worth the \n&gt; price of the inher=\r\nent complexity it adds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Greg.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Greg, welcome to th=\r\ne group.  I believe it would be okay to let\n&gt; &gt; activation functions inside=\r\n nodes mutate, but if that is done I \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; not change the neuron to =\r\na neuron with a different innovation \n&gt; number.\n&gt; &gt;  That would not work we=\r\nll for NEAT because it would mean that the \n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; connection connects =\r\nto more than one neuron (i.e. in some cases the\n&gt; &gt; original neuron and in =\r\nsome cases the new neuron), which means that\n&gt; &gt; the actual network structu=\r\nre becomes ambiguous e.g. during mating of\n&gt; &gt; such individuals.    \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; However, I understand the motivation for your suggestion, but I am\n&gt; &gt; g=\r\nuessing if the chance of mutation is low enough it will not be all\n&gt; &gt; that=\r\n destructive to simply mutate the functions while leaving the\n&gt; &gt; innovatio=\r\nn numbers for their respective nodes unchanged.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, I wo=\r\nuld consider this issue an implementation detail, so\n&gt; &gt; it is not necessar=\r\nily an &quot;official&quot; part of the HyperNEAT system \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; it does or does =\r\nnot mutate the activation functions of\n&gt; &gt; already-existing nodes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;godin.gregory&quot; &lt;godin.gregory@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First off, let me introduce myself.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a french developper working in IT software compagny \n&gt; completely \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; non related to IA.
