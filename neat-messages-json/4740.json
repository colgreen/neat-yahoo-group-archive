So, in order to discover which inputs are=\r\n more relevant than others, i am thinking of initial state of 0 hidden node=\r\ns and do increases of hidden nodes by 1 and only allow 20% of the best popu=\r\nlation to go for next stage.\nFor example:\nStage1.1 Start the process with a=\r\n maximum of 1 hidden nodes (i.e. mutate_add_node() function is not allowed =\r\nto execute if genome has one node already). Randomly connect inputs. Mutate=\r\n weights. Evolve for a considerable time(still to find out how much).\nStage=\r\n1.2 Remove 80% percent of the population. \nStage2.1 Start with population t=\r\nhat survived stage 1. Allow genomes to grow during mutation 1 node more (ma=\r\nximum 2 nodes per network now). Evolve for a considerable time.\nStage2.2 Re=\r\nmove 80% percent of the population. \nStage3.1 Start with population that su=\r\nrvived stage 2. Allow networks to grow 1 node more (maximum 3 nodes per net=\r\nwork) ....\nAnd so on... \n\nAs you see, the basic idea, is to limit the growt=\r\nh of depth of the networks, forcing them to first find the best solution at=\r\n the minimum possible ammount of network depth, before adding more nodes. \n=\r\nThere will be no limits on how many links can be created.\nDo you think this=\r\n method will improve the search?\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n"}}
