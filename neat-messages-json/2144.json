At this point though I think we should distinguish\n&gt;between the two (that come to mind) benefits of NEAT&#39;s discrete species:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) Each species represents a distinct point or area in the search space,\n&gt;and therefore speciation allows NEAT to search several areas of the\n&gt;search space simultaneously.\n&gt;2) Mating between genomes within a species are more likely to generate\n&gt;good offspring - than mating with more distant genomes from other species.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure if there exists hard evidence/research to back up these two\n&gt;points. I&#39;m happy to assume that (1) is the case. (2) though is a bit\n&gt;more shaky. Actually one experiment I would like to do is track the\n&gt;quantity and quality of offspring and to graph this against their\n&gt;origin, e.g. mutation or crossover, and the genetic distance between\n&gt;parents. I wouldn&#39;t be /too/ surprised if it turned out that crossover\n&gt;didn&#39;t generate many good offspring and thus I don&#39;t feel comfortable\n&gt;assuming (2).\n&gt;\n&gt;Ok now consider that the discrete speciation in NEAT does indeed perform\n&gt;(1) fairly well, and there isn&#39;t that much room for improvement.\n&gt;Therefore any new speciation technique should probably maintain the\n&gt;benefits of (1) whilst improving (2). Does a heap based continous\n&gt;speciation meet these criteria?\n&gt;\n&gt;Certainly the heap maintains genomes over a number of areas of the\n&gt;search space, or at least over one wide area. It&#39;s not clear to me if\n&gt;the genomes would form clusters in the search space, as with discrete\n&gt;speciation, or whether perhaps they would describe a tree structure.\n&gt;Thus I can see that (1) seems intact, but (2)?\n&gt;\n&gt;It seems to me that the heap structure is trying to maintain two things\n&gt;- a hierachy of fitness and a hierachy of genetic distance. The first is\n&gt;explicity coded into the heap, the second though I think can become\n&gt;broken when really fit genomes bubble up to the top of the heap and\n&gt;become h-parents of genomes that are genetically dissimilar. Thus when\n&gt;selecting mating pairs we may end up with two very different genomes\n&gt;(couldn&#39;t we?), when ideally we probably want to select mates within\n&gt;some genetic distance range. Actually in discrete speciation we might\n&gt;find that some species generate good offspring with a wider or narrower\n&gt;range than others.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m going to leave it there as I&#39;m not really forming a clear train of\n&gt;though on this one right now :(\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
