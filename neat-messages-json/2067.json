In general this is something you don&#39;t see when \nyou do a normal generational experiment, since you dont see everyone \nat once, but in NERO since we saw everyone at once, we could see the \neffect of a high bias.  One theory is that a high bias can easily \ncause one of the turn outputs to go high with a relatively low \nweight, making &quot;spinniness&quot; a likely genetic trait.  My conclusion \nhas since been to keep biases below 1.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
