It is certainly still interesting the \n&gt;rate at which genes should be disabled or reinstated, and it is \n&gt;quite related to the work on pruning that e.g. Colin has been doing \n&gt;with SharpNEAT, or Derek and Philip have been doing with ANJI (these \n&gt;people are all in this group).  Although they use actual deletion \n&gt;operators, it is still related to disabling and the overall question \n&gt;of how much to simplify vs. complexify.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve seen \n&gt;any of their work in this area?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh SharpNEAT no longer has a disable flag on the connection genes, they \nare either present and therefore expressed in the network, or they are \ndeleted for good. Of course a gene that is deleted from one genome may \nstill exist elsewhere in the population, so just because it has been \ndeleted from a specific genome doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t make a comeback in \nthat genome&#39;s descedant line at some point in the future.\n\nAs I recall my main reason for removal of the disable bit was that I \nfelt it was redundant following the implementation of the &#39;delete gene&#39; \nmutation. I also felt that keeping a lot of diabled genes around would \neffect performance of the  NEAT algorithm by causing genome &#39;bloat&#39; - \nhow many diabled genes do you want to keep? How many is too many? etc.\n\nThere is bit more backround on the use of deletion mutations in my write \nup of my phased complexification/simplification search experiments here:\n\nhttp://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/phasedsearch.html\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
