I&#39;m\nunderstanding the point and largely agree with Ken&#39;s and other&#39;s view\nthat focusing on test metrics can tend to be be a distraction,\nalthough I&#39;m not in academia and have yet to submit a paper for\npublication so my understanding of the problem at journal paper\nacceptance level is zero.\n\nAre papers really rejected based on whether they present a comparison\nor comparisons with existing methods? I would hope that a novel method\nthat shows that it succeeds on a reasonably difficult test would be\npublished regardless of any comparison, the point being that such a\nmethod is a new idea, qualitatively different and therefore worthy of\npublication to spread the idea and maybe spark further ideas. Whereas\na paper that makes a tweak and improves performance by say 50% (e.g.\nsolved problem in 1 CPU hour instead of 2), is maybe interesting and\nworthy for those working on that particular method but is probably not\nof wider interest.\n\nThat said, I would like to throw the idea out there that maybe it&#39;s\nnot all that bad a situation, if a novel method is head and shoulders\nabove the current best then presumably this would be evident in a\nrange of problem domains. But yes, how do you follow a path  of\nresearch that gets to that method if you&#39;re too focused on metrics.\nHow very &#39;meta&#39; :)\n\nBut as all of us on here will be aware, evolution in nature consists\nboth of large disruptive jumps that cause a flurry of new solutions to\nbe searched in a relatively short span of time (e.g. Cambrian\nexplosion), as well as smooth steady incremental improvements, and\nyes, periods of relative stagnation. A single paper could and\neventually will make a large jump that shakes up the entire research\ncommunity. I think the novelty search research &#39;track&#39; is a good\ncandidate for spawning that paper.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
