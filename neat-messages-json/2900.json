This is=\r\n just because separation bounds of different \nclasses are unknown and in la=\r\nrge ANNs extra neurons can be used to \nstabilize &quot;working&quot; neurons. There a=\r\nre some results from statistical \nlearning theory concerning toplogical com=\r\nplexity of ANN, for example \nVCDim (Vapnik-Chervonenkis&#39;s Dimension):\n\n2[K/=\r\n2]N &lt;=3D VCDim &lt;=3D 2N_w(1+lg{N_n}),\n\nwhere [] -- means convertion to integ=\r\ner, K -- numer of nodes in hidden \nlayer, N -- dimension of input vector, N=\r\n_w -- overall number of \nweights in ANN, N_n -- overall number of neurons.\n=\r\n\nBut this is a heuristic for SVM and RBF. Moreover VCDim doesn&#39;t \nconsider =\r\nshorcut connections which tend to appear in result of NEAT or \nanother NE a=\r\nlgorithms that search topology of ANN without strict \nconstraints. I&#39;m sure=\r\n that there should be novel mathematical results \nin this field but I suspe=\r\nct they don&#39;t solve the whole problem due to \ngreat variety of tasks and un=\r\ncertainity of data in many of them.\n\nAnyway, you can try early stopping tec=\r\nhnique. For this a validation \nset of data is needed (in addition to traini=\r\nng and test sets). You can \nform validation set simply by picking some samp=\r\nles from training set \nand some samples from the test set. But ensure that =\r\nresulting \ntraining, validation and test sets are representative enough for=\r\n \ncompetent learning.\n\nThe early stopping implementation have the following=\r\n steps:\n1. ANN training for N generations using training data set.\n2. Valid=\r\nation of current population using validation set. If average \nfitness is no=\r\nt worse than after the training step than proceed to Step \n1 otherwise we c=\r\nonsider that ANN is overfitting the training data and \nproceed to Step 3.\n3=\r\n. Stop\n\nGood luck,\nYury\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Richard Gong&quot; &lt;gongr=\r\nichard@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to prevent NEAT from overt=\r\nraining.
