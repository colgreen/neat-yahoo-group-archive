I agree that in theory adding fundamental \ndata into the mix is a good idea.\nUnfortunateley I haven&#39;t found a way of getting good historic data for \nthose parameters which means\nI can&#39;t really train a net adequately using them. I have daily \nopen,high,low,close & volume data for about\n17,000 stocks, some with data sets going back to 1962 so that&#39;s what I&#39;m \ngoing to use as my inputs\n(suitably processed & normalised of course).\nI&#39;m a great believer in the efficient market hypothesis. Bizarrely, even \na few days before Sept. 11th there\nwas a rush to buy short positions in the futures market. Especially on \nAirplane Operator stocks!\nObviously the conspiracy theorists among us will have their own ideas on \nthis, but my view is that sometimes\nsmall movements (caused by rumour or a modicum of insider dealing) will \ntrigger some more people t\no jump on the bandwagon (especially the banks and the pension funds) and \nyou get positive feedback\ncycles kicking up which will take the price a fair bit lower or higher.  \nI&#39;m trying to see if it&#39;s possible to\ntrain a net to recognise when such things are on the cards.\n\nEmyr\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
