I wanted to convert the \nprogram to use NEAT and to c=\r\nhange a few concepts regarding the \n_inputs and outputs_. \nPlease let me kn=\r\now what do you think about this technique and if you \nknow a better way:\n1.=\r\n Perform normalizations on the sound and removing the non-relevant \nparts \n=\r\n2. Perform FFT and focus on the vocal frequency only, separating the \ndata =\r\nto 16 &quot;channels&quot; (300Hz to 2.8KHz) \n3. Calculate the Polynom coefficient fo=\r\nr each channel, coefficient \nlevel is 6.\n\n=3D&gt; 97 NN inputs, 6 x 16 (+bias)=\r\n.\nI wanted the output to be 6 &quot;bit&quot;, having the ability to record 64 \ndiffe=\r\nrent words per NN.\n\nI want the learning to be relatively fast.. is this the=\r\n correct way? \nAny better idea?\nMaybe I can try to learn the syllables and =\r\nbreak the words to that.. \nbut that&#39;s seams to be much more complicated.\n\nT=\r\nhanks,\nAriel.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
