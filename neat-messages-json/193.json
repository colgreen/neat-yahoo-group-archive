Your real target should be the six-card game,\n&gt; and larger.  But you can do the 4-card game on the way\n&gt; there.  It will be interesting to see how many neurons\n&gt; you wind up with.  To play well the network must\n&gt; remember which two of the 4 cards were exposed by the\n&gt; first player, and whether each of those was a 1 or a\n&gt; 2.\n&gt; Then it must use that data to turn over an unexposed\n&gt; card, and then pick the single exposed card that\n&gt; matches it.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure NEAT would solve this task with no problem.  It \nseems that since NEAT can evolve topologies, it has a good\nshot at finding a more efficient topology than a fully-recurrent\nnet.  But how specific is that optimal structure?  It really\nwould be quite interesting to see how NEAT would handle the problem.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
