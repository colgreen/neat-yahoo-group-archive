The max fitness for\nthis domain is 260, I believe.  For the first few hundred generations,\nthe population improves to about 80, but for the next several\n*thousand* generations, the max and average fitness for the population\ngets worse and worse, ending up essentially as good as the initial\nrandom population (~10).\n\nThis isn&#39;t about simpler or more complex individuals performing better\nor worse.  This is about the entire population getting *worse*\nthroughout the run.  It certainly seems to me that this is not the way\nNEAT is supposed to work.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
