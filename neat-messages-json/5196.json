This person will at each timestep choose a random direction,\nwalk a few steps and plant a flag.\nIn the first case you will get a representative sample of the landscape. In\nthe second you get a trail with the different flags being at similar\nheights. He might land on the planes and miss the hills altogether. The\nlandscape will be poorly represented.\nA more sophisticated search algorithm, will reduce the impact of this\nproblem, as the person will sometimes jump to faraway locations. The problem\nhowever will never be eliminated, as a kind of a local search is in integral\npart of any fitness directed search algorithm.\n\nAdditionally, I think there should be another subtler problem with random\nfitness directed search, which will manifest itself in representations with\nvariable size genotypes. It will cause the code size to grow much faster\nthan what is optimally wanted in a random search and produce overly\nconvoluted solutions, where in reality we we want the solutions to be\nsimple.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Ken&quot;\n&lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the best way to quantify the difference would be to implement the\nkind of random search that you are interested in and then compare it in the\nsame domain (and other domains, if you want to be thorough). Of course, if\nyou found that any type of completely random process consistently\noutperforms fitness significantly in reasonable domains (as novelty does) it\nwould be a huge shock. \n&gt; \n&gt; You suggest that the random search that we implemented is worse than the\nkind of random search that you describe. I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think\nthere is an a priori reason to believe that any given totally uninformed\nprocess is better than another. You note that our random search may be more\n&quot;uneven,&quot; which could be true, but there is no a priori reason to believe\nthat being &quot;even&quot; is better for a given domain. Generally, even with totally\nrandom searches you are facing a kind of no free lunch situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the most important question underlying your curiosity is why we\nwould expect novelty to be better than random. There are many answers to\nthis question, but perhaps one helpful insight is that novelty is an\ninformative gradient. That is, quite the opposite of random search, novelty\nis information-rich, which means that the novelty metric tells us a lot\nabout how different points in the search space relate to each other. In\nfact, one way to understand the relationship among random, fitness, and\nnovelty, is to realize that fitness actually provides less information than\nnovelty, putting it between random and novelty on the scale of\ninformation-richness. The reason fitness provides less information is that\nmany behaviors that are different from each other receive the same fitness,\nwhereas novelty search would notice their difference. Thus, in fitness-based\nsearch, moving among such conflated behaviors is similar to a random search,\nbecause there is no gradient among them. \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com,\n&quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Looks like I missed that part.
