They are entitled:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; * &quot;HyperNEAT release site change and more info&quot; - starting 4/11/2007\n&gt; * &quot;Another note on activation&quot; - starting 4/13/2007\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope those threads help.  A good portion of them is me just trying to explain the &quot;sorted network, single update&quot; method; however, once that was understood by all, it was generally agreed that they are simply two different ways to activate a network.  Ken ultimately signaled that the NEAT way (&quot;unsorted network, multiple updates&quot;) was the more common among neural network researchers.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stephen Waits\n&gt; steve@...\n&gt; http://swaits.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
