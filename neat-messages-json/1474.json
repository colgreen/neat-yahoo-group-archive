Whereas in NEAT the \n&gt;genes always remain in the order they were added to the genome (this \n&gt;makes comparison nice and fast), but perhaps we are loosing some \n&gt;important properties by doing this - namely, crossover could be allowed \n&gt;to re-arrange genes into functionaly dependent groups. Hey I like this \n&gt;idea a lot Ian.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI just had another idea. If I remember correctly, in nature genes are \nusually marked out with certain short sequences of DNA. Perhaps we could \nintroduce the concept of a marker gene into the NEAT genome. We could \nthen implement a multipoint crossover technique that is marker aware and \nhopefully genes would become re-ordered into functionaly dependent \ngroups far more efficiently than using plain old random multipoint \ncrossover.\n\nOf course I am assuming that nature uses the markers during crossover as \nwell as during expression of the genes. Actually it might not matter, if \ncrossover ignores the markers then the genes will still form functional \ngroups during expression. There may be a great deal of junk either side \nof the markers if crossover is ignoring them - but then there is all \nthat &#39;junk&#39; DNA isn&#39;t there.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
