In\n&gt;  particular, I&#39;d like to ask you if you know w=\r\nho did this before we\n&gt;  (me, Faustino Gomez, Juergen Schmidhuber) did. Bec=\r\nause the algorithm\n&gt;  we are presenting in this paper is so simple someone =\r\nmust have come up\n&gt;  with it before, it&#39;s just that our literature search h=\r\nas been\n&gt;  fruitless.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The basic idea is to combine hillclimbing (1+1 =\r\nevolution strategy) of\n&gt;  network topologies, with hillclimbing of network =\r\nweights, but at a\n&gt;  faster timescale. So after each (&quot;global&quot;) topology mu=\r\ntation, we\n&gt;  search (&quot;local&quot;) weight space for a number of steps (e.g. 50)=\r\n, and\n&gt;  only accepts the global mutation if the fitness after local search=\r\n is\n&gt;  higher than before the global mutation. The reason we do this is tha=\r\nt\n&gt;  global mutations are so often disruptive. Yes, this is the same idea\n&gt;=\r\n  as &quot;innovation protection&quot; in NEAT, but here we&#39;re boiling it down a\n&gt;  b=\r\nare minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt;  We tried two versions of a moderately difficult control =\r\ntask: one with\n&gt;  a set of 7 carefully selected inputs to the neural networ=\r\nk, and one\n&gt;  with 15 not-so-carefully-selected inputs to the network. We f=\r\nound\n&gt;  that, when compared to simple hillclimbing in weight space, or to\n&gt;=\r\n  climbing weights and topologies at the same time, performed slightly\n&gt;  b=\r\netter on the small-input  version of the problem problem. On the\n&gt;  big-inp=\r\nut version, the difference was dramatic, in that using\n&gt;  different timesca=\r\nles was really the only way to solve the problem!\n&gt;  (Incidentally, learnin=\r\ng topology at the &quot;local&quot; level and weights at\n&gt;  the &quot;global&quot; level worked=\r\n just as well.)\n&gt; \n&gt;  The paper is here:\n&gt;  http://julian.togelius.com/Toge=\r\nlius2008Learning.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt;  Again, this is so obvious that someone must have=\r\n done this before. The\n&gt;  literature search only pointed us to attempts to =\r\ncombine topology\n&gt;  evolution with backpropagation, which is related but no=\r\nt the same\n&gt;  thing. We submitted the paper to WCCI (and had it accepted) i=\r\nn the\n&gt;  hope that the reviewers would know, but that they didn&#39;t. So now I=\r\n\n&gt;  wonder if anyone of you might know. It would be good to know about\n&gt;  t=\r\nhis before go on with further experiments...\n&gt; \n&gt;  Grateful for any suggest=\r\nions\n&gt;  Julian\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; IDSIA\n&gt; Galleria 2\n&gt; 6928 Manno-Lu=\r\ngano\n&gt; Switzerland\n&gt; julian@...\n&gt; http://julian.togelius.com\n&gt; http://www.i=\r\ndsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; +46-705-192088\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
