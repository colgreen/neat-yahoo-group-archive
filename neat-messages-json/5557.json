We look\n&gt; both for creatures with novel morphologies and those that have high\n&gt; fitness relative to their morphological niche.\n\nSo the minor difference in where we ended up as I see it is that I&#39;m\ntalking about multiple fitness metrics that would each stand as a\ntarget objective in their own right (from a traditional EC point of\nview), and I&#39;m thinking that this would result in enough complexity in\nthe fitness space that you wouldn&#39;t need to define an &#39;artificial&#39;\n(e.g. novelty) metric to help nudge you into good regions of the\nfitness space. I guess it&#39;s a fairly subtle point and possibly a\nflawed one since it relies on a distinction between a &#39;real&#39; objectve\nand what I just called an &#39;artificial&#39; objective (an objective you\ndon&#39;t care about by itself but that you think will help guide a search\ninto useful regions of the search space to help the &#39;real&#39;\nobjectives).\n\n\n&gt; This seems somewhat related to your idea, although yours involves additional\n&gt; evaluations and weighted averages of different fitnesses depending on the X,Y niching\n&gt; coordinates.\n\nAgain I feel there are only minor differences here. I put two\nfunctions on each axis of my example 2D niche space - so on one axis\nyou move from being good at f1 to being good at f2:\n\n     f1&lt;----&gt;f2\n\nIf I&#39;m understanding your&#39;s and Ken&#39;s paper right you effectively have\nthe same type of space but with one fitness metric/function per axis.\nBecause I was looking at the niche space as weighted fitness functions\nI wanted to avoid having a corner of the space where all the weights\nwere zero - hence I put a balance between *two* functions on each axis\n(you actually only need to do this for one axis to avoid the &#39;zero\ncorner&#39;). But then (A) it might be that having a zero weighted corner\nisn&#39;t such a bad thing and (B) I may not have fully understood how you\ncombined your multiple objectives.\n\n\n&gt; Your suggestion of a more general conception of incremental evolution\n&gt; is interesting as well. One problem with incremental evolution\n&gt; is that you have to know both what the stepping stones are and the order in which they\n&gt; should be discovered to create some sort of training plan. Your generalization might\n&gt; alleviate the need to know the &quot;order&quot; of the stepping stones because genomes can\n&gt; specialize to whatever objective they are most suited to (by changing their XY through\n&gt; mutation).\n\nAbsolutely, that&#39;s the hope. I&#39;d also say that specifying one linear\ndirected order of discrete steps is very limiting. This alternative\napproach potentially provides multiple smooth pathways and even\nreverse and possibly oscillating pathways (think of\nfish-&gt;mammals-&gt;dolphins as a very high level example).\n\n\n&gt; Anyways, I look forward to seeing your idea further developed, it seems like a cool\n&gt; approach to potentially evolve more complex things.\n\nThanks and thanks for the paper. I especially enjoyed the videos BTW,\nsome of those examples were quite amusing I thought :)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
