This causes some problems for me, because I=\r\n do not currently always generate positive fitness values where the relativ=\r\ne fitness of the best and worst individual is &#39;right&#39;.\n\nI am wondering whet=\r\nher anyone has tried using either tournament selection (instead of proporti=\r\nonal selection after fitness sharing) or some sort of ranking method (as an=\r\n additional step before fitness sharing), like linear or non-linear ranking=\r\n. Using any of these techniques, only the ranking of individuals would beco=\r\nme important, and the selection pressure simply becomes another parameter o=\r\nf the algorithm.\n\nI found some topics about fitness values on this users gr=\r\noup, but I did not find one that really addressed my question. I&#39;m sorry if=\r\n this question has been addressed before.\n\nI would also be happy to hear wh=\r\nat you think are good values for the ratio between the fitness of the best =\r\nand worst individual and/or the selective pressure and/or the selection int=\r\nensity.\n\nGreetings,\nJonathan Merlevede\n\n\n"}}
