For example, if an =\r\nagent spend 100\n&gt; timesteps trying to run through a wall, we would want to =\r\ncharacterize its\n&gt; behavior as being stalled rather than as moving forward.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, one of the big challenges in competitive coevolution (and alife =\r\nin\n&gt; general) is to create a domain that is open-ended enough to support\n&gt; =\r\nsomething interesting arising. The robot duel was my attempt to do that, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; perhaps it could be enhanced to support more open-endedness, though I d=\r\non&#39;t\n&gt; know how off-hand. But the risk you always have in these domains is =\r\nthat\n&gt; even if you have a fantastic algorithmic setup that in principle cou=\r\nld\n&gt; discover amazing behaviors, it is always possible that the domain itse=\r\nlf\n&gt; only supports a limited range of strategies.

Of co=\r\nurse, this is a dynamic\n&gt; &gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So for each time the class=\r\nification of inputs changes, the behavior of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; host is classified a=\r\nnd checked for novelty. These individual novelty\n&gt; &gt; measurements are all a=\r\ndded up at the end of the run, and divided by the\n&gt; &gt; number of class of in=\r\nput changes to normalize things.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\ns far as making it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, of course a record of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; who won is essentially a fitness measure, so there&#39;d have to be a hybrid\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; novelty/fitness in there somewhere, because measuring who won is not a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; novelty measure.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a lot of b=\r\nenefits to the table. My\n&gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is an added pa=\r\nrameter for population\n&gt; growth\n&gt; &gt; allowance for the host group. Instead o=\r\nf a fitness function, a novelty\n&gt; &gt; metric is used (assuming one can be mad=\r\ne, obviously that&#39;s tricky). The\n&gt; host\n&gt; &gt; population remains the hosts un=\r\ntil their population has grown the\n&gt; specified\n&gt; &gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping that =\r\nwill encourage a nice broad range of strategies\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; be evaluated. Once=\r\n that max population % has been hit, a &quot;cataclysmic\n&gt; event&quot;\n&gt; &gt; occurs (ca=\r\ntaclysm-neat? rapture-neat? Harold Camping-neat?) to wipe out\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; ext=\r\nra population, and only the best performing hosts are kept, which\n&gt; would\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; be how it integrates into the competition side of things. .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then=\r\n the parasites and hosts flip. Essentially novelty is used to explore\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\niffering behaviors up until the cataclysmic event, then performance is\n&gt; us=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; to prune the population back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their g=\r\no.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but =\r\nif I can\n&gt; &gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gonna give =\r\nit a whirl.\n&gt; &gt; Gotta write up something interesting to graduate I suppose.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Drew\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nn Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I just wanted to echo that I think combining nove=\r\nlty search\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction between evolving agents is very interes=\r\nting, if only we can\n&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a way to characterize behavior generally =\r\nenough to overcome the\n&gt; inherent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noisiness of interaction.

I=\r\n&#39;m thinking in particular about the robot duel from&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; your=\r\n paper &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary Complexi=EF=AC ca=\r\ntion&quot;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Instead of categorizing the paras=\r\nite behavior, I was thinking break out&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; meaningful classifications =\r\nof sensor inputs. Classification of behavior of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the host would bas=\r\ned on it&#39;s movement vector and speed (moving away,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; towards, fa=\r\nst/slow, going after food, etc). Of course, this is a dynamic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; envi=\r\nronment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So for each time the classification of inputs c=\r\nhanges, the behavior of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; host is classified and checked for nov=\r\nelty. These individual novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; measurements are all added up at th=\r\ne end of the run, and divided by the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; number of class of input chan=\r\nges to normalize things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Still spit-balling here.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As far as making it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, =\r\nof course a record of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who won is essentially a fitness measure, so=\r\n there&#39;d have to be a hybrid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; novelty/fitness in there somewher=\r\ne, because measuring who won is not a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; novelty measure.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; I still think novelty search brings a lot of benefits to the table.=\r\n My&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; current spit-ball is that there is an added parameter for popu=\r\nlation growth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; allowance for the host group. Instead of a fitness f=\r\nunction, a novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; metric is used (assuming one can be made, obvio=\r\nusly that&#39;s tricky). The host&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; population remains the hosts unt=\r\nil their population has grown the specified&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping=\r\n that will encourage a nice broad range of strategies to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be evalua=\r\nted. Once that max population % has been hit, a &quot;cataclysmic event&quo=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; occurs (cataclysm-neat? rapture-neat? Harold Camping-neat?)  to=\r\n wipe out the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; extra population, and only the best performing hosts=\r\n are kept, which would&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be how it integrates into the competition s=\r\nide of things. .&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then the parasites and hosts flip. Esse=\r\nntially novelty is used to explore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; differing behaviors up until th=\r\ne cataclysmic event, then performance is used&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to prune the populat=\r\nion back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but if I c=\r\nan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gonna gi=\r\nve it a whirl.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gotta write up something interesting to graduate I =\r\nsuppose.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Drew&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&gt; On=\r\n Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Drew=\r\n, I just wanted to echo that I think combining novelty search with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; interaction between evolving agents is very interesting, if only we c=\r\nan find&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a way to characterize behavior generally enough to ov=\r\nercome the inherent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; noisiness of interaction. Of course, you =\r\nhave clearly been thinking about&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that, and it may be possible=\r\n to make progress following your line of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; reasoning. Maybe if =\r\nparasites could be categorized into classes and novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; was a=\r\n concatenation of behaviors across all known classes it could make more&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; sense of the behavior space than just a raw behavior characteriz=\r\nation. I&#39;m&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sure there are many other ways to think about =\r\nit too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One other thing to note is that it may =\r\nnot really be &quot;competitive&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; coevolution per se if y=\r\nou implemented such an experiment.

You could do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; multiple&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; evaluations and have a behavioral characterization that is related=\r\n to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distribution of behaviors. Al=\r\nternatively, novelty search might be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; robust&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; enough that nothing special needs to be done.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This direction of research is very interesting th=\r\nough, and I hope that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; follow up o=\r\nn it.
