The basic idea is if\nyou are controlling a vehicle and suddenly (or even gradually)\nsomething breaks or changes about the vehicle, it would be really cool\nif the controls stayed exactly the same.  In other words, from your\npoint of view as a driver, nothing changes.  The example he gave was\nan airplane that lost part of its wing that from the pilot&#39;s\nperspective still flew the same way.\n\nThis kind of system obviously would require adaptation.  One\ninteresting thing you could do is have a simulated &quot;control-stream,&quot;\ni.e. a sequence of control commands that are prescripted for a\nsimulated vehicle.  Then during the course of the control stream, you\nmake changes to the vehicle&#39;s functionality.  The fitness of the\nnetwork is based on how well the vehicle still adheres to its intended\npath.  If the network can do a good job adapting to changes in how the\nvehicle handles, the control stream should still be followed\naccurately.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Mon, 13 Sep 2004 15:05:46 -0400, Mark Ahlstrom &lt;lists@d...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think Ken wrote a paper on plastic synapses, is that right? -\nI admit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to not reading it yet though :(\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was actually Ken&#39;s paper that really helped me narrow down\nwhat I\n&gt; &gt; wanted to do research on.  I started with just wanting to use\ngenetic\n&gt; &gt; algorithms to evolve the topology of neural networks rather than\njust\n&gt; &gt; the weights (the only application I had seen previously).  From\nthere,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve gradually gotten more specific in what I&#39;ve wanted to address\nas I\n&gt; &gt; read more papers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you referring to this paper:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pu\nbs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=131\n&gt; \n&gt; The one with the food foraging domain?  As Ken points out in the\n&gt; paper, an interesting result is that networks without adaptive\n&gt; synapsese are able to evolve built-in adaptive behaviors so that\nthey\n&gt; can react &#39;on the fly&#39; to changing conditions in the domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is a pretty interesting avenue to pursue.  As far as\n&gt; domains go, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of domains where it *wouldn&#39;t*\n&gt; be interesting to try to exploit plasticity during the lifetime of\nthe\n&gt; network.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d disagree with Colin that game domains would be out.  You&#39;d\n&gt; certainly want to be able to detect and rapidly adapt to various\n&gt; strategies...even in very simple games such as Tic-Tac-Toe there is\na\n&gt; significant advantage to tailoring your strategy to your specific\n&gt; opponent, rather than playing solid, generic gameplay.\n&gt; \n&gt; So rather than trying to find a domain to which adaptive synapses\nare\n&gt; applicable, I&#39;d probably take the approach of choosing a domain that\n&gt; particularly interests me, then just see how adaptive synapses\n&gt; function in that domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; What are you interested in?  Games?  Imaging?  Robotics?  Speech\n&gt; recognition?  Data mining?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
