The \nidea of recurrency is that it stores a memory that allows the net to \nanticipate and strategize based on a prior world state. \n\nSuppose I follow your idea of activating the net in several steps, \nmoving my agent in those time steps if the net says to do it, but \nnot checking the new world state.  \n\nAfter these several timesteps, I assume I should re-initialize the \ninputs to all the neurons to zero.  Then I re-scan the &quot;world&quot;, get \nmy inputs, and do it all again.  But this resetting and rescanning \nimplies no memory of a prior world state since in our internal \ntimesteps we did not consider the world inputs again until we were \ndone with our net activation.  Does this make sense?  \n\nI have come up with my own way to handle this and I&#39;m coding it \nas we speak.  Following is what I propose:\n\n1) I do exactly what John suggested, I have a nice and tight\nrecursive routine that quickly determines dependencies, which \nincludes recursive dependencies\n\n2) I then activate each neuron that has all its depedencies \nfulfilled/processed iteratively, unitl ALL neurons have been \nprocessed.  I also process recurrent links here, BUT if it is\ntimestep 0, i store the recurrent value in its own place separate \nfrom the neurons non-recurrent, total inputs.  Importantly, at \ntimestep 0 these recurrent weights are NOT considered in the \nfiring/non-firing decision of the neuron.\n\n3) if the output neurons tell the agent to move, it does so.\n\n4) reset ALL the neurons...BUT, if its not timestep 0, then keep the \nrecurrent totals in the neurons that had a recurrent link back to \nthem..otherwise erset all neurons totals including recurrent totals\n\n5) get the new state of the world..meaning read the input values..\n\n6) process the net as above...if it is not timestep 0, then when \nmaking a fire/not-fire decision, we total the inputs for a neuron\nPLUS the recurrent values from the last net execution....so this is \nthe memory of the prior state being used.\n\n7) repeat all the above...\n\nThis seems like a practical approach to me that should work, \nalthough I haven&#39;t got it working yet.. The code to fire the \nnetwork, even knowing dependencies, is a little tricky.\n\nHope this all makes some sense...hard to describe via written note...\n\n--Kevin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
