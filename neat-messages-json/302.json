Can \n&gt; someone remind me?\n\nAh, those are mine and Philip&#39;s.  They&#39;re samples of\nthe two different graphical layouts of networks that\nthe implementation we&#39;re working on produces.  \n\nThey&#39;re screen shots of sample output.  The actual\ngraphical output for everything in our implementation\n(networks, speciation statistics, fitness graphs) are\nall done in SVG, which is scalable.  I&#39;ve uploaded a\ncouple more examples in the &quot;Files&quot; section, in SVG\nformat.  SVG is XML-based, so we felt it would be a\nmore efficient way of storing graphical experimental\ndata.  You can view the .svg files with a browser,\nwith the SVG plug-in:\n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html\n\nOnce the plug-in is installed in your browser, just\ndouble-click on the .svg file you want to view.  You\ncan then right click on the image and select to zoom\nin or out.\n\nWe don&#39;t know if it&#39;s practical, or even really useful\nyet, but we wanted to be able to store an image of\neach network which clearly shows all of the\nconnectivity and the value of the weights on every\nconnection.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
