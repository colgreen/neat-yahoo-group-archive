(Robot Auto Racing\nSimulation)  That&#39;s a fairly difficult challenge, but\nat least one ANN-based controller did pretty well in\nit.  It was by Remi Coulom, who also included it in\nhis Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nThis software has been around since 1995 and is in\nC++.\nI will admit to a special interest in it, since I was\nthe founder, although I have not participated since\n1996.  Others carry on with the project.  It is now\nunder the sourceforge umbrella.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
