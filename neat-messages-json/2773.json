It appears that a numbe=\r\nr sequence is \npresented on an input, along with additional inputs correspo=\r\nnding to \nvarious program instructions. Output appears to be threshold appl=\r\nied \nto select the program instruction w/ highest output. The outputs \ncorr=\r\nesponding to the sequence is tested for length and correctness as \napplies =\r\nto the status of the stack. Fitness is computed based upon \ncumulative erro=\r\nr over input sequence. It appears that cost is tracked \nbut does not appear=\r\n to factor into fitness?\n\n   Is this even close? Could you supply the prope=\r\nr explanation?\n\nThanks,\n   Andy\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Darren Izzard=\r\n &lt;zysyshelp@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Has anybody converted the contents of the N=\r\nEATWIN2.ZIP, located in \nthe \n&gt; &gt;Files area, to MSVC++ 6.0 or .NET? I&#39;m par=\r\nticularly interested \n&gt; &gt;in &quot;Darren&#39;s Program Experiment&quot; contained therein=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a while since I uploaded that file, and the experiment you \n&gt; m=\r\nention was a little disappointing in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; The purpose was to use =\r\nNEAT to evolve networks which would output \n&gt; programs in a simple stack-ba=\r\nsed language to generate given \nsequences \n&gt; of numbers. You may be wonderi=\r\nng: why make the network generate a \n&gt; program to do it rather than have th=\r\ne network generate the \nsequences \n&gt; directly? Mainly because it&#39;s really h=\r\nard to reverse-engineer the \n&gt; algorithms networks are using and understand=\r\n how they&#39;re working, \nand \n&gt; it would be more practical in some ways to ev=\r\nolve routines in a \nform \n&gt; closer to conventional programming languages.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The real difficulty comes down to finding a good representation of \na \n=\r\n&gt; program which the network can output. The Program Experiment tried \nto \n&gt;=\r\n have the network build up the program instruction by instruction, \nable \n&gt;=\r\n to move back and forth through the list to change instructions as \n&gt; neede=\r\nd. This was, in some ways, the inverse of the roving eye \nmethod \n&gt; for inp=\r\nuts, and I had hoped it would mean a program-generator could \nbe \n&gt; evolved=\r\n incrementally. The main problem was that there was such a \nhuge \n&gt; jump in=\r\n complexity required between a simple, useless program which \n&gt; just return=\r\ned the average of the sequence (or some other simple \n&gt; output, such as a c=\r\nounter) and a meaningful one which actually \n&gt; calculated a value.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\nrefore, a better representation would have to be found where \nthese \n&gt; jump=\r\ns would be minimised. One possibility which did occur would be \nto \n&gt; make =\r\nthe transformations the network could apply to the list of \n&gt; instructions =\r\nmore sophisticated, a bit like the ones ADATE applies \nto \n&gt; programs it ev=\r\nolves.\n&gt; \n&gt; At any rate, I now use SharpNeat (which naturally works quite w=\r\nell \n&gt; under VS.NET!) although I haven&#39;t recreated anything like the \nProgr=\r\nam \n&gt; Experiment yet, simply because I haven&#39;t thought of a better way of \n=\r\n&gt; doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Darren\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
