Either assign it a random value at\n&gt; the beginning of an each activation, or have its value change every time\n&gt; it is read.  The network will, of course, evolve to minimize the weights\n&gt; to the random node.  But the presence of random fluctuations in the\n&gt; environment will force it to adopt a different strategy of execution.\n\nWe tried this with our tic-tac-toe player and it didn&#39;t seem to make\nmuch difference.  The concept does seem like it could be beneficial to\nme, though, especially in domains where the ability to generate\nrandomness has a clear fitness advantage.  We had thought about using\nthat if we ever tackle poker.  Even something simpler like prisoner&#39;s\ndilemma might benefit from a random input node.  It&#39;s kind of like\ngiving the net some dice to roll.\n\nYou mentioned an oscillating input node.  That might be useful for\ngiving the net the concept of the passage of time without giving it an\nabsolute time input.\n\n"}}
