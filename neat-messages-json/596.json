What precisely does it describe?  I&#39;ve had a look at the \nmutate_add_mode() function in original NEAT code and I&#39;m not 100% sure \nbut it looks like a recurrent connection is one that links a neuron to \nitself, is this correct?  Elsewhere though I get the feeling that a \nrecurrent connection is one that links &#39;backwards&#39;, thus causing \nrecurrency but via a chain of 2 or more neurons. If this second case is \ntrue then how is &#39;backwards&#39; determined since the neurons aren&#39;t placed \ninto layers?\n\nIs it the case that the neurons are considered to be in a chain (in 1 \ndimension), e.g. with inputs on the left, hidden neurons in the middle \nand outputs on the right. Thus a recurrent connection is one that links \nback to a neuron earlier in the chain, right-to-left. And therefore if \nwe prevent recurrent connections we are guaranteed of finding only \nfeedforward networks.\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
