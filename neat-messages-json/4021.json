And \nCPPNs show=\r\ned that they are capable of representing all known patterns \nfrom nature/bi=\r\nology, symettry, imperfect symettry, repetition, and \nrepetition with varia=\r\ntion. Combining CPPN evolution with NEAT (CPPN-\nNEAT) introduces another im=\r\nportant component, that is, the \nelaboration of preevolved structure, i.e. =\r\ncomplexification. Well just \nplay around in the PicBreeder site and you wil=\r\nl get a feeling of what \nis possible. You can easily imagine (extrapolate) =\r\nthose pictures as \nif they were connectivity concepts of neural networks. W=\r\nhy do you \nneed a benchmark at all? It was discussed that the selection pro=\r\ncess \nis the most important thing for discovering certain types of \npattern=\r\ns. It is even more natural in some sense. In fact I&#39;ve seen \nthat a segment=\r\ned picture can be turned into a circle-like picture \njust by selecting the =\r\nroundest individuals. So in fact the dynamics \nof evolution guide the proce=\r\nss. \n\nAbout the computational cost, I think you can see it for yourself. It=\r\n \nis clear that CPPN-based phenotypes need a lot of time to create, \nsince =\r\nthe CPPN is requeried many times and each query is a couple of \nNN activati=\r\nons until relaxation. In fact for some tasks the creation \nof the phenotype=\r\ns takes more time than evaluating them, but this is \nalways domain dependan=\r\nt. \n\nAs I see you want this.. &quot;data&quot;.. written and exposed as a separate \ne=\r\nxperiment in the papers from the Eplex group but it is so obvious \nthat you=\r\n just need to think about it for a second and answer \nyourself. \n\nPeter\n\n--=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your=\r\n answers to questions express your positions/opinions regarding \n&gt; the rela=\r\ntive value of various topics...such as say the utility of \n&gt; Jeff&#39;s referen=\r\nce to &quot;building blocks.&quot; Your choices regarding \n&gt; published research areas=\r\n indicate areas of topical interest.

Instead of attacking the \n&gt; source \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having answered every question that you have and \nperforme=\r\nd \n&gt; every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment that you personally believe we should eve=\r\nr \n&gt; perform, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; why \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put it more like, &quot;It w=\r\nould be interesting to see if...&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;=\r\nd like to perform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether...&quot; In other words, what is accomplished by your \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n aggressive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I remember hearing once, though I do not remember the \n&gt; source, an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting quote on scientific research.  To \n&gt; paraphrase: &quot;Good\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research answers hard questions.  However, the \n&gt; best=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research raises entirely new questions that we \n&gt; n=\r\never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have even asked before.&quot;  Think of quantu=\r\nm physics.  The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; uncertainty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principle has led to endless=\r\n discussion of paradoxes and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impossibilities, with no end in si=\r\nght, but we do not see \n&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accusing Heisenberg of trying =\r\nto hide the &quot;truth.&quot;  \n&gt; Instead, it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; credit to his =\r\ndiscovery that we are now asking such \n&gt; profound \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let me suggest to you that you change your tone an=\r\nd \ndrop \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor.  That is not an approp=\r\nriate way \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; colleagues, or to an=\r\nyone else for that matter, and I \n&gt; sincerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hope \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain the exceptional positive atmosphere this group \nhas \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintained\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; throughout 5 years (believe it or not!) of fru=\r\nitful and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Let me also add that I am not the moderator (who is Derek \n&gt; &gt; &gt; James, =\r\nwho\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has done an excellent job), and therefore this is just my \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
