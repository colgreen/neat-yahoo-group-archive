That&#39;s great that IEEE picked =\r\nit up so fast, but I&#39;m not surprised they like it.  All the attention shows=\r\n there&#39;s something intuitively appealing that feels natural about this doma=\r\nin.  Maybe it could also succeed on Slashdot.\n\nI also wanted to make a slig=\r\nhtly more controversial point of praise, which I hope you don&#39;t mind, but o=\r\nne of my favorite parts of the paper is this:\n\n&quot;Because it is notoriously d=\r\nifficult to quantify attributes\nsuch as &quot;impressiveness&quot; and &quot;complexity&quot;, =\r\nwe make no effort\nto do so here. Instead, we attempt to visually represent\n=\r\nthe interesting diversity of morphologies and behaviors that\nevolved once e=\r\nvolution was provided with more materials\nand a sophisticated encoding.&quot;\n\nI=\r\n really appreciated the open acknowledgment of the potential pretense of th=\r\nese kinds of measures.  Given the recognition this paper is already receivi=\r\nng, it&#39;s nice to see that sometimes people can agree that something is inte=\r\nresting simply by looking at it rather than through a mysterious quantifica=\r\ntion that no one really understands. (Although of course that doesn&#39;t mean =\r\nmeasuring something is always bad either, but it does tend to be overemphas=\r\nized in many cases.)\n\nBest,\n\nken  \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune=\r\n &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am pleased to announce a new pap=\r\ner on evolving soft robots with CPPNs.

Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved m=\r\norphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems =\r\nto have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased =\r\ncomplexity is that most work, including Sims&#39;, evolves morphologies compose=\r\nd of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design=\r\n space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have bee=\r\nn overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we=\r\n test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a=\r\n powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing netw=\r\nork (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs ev=\r\nolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies ap=\r\npear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as mo=\r\nre materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increase=\r\nd with different cost functions without stifling performance, and that orga=\r\nnisms can be evolved at different levels of resolution.  These findings sug=\r\ngest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving=\r\n a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our resul=\r\nts suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPN-encoded sof=\r\nt, multi-material robots with modern diversity-encouraging techniques could=\r\n finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting =\r\nthan those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, please=\r\n let me know if you have any comments or questions!\n&gt; \n&gt; PS.
