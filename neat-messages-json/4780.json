There is a newer version of the NEAT sour=\r\nce code? Is HyperNEAT the &quot;evolution&quot; source code for NEAT? Which of them I=\r\n should use?\n\nThanks for your answers.\n\nAlso, I made some adjustments to th=\r\ne original source code, to use QT instead of GTK, if someone is interested =\r\non that, let me know and I will share these modifications.\n\n\n"}}
