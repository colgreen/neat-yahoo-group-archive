You\nmake =\r\na good point- my statement was too broad, in part because\n&quot;cellular growth =\r\nmodel&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\npotentially refer to many types =\r\nof systems.  \n\nJust to clarify my statement, I was responding the line of d=\r\niscussion\nwith Peter about encodings that actually create distinct bodily s=\r\nhapes\nthat are self-contained and have clear structural boundaries (which\nr=\r\neaction-diffusion systems tend not to produce; rather they produce\nwallpape=\r\nr-like patterns).  Often when growth-based models are used to\ndefine actual=\r\n bodies with distinct borders, they are studied in the\ncontext of blobs wit=\r\nh a particular focus on how the blob knows when to\nstop growing so that a b=\r\norder shape can be created.  That kind of\nsystems goes along with the &quot;skin=\r\n&quot; issue that we were discussing.\n\nNevertheless, the field is quite broad an=\r\nd there are many possible\ninteresting examples of such systems.  If I could=\r\n revisit my\nstatement, I would reword it such as to avoid implying any swee=\r\nping\ngeneralization.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Alexandre Devert &lt;=\r\nmarmakoide@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Along these lines, I have rarely see=\r\nn a cellular growth model\nproduce anything more than a blob or an amorphous=\r\n shape without clear\nparts.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If you consider reaction-diffusion system=\r\ns as a cellular growth\nmodel, then you might consider the following publica=\r\ntions :\n&gt; &quot;Interactive Evolution of Dynamical Systems, Karl Sims&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Advanc=\r\ned Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture Synthesis, Allen R.\nSanderson et a=\r\nl.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Those patterns are a bit above the average blob and features very\n=\r\ncompact description.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alexandre Devert\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
