I agree that your suggestion would make a\nusefu=\r\nl comparison.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;matti=\r\nas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken, let me clear up that I&#39;m pretty certain that the r(=\r\nx) method will\n&gt; work better than the alternative method I mentioned (suppl=\r\nying\n&gt; position/role input to each phenotype as it is evaluated). The reaso=\r\nn I\n&gt; suggested it as a test was to rule out that there&#39;s a trivial method =\r\nof\n&gt; assigning roles that&#39;s more powerful than the r(x) method. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mat=\r\ntias, that&#39;s a good question for comparison.  Because it is a \n&gt; &gt; challeng=\r\ne to affect the holistic policy of a neural network with a \n&gt; &gt; single inpu=\r\nt, I am guessing it would not work as well.  In contrast, \n&gt; &gt; in HyperNEAT=\r\n, the x position naturally has a holistic effect on the \n&gt; &gt; substrate beca=\r\nuse the whole substrate is generated from that value.  \n&gt; &gt; Yet it is an em=\r\npirical issue and I could be wrong; your idea might \n&gt; &gt; work as well.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n with regards,\n&gt; mattias\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
