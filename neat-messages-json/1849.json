For example, &quot;BioMorphs&quot; are similar:\n\nhttp://alife.fusebox.com/morph_lab.html\n\nBut even though at first BioMorphs seem like you will be able to get \nalmost anything, you eventually hit a kind of wall where you start \nnoticing the limits of the space you&#39;re exploring.  The big \ndifference in the NEAT-based Art tool is that there are no limits to \nthe space because it is complexifying.  So it is ultimately \ntheoretically searching through umlimited dimensions.  I don&#39;t know \nif there has been an art or breeding tool like that before.\n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Darren Izzard &lt;zysyshelp@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ken&#39;s adventures with the spaceship led me to have a go with the \nGenetic \n&gt; Art program, and I&#39;ve successfully evolved a rather nice shootemup-\nstyle \n&gt; alien ship. Quite an addictive little program! It seems to go more \nin \n&gt; the direction you want it to, than other genetic art programs I&#39;ve \nseen.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Darren\n\n\n\n\n"}}
