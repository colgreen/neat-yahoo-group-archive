I mean 1d or 2d, and what\n&gt; you will pass to neat, cause i see several ways:\n&gt; -to use 1d map and to have 1 input from each SOM (i think there is an\n&gt; option to use several SOMs  for better results)\n&gt; -to use 2d map and have 2 inputs as coordinates\n&gt; -to use 2d map but 1 input as cluster number\n&gt; - may be something else\n&gt; \n&gt; Alex\n&gt; From Russia with love :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello fab_wartix,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tuesday, October 4, 2005, 10:46:40 AM, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; Hi every one\n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; I am trying to make a soft who provide vocal control under a house\n&gt; f&gt; automation.\n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; I will connect SOM to NEAT, but i am open for all new idea :) \n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; If you have interesting link or something eles just let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; Is someone know where i can found phoneme database for french?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; I ll make the audio stream passing thrue SOM , the ouput vector ll go\n&gt; f&gt; to neat entrance, and neat output ll be connect to house&#39;s automation\n&gt; f&gt; by computer.\n&gt; \n&gt; f&gt; I don t need to have a big amount of word .
