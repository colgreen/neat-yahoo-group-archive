I realise this \n&gt;is a special case, you would normaly see some minimal fitness in the \n&gt;initial population and hence no problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;Possible solutions then.\n&gt;1) Precalculate the size of the population, test for the zero case and \n&gt;if so then keep the original species sizes.\n&gt;2) Define a minimum fitness greater than 0. This is a bit bit of a hack \n&gt;though really.\n&gt;3) Keep generating initial populations until a none zero fitness occurs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
