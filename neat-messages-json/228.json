Thanks for sharing them.\nThis experiment, and the one you performed before, can really\nhelp us understand what these networks can do.\n\n&gt; Here is a very basic task a recurrent ANN should be\n&gt; able to handle:  \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. We generate a random bit string of length N\n&gt; 2. We feed it to the ANN one bit at a time, so there\n&gt; are N steps here.\n&gt; 3. The ANN now repeats the sequence back to you.\n&gt; 4. The fitness function is the fraction of correct\n&gt; bits.\n&gt; \n&gt; How about someone using NEAT for this?  We would like\n&gt; to see how the resulting topology varies with N, and\n&gt; also how large a value of N can be comfortably handled.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
