However, I do not think it can be said accurately it \n&gt; remains undirected.\n\nWell as long as there has been agriculture and domestication of \nplants and animals there has been directed evolution.  The particular \nselection pressure applied by humans to isolated populations has a \nname: Artificial Selection.  It&#39;s how we got poodles and flower shops.\n\nBut certainly you don&#39;t mean to say that natural selection (and other \nevolutionary pressures) still aren&#39;t acting upon millions of species \nworldwide every day?\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
