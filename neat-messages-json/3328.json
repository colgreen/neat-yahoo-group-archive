It is the genotype of the \nnetwork solving the p=\r\nroblem. \n\n2. Auxiliary additional parameters associated with problem specif=\r\nic \ninputs are just additional problem specific inputs. There is a big \ndif=\r\nference. The geometry is given to the CPPN only. And it is the \nonly thing =\r\nthat a CPPN needs to work. \n\n3. &quot;the quantity and meaning of auxiliary addi=\r\ntional parameters \n  associated w/ PSIs (1-b) can vary over the substrate n=\r\network (i.e. \n  dimensionality of substrate inputs, hidden and output nodes=\r\n) &quot;\n\nIt&#39;s like telling me that the 3D space around me can twist and bend \nb=\r\necause of the complexity of my organism. You have to understand that \nthe C=\r\nPPN network has nothing to do with the substrate. I can take a \nconnective =\r\nCPPN and turn it into a spatial CPPN that draws pictures \nwithout losing it=\r\ns capability to create complex connective patters, \nfor example. \n\n * * * \n=\r\n\nAt this point, I see your generalization as defining a higher-\ndimentional=\r\n space (the design space), where the phenotype/genotype \nspaces are subspac=\r\nes in it. I think this is a wrong way for \ngeneralizing HyperNEAT, because =\r\nit implies that the genotype space is \ndependant of the phenotype space or =\r\nthere is a bi-directional \nconnection between them. This is not the case in=\r\n fact. Genotypes \ncannot change. The genotype is given a fitness score, but=\r\n it is the \nphenotype that is evaluated. The genotype maps to the phenotype=\r\n in \nsome way. The problem-specific inputs/outputs can exist in the \nphenot=\r\nype space only. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The following is a proposed generalization of the HyperNEAT co=\r\nncept \n&gt; from its present implementation.
