The best\nof these included a workshop on modularity and reuse, in which Ken was\na speaker.  Some of the speakers were virtually incoherent, but\nnevertheless the session sparked a lot of ideas and included some good\ndiscussion.  I especially liked Ken&#39;s suggestion that the best\napproach is to allow for overall designs or body plans which are able\nto exploit modularity, rather than the approach of haphazardly\nevolving individuals and then trying to find &quot;useful&quot; modules (if I&#39;m\nunderstanding what he said correctly).\n\nAnother highlight, for me at least, was the tutorial on Evolutionary\nRobotics by Dario Floreano.  He covered nearly a decade of research in\nthe area, included lots of examples, with videos, and sparked a lot of\ninteresting ideas.  Unfortunately, he ran over time and didn&#39;t leave\nroom for questions (though I was able to corner him later at a\nreception and discuss a few things).\n\nMy presentation was on Monday.  I made a wise choice in using overhead\nslides instead of a Powerpoint.  I attended several presentations in\nwhich time was eaten trying to change the resolution of the laptop\nmonitors to fit the projection.  Anyway, there were more people than\nI&#39;d expected (I pretty much thought only the presenters would be\nthere).  It was a tiny room, but it was nearly full.  A couple of\npresenters didn&#39;t show up, but the moderator just left gaps instead of\nforging ahead with the next in line.  When it was my turn, I gave a\ngeneral overview of what we meant by &quot;simplification&quot; and\n&quot;complexification&quot;, briefly explained how NEAT works, then ANJI.  I\ntalked about the domain and how we set up the experiments, and then I\nshowed our results.  The audience didn&#39;t exactly look riveted, but I\ngot four questions at the end, which at least shows that some people\nwere actually paying attention.  If I were to try to present next\nyear, I think I&#39;d try for the regular paper deadline, and hopefully\nshoot for some slightly meatier material.\n\nThe rest of the conference was mostly paper presentations, many of\nwhich didn&#39;t really relate to what we&#39;re interested in on this list,\nbut still interesting.  I met several interesting people from other\nschools, and from industries and non-profits.  I tagged along to a few\nmeals with Ken and Joseph, and we had some interesting discussions.\n\nThe only touristy thing we did in Seattle was check out the new\nScience Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, which was pretty cool.\n\nAll in all it was a good experience...not a bad way to spend my vacation.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
