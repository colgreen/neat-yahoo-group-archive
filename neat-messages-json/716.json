That is, a network with extremely large\nweights is likely to produce only 0&#39;s or 1&#39;s, because its sigmoid\nfunction is saturated.  Thus, the network wont be sensitive to fine\ngradations in input.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yurifromtomsk&quot; &lt;neuroevolution@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Probably it&#39;s not good to have large weights of connections for the\nfollowing reason. Consider one is solving a neural control task and\nhis network has some &quot;significant&quot; (by their weights) connections.\nThen even slight change of input parameter can lead to significant\nchange of network outputs. I.e. network seems to be easy to disbalance.\n&gt; \n&gt; An interesting question appears. Described above problem is\nconcerning correlation level amidst i/o signals. Is there any way to\nevaluate this parameter and whether its possible to use it in networks\nevolution? And more is there any way to check network stability and\nquality? It can be useful because it will be possible to search for\nsolution with some apriory defined charactersitics which seem to be\nmore significant then total network complexity or something of this kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
