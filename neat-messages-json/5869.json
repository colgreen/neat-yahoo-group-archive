However, =\r\nin the provided matlab code I noted that part of the learning happens post =\r\nhoc. For example, when the agent veers away from the wall or the wrong food=\r\n type, synaptic plasticity increases. It means that part of the learning is=\r\n not only a result of direct punishment (e.g. the vehicle hits the wall) bu=\r\nt of a subsequent positive neuromodulation ones the vehicle managed to get =\r\naway from the wall. I wondered whether the agent would be able to learn the=\r\n correct behavior without the reward for fleeing?\n\nIn general, it could be =\r\ninteresting to analyse the concept that stopping punishment immediately res=\r\nults in short-term reward.\n\n\n"}}
