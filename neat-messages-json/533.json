(See\nfor example the network picture at\nwww.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html) I typically don&#39;t find\nthem all in one layer at all...it usually works out pretty well.  The\none thing to make sure of is not to count a recurrent connection as a\nhop-  otherwise you can go in circles- but that requires also knowing\nwhich connections are recurrent, which may also be difficult depending\nhow you keep track of things.  The problem is that this method is very\ncomputationally expensive, and also requires always knowing which\nconnections are recurrent.  Once you get thousands of nodes I find it\nstarts lagging out a lot before drawing anything.\n\nI think there are better ways.  I think Mat Buckland did something\nclever to keep track of which neuron was in which layer, but I need to\nreread his chapter on NEAT to remind myself of his method.  Maybe he\nwill have a comment if he&#39;s reading this.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
