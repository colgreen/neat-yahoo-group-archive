The ability to start a NEAT \n&gt; evolution with best &quot;knowledge&quot; to da=\r\nte is profoundly more \neffective \n&gt; as a consequence of not &quot;reinventing-th=\r\ne-wheel&quot; each run, and is \n&gt; beneficial to the user as evidenced by useful =\r\nresults sooner.\n&gt; \n&gt; The example is comprised of (1) input bias node and (8=\r\n) output \nnodes, \n&gt; the values of which are used in the fitness determinati=\r\non. This \n&gt; parameter estimation problem is utilized to demonstrate a \nmini=\r\nmalist \n&gt; approach to this class of problems, but does not represent a \n&gt; l=\r\nimitation of the approach to the more general (x) input and (y) \n&gt; output p=\r\nroblems.\n&gt; \n&gt; The procedure is the determination of connection weights betw=\r\neen \nthe \n&gt; single bias node to each of the (8) output nodes, such that the=\r\n \n&gt; network activation will result in each of the output&#39;s activation \n&gt; co=\r\nrresponding to the normalized version of the desired starting \n&gt; output.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; a) The Start, Max and Min values of each output are normalized to \n&gt; wit=\r\nhin the range of 0 to 1 (or 0.1 & 0.9, etc.).\n&gt; b) For the selected bias va=\r\nlue (usually 1.0), solve for the weight \n&gt; value such that fsigmoid of the =\r\nproduct of bias x weight is equal \nto \n&gt; the normalized value of Start.\n&gt; c=\r\n) Perform (a) and (b) above for each output.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a bias value of 1.0, =\r\nNormalize_min =3D 0.1 and Normalize_max =3D \n0.9:\n&gt; \n&gt; Input\tStart\tMax\tMin\t=\r\nWeight\n&gt; 1\t37.8\t50.0\t22.5\t0.0367272\n&gt; 2\t2.8\t10.0\t0.01\t-0.149887\n&gt; 3\t60\t500.=\r\n0\t0.5\t-0.287548\n&gt; 4\t0.072\t1.0\t0.001\t-0.341533\n&gt; 5\t28.1\t35.0\t0.1\t0.214351\n&gt; =\r\n6\t79.44\t100.0\t0.1\t0.207536\n&gt; 7\t52.33\t100.0\t0.5\t0.0135897\n&gt; 8\t52.33\t100.0\t0.=\r\n5\t0.0135897\n&gt; \n&gt; The corresponding start genome would be:\n&gt; \n&gt; genomestart =\r\n1\n&gt; trait 1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n&gt; trait 2 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n&gt; trait 3 0.3 0 0=\r\n 0 0 0 0 0\n&gt; node 1 0 1 3\n&gt; node 2 0 0 2\n&gt; node 3 0 0 2\n&gt; node 4 0 0 2\n&gt; no=\r\nde 5 0 0 2\n&gt; node 6 0 0 2\n&gt; node 7 0 0 2\n&gt; node 8 0 0 2\n&gt; node 9 0 0 2\n&gt; ge=\r\nne 3 1 2  0.0367272 0 1 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 3 -0.149887  0 2 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 4 -0=\r\n.287548  0 3 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 5 -0.341533  0 1 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 6  0.214351  0 =\r\n2 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 7  0.207536  0 3 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 1 8  0.0135897 0 1 0 1\n&gt; gen=\r\ne 3 1 9  0.0135897 0 2 0 1\n&gt; genomeend 1\n&gt; \n&gt; For the more general problem =\r\nof (x) inputs and (y) outputs:\n&gt; i) # Inputs equals (x) + (1) bias, where a=\r\nll (x) inputs are left \n&gt; unconnected.\n&gt; ii) # Outputs equals (y).\n&gt; iii) #=\r\n weights equals (x), each from the single bias node to each \nof \n&gt; the outp=\r\nut nodes respectively.\n&gt; iv) Procedure for determination of start genome we=\r\night values is \nsame \n&gt; as above.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is required that the same normali=\r\nzation methodology utilized in \n&gt; the above procedure is embedded in the co=\r\nrresponding Experiment \n&gt; fitness method.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
