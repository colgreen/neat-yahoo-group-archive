We have =\r\nposted a very preliminary draft of a paper about it on arXiv: http://arxiv.=\r\norg/abs/1504.04909\n\nWe previously described MAP-Elites in our soon-to-be-pu=\r\nblished paper about damage recovery in robotics (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1=\r\n407.3501); the new paper is dedicated to MAP-Elites and provide many new ex=\r\nperiments and discussions.\n\nMAP-Elites aims to find the highest performing =\r\nsolution at each point in a =93feature space=94 or =93behavior space=94, wh=\r\nere the user gets to choose the dimensions of the feature space. For exampl=\r\ne, one could look for the fastest robot at each point in a 2D space where h=\r\neight and weight are on the x and y axes. Alternately, one could search for=\r\n the highest performing neural network at each combination of modularity an=\r\nd network depth, or network depth and number of connections, or whichever d=\r\nimensions one is interested in. MAP-Elites can thus also be seen as a form =\r\nof dimensionality reduction, searching through a very high-dimensional sear=\r\nch space (e.g. the space of all robots, or all neural networks) to find the=\r\n highest-performing option at each point in a user-defined, low-dimensional=\r\n space. The algorithm itself is very simple (simpler than a basic GA!) but =\r\nit leads to many interesting results: we used it to evolve neural networks,=\r\n virtual creatures, and basic controllers for a soft physical robot.\n\nBecau=\r\nse there was not previously a name for these type of algorithms that look f=\r\nor the highest performing solution at each point in a feature/phenotype/beh=\r\navior space, in this paper we suggest the term =93Illumination Algorithms.=\r\n=94 That is because these types of algorithms reveal the fitness potential =\r\nof each area in a feature/behavior/phenotype space, and thus illuminate suc=\r\nh spaces and help us better understand and visualize them. Illumination alg=\r\norithms also find a diversity of high-performing solutions, which are usefu=\r\nl in their own right, but they also tend to work as really good optimizatio=\r\nn algorithms because the nicely hybridize objective-driven and divergent se=\r\narch. We empirically found that they often do a better job at optimization =\r\nthan a traditional EA, even one that includes diversity. Illumination algor=\r\nithms are thus a subset of optimization algorithms that have the extra goal=\r\n of not just finding the single best solution, or a small set of solutions =\r\non the Pareto front, but instead of trying to find the best solution at eac=\r\nh point in a feature space. \n\nPrevious Illumination Algorithms include the =\r\nMulti-Objective Landscape Exploration (MOLE) algorithm from [1] and Novelty=\r\n Search + Local Competition (NS+LC) [2], the latter of which inspired both =\r\nMOLE and MAP-Elites. We thank Ken and Joel for continuing to have such wond=\r\nerful, exciting ideas! Our paper lays out the differences between MAP-Elite=\r\ns, MOLE, and NS+LC, of which there are many. Overall, we believe MAP-Elites=\r\n is simpler and works better than previous Illumination Algorithms, althoug=\r\nh more work remains to fully determine the extent to which those beliefs ar=\r\ne true. \n\nWe look forward to hearing your thoughts on MAP-Elites. Of course=\r\n, we would never normally post such a preliminary version of a paper, with =\r\nincomplete experiments, insufficient controls, and not as much time to poli=\r\nsh the writing as we would like, but several people are starting to publish=\r\n papers that use and/or mention MAP-Elites, so we wanted to provide a refer=\r\nence. It=92s also fun to share our thoughts about what makes the algorithm =\r\ninteresting and show some of the (unreliable, preliminary) data we have col=\r\nlected about it to date. \n\n[1] Clune J, Mouret JB, Lipson H (2013) The evol=\r\nutionary origins of modularity.
