I haven&#39;t been able to access the site for some \n&gt;days....\n\nCurrently, no.  The controller is now at work, which means it is behind the \nwork firewall.  Our IT guy said he would set me up with a NATed port that \nwill let me access it from the outside, but he hasn&#39;t done that yet.\n\nAnd as of right now, generations are only taking about 60 seconds each.  For \nyou, you would have to download the bzip&#39;d code, decompress it, compile it, \nthen fetch a work packet, then process it...  by the time you had done all \nthat, the generation might be over!  If at some point I up the population \nback up to 1000 networks, the generations might take long enough to be worth \nhaving participants outside the corporate network...  But as long as I can \nmake progress with shorter generations, I&#39;m going to do it!\n\nIn the mean time, at around generation 1080, something cool happened.  The \npeak fitness had been almost completely flat (very, very small \nfluctuations).  But suddenly it was actually up higher, and was fluctuating \na lot by comparison.  That lasted for about 80 generations, and then it went \nback to its quiet old self.  Which means that it CAN eventually find \nsomething that makes a difference.\n\nWhat&#39;s unfortunate is that when it died, the new topology created to replace \nit wasn&#39;t based on the one that died.  Makes me wonder if perhaps I should \nmake a slight change to how I decide which network to mutate when making new \ntopologies.  Currently, I just pick an elite at random from the current \npopulation.  Perhaps what I should do is select the &#39;peak&#39; network from \nhistory.  Yeah...I think I&#39;ll try that...  I&#39;ll let you know if that helps.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
