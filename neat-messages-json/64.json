I was hoping this group could help\nwith that.\n\nFirst of all, is anyone else currently working on a\nnew implementation of NEAT?  Or are all the various\nimplementations out there full and complete?\n\nAnyway, we&#39;re dealing with speciation right now, and\nI&#39;d already asked him this question, but I thought it\nmight be interesting to see how others handled it:\n\nBasically, either because a single individual starts a\nnew species, or due to selection, a species is reduced\nto only one member before the reproduction phase,\noften there are species with only one individual.\n\nHow do you handle reproduction for a species with only\none member?  Just clone it?  In Ken&#39;s original\nimplementation there&#39;s a very small interspecies\nmating rate, which won&#39;t apply most of the time.  I\nbelieve Ken said that he simply used a clone in this\ncase, but I was wondering if anyone else handled this\ndifferently (perhaps allowing the lone individual to\nmate with a random individual from the last species it\nbelonged to, or something).\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
