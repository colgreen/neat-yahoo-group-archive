His version was pretty much\n&gt; feature-complete as of last  \n&gt; &gt; summer, though I haven&#39;t heard anything from him\n&gt; in a while.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve personally coded up a very general NEAT\n&gt; framework in python, but  \n&gt; &gt; I never got around to adding the module for neural\n&gt; networks. My goal  \n&gt; &gt; was basically to abstract away all of the GA code\n&gt; so I could focus on  \n&gt; &gt; different representations (of which I&#39;ve written\n&gt; several, including a  \n&gt; &gt; complexifying GRN, which is similar to NEAT).\n&gt; Anyway if you&#39;re  \n&gt; &gt; interested, the code is fairly well commented\n&gt; (compared to my last  \n&gt; &gt; endeavor :P), and I have stubs completed for\n&gt; adding the remaining  \n&gt; &gt; NEAT bits as a representation, so basically all\n&gt; you&#39;d have to do is  \n&gt; &gt; code up the neural network side. I could also\n&gt; write up a blurb about  \n&gt; &gt; how to add a new representation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway message me if you&#39;re interested; it might\n&gt; be easier than  \n&gt; &gt; starting from scratch.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- Joe\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Jul 5, 2005, at 5:27 PM, Thomas B wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I came across mention of Karl Lewin and his\n&gt; work, but his links such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as http://www.wooleyrhino.com/pyn.html are down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas B&quot;\n&gt; &lt;tomb@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking for NEAT implemented in Python.
