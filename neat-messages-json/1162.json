Also, we havent \nimplemented \n&gt; neat. we just have 9 inputs going into 2 outputs. however, we&#39;ve \n&gt; started running into problems that i was hoping to get some advice \n&gt; for.\n&gt; \n&gt; first, we have two outputs, if the first output is between -10 and \n&gt; 10, we make it stay, if it is less than -10 we make it go left and \n&gt; right if it is above 10. we do the the same with the other node \n&gt; except for up down. is there a better way to do this?\n&gt; \n\nHow did you come up with the range -10 to 10?  That sounds very \nlarge for a normal neural network.  A normal NN usually only outputs \nvalues between 0 and 1.\n\n&gt; second, we always seem to have some immediate improvement but then \n&gt; some major stagnation for about 1000 generations then maybe some \n&gt; minor improvements over the next however many generations we run \nit. \n&gt; in our simulated world, rabbits all start in the middle and get \n100 \n&gt; moves to get as much food as they can. fitness is defined as how \nmany \n&gt; pieces of food you get.\n&gt; \n\nDo you randomize the placement of food?  It is possible sometimes it \njust happens that food is placed in a more easy configuration, or \nrabbits are place relative to each other in a better way.  Do you \nevaluate lots of NN&#39;s at the same time (inside many rabbits) or is \nit one NN controlling many rabbits at once?  It is also possible the \ntask is very easy and you solved it too fast.  Or, you may need a \nmore sophisticated network representation.  1,000 generations of \nstagnation sounds like a really long time, so if it does improve \nlater on it&#39;s probably just random luck.\n\n&gt; thirdly, can anyone explain the logic behind how neat is \nimplemented? \n&gt; for example, with what percentage should a node or connections be \n&gt; added and why?\n&gt; \n\nHave your read our EC paper, looked at our code, and read the NEAT \nFAQ?  I suggest doing those things before asking questions because a \nlot of your first questions will probably be answered.  My version \nof NEAT also comes with a tutorial document.  I am not saying you \nhave to use my version, but just that looking over the code and \ntutorial may help you understand it better.  A fair number of people \nhere have now implemented NEAT, so I&#39;m sure we can all help you out \nwith specific questions.\n\n&gt; finally, we get about 5 sec / 100 generations (with 100 rabbits) \nbut \n&gt; that is with extremely limited vision (written in C) if we extend \nthe \n&gt; vision one more space in each direction, it drops to about 15 sec/ \n&gt; 100 generations. is this....ok?\n&gt; \n\nThat is generally extremely fast.  It means your domain must be very \nsimple (and perhaps well-implemented as well).  It makes sense that \nadding sensors increases evaluation time.\n\nHave you observed your rabbits&#39; behavior?  Does it looks reasonable \nand make sense to you?  If so, it&#39;s a good sign your metholdogy is \nworking.  (It&#39;s more important than just looking at the fitness \ngraph)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
