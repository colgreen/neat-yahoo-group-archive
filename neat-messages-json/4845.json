I am currently in=\r\nvestigating using K-Medoid Clustering (very similar\n&gt; to K-Means, but the c=\r\nenter of a cluster is an existing value, not=A0a &quot;created\n&gt; value&quot; like in =\r\nK-Means) for something else I am working on and am quite\n&gt; interested to se=\r\ne how you went about creating a &quot;sensible&quot; K value :-).\n\nFWIW I&#39;ve uploaded=\r\n a 7zip file to:\n\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/sharpneat/recent-builds\n\nAls=\r\no on that google &#39;site&#39; I&#39;m writing an overview of speciation in\nNEAT and w=\r\nhy k-means may be a better choice. It&#39;s a work in progress\nbut some may be =\r\ninterested in reading it as it stands.\n\nThere&#39;s no magic really, I defined =\r\na class (CoordinateVector) that\nrepresents a point in N-dimensional space. =\r\nBut unlike x,y coordinates\neach element of the coordinate (the x and the y)=\r\n has an ID. Put\nanother way, each /dimension/ or axis has an ID. That way w=\r\ne can have\ncoordinates that define a points in very high dimensional space\n=\r\nwithout having to allocate an element for every possible dimension.\n\nMy gen=\r\neric IGenome interface then has a Position property that gets a\nCoordinateV=\r\nector object representing that genome&#39;s position. Initially\nI just took the=\r\n innovation ID of each connection as the dimension/axis\nID (in CoordinateVe=\r\nctor) and the connection weight as the position on\nthat axis. I&#39;ve just cha=\r\nnged this slightly so that the transaltion\nfrom genome to coordinate is per=\r\nformed by a plugged in\n&#39;INeatCoordinateSystem&#39;. More on that another time I=\r\n think.\n\nMy k-means algorithm (KMeansSpeciationStrategy) operates on a list=\r\n of\nIGenomes by using their Position. Calculating centroids is a simple\nave=\r\nrgaing of a list of CoordinateVectros and returns another\nCoordinateVector =\r\nobject. One warning here, the centroid calculation\nchanges for different di=\r\nstance metrics. For Euclidean distance we take\nthe mean, for Manhattan we t=\r\nake the median value - I&#39;m attempting to\nexplain this as part of my speciat=\r\nion overview in the above URL.\n\nIt&#39;s also possible to run k-means without c=\r\nentroids, by measuring the\naverage distance between a point and all points =\r\nin a cluster rather\nthan betwene a point and the cluster centroid. Obviousl=\r\ny this uses\nmore CPU time but I allow for teh possibility of &#39;centroid-less=\r\n&#39;\ndistance metrics in the code (I haven&#39;t fully thought through if this\nis =\r\nabsolutely required yet).\n\n\nk-mediods is an interesting suggestion. My init=\r\nial reaction (having\njust read the wikipedia page) is that it&#39;s probably a =\r\ngood choice\ncompared to the original NEAT (O-NEAT) speciation but perhaps n=\r\not\nquite as good as k-means because the centroid is being artificially\nlimi=\r\nted to being one of the genomes - which is going to be a\nsub-optimal choice=\r\n of centroid However, I suspect k-mediods and\nk-means are both a big improv=\r\nment over O-NEAT and the gap between\nk-mediods and k-means is minimal. Also=\r\n k-means isn&#39;t perfect, it forms\nsub-optimal clusters (in terms of minimizi=\r\nng intra cluster variance)\nso there may be yet better clustering algorithms=\r\n to consider.\n\n\n\n&gt; Could you also point me at the code in SharpNeat that do=\r\nes the threshold\n&gt; adjustment dynamically for the regular Speciation?\n\n\nHav=\r\ne a look at EvolutionAlgorith.AdjustSpeciationThreshold().\n\nIt started out =\r\nas a fixed increment up or down and then I started\nincreasing the size of t=\r\nhe increment with each generation that we are\noutside the target, sort of l=\r\nike an accelerating increment if you\nlike. It&#39;s far from perfect though, he=\r\nnce the effort to improve\nspeciation.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
