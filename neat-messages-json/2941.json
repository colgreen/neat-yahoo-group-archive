I don&#39;t really know which is=\r\n slower, evolving\nmultiple sets of similar nets or evolving one monolithic =\r\nnet and using\nseparate boolean input nodes (or negative values to the optio=\r\nnal\nnodes) to indicate when nodes should be ignored.  For example, you\nwoul=\r\nd need betting information about the flop and turn on the river,\nbut would =\r\nneed some way to indicate that the information is no longer\nrelevant on the=\r\n earlier rounds.\n\nI tend to think evolving separate networks is the better =\r\napproach\nbecause it will tell us more about the game itself.  As networks g=\r\nrow\nin size and complexity, the ability to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind\nthei=\r\nr structure diminishes.\n \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing a lot of these tournaments would h=\r\nave to be played.  In\nwhich\n&gt; case, it is insufficient to say &quot;a fraction o=\r\nf a second&quot;.  I am\nforced to\n&gt; ask, which fraction?\n&gt;\n\nI have a framework w=\r\nhich I have used already which is not in any way\nas fast as poker eval (I w=\r\nrote it before finding poker eval).  This is\nwhat I used to do my simulatio=\r\nns.\n\nI was able to calculate all the stats I mentioned previously in my\npas=\r\nt experiments (using exhaustive evaluation of all possible hands to\nfind yo=\r\nur overall hand rank).  A session would consist of a 6 handed\ngame of limit=\r\n hold em which lasted 1000 hands.  Each bot would play a\nsession against a =\r\nrandomly selected group of 5 other bots.  I used a\nfixed size population of=\r\n 50 bots, (i.e., 50,000 hands per generation).\n The total time for evaluati=\r\nng 1 generation, performing selection and\nmutation, and serializing the bot=\r\ns to file (in case of a system crash)\nusing a AMD 3500+ was about 40 second=\r\ns on average.\n\nI was able to run several hundred generations overnight and =\r\nwake up to\nlovely and horrible results. :)\n \n&gt; But I agree parallelizing it=\r\n would be hella cool.\n&gt;\n\nI think this is going to be my first step.  It wil=\r\nl certainly help to\nfamiliarize myself with the details of NEAT.\n \n&gt; For an=\r\nyone who&#39;s interested, I&#39;ve posted it under &quot;maverick&quot; (what I\n&gt; named\n&gt; it=\r\n long ago) on the neat group file page.\n\nI don&#39;t really see much in terms o=\r\nf an actual poker engine for this. \nHow did you run hand simulations?\n\n\n&gt; I=\r\n don&#39;t really play well with others but if people are serious, I&#39;ll\n&gt; contr=\r\nibute.  But I hate yahoo messenger.\n\nOk, I guess we&#39;ll stick to this for no=\r\nw then.\n\n\nWesley\n\n\n\n"}}
