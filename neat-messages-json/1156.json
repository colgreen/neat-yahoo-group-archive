Also, we havent implemented \nneat. we just have 9 inputs going into 2 outputs. however, we&#39;ve \nstarted running into problems that i was hoping to get some advice \nfor.\n\nfirst, we have two outputs, if the first output is between -10 and \n10, we make it stay, if it is less than -10 we make it go left and \nright if it is above 10. we do the the same with the other node \nexcept for up down. is there a better way to do this?\n\nsecond, we always seem to have some immediate improvement but then \nsome major stagnation for about 1000 generations then maybe some \nminor improvements over the next however many generations we run it. \nin our simulated world, rabbits all start in the middle and get 100 \nmoves to get as much food as they can. fitness is defined as how many \npieces of food you get.\n\nthirdly, can anyone explain the logic behind how neat is implemented? \nfor example, with what percentage should a node or connections be \nadded and why?\n\nfinally, we get about 5 sec / 100 generations (with 100 rabbits) but \nthat is with extremely limited vision (written in C) if we extend the \nvision one more space in each direction, it drops to about 15 sec/ \n100 generations. is this....ok?\n\nanyway, i would appreciate anyone&#39;s input. thanks\n\n-timmy\n\n\n\n\n"}}
