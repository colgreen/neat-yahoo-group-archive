I think most of the memory in my Go eyes was\nrecurrent.\n\nI have uploaded a sample 7x7 champion network to the photos section,\ncalled go_eye431.jpg (it&#39;s from generation 431).\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Darren&quot; &lt;zysyshelp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Darren Izzard, check out the Acknowledgments section.
