For example, \n&gt;=\r\n you might have a single 2D input layer connecting to a single \noutput \n&gt; n=\r\node (yes/no); or you could have a multilayer 3D input field (where \n&gt; each =\r\n2D layer is a type of object) connecting to a 2D output field \n&gt; (where eac=\r\nh pixel answers the question, is there overlap here?).  \n&gt; You might have a=\r\n hidden layer, and you might not.  You might allow \n&gt; the hidden layer to e=\r\nxpress lateral connections, and you might \nnot.  \n&gt; You might have a 3D hid=\r\nden layer or a 2D hidden layer.  You might \n&gt; embed everything in 3D, or yo=\r\nu might map a 3D coordinate to a 2D, \nor \n&gt; a 2D or a 3D, etc..\n&gt; \n&gt; In eac=\r\nh case, the implications are different about how proximities \n&gt; are incorpo=\r\nrated or expressed.  In some cases it can be explicit \n&gt; within parts of th=\r\ne substrate; in some cases it is implicit.  For \n&gt; example, if there is onl=\r\ny a single output node and a 2D sheet of \n&gt; inputs, then the CPPN does not =\r\neven need to take a target location \n&gt; as input, since there is only one ta=\r\nrget.  In that case you just \n&gt; query for each input node what weight is co=\r\nming out of it.  In such \n&gt; a case, it is true that you do not explicitly p=\r\nrovide a proximity \n&gt; input to the CPPN; however proximity is still implici=\r\nt within the \n&gt; representation since input nodes that are near each other a=\r\nre also \n&gt; nearby in the function domain of the CPPN, that is, it can use t=\r\nhat \n&gt; nearness even though it is not explicitly provided as input.  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPlease let me know if I didn&#39;t answer adequately and I can try to \nbe \n&gt; mo=\r\nre specific, but I might need more detail on the precise scenario \n&gt; you ar=\r\ne considering.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.c=\r\narl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ken,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    One troubling &quot;detail&quot; is that of dif=\r\nferences in \ndimensionality \n&gt; &gt; between substrate inputs and outputs. In t=\r\nhe examples used in the \n&gt; &gt; various papers, the dimensionality of the subs=\r\ntrate input and \n&gt; output \n&gt; &gt; nodes, as applied to the Hypercube inputs, w=\r\nere identical (i.e. \n&gt; x_in, \n&gt; &gt; y_in, x_out, y_out). This simplifies the =\r\nconcept of distance. But \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; problem could just as easily have been=\r\n: Do the two squares on the \n&gt; &gt; visual field overlap? (yes/no). In this ca=\r\nse, dimensionality of \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; substrate input and output nodes, as appl=\r\nied to the Hypercube \n&gt; inputs, \n&gt; &gt; have differing dimensionality, even th=\r\nough the answer is strongly \n&gt; &gt; dependent on proximity in the input visual=\r\n field. Any experience \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; comments on this seemly more common gener=\r\nal condition?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;    Andy Carl \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Andy, I&#39;d say =\r\nthis is a about right.

So you might for example output \na \n&gt; &gt; high \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; resolution representation of your possible decisions, which is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsomething you normally wouldn&#39;t do in regular NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (b) Hype=\r\nrcube Network: (i) Inputs: Other \n&gt; descriptors/parameters \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; geometric coordinates being a subset thereof), associated \nwith \n&gt; a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate network node (i.e. like a timestamp associa=\r\nted with \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinate point comprising a trajectory), mutually =\r\nexclusive \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; descriptor/parameter expressly identifi=\r\ned in the substrate \n&gt; node, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being collected together =\r\nand collectively identified as \neither \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;to&quot; ter=\r\nminator of a link between any two substrate nodes; \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ii) \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Output: Weight of link between the currently \nidentified &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand &quot;to&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate nodes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this chara=\r\ncterizes it well, although there is even more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; flexibility.  You can =\r\nfor example use additional outputs on the \n&gt; &gt; CPPN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to represent add=\r\nitional attributes of links and/or nodes.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The timestamp idea=\r\n is interesting- if I understand correctly it \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cause the n=\r\network to change over time in a deterministic way.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although maybe I=\r\n&#39;m misunderstanding.
