But since it&#39;s not going to work with distributed \nNEAT\n&gt; &gt;and also if say you load a seed population that already has \nmatching\n&gt; &gt;connections. I think I will have to do as you say - and maybe try \nand\n&gt; &gt;maintain innovation numbers across the population as well if I \ncan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a thought...  Why give connections a unique innovation \nnumber at all? \n&gt;   Why not assign their unique ID based on the innovation numbers \nof the \n&gt; nodes they connect?  If you create a new connection between nodes \n253 and \n&gt; 275, then the ID for the connection could be &quot;253:275&quot;.  Store the \n&gt; connections in a hash table, and you have instant prevention of \nduplicates.  \n&gt; Then, even if a connection is created 10 generations later, if it \nconnects \n&gt; the same nodes, it&#39;s the same gene.  Even if the organism has \nsubsequently \n&gt; gone off and formed its own species.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any reason why that wouldn&#39;t work?\n\nI think sometimes it may be desirable to assign a different \ninnovation number connecting two of the same nodes.  This goes back \nto the debate about how long to keep a record of innovation \nnumbers.  In the FAQ I give some reasons I chose to only keep them \naround for 1 generation.  In your proposed model, this wouldn&#39;t be \nan option.  Also, it&#39;s nice to know the order that connections \nappeared.  If you ever look at a NEAT genome you can tell how often \nconnections are successful and in what order they were put togther \nby looking at their innovation numbers.  Aside from these concerns, \nyour idea is still doable but you&#39;d lose these capabilities.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
