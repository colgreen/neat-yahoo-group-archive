So far they seem unreasonably nice :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell good luck with that, looks &#39;your cup of tea&#39; anyway. I looked for \nwork this time last year but was thoroughly disheartened by the type of \nwork available. At least my current job allows me to go off on &#39;flights \nof fancy&#39; as far as coding is concerned - somehow I&#39;m protected from \ncommercial realtities by the umpteen layers of management between me and \nthe shareholders :)\n\n&gt;\tw.r.t SLEAT, I spent some time putting a ES-style (*) variance \n&gt;parameters into it.  They don&#39;t seem to make much difference to the \n&gt;search, but that mean they are not killing it either.  And they are \n&gt;driven down to low values in old (and hence required) genes...  I put \n&gt;them on all weights and also all FIDs.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI woud expect this. The benefit should come from very long duration \nsearches where the algorithm has time to settle on good variance parameters.\n\n&gt;\t(*do I mean ES?  I get abbreviation blindness sometimes)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I think that&#39;s right. These days Wikipedia has some info on these \nterms, but to be honest I think we need throw away all of these old \nterms and replace them with a proper classification system, since (to me \nanyway) all of these strategies are just variations on a theme.\n\n&gt;\tGenerally, SLEAT runs fine up to the point where the PPS fitness \n&gt;(see my previous discussions) reaches about 90%.  Then it really \n&gt;starts to slow (never quite stopping, but how would I know...) and by \n&gt;the time it gets to around 92% the search is so slow that it becomes \n&gt;impractical to continue...\n&gt;\n&gt;\tHow does that gel with folk&#39;s experience on similar problems?\n&gt;\nGenerally speaking I can confirm this observation. I think in your case \nthe evaluation time is constant and it&#39;s the increasing complexity of \nthe solutions that consumes time, yes? which is how I arrived at the \nphased pruning idea.\n\nAs for me I&#39;ve started redesigning sharpneat with a fresh slate using \ngenerics (templates). So far so good. At the most abstract level I have \nan IEvolutionAlgorithm interface that defines the concept of an \nalgorithm with generations and actring on completely abstract genome and \nphenome types. My current NEAT code then sits on top of this (with a \ncouple of design layers in between) quite nicely and acts as a default \nimplementation right now to put some meat on the bones of the framework. \nI then intend to create a completely new genome representation based on \nmany of the ideas on the group over the last year.\n\nI have to say that working with templates is a breath of fresh air, I \nthink this new framework is going to make the old one look positively \nold hat!\n\n\n&gt;p.s. and a happy new year.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nLikewise.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
