T.\nEvolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding.\n\nProceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing Special Section\non Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n\nLegged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as navigating\nrough terrain, but the design of their control software is both challenging\nand laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these\ncontrollers, but require manual decomposition or other problem\nsimplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble\ntaking advantage of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such active\nintervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and\nrequires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem&#39;s\nstructure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising\ngenerative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits\nwithout manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is\nsuccessful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily\nreuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary\nalgorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which may aid its\nperformance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and\nfind that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly\noutperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals\nare more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better\ncoordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results suggest that\nHyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex,\nyet regular, devices, such as robots.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
