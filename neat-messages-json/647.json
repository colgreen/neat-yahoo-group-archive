For example, do you start each trial from a\nrandom\n&gt; &gt;&gt;position (either the prey or the predator)?  Or is something\n&gt; &gt;&gt;randomized about the prey? \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; A quick update on the prey capture work. I&#39;ve been fine tuning the\nprey \n&gt; capture test cases and I do now have some nice results,\nparticularly \n&gt; evolved agent&#39;s that are able to remember where the prey was last\nseen \n&gt; before it moved out of sensor range - and then move in that\ndirection. I \n&gt; still need to extend the new tests further - to evolve agents that\ncan \n&gt; chase moving prey - following that and some code tidying up I&#39;ll put\nthe \n&gt; new code on the web site and post another message.\n&gt; \n\nHey Colin, just out of curiosity what was the fine tuning that\nimproved things?  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
