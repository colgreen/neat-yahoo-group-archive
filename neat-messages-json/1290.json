This\n&gt; &gt;basically prevents me from having to write the LIKE\n&gt; &gt;statements etc....\n&gt; &gt;Well I was thinking about rathing than using that\n&gt; &gt;coming up with a set of inputs such as Page UpTime,\n&gt; &gt;Num Clicks, etc.. and using those inputs into the\n&gt; &gt;Neural Network and using Ga to evolve the weights. \n&gt; &gt;Well I have looked at the smartsweepers example on\n&gt; &gt;ai-junkie and Matt has done a gerat job, but I am\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt;sure how I could apply it to my solution. For\n&gt; instance\n&gt; &gt;inthe smartsweepers problem he had a controller\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt;iterataed through the sweepers and each sweeper had\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;brain independent of the other sweepers. For my\n&gt; &gt;problem would I have a SearchSweeper with its own\n&gt; &gt;brain and then it would get a list of results from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;database(perhaps FullText INdexing still) and then\n&gt; &gt;rank them on the basis of the weights of the inputs\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;should each search result have its own brain and\n&gt; &gt;determine its own ranking?\n&gt; &gt;Does that help, not sure if it does.\n&gt; &gt;Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;Rog\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Hi Roger, I don&#39;t know anything about smartsweepers\n&gt; I&#39;m afraid but I \n&gt; think I&#39;m starting to get the picture. You want to\n&gt; rank the search \n&gt; results from an SQL server query, so that instead of\n&gt; having to deal with \n&gt; g the raw, un-ranked search results from SQL you\n&gt; want to pass each \n&gt; result, in turn, through a network and for the\n&gt; network to output a \n&gt; ranking,  or some variation on this scheme that\n&gt; gives you a ranked list \n&gt; of search results, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure what benefit such a  scheme would\n&gt; provide over simple \n&gt; weighting of the various factors, such as page-up\n&gt; time, and other \n&gt; factors such as the proximity of the various\n&gt; keywords and the frequency \n&gt; they occur on a page. Google of course also factors\n&gt; in how many links \n&gt; point to a page from elsewhere on the web - but my\n&gt; guess would be that \n&gt; they take all of these factors, give some more\n&gt; weight than others, total \n&gt; them all up and sort them so that the highest\n&gt; scoring pages occurs first \n&gt; in the list.  Now, perhaps a Neural Net could apply\n&gt; a more intelligent \n&gt; analysis of the various factors, but then there is\n&gt; the problem of \n&gt; determining the &#39;best&#39; order that the search results\n&gt; could be in so that \n&gt; you can train a network to achieve that &#39;best&#39;\n&gt; order.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n\n\n=====\n\n\n \n\n \n\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````\n\nRoger R.
