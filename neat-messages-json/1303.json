ACSII?  gifs?  What size?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI posted some details in an earlier message, but to recap I created my \nown clas (BitImage) to represent the characters during experiments as \nthis is more efficient in terms of memory requirements and performance. \nBitImage is just a convienient wrapper for a 2D array of bits. The set \nof BitImages is built at the start of an experiment by using various \nparts of the .Net class framework to write each character to a temporary \nImage from which I can then read the pixel values from and build a \nBitImage object.\n\nI use the Courier New font (plain Courier is not a proper TrueType font \nI believe), size 6. I found this to be the smallest I could go before \nthe characters became unrecognisable to the human eye as letters of the \nalphabet. When I extract the characters into a BitImage object I \nactually take the smallest possible area that represents all of the \ncharacters, this works out to be 7 pixels wide by 9 high, e.g.\n\nlower case &#39;b&#39;\n\nOO`````\n`O`````\n`O`OO``\n`OO``O`\n`O```O`\n`O```O`\nOOOOO``\n```````\n```````\n\nlower case &#39;q&#39;\n\n```````\n```````\n``OO`OO\n`O``OO`\n`O```O`\n`O```O`\n``OOOO`\n`````O`\n````OOO\n\n\n\nSo you can see that characters have some whitespace around them because \nI have preserved the relative position of the characters from the \noriginal Image structure, I have simply trimmed the whitespace that is \ncommon to all of the characters.\n\nThe images are 1 bit plane (black and white).\n\n&gt;2) How are these input into the network?\n&gt;\n&gt;3) What are the outputs of the network?  Do you have 26 outputs, one\n&gt;for each letter?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFor the experinment I have 1 input for each pixel (7x9=63) and one \noutput for each character in the set that the network will be exposed \nto, I can vary this number but I have been using all 26 lower case \nletters, so 26 outputs. For each evaluation I apply each character in \nturn to the input nodes and take the highest output as the network&#39;s \nselection - if there is no unique high output then I take this as a \nfailure for that character.\n\nYou will note that the set of characters is very limited, e.g. there is \nonly one representation of each letter, I don&#39;t have any dummy or \n&#39;trick&#39; characters and I don&#39;t use multiple representations of each \ncharacter. This is all on done on purpose because I didn&#39;t want a full \nblown OCR experiment as such, I just wanted a problem domain that could \nbe used to test NEATs ability to search through a large connection space \nand that would execute at high speed - this domain achieves those \nrequirements.\n\n&gt;I ask because we&#39;re in the process of experimenting with OCR as well. \n&gt;We&#39;re using 50x50 tiffs, 8 images of each letter, consisting of 3\n&gt;different fonts (Courier, New Times Roman, and Ariel).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n50x50 represnts a massive input space, but since I understand you&#39;re \nusing a roving eye technique that seems reasonable to me, although \npersonally I would be tempted to start a bit smaller. I also recommend \nyou adopt Kens suggestion of evolving one network for each character. A \nsingle output can then indicate if the supplied image is or isn&#39;t one \nspecific character. Once you have 26 successful networks you can \nmanually combine them into one large network with 26 outputs. I recon \nthis will greatly increase the chances of finding good networks.\n\nNote that I choose to go for the multiple output route because, again, I \nwas specifically looking for a difficult task with a high input/output \nspace. If I reduce the char set to 2 or three chars the problem becomes \na lot simpler and networks are found very quickly - the problem \ndifficulty I guess rises exponentially with a linear increase in number \nof chars in the set.\n\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;\n\nCheers,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
