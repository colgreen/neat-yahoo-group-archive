Lots of quick responses.  Some quick replies:\n\n\nJulien - I have indee=\r\nd seen the contest and I&#39;ve thought of \nentering.  The big issues is that y=\r\nou get a graphic file of the \nscreen, so I would need to extract details fr=\r\nom the graphic, or let \nNEAT find features.  While that would be very cool =\r\nif it worked, I \nwould be amazed if it could work from first principles but=\r\n would \nrather require a hearty set of primitives.  They mention the \npossi=\r\nble availability of an API to extract features, but I have yet \nto see it c=\r\nome to life.\n\nKen - May I call you Ken?? -  Once I have a SourceForge proje=\r\nct up \nand running, I&#39;ll post back here and let people know.  Mat Bucland \n=\r\nhas given me permission to post his code along with it, so it should \nbe a =\r\ncomplete package.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;=\r\nkstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Kirk, I think it&#39;s a great idea to release your NE=\r\nAT-based \nPacman.  \n&gt; Even if it was a little buggy, it would still be a ni=\r\nce platform \nfor \n&gt; people to experiment with (and fun too).  I&#39;d certainly=\r\n play it \nmyself.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot;=\r\n &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve implemented a PacMan clone in which I&#39;ve =\r\nemployed NEAT to \n&gt; evolve \n&gt; &gt; PacMan&#39;s AI.  So far the results have been =\r\nresonably good, and I \n&gt; hope \n&gt; &gt; to put the code in a SourceForge project=\r\n, if anyone is \ninterested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve used Mat Bucland&#39;s implementation=\r\n of NEAT for Windows, but \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; &gt; been told that it may be somewhat bugg=\r\ny.  If anyone has any \nfeedback \n&gt; &gt; on the suitability of this code or of =\r\nmodifcations or \nalternatives, \n&gt; &gt; please let me know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And, I hav=\r\ne to say, very nice work Dr. Stanley.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Kirk\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
