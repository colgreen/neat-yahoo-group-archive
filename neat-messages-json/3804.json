If you strip down the whole idea of \nan &quot;inter=\r\naction map,&quot; all you really have left is a function that \ntakes two nodes a=\r\ns input and outputs the parameters of the \nassociated connection between th=\r\nem.  In AGE, that function is based \non a matching scheme.  So the deeper q=\r\nuestion is, towards what kinds \nof patterns are matching schemes biased? It=\r\n&#39;s all about bias when \nyou&#39;re talking about indirect encoding.  I do not s=\r\nee any argument \nthat there is a beneficial bias for a matching scheme.  Th=\r\ne only \nthing the authors really say to recommend the matching scheme is \nt=\r\nhat it allows a continuum of values.  Yet so do many other types of \nfuncti=\r\nons.\n\nSo yes, the crux of the issue is that any method for assigning \nvalue=\r\ns to compoments of a structure should ideally be based on some \nkind of pri=\r\nnciple that addresses how (i.e. in what kinds of \npatterns) we would like t=\r\nhose values to relate to the underlying \nstructure.\n\nNote that the AGE pape=\r\nrs seem to imply that AGE could theoretically \nuse methods other than match=\r\ning schemes in the interaction map.  But \nthen, what other methods?  It see=\r\nms the most viable alternative \nassignment method is just to collapse into =\r\nHyperNEAT.  So the real \ncore focus should be the matching scheme itself, i=\r\n.e. not the gene \nalphabet and methods of recombination that AGE focuses on=\r\n.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes Ken=\r\n. That&#39;s also what my question was referring, what advantage\n&gt; does it have=\r\n. I can see AGE producing complex patterns via a \nintricate\n&gt; interaction m=\r\nap (or matching scheme, are they just different terms \nfor\n&gt; the same mecha=\r\nnism?) And I suppose you can evolve the interaction \nmap\n&gt; too. But then ho=\r\nw would that be any different than HyperNeat if you\n&gt; just consider a match=\r\ning scheme as a general function with input \nand\n&gt; output. It seems to me H=\r\nyperNeat take one more abstraction away and\n&gt; made it more focus on the end=\r\n result with is patterns of \norganization.\n&gt; Or maybe I am just not underst=\r\nanding the essence of GRN and AGE?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenne=\r\nth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;s=\r\nkybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (This is my first post.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recent=\r\nly came upon some literatures on Analog Genetic \nEncoding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developed b=\r\ny Mattiussi and Floreano. It&#39;s interesting but \ncertainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not revolut=\r\nionary. After all it&#39;s just a simplified version of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gene-regulation i=\r\nn real biological system. Some stats shows it \nis as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; robust as Neat. =\r\n(Probably not tested against HyperNeat)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you had any exper=\r\nience with it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have no experience with Mattiussi&#39;s Analog =\r\nGenetic Encoding \naside \n&gt; &gt; from reading about it myself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is s=\r\nimilar in a way to Joseph Reisinger&#39;s work with evolving \na GRN-\n&gt; &gt; based =\r\nencoding with NEAT, as Joe mentions in his response to \nyour \n&gt; &gt; post.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; It is interesting as an abstraction of  developmental encoding \nin \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; nature.  In particular, it broadens our perspective on how such \n&gt; &gt; abs=\r\ntractions can work and from which aspects of development they \ncan \n&gt; &gt; dra=\r\nw.  The abstraction seems fairly high-level, i.e. it \nabstracts \n&gt; &gt; away s=\r\nuch details as chemical diffusion and growth from an \nembryo.  \n&gt; &gt; In that=\r\n way, it has some similarities to HyperNEAT.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The main question i=\r\nt brings to my mind is what exactly \nrecommends \n&gt; &gt; this particular abstra=\r\nction over any other.  Although the \nauthors \n&gt; &gt; note that it allows a lar=\r\nge variety of genetic operations, aside \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; that, it is unclear what=\r\n the main principle is that supports the \n&gt; &gt; approach, i.e. why we should =\r\nprefer it to any other indirect \n&gt; &gt; encoding.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, as a p=\r\nroponent of CPPNs and HyperNEAT, I think that \none \n&gt; &gt; important ingredien=\r\nt for a developmental encoding is the ability \nto \n&gt; &gt; create patterns as a=\r\n function of the domain geometry (as in the \n&gt; &gt; substrate in HyperNEAT).  =\r\nAGE does not have such a capability.  \nIts \n&gt; &gt; interactions are detached f=\r\nrom the geometry of the ultimate \nnetwork \n&gt; &gt; it encodes, which suggests t=\r\no me that it may fare worse in \ndomains \n&gt; &gt; with a geometric basis, especi=\r\nally those with high \n&gt; &gt; resolution/granularity.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also wonder =\r\nwhy connection-centric parameters (such as \nweights) \n&gt; &gt; should be derived=\r\n through a matching scheme like sequence \nalignment \n&gt; &gt; (which is one way =\r\nAGE sets up its &quot;device interaction map.&quot;)  \nThis \n&gt; &gt; idea seems to be tak=\r\nen from biology simply for the sake of doing \n&gt; &gt; something similarly to bi=\r\nology.  Yet such matching schemes are \nad hoc \n&gt; &gt; because they do not rela=\r\nte to anything extrinsic to the genome.  \n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT relates its connect=\r\nion weights to the outside world by \n&gt; &gt; computing them as a function of th=\r\ne locations of nodes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for comparisons with NEAT, I do believe t=\r\nhat indirect \nencodings, \n&gt; &gt; including AGE, should generally be superior t=\r\no direct encodings \nin \n&gt; &gt; tasks that involve moderate-sized patterns.  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
