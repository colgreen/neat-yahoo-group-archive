I hadn&#39;t been aware of \nthat =\r\npaper and it is indeed an interesting study.\n\nI&#39;m guessing that it probably=\r\n has not been done before exactly \nbecause it is so simple.  In particular,=\r\n running evolution with a \npopulation of one is not very popular these days=\r\n, and so people \nprobably don&#39;t even bother considering it.\n\nOf course, as =\r\nyour paper discusses, it then leads to the question of \nhow you might expan=\r\nd it into a population-based approach, and a lot \nof the existing methods m=\r\night embody ways that could be done to \nvarious degrees.  NEAT seems to be =\r\na possible such expansion in the \nsense that it has multiple species of top=\r\nologies and roughly evolves \nweights and topologies on two different time s=\r\ncales with its usual \nparameter settings.\n\nIn any case, your paper an elega=\r\nnt demonstration of how much you can \nlearn from a simple concept.  \n\nOne q=\r\nuestion I have is what is meant when you mention things \nlike &quot;all connecti=\r\nons on?&quot;  It sounds like the topology is chosen \nfrom some finite constrain=\r\ned set of topologies.  Is that true?  Or \nis any potential topology possibl=\r\ne?  It makes me wonder whether the \nconnection set from which you are choos=\r\ning somehow biases the result \nto radically favor the different time scales=\r\n, though I&#39;m not sure \nhow.\n\nIn general, my intuitive explanation of the ph=\r\nenomenon is that if \nyou stick with only a single topology it is likely to =\r\nbe the wrong \none, so you need to look at several to see if they have poten=\r\ntial.  \nThen you ensure steady progress.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt;  I&#39;d like to conne=\r\nct to the recent discussion in this group on\n&gt;  combining neuroevolution wi=\r\nth backpropagation, and use it as a\n&gt;  convenient excuse to expose you to a=\r\n recent paper of mine. In\n&gt;  particular, I&#39;d like to ask you if you know wh=\r\no did this before we\n&gt;  (me, Faustino Gomez, Juergen Schmidhuber) did. Beca=\r\nuse the \nalgorithm\n&gt;  we are presenting in this paper is so simple someone =\r\nmust have \ncome up\n&gt;  with it before, it&#39;s just that our literature search =\r\nhas been\n&gt;  fruitless.\n&gt; \n&gt;  The basic idea is to combine hillclimbing (1+1=\r\n evolution \nstrategy) of\n&gt;  network topologies, with hillclimbing of networ=\r\nk weights, but at a\n&gt;  faster timescale. So after each (&quot;global&quot;) topology =\r\nmutation, we\n&gt;  search (&quot;local&quot;) weight space for a number of steps (e.g. 5=\r\n0), and\n&gt;  only accepts the global mutation if the fitness after local \nsea=\r\nrch is\n&gt;  higher than before the global mutation. The reason we do this is =\r\n\nthat\n&gt;  global mutations are so often disruptive. Yes, this is the same \ni=\r\ndea\n&gt;  as &quot;innovation protection&quot; in NEAT, but here we&#39;re boiling it \ndown =\r\na\n&gt;  bare minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt;  We tried two versions of a moderately difficult co=\r\nntrol task: one \nwith\n&gt;  a set of 7 carefully selected inputs to the neural=\r\n network, and \none\n&gt;  with 15 not-so-carefully-selected inputs to the netwo=\r\nrk. We found\n&gt;  that, when compared to simple hillclimbing in weight space,=\r\n or to\n&gt;  climbing weights and topologies at the same time, performed \nslig=\r\nhtly\n&gt;  better on the small-input  version of the problem problem. On the\n&gt;=\r\n  big-input version, the difference was dramatic, in that using\n&gt;  differen=\r\nt timescales was really the only way to solve the problem!\n&gt;  (Incidentally=\r\n, learning topology at the &quot;local&quot; level and weights \nat\n&gt;  the &quot;global&quot; le=\r\nvel worked just as well.)\n&gt; \n&gt;  The paper is here:\n&gt;  http://julian.togeliu=\r\ns.com/Togelius2008Learning.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt;  Again, this is so obvious that someone=\r\n must have done this \nbefore. The\n&gt;  literature search only pointed us to a=\r\nttempts to combine topology\n&gt;  evolution with backpropagation, which is rel=\r\nated but not the same\n&gt;  thing. We submitted the paper to WCCI (and had it =\r\naccepted) in the\n&gt;  hope that the reviewers would know, but that they didn&#39;=\r\nt. So now I\n&gt;  wonder if anyone of you might know. It would be good to know=\r\n about\n&gt;  this before go on with further experiments...\n&gt; \n&gt;  Grateful for =\r\nany suggestions\n&gt;  Julian\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; IDSIA\n&gt; Galleria 2\n&gt; 69=\r\n28 Manno-Lugano\n&gt; Switzerland\n&gt; julian@...\n&gt; http://julian.togelius.com\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; +46-705-192088\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
