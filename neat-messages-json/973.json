I think it makes much more sense to try to\n&gt; &gt;only keep around mutations that show an immediate payoff for fitness,\n&gt; &gt;even if it is slight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Isn&#39;t this whole discussion moot?  Between fitness sharing, fixed size\n&gt; populations, and selective reproduction, haven&#39;t we already biased things\n&gt; towards mutations that are beneficial?\n\nThe point is, there is no direct bias against network size or\nefficiency.  So no, there is currently no bias *against* neutral\nmutations.  That&#39;s what I believe Colin and Ken are arguing for, the\nallowance for a lot of structure that&#39;s neither directly helping or\nhurting fitness in the present, but that may be coopted later in the\nrun to increase fitness.\n\nIf you want to see this in action, just run NEAT on a very simple\nproblem and crank up the mutation rates.  It will still solve the\nproblem, but you will have networks that are much larger than they\nreally need to be.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
