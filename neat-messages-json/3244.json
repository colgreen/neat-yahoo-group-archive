I went with the example =\r\n\njust for illustration, but let me give a shot at a more general \nanswer:\n\n=\r\nI think the most general answer is that to the extent inputs and \noutputs r=\r\neally are apples and oranges there is still valuable \ninformation that can =\r\nbe included with respect to how they are \nseparately arranged.  It is not o=\r\nnly the relationship of inputs to \noutputs, but the relations of inputs to =\r\neach other (and outputs to \neach other) that is potentially valuable.  \n\nOn=\r\n the other hand, I don&#39;t think inputs and outputs are really often \ngoing t=\r\no truly be apples and oranges since both normally will be at \nleast about t=\r\nhe same world, i.e. what I see in the world vs. what I \ndo in the world; so=\r\n there is an inherent conceptual relationship \nbetween them in most context=\r\ns.  While it is possible to pose a \nproblem in a way that removes some of t=\r\nhat relationship (such as in \nyour example), it should normally be possible=\r\n to recast the problem \nat least in part to restore it.  That is, there is =\r\nmore than one way \nto pose a problem from a geometric standpoint.  In gener=\r\nal if the \ninputs and outputs are both about the same world, then some meth=\r\nod \nis probably available.\n\nAt the same time, even in cases where there is =\r\nreally no \nrelationship whatsoever, there is still utility in arranging the=\r\n \ninputs and outputs separately in ways that correspond to their \nrespectiv=\r\ne geometric contexts.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt;    The cited example modification of the paper ge=\r\nometry problem \nwas \n&gt; only to provide an instance in which the dimensional=\r\nity of the \n&gt; substrate inputs and outputs, as applied to the Hypercube inp=\r\nuts, \nas \n&gt; stated in the original attempted general characterization, were=\r\n of \n&gt; differing dimensionality.\n&gt; \n&gt;    I believe the jist of your other c=\r\nontemporaneous conversations \nis \n&gt; that additional a priori knowledge mayb=\r\ne interjected via the \n&gt; Hypercube inputs, since:\n&gt; \n&gt; (a) this additional =\r\ninformation is associated with the substrate \n&gt; input/output node, though n=\r\not expressly represented in same, and\n&gt; \n&gt; (b) this additional information =\r\nis segregated to either the &quot;from&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;to&quot; nodes associated with the cur=\r\nrent substrate link under \n&gt; consideration.\n&gt; \n&gt;    I am only attempting to=\r\n clarify the seemly more general \ncondition \n&gt; in which the additional &quot;inf=\r\normation&quot; associated with a substrate \n&gt; input node is of different content=\r\n and/or dimensionality than the \n&gt; additional &quot;information&quot; associated with=\r\n a substrate output node \n&gt; (i.e. apples and oranges, not just oranges and =\r\noranges).

You migh=\r\nt \nallow \n&gt; &gt; the hidden layer to express lateral connections, and you migh=\r\nt \n&gt; not.  \n&gt; &gt; You might have a 3D hidden layer or a 2D hidden layer.  You=\r\n \nmight \n&gt; &gt; embed everything in 3D, or you might map a 3D coordinate to a =\r\n\n2D, \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; a 2D or a 3D, etc..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In each case, the implications=\r\n are different about how \nproximities \n&gt; &gt; are incorporated or expressed.  =\r\nIn some cases it can be explicit \n&gt; &gt; within parts of the substrate; in som=\r\ne cases it is implicit.  \nFor \n&gt; &gt; example, if there is only a single outpu=\r\nt node and a 2D sheet of \n&gt; &gt; inputs, then the CPPN does not even need to t=\r\nake a target \nlocation \n&gt; &gt; as input, since there is only one target.  In t=\r\nhat case you just \n&gt; &gt; query for each input node what weight is coming out =\r\nof it.  In \nsuch \n&gt; &gt; a case, it is true that you do not explicitly provide=\r\n a \nproximity \n&gt; &gt; input to the CPPN; however proximity is still implicit w=\r\nithin \nthe \n&gt; &gt; representation since input nodes that are near each other a=\r\nre \nalso \n&gt; &gt; nearby in the function domain of the CPPN, that is, it can us=\r\ne \nthat \n&gt; &gt; nearness even though it is not explicitly provided as input.  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please let me know if I didn&#39;t answer adequately and I can try \nt=\r\no \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; more specific, but I might need more detail on the precise \nsc=\r\nenario \n&gt; &gt; you are considering.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    O=\r\nne troubling &quot;detail&quot; is that of differences in \n&gt; dimensionality \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\ntween substrate inputs and outputs. In the examples used in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; var=\r\nious papers, the dimensionality of the substrate input and \n&gt; &gt; output \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; nodes, as applied to the Hypercube inputs, were identical \n(i.e. \n&gt; &gt; x_=\r\nin, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; y_in, x_out, y_out). This simplifies the concept of distance. \nB=\r\nut \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem could just as easily have been: Do the two squar=\r\nes on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; visual field overlap?
