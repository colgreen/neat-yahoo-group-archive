One reason is to promote the work of\n&gt; those outside our own EPlex research group.  There is now a fair amount of\n&gt; significant work on HyperNEAT from outside EPlex and it is difficult for\n&gt; someone interested in HyperNEAT to find out about it from our own publications\n&gt; pages, which only features our own work.  Therefore, the HyperNEAT Users Page\n&gt; has a section called, &quot;HyperNEAT Projects and Publications from Outside\n&gt; EPlex,&quot; which features this outside work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you would like your work featured on this page please let me know and we\n&gt; will be happy to link it.  It does not have to be an official publication.\n&gt; Software, experiments, or informal documents are also welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another reason for the page is to have everything about HyperNEAT available in\n&gt; one place.  Before this page, there was no clear destination for people\n&gt; searching for &quot;hyperneat&quot; in search engines.  This page will help people find\n&gt; what they are looking for in an organized manner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, we hope the page makes it easier for newcomers to get started.  It\n&gt; has a brief introduction explaining the main concepts at a high level and some\n&gt; pictures that give the gist of the approach without having to read a whole\n&gt; research article.\n&gt; \n&gt; Comments are welcome,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
