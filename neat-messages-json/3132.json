Of course, the first time through, the recurrent \nlink has no influence (since the node behind it is initially inactive).\n\n&gt; So, even using your method, you have to decide how many times you\n&gt; would like to update the network, and that number will change the\n&gt; value of the output.\n\nNot really.  Using my method you only update it once, regardless.  Yes, \nthere are cases where it will treat recurrency slightly differently.  In \nmy admittedly trivial example network, though, I don&#39;t see any difference.\n\nAs Ken pointed out, it&#39;s just a different way of doing the update.  I \nlike it because it&#39;s very simple, and obviously faster than updating a \nnetwork multiple times.\n\nI do not come from the world of Academia, and hadn&#39;t realized, as Ken \nsaid, that the [update in arbitrary order until stable] update method \nwas more common.  My world is one of real-time interactivity (console \nvideo games), to give you an idea of my frame of mind.\n\nLet&#39;s assume we can poll a particular wireless controller device at \naround 50Hz, in hopes of recognizing some physical gestures.  You can \nsee then where doing a single update per sample is considerably more \nattractive.\n\n--Steve\n\n\n"}}
