My questions are:\n\n- to which extent is the ANJI implementation=\r\n compatible to NEAT ? At \nleast it implements an additional mutation for re=\r\nmoving connections. \nDoes this improve the (modeling) performance ? \n\n- ANJ=\r\nI seems to use online training - wouldn&#39;t batch training be \nadvantageous (=\r\nmostly to avoid local minima) ?\n\n- how does one implement the FS-NEAT versi=\r\non (which automatically \nselects inputs) in ANJI (or JNeat) ? Is there an i=\r\nmplementation \nalready available ?\n\nThanks,\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
