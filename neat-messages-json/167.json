I think it \nshould be kept reasonably simple, unless you want to go the whole hog so \nto speak :)  So for starters I would just use plain HTML and have a page \nof short descriptions for each of the domains, perhaps categorised by \nimplementation language. Then perhaps a more detailed page of \ndocumentation and stuff per domain..\n\nI&#39;m not sure how you will arrange file uploads. You may just want to \ngive out an email or ftp address that people can upload to and then you \ncan add the files to the site manually. Or were you thinking of \nsomething more dynamic, maybe allowing people to create there own area \non the web page and upload the file(s) and descriptions/documentation?  \nThis is more work and is going to require a server with support for \nsomething like ASP. Now, there are free web servers that allow ASP but \nwhen I last looked at this (a year ago) they were all ad-ware servers, \nwhich I personally dislike.\n\nIf you do get ASP support then another option is support for forums. I \nrecently set up some forums using a load of free ASP scripts and a \nsingle MS-Access database and it&#39;s actually very simple. By far the most \ndifficult stage was deciding which forum implementation to use :)\n\nI will perhaps scour the internet for suitable (and free) web servers \nwhen I get chance. Probably at the weekend.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
