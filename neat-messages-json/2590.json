I see you attached some code as \nwell so maybe I&#39;ll take a look at integrating this into the main \nproject, it should be easy enough. Oh personally I quite like having \nmore than one line on a graph where the two values are related somehow - \nit makes it easier to see how the values affect each other and/or how \nthey are related, e.g. # of species and compat. threshold, or \ncomlplexity and evals/sec. Having said that I see you have put those two \nparticular pairings in graphs that are vertically alligned, which makes \nit pretty easy to see actually.\n\nSome other stuff you may not have picked up on. There was some work to \nbreak the experiment code into seperate binaries and to attach them at \nrun time with a config file - which in itself may not be that \ninteresting to you, but there is also a mechanism for specifying \nexperimnent prameters such as data file paths within teh config file. I \ncan&#39;t remember if I got round to releasing this yet - anyway it might be \nuseful for you.\n\nOn a more forward looking note, I also started completely revising the \nwhole code base and re-writing it to make it far more flexible to code \nagainst (e.g. plug-inable genome representations and associated decoded \n&#39;phenome&#39; classes). This is heavily using templates (generics in \n.Net2/Java world) and was makign good progress, right up to the point I \ngot distracted :(\n\nRight now I&#39;m acquiring some stock market data (london stocks only) via \na http/website ripper/reader type program and I&#39;m feeling motivated by \nyour work into putting together my own simple analysis experiment using \nthe existing code base, so work on the new stuff will probably have to \nwait some more. Actually I&#39;ve already hacked together some very simple \nnon-NEAT parameter optimisation type experiments over stock data with \ninteresting results, and I have actually made a little money, which is \nthe main reason I got sidelined - and no I haven&#39;t been spending it on \nfast cars/women if that&#39;s what you were thinking ;)  This is little more \nthan traditional graphing/analysis but with some param optimisation \nthrown in, so there is much room for improvement. It&#39;s also based on \nanalysing shares that I&#39;d already hand picked as being undervalued, but \nI think that is a pretty sound strategy to be starting from (as is \nshorting overvalued shares).\n\nMy initial plan is to use both price and trade volume data. Although the \ntrade direction (buy vs sell) isn&#39;t officially available, most web \nfinancial web sites determine this in real time by comparing against the \ncurrent bid/offer spread, this can be horribly wrong some days but that \nin itself is a symptom of a specific situation where the spread is very \nnarrow. So I think there is useful info in this data even in this \nslightly corrupted form. Certainly I&#39;ve learned from my trading so far \nthat the price by itself is only a small part of the picture, especially \nwhere trading is through old fashioned market makers who set the price \nrather than the more modern automated SETS system - which system is in \nuse for agiven share is also going to be pretty important as well I think.\n\nThat&#39;s enough banter for now - this is all vaguely to do with NEAT, honest!\n\nColin.\n\nmikewoodhouse wrote:\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve uploaded a file showing the alternative ProgressForm I hacked\n&gt;together for use within SharpNEAT. The code is relatively trivial -\n&gt;I&#39;m scarcely pushing the ZedGraph control and there&#39;s almost no logic\n&gt;there, but the GIF might be slightly more interesting. I thought it\n&gt;was only fair for Colin to see what I&#39;ve done to his baby...\n&gt;\n&gt;Mike\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
