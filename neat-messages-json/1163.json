All the fundamental\n&gt;components are operational, and I&#39;ve kicked off a number of client processes\n&gt;to do the distributed fitness evaluation.  I&#39;ll let them run over the\n&gt;weekend (while I go play up in the mountains) and see if it makes any\n&gt;progress.  I anticipate some bugs to fix, but who knows, maybe I&#39;ve killed\n&gt;enough of them to let it limp along? :)\n\nGood!\n\n&gt; &gt;From: Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Could you use float throughout instead of double?  That would reduce memory\n&gt; &gt;bandwidth requirements...\n&gt;\n&gt;I could try it and see what kind of difference it makes.  But this is a\n&gt;mathematical model domain, not a controller, so the added accuracy may\n&gt;actually be beneficial in the long run.  For a controller domain, I&#39;d even\n&gt;consider using integers...\n\nFloat accuracy is about 6 sig figs, double is about 16 sig figs.\n\nYour image data looks like it&#39;s 16bit, whcih is 5 sig figs.\n\n&gt;The output node is a summation node.  No sigmoid.  For a reason:  The output\n&gt;ranges need to be able to be more than +/-1.  So when I was first doing it,\n&gt;there were no sigmoids.  The sigmoids appear later as hidden nodes are\n&gt;added.\n\nSurely you are normalizing your pixel values to a range of 0 - 1 or -1 to 1?\n\n&gt; &gt;(if I may blow the trumpet for my inv-abs activation function here, it\n&gt; &gt;should be more-stable w.r.t extreme numbers...)\n&gt;\n&gt;I know you&#39;ve posted that before, but would you send it again so I have it\n&gt;for easy reference? :)\n\n &gt;&gt;&gt;I was just playing with some equations, it&#39;s not easy to get the\n &gt;&gt;&gt;right properties.  But how about x/(n+abs(x))?  That&#39;s a sigmoid, \nsymmetric\n &gt;&gt;&gt;about zero, equal to +1 at +infinity and -1 at -infinity.  n controls the\n &gt;&gt;&gt;steepness and is equal to the x value where the curve reaches +0.5...\n\n\n&gt; &gt;Other than that, the inside of activate will be more significant than the\n&gt; &gt;detail of this loop.  Do you have an example of &quot;activate&quot; generated the\n&gt; &gt;way you (currently) plan, and using network data of about the expected size\n&gt; &gt;and connection density?\n&gt;\n&gt;Until the experiment gets well underway and the networks get larger, the\n&gt;activate functions are a bit small, but...\n&gt;\n&gt;run the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;wget http://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/get_sample.cgi -O fitness.c\n&gt;\n&gt;That will pretend to be a client, fetch a fitness evaluation source file,\n&gt;and save it as fitness.c.\n\nYeah, I&#39;ve looked at the file.  You&#39;re right, none of the functions are \ncomplex enough yet to really analyze for efficiency issues.\n\nI do have a big question though: where&#39;s the input data.  e.g. all the \nfunctions I&#39;ve seen so far only read left, right, top, bottom, none of them \nreference texels in the input image.  It could just be that none of them \nevolved to access a pixel yet, but I don&#39;t even see the data array in there.\n\ne.g. I expected something like:\n\nshort Input[9][9] = { ... };\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
