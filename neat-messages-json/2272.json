They used NEAT to evolve an eye that looks at \nonly \n&gt; &gt; parts of an image and zooms on on relevant features to make \n&gt; &gt; distinctions.  The eye actually decides where it wants to look, \nas \n&gt; &gt; opposed to directed scanning as you suggest, but the concept is \n&gt; &gt; similar.  The video is actually in the Files section of this \ngroup, \n&gt; &gt; called &quot;eye.swf.&quot;  Here is the full link:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \nhttp://f6.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/QFoiQ4hlWrnOq9A5E5Xs1IXAJvXaVNupa4hhQqv2\n&gt; &gt; udISn92F1PydEVJy1gKj2No6n-\n0oA7_ir95uFFOZbrG_1tOizxY_KIqSzu3K/eye.swf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;jeff@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This may be an off-the-wall suggestion but you could try, just \nfor \n&gt; &gt; kicks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approaching the OCR problem a little differently.  You could \nlook \n&gt; &gt; at one row\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or column as an input vector and step the network through \ncycles \n&gt; &gt; looking at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consecutive columns/rows.  Of course, this implies a greater \n&gt; &gt; network\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complexity, but it&#39;s a different approach if you&#39;re trying to \ncut \n&gt; &gt; down on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inputs...may be interesting anyhoo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now someone else can say why this is a crazy idea :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jeff\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, 09 Sep 2005 23:08:00 -0000, Carl Strange wrote\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I kicked around a few ideas for a project, many getting \nwildly \n&gt; &gt; out of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand, and settled on Braille character recognition.  It let \nme \n&gt; &gt; play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a bit of development while using your OCR experiment as \na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; framework.  I thought the reduced 7 X 5 input grid and very \n&gt; &gt; distinct\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; character set would be a snap for the network.  Now I know \n&gt; &gt; better. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thirty-five inputs and twenty-six outputs is too much for a \none-\n&gt; &gt; to-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one connected net so the problem isn&#39;t trivial.  I&#39;m having \nfun \n&gt; &gt; playing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the various search parameters, especially the frequency \n&gt; &gt; of &quot;add\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connections&quot; and &quot;add nodes&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The downside of adding an experiment is my SharpNEAT library \nand \n&gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Form1 initialization differ from the standard release.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lots to play with and I haven&#39;t even looked at the network \ncode.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
