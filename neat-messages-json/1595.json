They all h=\r\nave self similar fractal / chaotic features\nand I \n&gt; think it&#39;s fair to lum=\r\np them all into some sort of &#39;equivalence class&#39;. \n&gt; This only\n&gt; goes for f=\r\nrequently traded high liquidity stocks though. So I think \n&gt; rescaling the =\r\ndata so the y-axis goes from 0-&gt;1 is a fair thing to do. \n&gt; Especially\n&gt; wh=\r\nen you think that the actual y-axis on the graph on the web page is a \n&gt; pi=\r\nxel index in a picture which is always 500 pixels high or whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\nhave no idea wether any of this will actually work. If it does, then \n&gt; I&#39;m=\r\n in the money. If not, I will have learned a hell of a lot trying.\n&gt; I&#39;m cu=\r\nrrently impelementing my own C++ version of NEAT which is heavily \n&gt; based =\r\non Ken&#39;s C++ code, but removing all the redundant stuff like\n&gt; traits and r=\r\necurrence which won&#39;t be needed for what I&#39;m trying to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Emyr\n\n\nEmyr=\r\n,\n\nI have a few (!) thoughts on this, based partly on my own fiddlings\nand =\r\npartly on a lot of reading on the subject in the past. [deep\nbreath] Here g=\r\noes...\n\n* Consider using daily returns not prices, i.e. percentage price\nch=\r\nange up/down. It saves your network having to strip out the boring\npart of =\r\nthe price...\n\n* Confidence sounds like a smart place to be - in particular =\r\nwhen two\nsimilar input vectors might result in wildly different outcomes (a=\r\n\nmajor problem with backprop) - the network can simlpy say &quot;dunno&quot;\n\n* Why a=\r\nre you planning to discard recurrence? I can think of two uses\nOTTOMH, firs=\r\nt to extend the network&#39;s memory beyond the time series\nbeing presented, an=\r\nd second to facilitate the use of a single network\nfor each stock: the recu=\r\nrrent connections may store propoerties\nparticular to the stock in question=\r\n.\n\n* Fitness function: profit? return on capital invested? volatility?\nShar=\r\npe Ratio? Be sure to factor in trading costs (execution fees,\nstamp duties,=\r\n margin/funding costs if using CFDs) as they can kill\nmodels that evolve to=\r\n &quot;scalp&quot; (sell on an uptick), which some of the\nbig boys can afford to do b=\r\necause of the cheapness of individual\ntransactions compared to the rest of =\r\nus.\n\n* Outputs - consider something like \n-1.0 .. -0.8\topen short position\n=\r\n-0.8 .. -0.5\tstay short\n-0.5 .. -0.3\tcover short\n-0.3 .. +0.3\tnothing to do=\r\n\n+0.3 .. +0.5\tclose long\n+0.5 .. +0.8\tstay long\n+0.8 .. +1.0\topen long posi=\r\ntion\nYou probably need to stare long and hard at the shape of your output\na=\r\nctivation function to get a feel for the exact values.\n\n* Go Short? Well, y=\r\nou can if you trade with CFDs (Contracts For\nDifference) rather than actual=\r\n shares. IIRC correctly, you can go long\nwithout paying Stamp Duty as well.=\r\n..\n\n* Efficient Market Hypothesis says all available information is in the\n=\r\nprice. Well, it may get there eventually but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s\ninstantan=\r\neous! Therefore it could be useful to provide information\noutside of the st=\r\nock price. Some possibilities:\n- Days (or fraction of the normal period) si=\r\nnce (or to) announcements\nof results\n- Stock index levels FTSE-100/250/350,=\r\n industry index for the stock\n- Interest base rate (and fraction of a month=\r\n till the next MPC meeting?)\n- House Price Index\n- Fraction of 5 years unti=\r\nl latest possible General Election date\n- The price of gold\n- Dividend yiel=\r\nd of the stock, sector, market\n- P/E ratio of the stock, sector, market\n- E=\r\nPS\n- Other more or less technical indicators: Price/Sales Ratio? Dividend\nC=\r\nover?\n- FX rates: GBP vs USD/EUR/JPY\n- Forward interest rate\n- Futures pric=\r\nes\n- Implied volatility of one or more options\n- Corporate Actions (dividen=\r\nd announcements, ex-dividend dates, split\nannouncements, warrant exercise d=\r\nates, rights issues, stuff like that)\n\n* Oh, Dividends. Remember that share=\r\n prices fall by the dividend\namount on the ex-div date (or by approximately=\r\n the present value\nthereof but near as dammit). So you&#39;ll either need to fa=\r\nctor dividends\nback into the price (not recommended, they&#39;re a realised one=\r\n, whereas\nin the price they&#39;re unrealised and rather less liquid) or (a) ad=\r\nd the\ndividend amount to your P&L and tell your network that the price drop=\r\n\nis OK, either by flagging the data on the date on an extra input or\nmore p=\r\nragmatically just dropping the day from your input data set.\n\nI believe tha=\r\nt there are companies using AI techniques in the markets,\nD E Shaw is one t=\r\nhat comes to mind, and there are/were a group in what\nis now part of UBS (w=\r\nas Swiss Bank, was O&#39;Brien(?)) that were in Santa\nFe, as described in The P=\r\nredictors\n(http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805057560/qid=3D109604=\r\n3006/sr=3D1-4/=3D\r\nref=3Dsr_1_8_4/026-2598516-4309207\n- recommended at a used price of =A32.2=\r\n5!).\n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
