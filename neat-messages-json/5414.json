However, it might also cause search to focu=\r\ns more on more promising areas, so it&#39;s a trade-off.  There isn&#39;t generally=\r\n one setup that is best for all problems.\n\nNote that in some versions of NE=\r\nAT there is something called a &quot;species dropoff age,&quot; which will cause a sp=\r\necies to be penalized if it has not improved in some number of generations =\r\n(the dropoff age).  That can help to eliminate those who are stuck.\n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chris Garrett&quot; &lt;garrerc@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actual=\r\nly, won&#39;t squaring the fitness increase the probability of a species that&#39;s=\r\n stuck in a local maximum being chosen over others?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;Chris Garrett&quot; &lt;garrerc@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the tips=\r\n!
