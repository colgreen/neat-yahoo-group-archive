You can learn about it here:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications=\r\n/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html\n\nWe also released a version of it that comes w=\r\nith its own multiagent simulator:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/software.html#mu=\r\nltiagentSim\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_ch=\r\nervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Sina, \n&gt; \n&gt; You can try a coevolutionary approa=\r\nch in which multiple populations compete or cooperate with each other. For =\r\nthis just regular NEAT is apropriate and in my opinion it should work fine.=\r\n Another possibility is to use real-time NEAT like in the NERO game. You ca=\r\nn still try HyperNEAT, but the CPPN to substrate mapping should be designed=\r\n such that every individual has his own coordinate frame, and if you want y=\r\nour agents to be learning in real-time, you can also have the CPPN output y=\r\nour learning coefficients just like the weights.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, Sina Iravanian &lt;sina_iravanian@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi =\r\nall,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to use NEAT for learning coordination in a multi-agent=\r\n system.\n&gt; &gt; But the agents in the system must be learning independently, i=\r\n.e., they cannot communicate and a centralized controller cannot be used. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would be grateful if anyone could introduce some previous work, =\r\nor publications which use NEAT (or any of its variants) in the same setting=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many thanks in advance,\n&gt; &gt; Sina\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
