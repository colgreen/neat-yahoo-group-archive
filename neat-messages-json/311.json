(Where right means that the outputs that\n&gt; should be 1 are above\n&gt; .0.5 and the ones that should be 0 are below) \n\nI&#39;ve done a couple dozen runs this evening, with\ndifferent parameters, and it looks like it&#39;s solving\nXOR on average between 10 and 20 generations.\n\nOn the graph I posted in the Photos section, it seems\nto have &quot;solved&quot; XOR around the 20th generation, but I\nhad the mutation rates pretty low on that run.   With\nthe topology mutation rates at the standard 0.03\nconnection mutation and 0.01 neuron mutation, it seems\nto solve for XOR pretty consistently within 10 or 12\ngenerations.\n\n&gt; And\n&gt; what size population\n&gt; are you using?\n\nThat is listed at the top of the graph, along with\nmost of the major parameters: 100.\n\n&gt; Mattias had some interesting results from trying\n&gt; different sigmoid\n&gt; functions with his system on XOR.  He found it could\n&gt; make a big\n&gt; impact.  If you feel performance could improve, it\n&gt; may be worth\n&gt; experimenting with activation functions a bit. \n\nI would be interested in hearing from Mattias...\n\nSo far we&#39;ve tried both the standard sigmoid and\nhyperbolic tangent.  Tanh actually seems to perform\nslightly better, but both of them are solving for XOR\nearly and consistently.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
