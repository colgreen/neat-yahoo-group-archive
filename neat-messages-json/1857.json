Where\n&gt; would the inputs be coming from?  Aren&#39;t colors determined at the\n&gt; outputs and not the inputs?  \n\nThe inputs tell the NN which color the output will be interpreted as. I \nchanged it around so that I used three input nodes, r g and b. r was set \nwhen I was calculating the red intensity. g was set when I was \ncalculating the green intensity etc. For each intesity, I flushed the \nnetwork and calculated the output. Three such outputs were used to \ngenerate the finaly pixel color.\n\nIt sorta worked, but it became prohibitively slow, since it requires \nmore than three times as much work as the bw version (more than three \ntimes because there are three extra input nodes for each network).\n\nBut the pictures looked far better than the previous color pictures that \nI generated.\n \n&gt; This is unrelated but you mentioned before the problem with RGB being\n&gt; virtually separate pitures on top of each other, but have you tried\n&gt; starting out with all 3 outputs fully connected to each other?  That\n&gt; way they would have some evolvable influence over each other from the\n&gt; start.\n\nYep, I tried that, didn&#39;t work much better, but that was a while back. I \nmight have needed some more iterations for the color outputs to \nstabilize a bit more.\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n\n"}}
