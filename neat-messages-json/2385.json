And if the \ndescendant is not allowed to have a recurrent connection (required to be \nfeed forward), then once the new graph is generated from merging the \nparents, a method on the graph, isRecurrent(), will indicate if any \nconnection ended up being recurrent from the definition.  If so, then a \nquick iteration through the connections to discover which ones are \nrecurrent, and then dropping them will return the network to feed \nforward only.  Or at least it is (very close) to that simple with Semiann.\n\n\nFurther Detail: Within Semiann, that condition gets handled because the \nnode firing order is deterministic.  As such, one of the two crossover \nconnections would be designated as &quot;recurrent&quot; (the directed link which \nwent from a higher node activation priority to a lower node activation \npriority).  This is also the case in self-connections, i.e. they are \nmarked as recurrent.  Stated in the positive, a connection is marked \nrecurrent if the &quot;from&quot; node activation priority is greater than or \nequal to the &quot;to&quot; node activation priority.  And &quot;equal&quot; is required due \nto the possibility of a self-connection.\n\nGraph definition:\n  a.  A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D\n\n  b.  A -&gt; B&#39;-&gt; C&#39;-&gt; D\n\n  c.  C -&gt; B&#39;\n\n  d.  C&#39;-&gt; B\n\nNode Activation Order (constraint: node activation priorities within the \nsame graph definition must be unique):\n  A=1, B=2, B&#39;=3, C=4, C&#39;=5, D=6\n\nThis means that when defining the graph for the &quot;combined descendant&quot;, \nthe Node Activation Order will still result in a unique and \ndeterministic firing order.\n\nThis would mean the connections listed in c and d would be marked \nrecurrent.  And all the following possible connection additions would \nalso be marked recurrent:\n\n  e.  B&#39;-&gt; B&#39; (self)\n\n  f.  C -&gt; C&#39; (self)\n\n  g.  D -&gt; C  (backwards)\n\n  h.  D -&gt; C&#39;  (backwards)\n\n  i.  D -&gt; B   (backwards)\n\n  etc.\n\nLet me know if I have not been sufficiently clear.  It&#39;s late and I am \nflying through this explanation.\n\n\nJim\n\n\nIan Badcoe wrote:\n\n&gt; At 22:05 02/11/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Ian Badcoe wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A-ha, you mean if I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A-&gt; B&#39; -&gt;C&#39; -&gt;D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Then it won&#39;t let me connect C&#39; to B?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yes I was thinking about this also [Actually I did a superior\n&gt; &gt;analysis... I used pencil and paper instead of napkins ;) ]. Does it\n&gt; &gt;matter I wonder? I suppose if e.g. some neuron is acting as a feature\n&gt; &gt;detector but we can&#39;t re-use its output in some neurons just because\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s depth value is too high, then that does sound quite limiting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s right, but I thought I had a scheme which sorted this, give me\n&gt; &gt; &gt;a while to think it through....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My instinct here is that any such technique will tend towards a time\n&gt; &gt;complexity similar to the algorithm that just searches for\n&gt; &gt;recursiveness. I&#39;ll be glad to be proved wrong though.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you may be right there.  Although I&#39;ll outline a reasonably\n&gt; efficient approach in a moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I got my wires crossed with &quot;teleology problem&quot;.  e.g. I had\n&gt; a mental note that depth counting would prevent recurrence and I\n&gt; unconsciously translated that into &quot;depth counting detects\n&gt; recurrence&quot; which is does and &quot;depth counting does not detect\n&gt; non-recurrence&quot;, which of course it doesn&#39;t ... :)\n&gt;\n&gt; One cheap way to handle this might be to keep a bit-array on each\n&gt; node.  Each node owns a unique bit in that array (2 ^ innovation, if\n&gt; you like).  Now you can proceed as with the counting, only you are\n&gt; ORing in the bits.  So, nodes adjoining the input layer (I&#39;m skipping\n&gt; the inputs themselves as I assume you already avoid recurrent\n&gt; connections to them) have just their own bit set.  Other nodes have\n&gt; all the bits that are set in their children, plus their own bit set.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is quite efficient because:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) you detect recurrence when, if you are adding a connection, the\n&gt; source has the destination&#39;s bit set.  This means that the\n&gt; destination already exists upstream of the source.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) when you add a connection you just have to merge the source&#39;s bits\n&gt; into the destination.  Only when that leads to a change in the\n&gt; destination&#39;s bits do you need to recursively propagate those changes\n&gt; through its downstream connections.  And merging is just an OR\n&gt; operation, and ORing on an unsigned long will do 32 at once....\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) it gets a little more expensive if you delete a connection, you\n&gt; have to tear-down the destination&#39;s current bit array and rebuilt if\n&gt; from all children, but even that&#39;s not so expensive and 66.66% of all\n&gt; NEAT implementations don&#39;t delete connections anyway.\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; All that said, to go back to my failed example:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;A-&gt; B&#39; -&gt;C&#39; -&gt;D\n&gt;\n&gt; Where the original scheme couldn&#39;t connect C to B&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; What happens now when individual 1 has just connected C to B&#39; and\n&gt; individual 2 has just connected C&#39; to B and they try to breed?\n&gt;\n&gt;          Ian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;            \n&gt; ___________________________________________________________\n&gt; How much free photo storage do you get?
