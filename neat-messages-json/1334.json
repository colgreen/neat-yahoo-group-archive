I suppose it depends on how you set up the roving eye, I was\n&gt;&gt;thinking that the network would have something like two (x and y)\n&gt;&gt;outputs for the coordinates the eye should be looking at, the experiment\n&gt;&gt;code then supplies the appropriate image to the eye&#39;s sensor inputs.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s where the complexity comes in, with the size of the eye. \n&gt;[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;If you scale up the size of the sensor area for the eye, you are\n&gt;exponentially increasing the size of the network needed.  A 3x3 eye\n&gt;needs 9 sensor nodes, but a 5x5 needs 25, and so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAhh yes of course...\n\n&gt;It almost sounds as if you were assuming that the eye would only be\n&gt;looking at a single pixel, or only receiving one sensory input value,\n&gt;each time step.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo I just wasn&#39;t thinking straight.\n\nThere is a pay off here, smaller eyes require less complexity but then \nyou are putting more faith in the ability to recognise a character (or \ngeometric shape, etc) by roving.  In fact this is a fundamentally \ndifferent technique to the frame and recognise technique I described in \nthe last email. I understand though that the roving eye technique is \nmore scalable, so I think it would be interesting to compare the two \ntechniques on a range of different tasks.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
