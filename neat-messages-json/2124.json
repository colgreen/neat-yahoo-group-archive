Now if we could exploit the\n&gt; &gt;translation and rotation of _parts_ of the Go board...\n\n&gt;I suppose you could use this technique (does it have a concise\n&gt;mathematical term?)\n\nOnly in as much as it&#39;s probably a form of &quot;normalization&quot;.\n\nIn CS terms its sort-of hashing...\n\n&gt;  to the input from a roving eye, thus removing the\n&gt;need for an ANN to drive the rotation of the eye itself. This does then\n&gt;mean that the eye is must analyse what it sees in isolation of what it\n&gt;just saw - e.g. normally it might detect patterns larger than the eye\n&gt;itself by sweeping over an area, but if we rotate the inputs then we\n&gt;break this kind of approach... unless we inform the eye of what rotation\n&gt;it is currently in. Has any of the people doing roving eye experiments\n&gt;used this approach of factoring out rotational invariance?\n\nYou could do that, but you run into a difficulty in that roving-eyes are \ngenerally recurrent and want to remember what they saw a moment ago.  So \nthe normalization makes the job of the network in _this_ frame easier, but \ntransfers the problem to the point where it needs to match-up data \npreserved from the previous frame.\n\nNow, if the data from the previous frame were still formatted like the \nboard layout, then we could cache the transformation from that frame and \ncombine it with the current one to bring it into line...\n\n&gt; &gt;OK, lets look at a 2x2 board.  There are four cells, which we can label\n&gt; &gt;with letters:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Ok yeh, thanks for explanation. This definitely sounds familair, perhaps\n&gt;you mentioned this in previous discussions. I definitely sounds like a\n&gt;superior approach to mine - that of playing opponents at all rotations -\n&gt;and I suspect it will definitely produce better players if I just switch\n&gt;my dominace chain experiment to this. The network&#39;s don&#39;t have to cover\n&gt;the same strategies from different rotations (which they see as\n&gt;different strategies) so the networks can perform better with less\n&gt;complexity, which in turn makes for faster evolution. And far fewer\n&gt;games are requried per evaluation, which speeds things up again. We are\n&gt;artificially helping NEAT along here a little, ideally NEAT would evolve\n&gt;a sub-network to do this work itself, but it still makes for an\n&gt;interesting experiment and the technique is potentially applicable to\n&gt;many other domains. It&#39;s certainly one to keep in teh ole tool belt :)\n\nIdeally... yes, but I still say we need some cleverer take on modularity \nand/or indirect encodings before we can expect to grow a network that \nexploits symmetry in that way.\n\nActually I am toying with a system that might bring some simple indirect \nencodings into TTT, but for the moment I left the symmetry out and will \nprobably &quot;normalize&quot; before presenting the boards.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I bet I can get there before you... 2mins :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The milestone for delivery of the future has been put back again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;hmm, I think you missed it. It&#39;s been and gone already.\n\nI _missed_ the future?  But I was waiting for years!\n\nIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
