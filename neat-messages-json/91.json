This is a major shift from the NE \n&gt; techniques I have seen to date.\n&gt; \n\nThis is a very interesting issue.  I am not sure though whether \nfunctionality cannot be encoded in a self-organizing system.  It&#39;s a \nreally good question.  Does anyone have thoughts on this?  It seems \nthat a self-organizing system that produces repeating patterns can \nencapsulate functionality within those patterns, although this might \nbe more difficult than having it learn the functionality through \nfurther experience.\n\nParadoxically, learning itself is a functionality which requires \nsome kind of initial pattern (perhaps a pattenr of learning rules), \nbut it may be a simpler initial pattern, and so easier to self-\norganize.  There has been a fair amount of work on evolving adaptive \nneural networks that can adapt their functionality during their \nlifetime.  For example, see our paper, &quot;Evolving Adaptive Neural \nNetworks with and without Adaptive Synapses&quot;:\n\nhttp://steam.csres.utexas.edu/nn/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY\n(Pubs=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=131\n\n(sorry that yahoo seems to screw up these urls...it should all be \none string..you can also find it on my homepage or the NEAT Users \npage)\n\nAnyway, ultimately there may be an important union between adaptive \nneuroevolution and self-organization in indirect encoding.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
