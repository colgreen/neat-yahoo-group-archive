If you have the core algorithm \nrunning then that should be enough, implemeting all of the details might \nimprove the efficiency of some searches(it may take less generations to \nfind a solution), but generally speaking it won&#39;t greatly effect the \nability to find a solution overall.\n\nRegarding the cat & mouse domain, again I agree with Derek&#39;s comment&#39;s \non the fitness gradient probably being too steep. This is a variation on \nthe prey capture experiment in the paper &quot;Incremental Evolution Of \nComplex General Behavior (1997)&quot;, which can be found at (beware of URL \nwrapping):\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=35\n\nIn that domain there is no maze, just a bounded grid space, but there is \na limited sensor range. Therefore if the prey goes out of sensor range \nthen the agent must use memory in order to move in the correct \ndirection. The paper describes how this was too big a problem to solve \ndirectly. Instead, an agent is evolved on progressively more difficult \ntasks whereby the prey is given an increasing number of &#39;head start&#39; \nmoves, thus allowing it to move out of sensor range before the agent is \nallowed to move. To further increase the difficulty the prey&#39;s speed is \nincreased from stationary up to a maximum of 1 move per timestep, which \nis the same as the agent&#39;s speed. The prey moves stochastically, so a \nspeed of 0.5 means that it has a 50% chance of moving in a given timestep.\n\nThe paper in question didn&#39;t use NEAT but I have implemented it in \nSharpNEAT and it works very well, although I have never evolved a \nperfect network. Typically the best that I have achieved after some \ntweaking of the evaluation function has been a 1/1000 fail rate, which \nis pretty good really.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
