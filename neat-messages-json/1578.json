If you gift your TWEAN with a range of\n&gt;&gt;activation functions then the lines between the two domains become even\n&gt;&gt;more blurred. From the posts so far I take it that GP&#39;s evolve tree\n&gt;&gt;structures, whereas neural nets tend to have, well,  interconnected\n&gt;&gt;networks of nodes. But are the two approaches really that different?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;They&#39;re not _all_ that different, but there&#39;s some differences of history, \n&gt;attitude etc etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;I would not say it was true that TWEANs are a subset of GP, I would say \n&gt;that TWEANs are analogous to a subset of GP.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk so I wasn&#39;t that far off the mark. As discussed on the list recently, \none possible direction I will be taking SharpNEAT is to introduce a few \nmore possible activation functions - multiplication being one. So I \nreally think this blurs the lines between GP and TWEANs somewhat.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
