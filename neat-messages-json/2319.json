I&#39;ve been\n&gt;traveling and unable to follow the group for a while.\n&gt;\n&gt;There is a clear answer to the &quot;who to kill&quot; question in the\n&gt;continuous case: Kill the individual in the population with the\n&gt;worst adjusted fitness.  Adjusted fitnesses should always be kept up\n&gt;to date, which means after every replacement they should be\n&gt;recalculated for the affected species.   Adjusted fitness means your\n&gt;fitness after fitness sharing has been taken into account.\n\nHi,\n\nHmm, I think I must have misunderstood &quot;adjusted fitness&quot;...\n\nI thought it was:\n\n         SpeciesMaxFitness / NumInSpecies\n\nWhich is only defined for the whole species, not each individual.\n\nOf course, one could just use the individual fitness over the number \nin the species...\n\n...but I wonder if I&#39;ve missed the point somewhere.\n\n&gt;Ian, it&#39;s true we faced this problem with rtNEAT and NERO.  And we\n&gt;tried several schemes.  Empirically, killing the adjusted loser\n&gt;works best.  But it also makes sense logically, because fitness\n&gt;sharing is supposed to *protect* the less competitive species, and\n&gt;you would be defeating that purpose if you killed off the absolute\n&gt;worst individual.  What if every time a new individual is born with\n&gt;new structure, it tends to suck?  Then you will keep killing off the\n&gt;innovative structures.  And that&#39;s what fitness sharing is supposed\n&gt;to protect, but it can&#39;t if you kill off the individual with\n&gt;absolute worst fitness.  So you kill the one with the worst adjusted\n&gt;fitness, and the dynamics fall back to regular NEAT.\n&gt;\n&gt;Making NEAT continuous actually has a fair number of similar hairy\n&gt;issues, including how to use a dynamic compatibility threshold and\n&gt;how to appropriately choose the next parent species.\n\nThe threshold is my next task, the species I did yesterday.  I have \nacted upon my misgivings about absolute differences in an arbitrary \nfitness scale, so I&#39;m doing it like this:\n\n1 - rank species by increasing fitness\n2 - calculate the triangular number for the number of species: Trig = \nN * (N + 1) / 2\n3 - assign each species offspring proportional to:\n\n         RankPosition / Trig\n\nActually, the only purpose of Trig is that it normalises the values \ninto probabilities, without me needing to do a sum over all species....\n\nSo, if you have two species, the better one gets 2/3 of the \noffspring.  If you have three, the best gets 1/2, the next 1/3 and \nthe last 1/6...\n\n&gt;   The ultimate\n&gt;goal is to approximate the dynamics of original NEAT.  Our papers on\n&gt;NERO address the step by step &quot;rtNEAT&quot; process (rtNEAT is the name I\n&gt;gave to what you&#39;re calling continuous NEAT) in explicit detail, so\n&gt;you may refer to them for guidance.  For example, see:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:utcstr-04-312\n&gt;\n&gt;Note that this tech report should soon be replaced by a superior\n&gt;journal article which is currently in publication.  But the tech\n&gt;report does a good job of laying out the details in any case.\n\nA-ha, I thought I&#39;d lloked at all your docs, but maybe this one is \nnew since I last looked (it was a couple of months ago).\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
