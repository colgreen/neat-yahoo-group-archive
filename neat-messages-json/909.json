Because my ultimate goal is a \ndistributed NEAT that may take months to get anywhere... :(\n\nThose of you with an existing NEAT implementation could probably convert it \nfor use in this manner in about a half-hour, huh?  :)  And if you are \nwilling to save me the effort, I wouldn&#39;t complain...\n\nOtherwise, I&#39;ll probably build it in Perl, since that&#39;s the language I&#39;m the \nmost proficient in.  (YANI...yet another neat implementation.  :-) )  Before \nI begin, would any of you like to give me some tips or suggestions?  Some \ndesign suggestions that you perhaps wish you had thought of before you \nstarted?  Anything?  Thanks!\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
