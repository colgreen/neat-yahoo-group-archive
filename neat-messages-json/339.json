IF you\ncreate a perfect TTT player and use it as a model,\nthen you should be able to evolve ANNs that\nre-recreate that behaviour.  OTOH, you may be able to\nsucceed without any model, by basing evolution on\nsuccess in a tournament of some kind.  If you succeed\nwith this approach you will have accomplished\nsomething significant, because TTT has not previously\nbeen solved this way, at least not to the point of\nevolving a perfect player of the game.  If you choose\nthis path you want to make sure that the machine is\nnot programmed with any strategy knowledge whatsoever.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
