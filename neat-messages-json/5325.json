Simulated agents are robots with rangefinder sensor=\r\ns.  The GUI allows operations such as picking up a robot and moving it in t=\r\nhe middle of testing, or placing a new wall.  \n\nOur hope is that this packa=\r\nge makes multiagent HyperNEAT, which is described most recently in the foll=\r\nowing paper, more accessible to those interested:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/=\r\npapers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf\n\nIt should also be possible to test other meth=\r\nods in the same simulator.  The lightweight design of the simulator is well=\r\n-suited to evolutionary and learning experiments in which many training tri=\r\nals must be run faster than real-time.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
