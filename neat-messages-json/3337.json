It&#39;s primary target=\r\n is to examine \nwhat \n&gt; are the benefits of using geometry for dynamic cont=\r\nrol problems. \n&gt; Use &quot;F&quot; to switch between fast and normal mode. Use &quot;C&quot; to=\r\n switch \n&gt; between CPPN network and substrate views. If you close a window,=\r\n it \n&gt; will not open anymore. You need Visual Studio 2005 to compile, but \n=\r\nit \n&gt; is compatible with other versions, I guess. You have to copy the .H \n=\r\n&gt; files to your compiler&#39;s include directory.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can access thi=\r\ns file at the URL:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/Neuro%20Evo=\r\nlving%\n20Virtual%\n&gt; 20Humans.zip \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To learn more about file sharing=\r\n for your group, please visit:\n&gt; &gt; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/fil=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
