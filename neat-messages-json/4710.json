While\nimpr=\r\nessive results have been achieved with this methodology, and it is\narguably=\r\n the best suited to human engineers, it neglects numerous\nsituations in whi=\r\nch, for instance, a minor change in mechanics can\nsubstantially simplify so=\r\nftware and/or electronics. Conversely,\nevolution allows living organisms to=\r\n take full advantage of interactions\nacross levels, because it provides a a=\r\nutomatic and integrated design\nprocess that relies only on the effectivenes=\r\ns of its results as a whole.\n\nLoosely inspired by nature, Evolutionary Algo=\r\nrithms (EAs) now provide\nmature optimization tools that have successfully b=\r\neen applied to the\ndesign of many artifacts, from antennas to complete robo=\r\nts. In robotics,\nit has culminated in the Evolutionary Robotics research fi=\r\neld. Modular\nrobotics, swarm robotics or any robot with non-conventional me=\r\nchanics\n(high redundancy, dynamic motion, multi-modality) are challenging\nr=\r\nobotics applications for which such an integrated approach could prove\nusef=\r\nul.\n\nThe workshop will present the most recent fundamental developments of\n=\r\nER, including some not yet transferred to real robotics applications. It\nal=\r\nso aims at facilitating discussions on ER applications between\nresearchers =\r\nof the field and potential users.
