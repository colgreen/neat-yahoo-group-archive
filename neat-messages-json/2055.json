States 2 and 4 are in radians, which means they&#39;re\nbetween -PI and PI (unless I&#39;m reading the code wrong).  So dividing\nby 0.52 yields approximately -6 ... 6.  And state 0 ranges from\n-trackLength/2 to trackLength/2, so it&#39;s scaled to -0.5 ... 0.5.  None\nof this keeps the net from solving the problem, but they seem odd choices.\n\nAnother difference I noticed between Markovian and non-Markovian\ndouble pole balancing is that one had a bias of 1.0, the other 0.5. \nAny reason for that?\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n\n\n"}}
