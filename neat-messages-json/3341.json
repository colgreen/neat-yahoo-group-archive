Like others, I&#39;d love \nto see=\r\n examples of what you describe in some kind of video!  Perhaps \nyou can upl=\r\noad it to YouTube :)  \n\nThe idea that the HyperNEAT-evolved solution looks =\r\nmore &quot;natural&quot; is \nvery interesting, as is your chosen substrate configurat=\r\nion and how \nit gives the system an opportunity to utilize the body geometr=\r\ny.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervens=\r\nki@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello there, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am using the following CPPN model f=\r\nor the substrate: \n&gt; \n&gt; Inputs: X1, Y1, X2, Y2, BIAS\n&gt; Outputs: Weight, Nod=\r\ne-Bias, Node-Time_Constant\n&gt; \n&gt; The time constant range is [0.5 .. 5.0] and=\r\n the weight/node-bias \nrange \n&gt; within the substrate in [-8.0 .. 8.0]. \n&gt; T=\r\nhe weight range in the CPPN is unbounded. \n&gt; \n&gt; The node-specific outputs a=\r\nre computed using (X1, Y1, BIAS) and \nthe \n&gt; others set to 0.\n&gt; \n&gt; The acti=\r\nvation functions used are plain sigmoid, gaussian, and \nsine. \n&gt; The CTRNN =\r\nsubstrate activates with 0.02 timestep and it is used to \n&gt; control a 3D hu=\r\nmanoid model, simulated in a physical environment \n(using \n&gt; Open Dynamics =\r\nEngine http://www.ode.org ). \n&gt; \n&gt; The thing I notice, is the following: \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The first networks are simple, and so the connective patterns are. \nBut=\r\n \n&gt; the node biases and time constants are also simple. When I watch \nan \n&gt;=\r\n animaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it looks \nlike it \n&gt;=\r\n exibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be described as a \nmexican \n=\r\n&gt; wave travelling across the hidden nodes. \n&gt; As the CPPNs complexify, so d=\r\no the activity patterns exibited. \nWhen \n&gt; using regular NEAT for the probl=\r\nem of keeping the humanoid model \n&gt; balanced, it has moslty erratic behavio=\r\nur, and the lucky ones \n(with \n&gt; high fitness) usually find a way to trick =\r\nthe system and stay in a \n&gt; balanced position forever, without moving at al=\r\nl. \n&gt; But when HyperNEAT is used for this, it looks really interesting \nand=\r\n.. \n&gt; natural! The model is trying to balance using its arms, and it is \n&gt; =\r\nmoving.. It looks like a drunk guy, but you note the difference. \n&gt; I&#39;ve ar=\r\nranged the nodes in a geometric way.. Let me explain - the \nleft \n&gt; and rig=\r\nht arm&#39;s outputs are separated in the left and right in the \n&gt; substrate sp=\r\nace, and close to each other. So do the legs. The \nhidden \n&gt; nodes are in t=\r\nhe center in a star/cirlular shape. I also included \n3 \n&gt; inputs (head velo=\r\ncity) in the center around 0.0, but with smaller \n&gt; radius than the ring of=\r\n hidden nodes. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
