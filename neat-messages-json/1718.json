I have a bio-science background, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I read the first 1/3 of an introductory text a few months ago, as a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;refresher...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What was the text? Any good?\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Seemed OK, it is a very basic intro:\n&gt;\n&gt;         &quot;Development&quot;\n&gt;         Edited by Brian Goodwin\n&gt;         Published by Hodder and Stoughton/The Open University\n&gt;         ISBN 0-340-53190-8\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s from 1991 and the OU tend to update their course-texts pretty often, \n&gt;so there&#39;s probably a newer one by now...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s available through a 3rd party on amazon, and still looks like the \n1991 ed. But at �8 after P&P that sounds just right for something I can \ndip into. There&#39;s another more recent hefty tome that is �37 which looks \nlike the *the* book to read on the subject. Long term that would be a \ngood book to read prior to doing any indirect encoding investigations, \nso I&#39;ll give it a miss for now.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I just came across this:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons\n&gt;&gt;(Computational Neuroscience), Chistoff Koch*\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n[...]\n\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s interesting.  Of course, the biophysics of the nerve-cell is a very \n&gt;different approach to take from the developmental biology of nerve \n&gt;growth.  Sort of like the difference between taking a VCR apart or spying \n&gt;on the factory it comes from....\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI expect both subjects will shed some light on how neurons function. The \nbiophysics tells us what neurons are capable of, and the developmental \nstuff tells us the different types of neuron arrangements that occur. No \ndoubt there is considerable crossover between the two subjects.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
