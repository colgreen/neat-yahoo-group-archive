It raises the question of how bilateral sym=\r\nmetry arose in biological organisms.\n\nI have no link to literature or any k=\r\nind of evidence, but with regard to this paper I was wondering what kind of=\r\n creatures would emerge if you would start with an organism that has spheri=\r\ncal symmetry (as far as you can represent spherical symmetry with voxels ;)=\r\n) encoded through a CPPN. This ancestor organism would be something like a =\r\nunicellular organism in nature. Starting with a CPPN of such an organism wo=\r\nuld mean that radial and bilateral symmetry is in actual fact a departure f=\r\nrom spherical symmetry. And I suspect that from this starting position bila=\r\nteral symmetry should be easier to reach (and it is maybe biologically more=\r\n plausible!?).\n\n@Jeff: can you try that for us? :-)\n\nFrom this perspective,=\r\n complexification (or diversification) would mean breaking the symmetry  ra=\r\nther than approaching it, which seems to me more natural. But as I said, I =\r\nam not familiar with the literature in this area.\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
