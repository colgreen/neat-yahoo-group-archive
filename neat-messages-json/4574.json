By commercial opportunities, do you mean in the domain of real\n&gt; (not simulated) legged robots?\n\nYes. I&#39;m just thinking broadly of the commercial viability of a cheap\nleg based locomotion controller. Wheels are of course really good for\nmany situations in the modern world, but legs still win in all but the\nmost artificial (roads and level floors) situations. I expect there\nare military and commercial applications for small to large scale\nlegged vehicles for carrying payloads e.g. up a mountain/hillside,\nthrough boggy land, stuff like that. I just see it as an area with a\nlarge short term commercial potential in comparison to some of the\nother typical EC problem domains we all know and love.\n\n&gt; Do you know of any robots that can be bought and have a high-fidelity\n&gt; simulator (preferably in ODE)?\n\nSorry no.\n\n\n&gt; For the experiments in the paper, the period was a global experiment\n&gt; variable. I did try to evolve the period once and it did not really work.\n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what I did and maybe you&#39;ll have an idea as to what went\n&gt; wrong.\n\nI&#39;m not getting any clear thoughts on why the period would evolve to\nbe so slow. The only suggestion I have is that maybe the CPPNs weren&#39;t\nable to effectively coevolve these two disparate features - a gait\ncontroller and a single wave period value. Using the CPPN in this way\nis probably just a cheap and easy way of evolving a period value, with\nthe ideal solution being a completely independent period value bolted\nonto the NEAT genome.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks for the suggestions. I really appreciate the feedback.\n\nCool. No problem.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
