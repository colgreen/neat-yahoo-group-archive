I have\n&gt;finally accepted a tenure-track faculty position at the University\n&gt;of Central Florida in Orlando in the Dept. of Computer Science:\n&gt;www.cs.ucf.edu\n&gt;I am set to start in the Spring 2006 term, which begins in January.\n&gt;This will be a research-intensive position and I do plan on starting\n&gt;a research group there.  Annie Wu, a former student of John Holland,\n&gt;is also a prof there, so there will be two people there now in\n&gt;evolutionary computation.  There is also one of the biggest\n&gt;simulation and training labs in the country (meaning opportunities\n&gt;for applications).\n&gt;\n&gt;Obviously I only just accepted this job so I can&#39;t tell people a lot\n&gt;of details about getting into the program, etc., but a lot of people\n&gt;have noted that in America there are almost no places to go to study\n&gt;neuroevolution aside from UT Austin.  Therefore, I am hoping this\n&gt;will be a good development for the future of our field and give\n&gt;people another choice for studying and pursuing funded research in\n&gt;neuroevolution and artificial embryogeny.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
