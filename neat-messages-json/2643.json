In fact, it may work better. Here is the long explanation:\n\nThe reason I didn&#39;t keep the record around for the entire run in my\nimplementation of NEAT was because I felt that calling something the\nsame mutation that happened under completely different circumstances\nwas not intuitive. That is, it is likely that several generations down\nthe line, the &quot;meaning&quot; or contribution of the same connection\nrelative to all the other connections in a network is different than\nit would have been if it had appeared generations ago. I used a single\ngeneration as a yardstick for this kind of situatiom, although that is\nadmittedly ad hoc.\n\nThat said, functionally speaking, I don&#39;t think there is anything\nwrong with keeping innovations around forever. The main effect is to\ngenerate fewer species. Conversely, not keeping them around leads to\nmore species..some of them representing the same thing but separated\nnonetheless. It is not currently clear which method produces better\nresults under what circumstances.\n\nNote that as species diverge, calling a connection that appeared in\none species a different name than one that appeared earlier in another\njust increases the incompatibility of the species. This doesn&#39;t change\nthings much since they were incompatible to begin with. On the other\nhand, if the same species adds a connection that it added in an\nearlier generation, that must mean some members of the species had not\nadopted that connection yet...so now it is likely that the first\n&quot;version&quot; of that connection that starts being helpful will win out,\nand the other will die away. The third case is where a connection has\nalready been generally adopted by a species. In that case, there can\nbe no mutation creating the same connection in that species since it\nis already taken. The main point is, you don&#39;t really expect too many\ntruly similar structures with different markings to emerge, even with\nonly keeping the record around for 1 generation.\n\nWhich way works best is a good question. If you have any interesting\nexperimental results on this question, please let me know.\n\n\nOn 6/3/06, sidhantdash &lt;sidhantdash@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a second year student at the Indian Institute of Technology,\n&gt; Kanpur, and am currently working under a summer undergraduate research\n&gt; program. My project is to explore various neuro-evolution approaches\n&gt; to time series prediction.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to code my own version of NEAT for the same. I am trying\n&gt; to model it on Matlab_neat by Christian Mayr.\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing that I observed in the implementation of matlab neat is that\n&gt; the search for innovations is always limited to the particular\n&gt; generation in which we are trying to bring about the mutation. Is\n&gt; there any particular reason for wanting to do so? Is this done only in\n&gt; Matlab neat or is it a part of the NEAT process itself?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; regards\n&gt; Sidhant\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
