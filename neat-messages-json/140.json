Thanks for the input\n&gt; Derek, Kenneth, and Colin.  The reason I originally\n&gt; came to this group was because I asked about a\n&gt; program\n&gt; I was trying to write for JRobots.\n\nSmall world. :)\n\n&gt; You are very right Colin, although I have not looked\n&gt; too much into NEAT as of yet, we would have to pare\n&gt; down some things to fit within the contraints of\n&gt; JRobots.  \n\nI&#39;m not really all that interested in actually\nentering a NEAT-produced bot into the official\ncompetition (I&#39;m not interested in meeting their\nnecessary requirements either...as Colin pointed out,\nit&#39;d be a pain in the butt).  \n\nI *am* interested in using their freely available\nenvironment and plethora of pre-programmed AI\nopponents as a testbed for a NEAT-evolved player (if\nthat&#39;s possible...if not, I won&#39;t mess with it).\n\nAs far as a repository for domains, I think setting\none up on the neuroevolution.com domain would be a\ngood idea.  Ken already uses the Users Page as a\nrepository of sorts for versions of NEAT.\n\nPhilip and I hope to opensource our Java version\n(hopefully by the end of the year!) on Sourceforge,\nwhich could then be used as a repository, at least for\nJava-based domains.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
