I agree that there is room for a number=\r\n of interesting variants of the general idea of searching the hypercube for=\r\n meaningful connections (and hence their associated nodes).  Hopefully this=\r\n paper will help to open up research in that direction.\n\nAt the same time I=\r\n think our results do suggest the potential danger of coevolving connectivi=\r\nty and node placement, even though it seems intuitive.  Decoupling connecti=\r\nons from nodes may create a situation in the search something like a dog ch=\r\nasing its own tail.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.g=\r\nreen1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 23 March 2010 21:39, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; After years of speculation on how the placement and density of nodes m=\r\night be evolved in\n&gt; &gt; the HyperNEAT substrate, Sebastian Risi, Joel Lehman=\r\n, and I are pleased to announce\n&gt; &gt; our contribution to this conversation. =\r\nOur paper, &quot;Evolving the Placement and Density of\n&gt; &gt; Neurons in the HyperN=\r\nEAT Substrate,&quot; which will be presented at GECCO this year\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice work, =\r\nI really like the approach.
