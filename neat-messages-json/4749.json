I&#39;ve been debating whether or not to make a r=\r\neleased version.\n\nIn it&#39;s current state, the sheets are layed out on planes=\r\n and the camera can rotate and move around the substrates.  The node colors=\r\n represent activation levels, but when you mouse over a node, the colors ch=\r\nange to represent the connection weights emanating from the focused node.\n\n=\r\nIs this the kind of thing you had in mind?  If there is a demand for this a=\r\npp, I can package it with the next HyperNEAT C++ release.  If so, is there =\r\nanything that you&#39;d want the app to do that I haven&#39;t mentioned?\n\nJason G.\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
