Miguel &lt;cesargm@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Something&#39;s been bothering me lately. There are two methods for\n&gt; updating the neural network state: asynchronous and synchronous.\n&gt;\n&gt; These two methods gives different results, so we need to consider them\n&gt; when implementing a general neural network class (in NEAT or in a\n&gt; general purpose application).\n&gt;\n&gt; The synchronous mode (or parallel) is just a matrix-vector\n&gt; multiplication, where the matrix represents the network weights and\n&gt; connectivity and the vector is the state of the network at time t. In\n&gt; this mode, all neurons are updated at the same time, only requiring\n&gt; information from the last time. You also need to set an initial\n&gt; condition (state vector at time t=0), even if the network topology is\n&gt; feed-forward.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if we also update the state vector every time a neuron output is\n&gt; computed we have a &quot;real-time&quot; or asynchronous updating. This is\n&gt; achieved by choosing a random neuron from the network or following a\n&gt; certain pattern (update all neurons going from the input to the output\n&gt; like in feed-forward topology). A neuron output is computed using the\n&gt; most recent information from the network (not only its last state).\n&gt;\n&gt; For instance, as far as I could check, Matt Simmerson&#39;s NEAT\n&gt; implementation (NEAT4J) uses asynchronous updating: from the output\n&gt; neuron it recursively updates all the necessary nodes down to the\n&gt; input. If there are any recurrent\n&gt; links, its first output (initial state) is set to zero or any real\n&gt; value you wish.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Since the network&#39;s dynamics is affected by these two different\n&gt; methods, which one to choose?\n&gt; 2. How to choose an initial state vector for recurrent links ensuring\n&gt; overall network stability?\n&gt;\n&gt; I know that the last question is a difficult one since we&#39;re working\n&gt; with a discrete dynamical system, but what really bothers me is the\n&gt; first one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to make things clearer, I have an example where the network&#39;s\n&gt; input is set to {1} and the initial state is {0,0}:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.ime.usp.br/~cesargm/updating.png\n&gt;\n&gt; Cesar\n&gt;\n\n"}}
