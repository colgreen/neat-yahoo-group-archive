Personally, I try to have the average specie\nsize to be about 10, which allows for sorting and the mating of the\ntop n%, either by tuning the threshold manually or choosing the\nrequired number of species for dynamic threshold manipulation.\n\nI haven&#39;t clamped my species, to be honest, never even thought of it\nas an option.\n\nI have thought about having an average specie size of around 30 as\nthis is supposed to be the min size of a cow herd, for example, to\nhave enough genetic material to produce healty offspring.  Not so sure\n it matters so much here if brother and sister mate though.\n\nAlso, I seem to remember 30 being the smallest statistically\nsignificant size for a sample, so maybe we should always aim for that\nnumber of species.\n\nKen, any thoughts/opinions as to specie number clamping or specie size\netc.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Matt,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think to a certain extent it&#39;s dependent on your population size. \n&gt; Larger populations are more tolerant of more species.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think most of the current NEAT implementations clamp the number of\n&gt; species...something like 5-8 (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong on this).\n&gt;  Obviously if you only have 1 species, you&#39;re not exploiting its\n&gt; advantages...likewise if you have a population of 100 and you have 100\n&gt; species (everyone is in their own species), you&#39;re not getting any\n&gt; crossover.\n&gt; \n&gt; ANJI doesn&#39;t clamp the number of species, and so we end up tuning the\n&gt; threshold manually.  We usually end up with somewhere between 20-30\n&gt; species in a typical run.\n&gt; \n&gt; Theoretically, I like to think of species as camps moving out into the\n&gt; search space and exploring.  They&#39;re clusters of similar solutions in\n&gt; the fitness landscape.  You don&#39;t want too many and you don&#39;t want too\n&gt; few.  And you want a certain amount of turnover or dynamism, because\n&gt; you want to encourage more exploration, and probably have some search\n&gt; spaces abandoned in favor of more promising ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; Others may have some insights into why they clamped the species size.\n&gt; \n&gt; The short answer, though not very helpful, is somewhere between 1 and\n&gt; your population size. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; On 9/7/05, Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just wondering if anyone has any view as to the optimum(ish) number of\n&gt; &gt; species.  My implementation will cope with both a fixed and dynamic\n&gt; &gt; compatability threshold so I can control the number of species to a\n&gt; &gt; certain degree.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I find that with a fixed CT, the number of species decline eventually\n&gt; &gt; to just a few, after intially having many (tens/hundreds).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thoughts, opinoins etc very much welcomed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Matt\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
