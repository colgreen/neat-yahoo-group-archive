Its\n&gt;  basically an extension of monte-carlo methods in the same way that\n&gt;  alpha-beta is an extension of standard brute-force search. The\n&gt;  cleverness of MoGo comes in via heuristics which encode things like\n&gt;  location and rotation invariant representations and hence provides\n&gt;  both a way to generalize from a small amount of experience (e.g.\n&gt;  exploit symmetries) and also to bias the MC search towards &quot;more\n&gt;  promising&quot; parts of the game tree (e.g. exploit heuristic knowledge of\n&gt;  ladders). These representations themselves aren&#39;t learned directly (as\n&gt;  far as I have seen) but the potential is of course there, and in\n&gt;  particular there is nothing inherent in the UCT framework itself\n&gt;  preventing this from happening. Since UCT is basically just a\n&gt;  framework for performing biased random search, I don&#39;t really agree\n&gt;  that its not scalable. Scalability comes from providing a stronger\n&gt;  search bias. Stronger search biases are formed by generalizing\n&gt;  acquired knowledge.\n\nWell, they&#39;re scalable in the sense that MoGo actually plays on a\n19x19 board, although the same player that MoGo beat on a 9x9 board\napparently beat MoGo on a 19x19 board, even though the algorithm had a\n9-stone handicap.\n\nHowever, I&#39;m not very optimistic that such approaches are going to\nyield much in the way of strong, general-purpose AI. The fact that\nalgorithms like UCT don&#39;t get in the way of explicitly learning\nrepresentations doesn&#39;t seem like a very strong endorsement of the\napproach. I tend to think that explicitly learning representations is\nthe key to developing strong methods that apply generally across many\ndomains.\n\n&gt;  Anyway, to my main point: I think the idea of biased random search in\n&gt;  UCT is actually very intuitive and useful both in enhancing the\n&gt;  abilities of AI search as well as in understanding how humans play.\n&gt;  The former is sort of obvious given how well UCT-based algorithms\n&gt;  perform in practice and the latter stems directly from the notion of\n&gt;  bias: If the heuristics we have don&#39;t provide any information about\n&gt;  the value of a board-position, the only thing we can do is play\n&gt;  randomly until we learn about that value. If the heuristics provide\n&gt;  weak information, then we play randomly, but slightly biased by this\n&gt;  weak knowledge (e.g. &quot;I know that a lot of the time this kind of move\n&gt;  works pretty well.....&quot;), etc. I think this idea of degree of bias and\n&gt;  confidence in heuristic scoring really does to a large extent underly\n&gt;  how humans reason about these kinds of games.\n\nMaybe. I tend to want to frame Go as a problem in a way that dovetails\nwith most other cognitive domains, so I think of it in terms of\nlearning, recognizing, and generating temporal sequences of patterns.\nThis explanatory framework can apply to domains encompassing any\nmodality, from object recognition to learning how to ride a bicycle.\nI&#39;m not sure how to conceptually map the UCT approach of biasing\nsearch to such domains.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
