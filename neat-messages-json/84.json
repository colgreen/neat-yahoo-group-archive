Hello to everyone!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, Mitch.  Welcome. :)  And the same to everybody\n&gt; else who&#39;s joined recently.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My own controller is an ANN, produced by more\n&gt; &gt; conventional \n&gt; &gt; neuroevolution.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Exactly what approach did you use?  Are you using a\n&gt; fixed topology and just evolving the weights?  \n\nYes.  The seven inputs all connect to 30 hidden layer\nneurons, which all connect to 4 output neurons.  The\nneurons use the sigmoid, 1/(1+exp(x)).  The weights\nwere evolved with EvSail-2.1, which will be available\nany day now.  (maybe today)  It took about 25 hours of\nevolution.\n\n&gt; I had a look at your website, but I haven&#39;t\n&gt; downloaded\n&gt; or looked at the code.  Looks pretty cool, though.\n\nTo motivate you to look at the code, I just counted\nthe lines of C code that perform the ANN computation. \nThere are only 14!  (I only counted lines that\nexecute.)  This code reads the weights from one long\narray and computes the outputs, putting them into a\nsmall array.\n\nm\n\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
