So that means that if\n&gt;the link that was disabled to add a node were to be reenabled, then\n&gt;split again, it would be interpreted as the other node that did the same\n&gt;thing. So in that case, it would inhibit horizontal growth, an karl put\n&gt;it.\n\nYes, you are right, the choice to re-use node ID&#39;s means that it would not \nbe able to grow horizontally without bounds in the way described.\n\nSuppose you have one input, and one output.  Split the connection to create \na new node.  That causes the connection between them to be severed, in favor \nof the connection to the new node.  Then, re-connect the input and the \noutput.  Now, split that connection again.  If it gets the same innovation \nid, then the split failed, and you end up right back where you were before \nyou reconnected.  But if you give it a unique id, then you have a \ndiamond-shaped network, one input, one output, and two hidden nodes.\n\nBut suppose instead of connecting the input to the output and then \nre-splitting that connection, suppose you split the connection from the \nhidden node to the input node.  Then connect that new node to the output \nnode.  Once you re-connect the first hidden node to the input node, you are \nalmost back to the diamond shape...except that there is a connection between \nthe hidden nodes.  You have the same horizontal shape, just more horizontal \nconnections.  And if you support deletion (or disabling), you could end up \nat the same place by just deleting that middle connection.\n\nThe first approach gets you there in 3 mutations.  The second approach gets \nyou there in 5.  But you still get there.  There is basically no topological \nstructure you can evolve one way that you can&#39;t evolve the other way.  It \n*might* slow down the evolution, if the final topology requires something \nfancy.  But if the same thing is evolved from two or three different \ndirections, all three will be recognized as being the same thing.  Question \nis, is that a good thing, or a bad thing?  I&#39;d hate to have three of my \ntopologies all trying to optimize a functionally identical network, that&#39;s a \nwaste.  Though, I admit, that&#39;s not overly likely.\n\n&gt;But in NEAT as I am understanding it from ken&#39;s paper, the link\n&gt;could be reenabled, then split again, which would disable it again. So\n&gt;the pattern of reenabling and splitting could repeat indefinitely to\n&gt;create a wide topology with a large parallel hidden layer.\n&gt;Did I get it right?\n&gt;chad\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;-----Original Message-----&gt;\n&gt; &gt;From: blackkm7\n&gt; &gt;Sent: 8/19/2004 11:00:00 AM\n&gt; &gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [neat] Re: genotype vs phenotype\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m still new to NEAT, but from my limited understanding, if you\n&gt; &gt;prevent certain kinds of (add node) innovations from repeating, then\n&gt; &gt;there are certain types of net topologies that cannot evolve.\n&gt; &gt;Specifically, how might a hidden layer evolve that was larger than\n&gt; &gt;the input/sensor layer? Horizontal growth as oposed to vertical?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now that I think of it, I&#39;ve only seen vertical growth in jNeat.\n&gt; &gt;Does NEAT prevent horizontal &quot;bulge&quot; in topologies?
