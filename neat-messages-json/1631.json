The fitness landscape ruggedness, hilliness,\n&gt;deceptiveness, etc., in different domains is likely to be different.\n&gt;\n&gt;Therefore, it actually kind of makes sense if you want to search for\n&gt;mutation parameters to tie them to the individual genes, since at\n&gt;least then the search is domain-specific.  Of course, as you point\n&gt;out, this kind of gene-by-gene searching may go all over the place,\n&gt;but then again, at least in the ES community (as Ian pointed out),\n&gt;they have had some success with this, and it&#39;s (I think) almost a\n&gt;standard part of their methodology now.\n\nNot only domain-specific, but it is inside each search, rather than an \nexternally determined &quot;ideal&quot; value.  E.g. as I mentioned in my previous \nmail...\n\n&gt;There actually is a third, more sophisticated method for getting\n&gt;weight mutation parameters, which is to measure the success of\n&gt;mutations in various directions in the multidimensional space and\n&gt;actually construct a model of the most promising mutation trajectory\n&gt;based on the experience over past generations (as a multi-dimensional\n&gt;probability distribution).  That has recently popped up in ES as well,\n&gt;though the math behind it is not simple at all.\n\nBut that is a step away from the basis of an evolutionary search and \ntowards a gradient-based method.  Gradient-based methods are \nwell-established and the choice for many problems, but they have certain \nweaknesses which evolutionary methods address... IMHO, that is.\n\n&gt;The problem of getting weight mutation right is a little bit of an art\n&gt;form and may have an element of alchemy (i.e. there&#39;s perhaps not that\n&gt;much you can really do without just getting lucky) but then again\n&gt;there probably are some ranges that are more reasonable than others\n&gt;over multiple domains, so it&#39;s not bad to learn more about it.\n\nWhat you say is true.  But what do people think of the idea than an &quot;ideal&quot; \nevolutionary methodology would not require any user configuration?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
