That is a problem in all Recurrent=\r\n \n&gt; Networks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; values are difficult to store more than 10-50 iterati=\r\nons in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; network (see LSTM Link for references). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \tI put LSTM inside a NEAT. The evolution make NEAT to use \n&gt; &gt; &gt; LSTM cel=\r\nls\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a productive way storing key values, recovering that values \n=\r\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are useful a forgetting them  if it is useful (The 3 LS=\r\nTM \n&gt; cell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functions).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \tMy analysis of some of the=\r\n solved problems suggest that LSTM \n&gt; &gt; &gt; helps to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT in some pro=\r\nblems to reduce greatly the searching space \n&gt; &gt; &gt; helping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; memor=\r\nize (some times to accumulate) some important key events \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used after to get out the right outputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \tAn intu=\r\nitional example about reduction of searching space is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; serial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n XOR, if you solve serial XOR with NEAT you can see that the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; solutio=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; net use recurrent connection to store the first value and \n&gt; late=\r\nr it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compares with second value in the serial sequence. In my \n&gt; co=\r\nmputer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (P4\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2,4Ghz) it last around  2 minutes to find a solut=\r\nion with NEAT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, when I use one LSTM cell in th=\r\ne NEAT-LSTM it last \n&gt; ONLY 5\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SECONDS!!!!!.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)  Im=\r\nproving Work Methods in Real Automation Problems:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Mo=\r\ntivation: Evolution systems have been achieving great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; results\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; in last years. In my daily work in automation projects \n&gt; business, I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; have to face another problem: cost. That is the reason that \n&gt; most of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the times the industry try to avoid complex systems. Complex \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; systems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are difficult to develop, difficult to modify and difficu=\r\nlt to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintenance. Most of the times, it is the last choosen \n&gt; res=\r\nource. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \tOther problems to use evolution systems are the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uncertainty.  Always,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is some likelihood that a problem=\r\n will converge to a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a reasonable time. Some time=\r\n we can evaluate it, sizing the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; searching\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space. Other times=\r\n it very difficult to size such space. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Uncertainty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a vari=\r\nable related to, what is known in business as, risk. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \tSom=\r\ne recent experiment as in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers=\r\n/whiteson.gecco03.pdf \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that a way to reduce searching=\r\n space is to &quot;draw&quot; the guide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution will be se=\r\narched. Some of my research has gone in that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direction. In most of =\r\nthe systems we have deal with, we have \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous knowledge a=\r\nbout them. My work is focusing in how \n&gt; organize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such previous kno=\r\nwledge in: decision trees, tasks, abstraction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; levels\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and int=\r\nerdependences among them to reduce as much as possible \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searc=\r\nhing space. So the final goal is to find feasibility work \n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tools to use evolution systems in real automation Industry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Germ=E1n.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
