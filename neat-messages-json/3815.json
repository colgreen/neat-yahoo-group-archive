We=\r\n&#39;ve been developing NEAT Drummer at EPlex over the last \ncouple years.\n\nNEA=\r\nT Drummer allows the user to interactively evolve drum tracks for \nexisting=\r\n songs.  You can basically input an instrumental MIDI file \nand it will cre=\r\nate drums to go with it.  Like a lot of other \ninteractive evolution work w=\r\ne&#39;ve been doing, it&#39;s motivated by the \nCPPN theory.  Because music is a te=\r\nmporal pattern, a pattern-\ngenerating representation like CPPNs should be w=\r\nell-suited to \ngenerating music. \n\nHowever, NEAT Drummer has an interesting=\r\n trick where it creates the \ndrum tracks as a function of preexisting parts=\r\n, which means they are \npatterns that are functions of preexisting patterns=\r\n that were created \nby human composers.  The effect is that they seem to se=\r\namlessly \nfollow the structure of the song.\n\nHere&#39;s a paper on it:\n\nhttp://=\r\neplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\noption=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=\r\n=3D28#hoover.evomusart08\n\nAnd some MIDI samples that go with the paper:\n\nht=\r\ntp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/neatdrummer/\n\n(drums in all the samples are generated=\r\n by NEAT Drummer)\n\nInterestingly, even at generation 1 the drum tracks tend=\r\n to sound \ngood because they are constrained by the underlying instrumental=\r\n \ntracks, which already make sense.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
