This is because there is \nsome intellig=\r\nence required to perform a good selection. In TBE the \nintelligence is the =\r\nstatic fitness function, in Picbreeder it is the \nhuman intelligence. In fa=\r\nct, some pictures may be &quot;in order&quot; but \nstill represent nothing. Perhaps s=\r\nome pattern recognition technique \nmay be involved in the process, but this=\r\n is still not enough. \nBut it is an interesting idea of NEAT controlling an=\r\nother NEAT. A \npopulation of &quot;selector&quot; networks, each one running an evolu=\r\ntion. \nThis will take A LOT of CPU time, but it is good for experimenting \n=\r\nwith. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; You had talked (at length...) about the merits of the=\r\n human-chooser\n&gt; verses the goal-oriented evolution.  I&#39;d like to weigh in =\r\non it a\n&gt; little and maybe throw in an idea for how to make things even mor=\r\ne\n&gt; interesting...\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, there is always a goal.  In one case,=\r\n the goal is very\n&gt; strictly defined, in the other, it is more losely defin=\r\ned.  But \nthere\n&gt; is still a &#39;goal&#39;.  The goal in PicBreeder is &#39;makes me f=\r\neel good&#39;\n&gt; which CAN be defined, it just has to be defined in terms of \nso=\r\nmething\n&gt; we can&#39;t see, which is the neuron firing pattern in our brains.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; My hypothesis, though, is that there is a pattern to our internal\n&gt; cho=\r\nosing of what we like.  And I posit that it may be possible to\n&gt; LEARN it. =\r\n Meaning, create a &#39;chooser&#39; network that also evolves\n&gt; &#39;interesting&#39; imag=\r\nes.\n&gt; \n&gt; You see, I think that &#39;recognition&#39; is a key element in deciding \n=\r\nwhat\n&gt; to choose.  And I think that the method that we use to recognize \nor=\r\nder\n&gt; vs. chaos could be modeled.  Sure, recognizing the difference \nbetwee=\r\nn\n&gt; two people&#39;s faces would be harder to model, but I think it would be\n&gt; =\r\nfairly easy to learn to model the difference between chaos and \norder.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I&#39;m thinking you should be able to evolve a network that tends to\n&gt; choose=\r\n (rank higher) images of real-world things over images of\n&gt; random, unstruc=\r\ntured noise.  You could take many image chunks the \nsize\n&gt; of the PicBreede=\r\nr output images, all of which have some kind of\n&gt; recognizability and pleas=\r\nantness to them.  Then create a large \nnumber\n&gt; of counter-examples that ar=\r\ne built out of unstructured randomness, \nbe\n&gt; it pixels or blobs or arcs or=\r\n whatever.  Then evolve a network that\n&gt; consistently recognizes the &#39;pleas=\r\ning&#39; images (ranks them highly) \nand\n&gt; recognizes the chaotic images as suc=\r\nh and thereby ranks them lower.\n&gt; \n&gt; When that&#39;s done, integrate it into th=\r\ne PicBreeder app as \na &#39;chooser&#39;\n&gt; which evolves and evolves until somebody=\r\n shuts it down.  Whenever it\n&gt; finds something that it likes more than some=\r\n threshold, it &#39;saves&#39; \nit.\n&gt;  When it likes something more than an even hi=\r\ngher threshold, it\n&gt; publishes it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I predict that there will be a swee=\r\nt spot for complexity of the\n&gt; PicBreeder image generating networks.  For a=\r\n while, as complexity\n&gt; grows, the chooser network will rank the images hig=\r\nher and higher.\n&gt; But I suspect that at some point, that trend will reverse=\r\n.  The \nnumber\n&gt; of highly ranked images as a percentage of all evolved ima=\r\nges at a\n&gt; particular complexity level will get lower as the complexity ris=\r\nes\n&gt; above that sweet spot.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would also like to mention that combinin=\r\ng such a &#39;general coolness\n&gt; chooser&#39; with a goal-oriented chooser could be=\r\n quite interesting.  \nThe\n&gt; two could work together synergistically to help=\r\n walk the search \nspace\n&gt; faster.  Problem may be to generate that chooser =\r\ncorrectly to begin\n&gt; with.  But my instincts tell me that one that is evolv=\r\ned to find\n&gt; regularity in an image and finds &#39;pleasing&#39; relationships betw=\r\neen\n&gt; them, such as the one described above, would be adequate to use in\n&gt; =\r\nconjunction with a goal-oriented evolution of the CPPN networks for\n&gt; who-k=\r\nnows-what.  The reason I say that is that I suspect that the \nsame\n&gt; &#39;regul=\r\narities&#39; that make for a &#39;pleasing&#39; image are the same\n&gt; characteristics th=\r\nat lead to a functional CPPN network.  But I&#39;m \nsure\n&gt; you would know bette=\r\nr based on your experiences working with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just thought I&#39;d throw =\r\nthat out there for you to think about.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; John Arrowwood\n&gt; John (at) H=\r\nanlons Razor (dot) com\n&gt; John (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n&gt; --\n&gt; h=\r\nttp://arrowwood.blogspot.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
