Actually, for that to be completely true, if you use a species,\n&gt; &gt;you probably want to take a copy of it and start pruning that; whereas\n&gt; &gt;starting/ending pruning an individual would make it a new species?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;One of the major benefits of pruning though is that it keeps the\n&gt;complexity of the population as a whole in check, which keeps the NEAT\n&gt;search running at an optimal speed.\n\nExcept that if the pruned species are fitter they will supplant the \nun-pruned ones and if they are not, then you don&#39;t have the option of \npruning anyway.\n\nEr... maybe...\n\nMust think about it some more...\n\nMaybe if species were allocated some analogue of runtime, then the pruned \nspecies would evolve faster (using less of their runtime per \ngeneration).  So if they _could_ come to beat the unpruned ones then they \n_would_ (being faster) but if they could not they would not (because we&#39;re \nnot actually adjusting anybody&#39;s fitness due to their size).\n\n&gt;So if you allowed some species to\n&gt;complexify without limit you would loose this benefit. Anway, more\n&gt;details on all of this will be in my write up!\n\nAnyway, just thinking out loud here, will be very interested when you write \nit up.\n\n&gt;Colin\n\nIan\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
