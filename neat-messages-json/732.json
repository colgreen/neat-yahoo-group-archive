Just to add to that, it used to be that \npeople who designed topology-evolving algorithms would usually \nsupport their use by explaining that they find the &quot;optimal \ntopology&quot; for the problem, i.e. at the *end* of evolution, you have \na really good solution.\n\nMy point was that the goal is not just to &quot;end up&quot; with something \ngood, but to have something good (meaning small) the whole way \nthrough, so that you actually get an advantage in the *search*, not \njust in the final topology.  In fact, for a lot of problems, it&#39;s \nthe search itself that is the problem, and the final topology \ndoesn&#39;t even matter that much.  (Of course, NEAT tends to find \nminimal solutions as well, so it&#39;s final solutions have that nice \nproperty, but that&#39;s not the main point.)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi German,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll go ahead and field this one, and let Ken add any comments if \nneed be.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My question is what does the text mean by &quot;rather than only at \nthe very\n&gt; &gt; end&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; A really common problem in Neuro-evolution (and in complexifying \ngenetic\n&gt; algorithms as a whole) is that genetic structure is sometimes \nadded that\n&gt; doesn&#39;t serve any purpose. This kind of structure can accrue over \ntime and\n&gt; make the chromosome sizes very large (which increases the number of\n&gt; dimensions in the search space). To make the evolved networks more\n&gt; understandable/computationally efficient, some systems simplify \nthe output\n&gt; of overly complex genetic code at the &quot;end&quot; of evolution. For \nexample, if\n&gt; neuron A is connected to neuron B by link 1 and also link 2, then \nthe\n&gt; weights of these two links are summed and the connection is \nsimplified to\n&gt; one link. This &quot;simplifies&quot; the neural network but doesn&#39;t result \nin a\n&gt; loss in functionality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken&#39;s hypothesis was that if we could somehow avoid adding this \nkind of\n&gt; redundant structure in the first place, then the GA search takes \nplace\n&gt; over a smaller space, and therefore can be more efficient.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Joseph Reisinger\n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n\n"}}
