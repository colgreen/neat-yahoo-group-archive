I haven&#39;t got around to doing anythin gliek this yet though.\n\nWhat I will be doing fairly soon is creating a multi-threaded version of \nSharpNEAT to utilize multi-core CPU&#39;s. I thought about it and I think it \nwill be easy to do - an evening or two say. Anyway I just put an order \nin for a new dual core PC so that should be an incentive :)\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
