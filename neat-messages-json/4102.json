In our implementation it is allowed\nto get stale for a few e=\r\nvaluations (in the same frequency that\nindividuals are respeciated accordin=\r\ng to rtNEAT). In our experiments,\nallowing for a bit staleness did not effe=\r\nct the results.\n\nActually, in the scenario you describe, each of the indivi=\r\nduals would\nnow have a lower novelty, the original individual included. Thi=\r\ns\nreflects that the area around these individuals in behavior space is\nmore=\r\n dense than it previously was. As more individuals come into a\nparticular a=\r\nrea, the novelty of all of them drops, and provides\npressure for individual=\r\ns to do something new in order to be seen as novel.\n\nLet me know if you hav=\r\ne any more implementation questions, I&#39;ll be\nreleasing my source based off =\r\nthe rtNEAT package in the next few weeks.\n\nJoel \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I impl=\r\nemented novelty search and the maze navigation task (it \n&gt; works! :)), but =\r\nI need to ask you about something. \n&gt; \n&gt; So when a new individual is spawne=\r\nd from the population, its novelty is \n&gt; computed based on the domain-speci=\r\nfic distance measure to all other \n&gt; behaviors in the population and the ar=\r\nchive, right. \n&gt; \n&gt; But what about the population itself, should every indi=\r\nvidual there \n&gt; recompute its sparseness on every evaluation, based on the =\r\nnew \n&gt; circumstances? \n&gt; \n&gt; I ask this because when I observe the sparsenes=\r\ns (I assume sparseness \n&gt; equals fitness) of the individuals, say one happe=\r\nns to be in a very \n&gt; sparse area so it receives a high fitness score. But =\r\nthen a couple of \n&gt; other individuals come into this area, so it becomes mo=\r\nre dense. But \n&gt; that first individual still has a high fitness score? Is t=\r\nhis right? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
