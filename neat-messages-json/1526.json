Specifically, I want to do a comparison of recurrent \n&gt;networks and networks with plastic synapses, looking at how well they \n&gt;scale to more complicated problems.  I&#39;ve been doing my background \n&gt;homework on the topic, but am having some trouble coming up with a \n&gt;problem domain for an experiment to test things with.  Any suggestions \n&gt;or advice?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think Ken wrote a paper on plastic synapses, is that right? - I admit \nto not reading it yet though :(\n\nDynamic networks are more suited to a different set of problems than \nfixed weight nets. e.g. There was an article in August&#39;s Scientific \nAmerican about NASA scientists using adaptive neural nets to fly cripled \naircraft, the net&#39;s architecture is fixed (from previous \nexperimentation) but the network adapts by changing it&#39;s weights to \nadapt to how the aircraft has been cripled - e.g. if a plane&#39;s elevators \naren&#39;t working the network learns to lift a plane by using the ailerons \nin unison to lift the nose.\n\nNow you could ask the question, could a fixed weight network achieve the \nsame results? That is, we could attempt to train a network against all \nthe expected types of failure. If it is possible, the fixed network \nwould almost certainly be more complex since it has to &#39;store&#39; all of \nthe different configuartions, whereaas the dynamic net just re-learns \nweight for each scenario presented. On the other hand the plane might \ncrash while the net was learning, e.g. in trying to pull up it might \ninitially cause the plane to fall before it is able get an error \nfeedback signal which causes the weights to update. So if a fixed weight \nnet could be found you would be one up on the NASA guys :)\n\nI&#39;m not suggesting you commandeer a plane but I&#39;m guessing that there is \nsome pretty acurate flight sim code out there somewhere.\n\n\nWhat else? Well game playing tends to be based around built-in, \npre-learned strategies which would be hard to learn dynamically, so I&#39;m \nguessing that area is out. Having said that, maybe they could benefit \nfrom some dynamic weights, e.g. adjusting the priority of the various \nbuilt-in strategies depending on how the game is progressing. It would \nbe interesting if this sort of effect could be shown to occur.\n\nOut of curiosity whereabouts are you studying? Austin?\n\nRegargs,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
