The relative\n&gt;values of the weights does *not* scale because the sigmoid function is\n&gt;absolute, i.e. it would not be scaled along with the weights.  If you\n&gt;try to normalize weights based on the relative strengths you will\n&gt;eliminate the functionality of the network.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFair point.. You would have to scale the activation function by the same \namount as the weights in order to maintain a network&#39;s functionality.\n\n&gt;Second, with a simple network like XOR, it looks fine to have the\n&gt;weights go up unbounded, and indeed the original NEAT was distributed\n&gt;without such a cap.  But once you start evolving networks with\n&gt;hundreds of connections or more, it doesn&#39;t work the way you guys are\n&gt;thinking.  A connection that evolves to &quot;drown out&quot; other connections\n&gt;then can never be surmounted.  In other words, new connections have no\n&gt;chance of having an effect, since they are drowned out as soon as they\n&gt;appear, so you stop getting new functionality.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now one thing you can do about this perhaps is find the max and min\n&gt;weights in the network and generate all new connections within that\n&gt;range.  However, that will cause the weights of the entire network to\n&gt;gradually gravitate to larger and larger magnitudes, which also means\n&gt;it will becomes a binary network.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYes I see. Also, allowing the weight range to gradually increase is \nequivalent to what I described above - normalizing the weights and \nscaling the activation function by the same amount. This has the effect \nof compressing the sigmoid so that eventually it becomes so steep that \nit describes a step function (binary network). If you were to scale the \nother way then the sigmoid becomes linear, it would describe the graph \ny=x or some variation on it.\n\n&gt;I think the right thing to do for long runs that are producing very\n&gt;complex networks is indeed to cap the weights.  This also means it is\n&gt;easier to break out of a local optimum, depending on the weight\n&gt;mutation power.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI agree.\n\nNow, you could perhaps cause the same &#39;drowing-out&#39; effect late on in a \nsearch if you used a parameterized activation function and added the \nparameters to the search. But I agree that the drown-out effect&#39;s \nusefulness is questionable and perhaps even undesirable, + parameterized \nactiavtion functions just increase to size of the search space... a lot.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
