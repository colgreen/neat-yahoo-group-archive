We&#39;ve\nbegun entering the age of &quot;Big Data&quot;-- 200M tweets/day, 700M Facebook users,\netc. We&#39;re also finding ourselves more immersed in computing technology as\nmobile phones become more ubiquitous.\n\nI&#39;m interested in your thoughts. Specifically:\n\n- Where does Neuroevolution hold the most potential for internet\napplications?\n\n- What kind of data will NE be best suited to leverage?\n\n- How does the ubiquity of mobile technology help NE-based applications?\n\n- As we now have over a billion people online, what kind of large-scale\nhuman feedback systems may be devised that rely on NE?\n\n- What do you generally see as the future of NE for consumer apps?\n\nI have my own thoughts on these, which I&#39;m happy to share, but I&#39;m really\ninterested in what the community thinks. As the world has changed\ndrastically even since the first NEAT paper was published, keeping up with\nthe real world necessitates us periodically re-examining the practical\napplication space for our research area. Other areas seem to have flourished\nin the new  world: NLP is regularly used to measure consumer sentiment in\nsocial media, graph analysis algorithms are used heavily at both Google and\nFacebook to determine which page to show or which friend&#39;s posts to display\nin your feed. Where does NE fit in here?\n\n\nWesley\n\r\n--001636d33cad7c81ac04a70a40fc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi all,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;d like to start a discussion on where NE f=\r\nits into the modern world.
