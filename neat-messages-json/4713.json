If this comparison results in a =\r\nmatch then you can re-use the innovation number, otherwise you take the nex=\r\nt free innovation number.\n\nTherefore to achieve the same functionaility whe=\r\nn running on multiple machines you would need to compare the new connection=\r\n with the complete population across all machines.\n\nOn the other hand I&#39;m n=\r\not sure the existing NEAT implementations strictly adhere to innovation re-=\r\nuse, e.g. rather than maintaining a hashtable of all connections it may be =\r\nquicker and alomst as good to maintain a hashtable of the last N new connec=\r\ntions, thus introducing the possibility of a new connection being allocated=\r\n a new innovation number even though there exists a matching connection els=\r\newhere.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
