I&#39;m\nusing a=\r\nnt colony optimisation as my test scenario,\n\nThe reward scheme is the diffi=\r\ncult bit as there are several goals, as\nthere are in swarming.  The goals I=\r\n set are not visiting the same\nplace more than once whilst not carrying foo=\r\nd, finding food and\nreturning that to the nest.\n\nWhilst the framework parts=\r\n works fine, I&#39;m more interested in getting\nthe ACO working so I can use it=\r\n as an exemplar for the next release.\n\nHas anyone done anything similar or =\r\njust wants to chip in some advice.\n\nIn a little more detail:\n\nInitially, th=\r\nere is a population, p, of randomly genrated ants which\nstart off in a rand=\r\nom location within the nest.  They then set off. \nEach unique location they=\r\n visit (per ant) earns them a small reward. \nWhen they find food, they get =\r\na hefty reward - and this is where\nthings start to get a bit more complex. =\r\n With food, for every move\nthey make closer to the nest, they get a reward,=\r\n r, but for every move\nthey make away from the nest they get a penalty of 2=\r\nr.  This then\nprevents toggling around 2 positions (hopefully).  Eventually=\r\n, they\nreach the nest and deposit food, for which they receive another heft=\r\ny\nbonus.  \n\nWhen an ant carries food, it deposits an amount of pheromone (w=\r\nhich\ndecays at some rate).  This, I hope leads to ants, bereft of food, to\n=\r\nfollow and find the food etc.  There is no reward for following\npheromone t=\r\nrails, I wanted the ants to work that one out for themselves.\n\nAny pointers=\r\n would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nMridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am planning to do my MS thesis=\r\n on Swarm Intelligence using NEAT. In\n&gt; Ken&#39;s interview with Tom Barbalet o=\r\nf biota.org, he mentioned that NEAT\n&gt; uses competition to weed out the leas=\r\nt performing individuals and\n&gt; species, but they are essentially independen=\r\nt of each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible to have the entities co-operate in som=\r\ne way to obtain\n&gt; swarm intelligence?
