This may not be clear, so I will\ndevelopp:\n\nThe NEAT part in hyperNEAT improves the evolution of CPPNs, and, if you\nremove both the speciation protection mechanism and the distance between\ngenotypes based on the innovation numbers, the &quot;HyperNeuralNetwork&quot; has bad\nfitnesses on the different benchmarks (the fitness landscape of the cppn\nseems to be quite deceptive).\n\nHowever, considering the recent results on diversity and novelty objectives,\nhas anybody tried to replace them (innovation numbers and speciation\nmechanisms) with an explicit objective which would take into account the\nnovelty of behavior of the CPPN ?\n\nThis is straightforward to implement for a given substrate: for each query\nof the cppn of an individual (each time you compute a weight between two\nsubstrate nodes), append the obtained weight to a vector. It is then\npossible to define a novelty objective based on a conventional distance\nmetric between these &quot;CPPN Behavior&quot; vectors.\n\nAn additionnal benefit I see from this approach, and if I understood neat\ninnovation numbers correctly, is that the mathematical functions used for\neach node in the cppn are not taken into account by the neat metric (if two\nnodes with a same innovation number have mutated to present different\nmathematical functions, this does not increase the NEAT distance between\nthem).\n\nI have already have preliminary results showing that this metric is an\nimprovement over my partial implementation of hyperNEAT, however, I only\nused a distance based on the innovation numbers and not the species\nprotection mechanism.\n\nPaul\n\r\n--000e0cdf9d066be0ad04a5e43b1d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHello, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am currently experimenting with hyperNEAT and was just \nwo=\r\nndering if anybody tried to replace the NEAT mechanisms found in \nhyperNEAT=\r\n (speciation, distance based on innovation numbers and weights \nin the cppn=\r\n) by a distance between the behaviors of the CPPN.=A0 This may \nnot be clea=\r\nr, so I will developp: &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The NEAT part in hyperNEAT improves the ev=\r\nolution of CPPNs, and, if \nyou remove both the speciation protection mechan=\r\nism and the distance \nbetween genotypes based on the innovation numbers, th=\r\ne \n&quot;HyperNeuralNetwork&quot; has bad fitnesses on the different benchm=\r\narks (the \nfitness landscape of the cppn seems to be quite deceptive). &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;However, considering the recent results on diversity and novelty \nobj=\r\nectives, has anybody tried to replace them (innovation numbers and \nspeciat=\r\nion mechanisms) with an explicit objective which would take into \naccount t=\r\nhe novelty of behavior of the CPPN ?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is straightforward to im=\r\nplement for a given substrate: for each\n query of the cppn of an individual=\r\n (each time you compute a weight \nbetween two substrate nodes), append the =\r\nobtained weight to a vector.
