I&#39;ve got 7 computers \nconscripted into participating (so far), and it seems to be working well.  \nThe experiment status page sucks, but it&#39;s better than nothing.  Not MUCH \nbetter, but...\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/status.html\n\nSome of the things I hope to add to the page include:\n\n1. more useful and/or interesting stats\n2. SVG visualization of the current champion network\n3. example enlargements performed by the current champion (once it actually \ngets somewhere near a solution)\n\nIf anyone is running Linux and is willing to donate idle CPU cycles, you can \ndownload the client from\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/iex_client.pl\n\nBefore you run it, edit the $cpu variable to match your CPU (for compiling \noptimization purposes).  If you want to help, but don&#39;t know what to put in \nthat variable, send me the output for /proc/cpuinfo.  If you decide to run \nmultiple instances on the same machine (to make optimal use of available \nresources), make sure each is running in a separate directory so that it \ndoesn&#39;t overwrite temporary files.  I&#39;ll clean that up and make it more user \nfriendly later.\n\nAnd if you do decide to donate CPU cycles...THANKS!\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
