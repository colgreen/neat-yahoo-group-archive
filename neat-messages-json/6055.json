There should be a place for\n&gt; qualitative exploration. I had paper (also physically simulated robots)\n&gt; that got similar criticism from a reviewer, &quot;You didn&#39;t test any\n&gt; hypothesis.&quot; ... yes but we got pretty interesting / unprecedented evolved\n&gt; behavior out of the robots!\n\nI hate being the kind of reviewer who seems to bother you but I strongly\ndisagree with this kind of statement. (disclaimer: I did not review this\npaper).\n\nGood science is made with papers on which we can rely, that is papers that\ncontain results solid enough to makes things go forward. It is not made of\nfun &quot;proofs of concept&quot; (which are perfectly fun to watch on youtube).\n\nOverall, as a reviewer, I judge a paper by &quot;how much I learned by reading\nthis paper&quot;.\n\nTesting an hypothesis is a very good way to teach me something: after\nreading your paper, I will know whether hypothesis XX is true or false. In\nmy future work, I can assume that &quot;we know that XX is true, therefore it\nis relevant to do ZZ&quot;.\n\nBenchmarks are another approach: I will know whether method XX performs\nbetter than methods YY on this test. There are meaningless benchmarks and\nI don&#39;t learn anything with them, but if your benchmark is relevant, I\nwill have learned something.\n\nMore generally, measures are one of the best tools to build solid\nknowledge and there are many other things to measure than performance. For\ninstance, I&#39;m finishing a paper in which we introduce a measure of\nregularity and show how generative encodings generate different level of\nregularity. Once we have a measure, we can test hypothesis and use\nstatistics to verify our claims.\n\nLast, proving that an intuition is wrong is also an interesting way to\nteach me something. Joel & Ken&#39;s novelty search is a good example: by\nshowing that objective-based search can easily be outperformed by a simple\nnovelty-based algorithm, this idea clearly made me think. But this paper\nshowed something with statistics and arguments. We don&#39;t really know\nwhether novelty search is a better optimization algorithm, but the paper\ntaught me something with solid arguments -- and this is what matters.\n\nSo, if you show that your complex system can generate &quot;pretty interesting\n/ unprecedented behaviors&quot;, chances are high that I will not learn any\nsolid knowledge. If you show me that one element of system is the key of\nyou success, then I may learn something. But this is almost testing an\nhypothesis &quot;we test test whether XX is mandatory to obtain YY&quot;. If you\nshow me that this element is a key to change property XX to YY and that it\nis the same for a few equivalent systems, then we are starting to build\nknowledge that we can use in future work. Showing this will probably\nrequire measuring many things, but benchmarks per se are not mandatory;\ncreating solid foundations for our field is mandatory.\n\nIn summary, we need papers that create a solid foundation of facts.\nHypothesis, measures and statistics are the basic tools for this.\nShowcasing ideas is rarely an efficient method (I&#39;m sure we can find a few\ncounter-examples). Even K. Sims paper does not teach much, but remember\nthat its most famous paper was published in SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics\nconference in which your goal is to show nice pictures and movie. I&#39;ve\nseen too many papers that describe how &quot;cool&quot; a complex system is, without\nteaching us anything new. And I&#39;ve seen too many students starting a new\nproject in our field without any solid literature to rely on. They can\nfind many ideas in the literature. They can have their own &quot;cooler&quot; ideas.\nBut, at the end, they spend their whole Ph.D. writing a complex\nevolutionary system that does to teach anything to anybody.\n\n\nBest regards,\n-- JBM\n\n\n"}}
