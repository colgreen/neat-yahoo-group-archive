If you&#39;re\nconnecting nodes A & B, then start with B and trav=\r\nerse the net to see\nif you connect to A.

I naive=\r\nly assumed that if I modified the &#39;add connection&#39; routine\n&gt; to only add co=\r\nnnections where the source neuron&#39;s innovation # was less\n&gt; than the target=\r\n&#39;s [with a bit of added complexity around the input and\n&gt; output neurons] t=\r\nhat this would do the job.\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately I noticed that some connection=\r\ns were still going back into\n&gt; the net. This of course is due to the way we=\r\n add new neurons by\n&gt; splitting connections, which means that new neurons w=\r\nith high innovation\n&gt; #&#39;s are placed throughout the network and often befor=\r\ne neurons with\n&gt; lower innov #&#39;s. It seems obvious to me now of course :)\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; So it seems I need some other mechanism to ensure new conenctions are\n&gt; =\r\nall feed-forward and because of the optimisations in my exiting genome\n&gt; co=\r\nde it is now quite rigid, or at least if I start hacking around in\n&gt; there =\r\nI risk disturbing the optimsations. No I think I&#39;ll defer this\n&gt; work for n=\r\now, what I want to do is allow for easy plugging-in of\n&gt; alternative genome=\r\n classes which is something not quite in place right\n&gt; now. However, as par=\r\nt of this I want to do a more wide ranging change\n&gt; which would be to expan=\r\nd the ANN model in use to allow for neurons with\n&gt; multiple incoming connec=\r\ntions. The standard single connection point\n&gt; neurons then just become a sp=\r\necial case (I think!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course that could potentially take a while so=\r\n I&#39;ll be thinking about\n&gt; wrapping up everything I&#39;ve done to-date and rele=\r\nasing some code in the\n&gt; next day or so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
