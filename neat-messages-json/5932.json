Of course, one easy way to do that is just to =\r\nscale everything into the positive range.\n\nHowever, your suggestion of usin=\r\ng a different selection method also can work in principle, though I don&#39;t k=\r\nnow of specific implementations that have tried that in the past.  But one =\r\nthing you have to be careful about is how exactly the specific implementati=\r\non of NEAT works because some versions of NEAT (like mine) actually assign =\r\na number of offspring to each *species* (i.e. not at first to individual ne=\r\ntworks) based on fitness before performing selection *within* the species. =\r\n In other words, such an implementation would still crash with negative fit=\r\nness values even with a different selection scheme because the step that as=\r\nsigns offspring allotments to each species would not work with negative num=\r\nbers in its equations.  However, that is an artifact of the implementation =\r\nand the principle behind your idea is still theoretically correct and I bel=\r\nieve it could be implemented that way, but you just have to be careful if y=\r\nou&#39;re using an existing NEAT implementation.\n\nRegarding best-to-worst ratio=\r\n, I&#39;d think more in terms of meaningful differences between substantially d=\r\nifferent behaviors.  For example, if something that balances a pole for 100=\r\n seconds has a fitness of 500, then you wouldn&#39;t want something that can on=\r\nly balance the pole for 50 seconds to have a fitness of 490 because it will=\r\n not make clear enough distinctions for selection to act forcefully.\n\nken\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jmerlevede&quot;  wrote:\n \n Hi everyone,\n \n I&#39;m a =\r\ngraduate student and am currently using NEAT, and hopefully soon HyperNEAT,=\r\n for my thesis.\n \n After some searching I found out that, after applying fi=\r\ntness sharing and taking elitism into account, NEAT uses fitness proportion=\r\nal selection. This causes some problems for me, because I do not currently =\r\nalways generate positive fitness values where the relative fitness of the b=\r\nest and worst individual is &#39;right&#39;.\n \n I am wondering whether anyone has t=\r\nried using either tournament selection (instead of proportional selection a=\r\nfter fitness sharing) or some sort of ranking method (as an additional step=\r\n before fitness sharing), like linear or non-linear ranking. Using any of t=\r\nhese techniques, only the ranking of individuals would become important, an=\r\nd the selection pressure simply becomes another parameter of the algorithm.=\r\n\n \n I found some topics about fitness values on this users group, but I did=\r\n not find one that really addressed my question. I&#39;m sorry if this question=\r\n has been addressed before.\n \n I would also be happy to hear what you think=\r\n are good values for the ratio between the fitness of the best and worst in=\r\ndividual and/or the selective pressure and/or the selection intensity.\n \n G=\r\nreetings,\n Jonathan Merlevede\n\n\n"}}
