Specieation is much better now, \nthanks\n&gt; for your patience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ta\n&gt; \n&gt; M\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Let me try to address these questions.  First, is this an\n&gt; &gt; ANJI-specific question?  Which software are you using?  I just \nwant to\n&gt; &gt; make sure since I think there is an error in the calculations \nyou are\n&gt; &gt; citing.  More below...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whilst calculating the number of offspring for a valid (i.e. \nnon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinct and size &gt; 0) specie, the count returns 0.  This is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly prevalent in large species where the adjusted \nfitness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; becomes quite small comapared with the rest of the other, and\n&gt; &gt; usually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much less populous, species. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This becomes even more marked if I boost young species fitness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I understand, the offspring is calculated as follows.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (av adjusted specie fitness) / (total of all species av \nadjusted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitnesses) * Population size.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This formula looks wrong.  It turns out there are a number of \nways to\n&gt; &gt; express the number of offspring (all being mathematically \nequivalent\n&gt; &gt; formulations), but the specifics are crucial.  And this looks \nlike it\n&gt; &gt; has some specifics wrong.  The formula should be:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Offspring = (AverageSpeciesFitness / \nTotal_of_AverageSpeciesFitnesss)\n&gt; &gt; * PopulationSize \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that &quot;adjusted&quot; never comes into it.  The presence of the \nword\n&gt; &gt; &quot;adjusted&quot; in your formulation implies to me that you may be\n&gt; &gt; double-adjusting.  The adjustments come in when you are modifying\n&gt; &gt; fitnesses on a per-organism basis and assigning offspring on a\n&gt; &gt; per-organism basis.  In other words, each organism has its \nfitness\n&gt; &gt; divided by the total number of individuals in its species.  But \nif you\n&gt; &gt; then SUM all those adjusted fitness together, what do you get?  \nYou\n&gt; &gt; get AverageSpeciesFitness, i.e. the simple average *unadjusted*\n&gt; &gt; fitness of all the organisms in the species.   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The point is this:  either you adjust the fitnesses of \nindividuals and\n&gt; &gt; then sum those adjusted fitnesses (as I do in my version of \nNEAT), or\n&gt; &gt; you just take the average fitness of the species.  You do *not* \ndo\n&gt; &gt; both.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note also that the denominator is the sum of all the average \nspecies\n&gt; &gt; fitnesses.  No adjustment in that part either.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The problem boils down to the fact that there are two ways to \nexpress\n&gt; &gt; offspring assigned in fitness sharing as it&#39;s done in NEAT: on a\n&gt; &gt; per-species or per-individual basis.  Equations in my papers are\n&gt; &gt; usually expressed per-offspring.  It&#39;s easier to understand\n&gt; &gt; intuitively on a per-offspring basis because in those equations \nyou\n&gt; &gt; can see how the individual&#39;s fitness is being reduced according \nto its\n&gt; &gt; species size.  In other words the fitness of any individual \nmatters\n&gt; &gt; less towards how many offspring the species gets the more \nindividuals\n&gt; &gt; are in that species.  Averaging without adjusting, however, is \njust a\n&gt; &gt; different way to formulate the same concept in which you don&#39;t \ndiretly\n&gt; &gt; see the reduction according to species size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, imagine we have 3 species. Specie_1 has 3 members \nav\n&gt; &gt; raw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness 0.85, Specie_2 has 2 members av raw fitness 0.82 and\n&gt; &gt; Specie_3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has 145 members with av raw fitness 0f 0.9.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_1(adj) = 0.85/3 = 0.28333\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_2(adj) = 0.82/2 = 0.41\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_3(adj) = 0.9/145 = 0.006\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_1 then generates 61 offspring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_2 then generates 87 offspring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Specie_3 then generates 2 offspring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Again, this doesn&#39;t make sense.  If 0.9 is the average fitness of\n&gt; &gt; species 3 then it should be getting over 1/3rd of the \noffspring.  if a\n&gt; &gt; system is showing this behavior there may be a bug in the \nspeciation\n&gt; &gt; code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n\n\n\n"}}
