Consider a\nfitness landscape with local maxima that we tend to get stuck in. NEAT\ngives us some ways of getting out of the local high points:\n\n1) Speciation. Maintains multiple search &#39;areas&#39; on teh landscape and\nbalances search effort between them. However, speciation by itself\ndoesn&#39;t provide a means of discovering new promising areas on the\nlandscape.\n2) Random mutations. Allow us to &#39;hop&#39; to new but relatively proximate\npoints on the landscape, e.g. single new connections/nodes and random\nresetting of connections weights.\n3) Crossover. Attempts to find new areas, but that are close to both\nparents (typically by searching in some higher dimensional space than\neither of the parents). Hence crossover provides access to a lot of\nnew search space by bringing it nearer to our current search\npoints(genomes) in terms of &#39;edit distance&#39;.\n\nI&#39;m proposing that another way of opening up the fitness landscape is\nto modify that landscape such that the arrangement of landscape\nbarriers changes and opens up pathways to new areas, but in a way that\nstill leads to promising areas. E.g. One technique I have experimented\nwith is to factor the size of a genome into the fitness function,\nmotivation for this comes from mathematical regularization - simply\nthat simpler models/genomes are more generalised and thus fitter than\nmore complex models (depending on the problem domain).\n\nIf I enforce selection pressure against complexity I see the search\nbecoming overly constrained, but if I lessen that pressure or remove\nit, allow search to continue for a while and then re-impose the\npressure then I&#39;ve found that this to be successful. You can imagine\nthat I&#39;ve removed a barrier in the landscape, some of the genome shave\nmigrated to new areas and then I&#39;ve put back the barriers and the\ngenome snow settle into new local maxima and continue searching from\nthere.\n\nThis idea overlaps with phased search (alternating between\ncomplexifying and simplifying) and could be framed as an extension of\nthat approach, essentially adding more phases or more axes to the\ncomplex-simple axis. I also think rather than switching certain types\nof fitness criteria on/off that a smoother transition would be a more\ngeneral solution. You can imagine the landscape as undulating and the\ngenomes as ball bearings rolling around as the landscpae changes\n(except ball bearings would follow valleys instead of peaks/ridges).\n\nColin\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia\n&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29&gt;\n.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0234_01CAC28E.211F1470\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot; http-equiv=3DContent-Type&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META name=3DGENERATOR content=3D&quot;MSHTML 8.00.6001.18876&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#=\r\n0000ff size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D406371516-13032010&gt;Colin,&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff size=3D2 f=\r\nace=3DArial&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D406371516-13032010&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;SPAN=\r\n \nclass=3D406371516-13032010&gt;You may want to investigate simulated annealin=\r\ng to \navoid local minima.&nbsp; Underlying the neural network is a graph th=\r\nat responds \nwell to graph thermodynamics.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dl=\r\ntr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000ff size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D=\r\n406371516-13032010&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT color=3D#0000ff size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D406371516-1303201=\r\n0&gt;Ken Lloyd&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000=\r\n0ff 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\nDIV dir=3Dltr lang=3Den-us class=3DOutlookMessageHeader align=3Dleft&gt;\n  &lt;HR=\r\n tabIndex=3D-1&gt;\n  &lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com \n  [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] &lt;B&gt;On Behalf Of &lt;/B&gt;Colin Green&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nB&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; \n  Saturday, March 13, 2010 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; \n  neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [neat] Fitness Landscape \n  Modulation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n  =\r\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;This is an idea I&#39;ve been thinking about for a wh=\r\nile.
