I used to be amazed as well that evolution never d=\r\niscovered the\nwheel. But then I realized that wheels are only good with pav=\r\nement. Since\nenvironments did not have pavement, it is no surprise that evo=\r\nlution did not\ndiscover the wheel. Only a complex process of niche construc=\r\ntion, like we\nhave done with our road system, allows the chicken/egg proble=\r\nm to be\novercome such that it is worth it to both lay roads and use wheels.=\r\n\n\nIn natural uneven landscapes, legged creatures are much better than wheel=\r\ned\ncreatures. Which is why we can&#39;t drive through forests.\n\nSo I don&#39;t see =\r\nthis as a failure of evolution. In fact, we can make good\nwheeled creatures=\r\n but are just barely starting to be able to make good\nlegged creatures (e.g=\r\n. Big dog). The legged creatures are better and harder\nto make than the whe=\r\nel.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThat point aside, evolution did discover the wheel=\r\n in some cases. Such as\ndung beetles:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DI1R=\r\nHmSm36aE\n\nSome people also have claimed that evolution has created the whee=\r\nl at the\nnano-scale. But I can&#39;t remember what the examples were.\n\nNone of =\r\nthis detracts from your main point, however, which I agree with.\n\nCheers,\nJ=\r\neff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 10:32:42 -000=\r\n0\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re:=\r\n Benchmarks for Artificial Embryogeny Systems\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek, I also don&#39;t beli=\r\neve there has been a great deal of benchmark\n&gt; comparison sine the 2003 pap=\r\ner, although Alexandre Devert cites a\n&gt; few.  However, usually when people =\r\nattempt benchmarks they do not\n&gt; compare their results explicitly with othe=\r\nrs.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the same time, as you know, I have changed my philosophy somewh=\r\nat\n&gt; since 2003 because I have realized that benchmark comparisons can\n&gt; le=\r\nad to misunderstanding unless they are controlled very carefully.\n&gt; One of =\r\nthe problems is the &quot;target-based evolution problem,&quot; which\n&gt; is one of the=\r\n inspirations for novelty search.  In short, evolving\n&gt; to an arbitrary tar=\r\nget can lead to misleading intuitions about what\n&gt; is possible with a parti=\r\ncular encoding because of deception.  Often\n&gt; a &quot;failed&quot; encoding very well=\r\n could represent the target if only it\n&gt; had been led to it through an alte=\r\nrnative path through the search\n&gt; space.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, another problem with be=\r\nnchmarks is that they may obfuscate\n&gt; more fundamental advantages of partic=\r\nular approaches because they do\n&gt; not focus on general capabilities.  (Alth=\r\nough, of course, if you do\n&gt; enough of them, perhaps general capabilities s=\r\ntart to be clearer.)\n&gt; But that is why I advocated more focus on looking fo=\r\nr biological-\n&gt; like regularities in the patterns output by particular enco=\r\ndings,\n&gt; rather than looking for a single particular pattern, or even a\n&gt; s=\r\ningle set of patterns.  Like I&#39;ve said before, evolution never\n&gt; produced a=\r\n wheel but that hardly means DNA is a bad encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course benchmar=\r\nks can play a role and I do think more comparisons\n&gt; could be done, but we =\r\nalso have to be cautious about their\n&gt; misapplication.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; Hi Derek,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not really aware of much, if any benchmarking wor=\r\nk that has\n&gt; been\n&gt;&gt; done in the field other than some of the papers mentio=\r\nned in the\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; post.

We have a forthcoming journal publication about\n&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT in g=\r\neneral that talks a bit about this.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; David\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Seeing Peter Krcah&#39;s stuf=\r\nf (http://ero.matfyz.cz/) at GECCO this\n&gt; year\n&gt;&gt;&gt; got me re-interested in =\r\nartificial embryogeny. I went back and\n&gt; reread\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken&#39;s paper &quot;A Taxonomy=\r\n for Artificial Embryogeny&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=\r\n=3D121), which is a\n&gt; very nice\n&gt;&gt;&gt; paper. I was specifically wondering abo=\r\nut the suggestions at the\n&gt; end\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the paper, regarding benchmarks for =\r\nAE systems, such as:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Evolution of:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --Pure symmetry (e.g. =\r\nbilateral symmetry)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --Specific shapes (e.g. rings, stars, and trees)\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; --Specific connectivity patterns (e.g. for neural networks)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --Simple =\r\ncontrollers (e.g. for double pole balancing)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken goes on to say:\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Such benchmark comparisons will eventually make it possible to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n predict the performance\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of AE systems based on their location in the t=\r\naxonomy. For\n&gt; example, one\n&gt;&gt;&gt; benchmark might be to evolve a five-pointed=\r\n star. This benchmark\n&gt; can\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be attempted\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with a system in which all=\r\n the dimensions of development are\n&gt; fixed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; except the cell\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fate dim=\r\nension. That dimension can vary from using only\n&gt; prepatterning\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to usin=\r\ng every\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conceivable form of fate determination, from stochastic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sel=\r\nf-organization to signaling,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; migration, and proliferation. The results =\r\ncan be measured using\n&gt;&gt;&gt; several criteria: How\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fast does the objective=\r\n shape evolve? How often and how many\n&gt; genes\n&gt;&gt; are reused by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the solu=\r\ntion genome? Is symmetry used, or is each point in the\n&gt; star\n&gt;&gt;&gt; specified=\r\n by a separate\n&gt;&gt;&gt; section of genetic code=97that is, is there emergent mod=\r\nularity?\n&gt; For\n&gt;&gt;&gt; every possible\n&gt;&gt;&gt; setting on the varying dimension (e.g=\r\n., cell fate\n&gt; determination), data\n&gt;&gt;&gt; will be available\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for compariso=\r\nn.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; This sounds like a great idea. I&#39;m wondering, though...what ki=\r\nnd\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; response has this generated? Have there been any follow up\n&gt; pa=\r\npers on\n&gt;&gt;&gt; AE systems that have tried to apply such benchmarks in a\n&gt; syst=\r\nematic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; way?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Have these types of benchmarks been systematically=\r\n applied to\n&gt; the 2D\n&gt;&gt;&gt; representations evolved using HyperNEAT?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nI also noticed rereading Sims 1994 paper that he displays hand-\n&gt; coded\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n examples of recognizable morphologies such as a primate hand, a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; humano=\r\nid form, and a tree structure. But I&#39;m wondering if and/or\n&gt; how\n&gt;&gt;&gt; easy s=\r\nuch structures arise using his encoding when starting from\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; simple c=\r\nore structure and either using artificial selection or a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fitness functi=\r\non tailored to evoke similar structures.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --Derek\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
