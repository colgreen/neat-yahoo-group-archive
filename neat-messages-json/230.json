I am running the \nc++ implementation and the only thing I thought needed changing was the \nevaluation function more specifically how the errorsum was calculated\ni.e.\nfor &quot;or&quot;\n    errorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\nand for &quot;and&quot;\n    errorsum=(fabs(out[0])+fabs(1-out[1])+fabs(1-out[2])+fabs(1-out[3]));\n\nThe problem is that when I run the program for OR and AND it rarely \nfinds a solution and if it does the final network seems overly complex \nand usually takes many more generations than XOR despite being a \n&quot;simpler&quot; function.  My question is whether there should be more to \nchange in the program or if neat is just better with XOR than AND or \nOR(I don&#39;t see why that would be...).  I figured since they were all \nbinary logic functions the parameters could stay the same and the \nstarting genome seemed as simple as it got so that didn&#39;t look like a \nproblem.  I&#39;m not too familiar with neat yet; maybe I&#39;m overlooking \nsomething simple so any tips would help.   Thanks.\n\nirvin h.\n\n\n"}}
