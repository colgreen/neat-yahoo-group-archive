Y=\r\nou say that &quot;inputs were not properly propagated.&quot;  \nIt&#39;s worth noting that=\r\n many researchers would actually say the \nopposite: They would say that thi=\r\ns form of iterative propagation \n(wherein activation does not go all the wa=\r\ny through the network in one \nfell swoop) *is* the proper form of propagati=\r\non, whereas the \nalternative is not proper.  The reason is that biology wor=\r\nks this \nway.  Biological neural networks are never &quot;completely activated.&quot;=\r\n  \nThey simply continaully activate forever (until death).  Thus one \ndoesn=\r\n&#39;t generally think of such networks in terms of completing the \nactivation =\r\ncycle properly.  Rather the network is in an infinite \nprocessing loop.  Of=\r\n course I realize that you understand this \nalready, but it&#39;s just an inter=\r\nesting cultural point since from your \nperspective that is not the correct =\r\nway to activate a network. \n\nIn fact, in some ways it is inaccurate to thin=\r\nk of a network with a \nlong delay line as not propagating to the outputs ov=\r\ner the course of \nthe delay because a neural network can have multiple para=\r\nllel routes \nto the outputs, some longer than others.  The consequence is t=\r\nhat you \ncan react to an input faster with less processing than you can wit=\r\nh \nmore processing.  So the speed of thought comes into play.  \n\nIf someone=\r\n throws a ball at my head, I need to reflexively jerk my \nhead to the side.=\r\n  The neural path to that decision has to be pretty \nshort.  On the other h=\r\nand, the very same sensory event may trigger a \nmore complicated chain of r=\r\neasoning about who is doing this to me and \nwhy.  Both paths can start at t=\r\nhe same time even though one completes \nwell before the other.  So in fact =\r\na neural network may well be \nreturning output even while some signals from=\r\n the same trigger point \nin time are still traveling in another part of the=\r\n brain.  These \nnuances are lost in the all-at-once model.\n\nUltimately thou=\r\ngh as I said there is no right way to do it.  It just \ndepends on what you =\r\ncare about.  I can appreciate from a game design \nstandpoint why one might =\r\nchoose to do it the way with which you are \nmore familiar, because it could=\r\n save cycles on the CPU.  That&#39;s a \nvalid consideration and there&#39;s nothing=\r\n wrong with it.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve never worked with non-recurrent neural networks where inp=\r\nuts  \n&gt; were not properly propagated all the way through the network; \nhenc=\r\ne,  \n&gt; my confusion.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
