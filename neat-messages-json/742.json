What is the fitness function being used in \nthe no wiggle pole balancing?  Is it the Gruau one used in our \npaper?  Because the fitness numbers I&#39;m seeing don&#39;t look familiar \nto me in that experiment.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t intending to put out another release just yet as I am in \nthe \n&gt; middle of a code reorganisation. However I though some might like \nto see \n&gt; the various improvements as they stand today...\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Marked improvement on single-pole search. In fact it&#39;s quite \nnormal \n&gt; to see perfect solutions within the initial population! This is \nmainly \n&gt; due to using fully connected networks in the initial population. I \n&gt; discussed this with Ken and this is was also seen in his \nexperiment&#39;s. \n&gt; The connection weight mutation has also been refined.\n&gt; \n&gt;  - New double-pole-balancing and double-pole-without-velocity-\ninput \n&gt; experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Updated the pole balancing simulator to show force acting on \ncart and \n&gt; support double-pole experiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zipped source code and .Net binaries here: \nhttp://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing I&#39;m just playing with now is an alternative fitness \nscheme to \n&gt; prevent the double-pole-without-velocity problem being solved by \nquickly \n&gt; wiggling the poles, as described in &quot;Efficient Reinforcement \nLearning \n&gt; through Evolving Neural Network Topologies&quot; (Ken and Risto \n&gt; Miikkulainen). This is in the released code/binaries but I haven&#39;t \nhad \n&gt; chance to experiment with this yet, I did a quick run and it still \n&gt; evolved &#39;wiggling&#39; solutions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n"}}
