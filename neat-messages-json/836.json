There are at \nleast three ways to implement it.  In the latter 2 cases, a &quot;record \nof innovations&quot; is kept.  (My version of NEAT, and I think all \nothers that I know of have the capability to keep such a record)\nThis record is a list of &quot;things that were added.&quot;  So for example, \nit will say &quot;a new link was added between nodes 3 and 7 and given \ninnovation number 12.&quot;  Then, any time another new link is added, \nNEAT can look back through the record and see if it&#39;s already been \nadded, and then if so give it the same number.  Anyway, here are the \n3 types of implementation:\n\n1.  Don&#39;t have NEAT keep any record of previous innovations at all.  \nIn that case, splitting the same link multiple times will always \nlead to new nodes.\n\n2.  Have NEAT keep a record of innovations, but clear that record \nafter each generation.  In that case, the same innovation occurring \nin the same generation will get the same historical marking, but in \nthe next generation the same innovation (e.g. connecting the same \ntwo nodes) would get a different marking.\n\n3.  Have NEAT keep a record of innovations forever.  In that case, \nthe same innovation *always* gets the same number for the entire run.\n\nThe FAQ question I cited earlier talks about the issues involved in \nchoosing how to do it, but the short answer is that it&#39;s a judgment \ncall, and there is no data to suggest one should strongly prefer one \noption over the other.  You may have opinions about which is most \nelegant/biologically plausible/conservative, and those will guide \nyour choice.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
