Of course the =\r\ncode is a bit complicated and figuring out what it does is difficult to do =\r\nquickly.  In particular here are corrections for b and c:\n\n(b) Species are =\r\nnot killed off if their average fitness falls below a certain level.  Rathe=\r\nr, there is a rule that, if turned on, would kill off a species if its maxi=\r\nmum fitness has not improved in some number of generations.  That is a way =\r\nto dump stagnant species.\n\n(c) &quot;Stolen babies&quot; is almost never used in any =\r\nexperiment that I have seen published or published myself, so it isn&#39;t real=\r\nly an important mechanism.  However, it is a way to increase greediness.  A=\r\ns Daniel rightly infers, it doesn&#39;t steal actual genetic code from one spec=\r\nies, but rather it steals the *right* to reproduce from the worse species a=\r\nnd redistributes that right to the better ones.  So sort of Robin Hood in r=\r\neverse (steal from the poor to help the rich).  \n\nIn terms of &quot;weighting th=\r\ne number of offspring produced towards the stronger species,&quot; that is corre=\r\nct, but that is just a property of fitness sharing, which NEAT uses.  \n\nIn =\r\ngeneral, the most important selection mechanism in NEAT is in fact fitness =\r\nsharing, which makes it difficult for good species to take over the entire =\r\npopulation because individuals must share the fitness of their species.  So=\r\n as a species gets bigger, the fitness of everyone within it drops.  I woul=\r\nd consider fitness sharing essential to NEAT&#39;s &quot;identity.&quot;\n\nHowever, all fi=\r\ntness sharing does is adjust the fitnesses of everyone in the population.  =\r\nSo after that, there is still a need to decide how many offpspring individu=\r\nals get.  It is at this point that versions of NEAT may diverge and I do no=\r\nt have a strong opinion because I do not consider the choice essential to N=\r\nEAT&#39;s identity.\n\nIn my own implementations, first, offspring numbers are as=\r\nsigned on a per-species basis (proportionally to *adjusted* fitness after f=\r\nitness sharing) and then they are assigned within to species to individuals=\r\n.  My version of NEAT usually uses truncation selection within species.  So=\r\n it just cuts out the bottom n% of the species from being eligible to repro=\r\nduce and the rest get to reproduce.  (rtNEAT is different of course since i=\r\nt only produces one at a time - it probabilistic).  The remaining individua=\r\nls are selected as parents randomly.\n\nPerhaps most appealing for me about t=\r\nhis approach is the idea that each species can be treated as its own little=\r\n mini-population in which whatever selection scheme you choose is implement=\r\ned.  I think it makes conceptual sense to think of a species as a populatio=\r\nn because *within* a species one wants the same kind of healthy phenomena t=\r\no happen that one wants in a regular GA with a full population.\n\nOf course,=\r\n you could alternatively choose roulette wheel selection within species (af=\r\nter adjusting fitness for fitness sharing) or something else.  That choice =\r\nis not that important, and I have tried a number of schemes and found that,=\r\n at least with NEAT, it makes limited difference which one is chosen.  But =\r\nthe fitness sharing is still key.\n\nSo Jeff, there is no simple to answer to=\r\n &quot;what kind of selection scheme does NEAT use&quot; because it is a multi-level =\r\nscheme that first acts at the level of speciation and then at the level of =\r\nindividuals within species.  So no one blanket terms really covers the whol=\r\ne thing.  To distill it to a short phrase, perhaps we could say it uses &quot;fi=\r\ntness sharing and any other scheme after fitness-sharing.&quot;\n\nken\n\n   \n\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m helpin=\r\ng with the overhaul of JNeat.  I hadn&#39;t even looked at selection,\n&gt; but now=\r\n that I do it seems very strange.  Perhaps Ken could explain what is\n&gt; goin=\r\ng on here.\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like all the selection pressure comes from:\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n(a) Elitism within species (&quot;champions&quot; are automatically cloned into the\n&gt;=\r\n subsequent generation)\n&gt;  (b) Killing off species when their average fitne=\r\nss falls below a certain\n&gt; threshhold\n&gt;  (c) Weighting the number of offspr=\r\ning produced towards the stronger\n&gt; species.  (In the code the metaphor of =\r\n&quot;stealing babies&quot; from weaker species\n&gt; is used, although this doesn&#39;t seem=\r\n quite right to me.  Surely if a species\n&gt; were to &quot;steal a baby&quot;, it would=\r\n retain the genetic material of it&#39;s\n&gt; original species?)\n&gt; \n&gt; With all tha=\r\nt said, you&#39;re question is on the mathematical function that\n&gt; describes se=\r\nlection pressure relative to fitness, right?  Unfortunately, I&#39;m\n&gt; finding =\r\nit very difficult to infer that from the above mechanisms.
