Does \ninputting the coords as row and column selectors help?\n\nE.g. one input for column one, one for column two, one for column three, \nonly one ever turned on at a time...\n\nditto on the rows\n\nThen I guess you need to double that up to give you bottom-left and top-right.\n\nActually that&#39;s another thought.  How about trying to index a single cell \nwith one coordinate as a first step?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
