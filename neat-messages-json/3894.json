It biases the search toward\ncertain type=\r\ns of solutions that would otherwise be less likely to be\nreached.  Of cours=\r\ne, as a consequence, it means that some solutions\nbecome less likely.  Howe=\r\nver the bias is provided under the assumption\nthat the solutions to many pr=\r\nactical problems involve some kind of\npattern or regularity.  \n\nThe idea go=\r\nes beyond simply discovering the right pattern; it also\nmeans preserving it=\r\n as it is elaborated.  For example, the encoding\nmay discover bilateral sym=\r\nmetry early on, and from that point onward\nelaborations that are discovered=\r\n through mutation are also likely to\nbe symmetric.  So the discovery itself=\r\n biases the future of the search.\n\nThe main problem that is being addressed=\r\n is that repetition and\nrepetition with variation are a necessary part of n=\r\neural circuitry to\napproach real world problems.  For example, there are mi=\r\nllions of\nreceptive fields in the human eye that project back to the brain,=\r\n each\ncreating the same connectivity motif.  An algorithm that had to\ndisco=\r\nver each such motif independently would be impractical.  In fact,\nmost algo=\r\nrithms in machine learning today have that very problem. In\ncontrast, Hyper=\r\nNEAT can discover all of them at once, and then improve\nall of them togethe=\r\nr, by discovery the pattern first.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dan=\r\niel Tuohy&quot; &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m curious about how th=\r\ne idea of identifying patterns in NEAT is\nrelated to\n&gt; inductive bias.

Our group has\n&gt; &gt; indeed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently produced a number of works=\r\n in interactive evolution,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including dance, art, music, and particl=\r\ne effects. Perhaps it\n&gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem a somewhat lighthearted departur=\r\ne from more serious\n&gt; &gt; subjects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet the implications of t=\r\nhis work are as serious as any in my\n&gt; &gt; view.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of that work is =\r\na probe of the ubiquity of patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regularities, in particular=\r\n through the theory of CPPNs. The\n&gt; &gt; deeper\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lesson in that body of=\r\n work is that the very same encoding is\n&gt; &gt; able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produce p=\r\natterns appropriate to what would otherwise appear to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disparate =\r\ndomains. The idea is to develop a theory of generic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pattern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\neneration and to show that patterns are interchangeable across\n&gt; &gt; many\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; domains. That insight leads to the idea of HyperNEAT, which\n&gt; &gt; takes\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again the very same encoding that is producing art and music and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; uses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it to produce a large-scale neural pattern. Therein it bec=\r\nomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serious, because the hard problems you like to focus on almost=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involve patterns and regularities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It=\r\n is no accident that in building a theory of pattern\n&gt; &gt; generation, a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; number of interactive evolutionary computation experiments would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nneed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be performed because understanding the capabilities of a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; pattern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generator require *exploring* the space of possibilities =\r\nrather\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply optimizing, and humans are much better explo=\r\nrers than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computers. The theory would never have gotten off the gro=\r\nund if\n&gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had stuck to more traditional optimization problems. =\r\nIndeed, as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; funny as it sounds, the whole idea began to materialize =\r\nonly\n&gt; &gt; after I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolved a spaceship in Mattias Fagerlund&#39;s DelphiN=\r\nEAT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To put it starkly, without that exploration in genetic=\r\n art, there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would have been no HyperNEAT. And in fact even more new=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; theories\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical implications are coming (not yet=\r\n published) because of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phenomena that became apparent through Picbr=\r\needer. So you see,\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; building a new algorithm or a new theory =\r\nwith practical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implications,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; often traditional problems are e=\r\nxactly the wrong vehicle to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discovery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because they perpetuate=\r\n the same dogmatic perspectives that\n&gt; &gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeate the field=\r\n to begin with and cause it to be staying in\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place. Thus al=\r\nl of these applications are chosen with careful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrutiny with a sin=\r\ncere belief in their practical ramifications.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not to mentio=\r\nn the fact that interactive evolution itself has the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practical pote=\r\nntial to change the way we do engineering in some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cases.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can =\r\nyou imagine Picbreeder for furinute instead of pictures?\n&gt; &gt; Or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; cars? Someday that may be how we create highly customized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arti=\r\nfacts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, some of the problems to which you are referring\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nonlinear and multi-objective) may only be possible to sol=\r\nve\n&gt; &gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interactive evolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How many ti=\r\nmes has NEAT, as a monolithic approach, been cited\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succes=\r\nsfully applied by government laboratories and Fortune\n&gt; &gt; 100\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; def=\r\nense firms for these type of &quot;hard&quot; problems?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You=\r\n can refer to the paper on high-energy physics at FermiLab if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;r=\r\ne interested, but I still think there is a bigger picture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn some ways, as researchers in AI, what practitioners are using\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; solve hard problems is exactly what we *don&#39;t* want to use.\n&gt; &gt; After\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all, how is anything ever going to become more powerful if we\n&gt; &gt; j=\r\nust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look to practitioners to show us what methods we should be\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nusing?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; researchers, it is our job to give the practitioner=\r\ns *new*\n&gt; &gt; options,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not the other way around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Prac=\r\ntitioners are often several steps behind algorithm\n&gt; &gt; developers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with good reason.
