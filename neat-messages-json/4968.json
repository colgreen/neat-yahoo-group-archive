Shimon has pointed out that maybe some other neuroevolution approach or even\n&gt; some other machine learning approach could also have done well (although Fermilab did try several approaches that did not fare &gt; as well as NEAT at the time). In a sense it may be luck for NEAT that NEAT happened to be what was on hand. However, in any\n&gt; case, it is to NEAT&#39;s credit that it was indeed the approach used for this accomplishment.\n\n\nYes, potentially something like GP say would be just as good but there\nare potentially a few things in NEAT that come together to make it the\nbest choice currently. I&#39;m thinking of the fact it evolves recursive\nnetworks and also the speciation and fitness sharing. I think there\nare GP variants with these and perhaps a variant with all of the\nabove, but I don&#39;t think the ideas are central to GP. Hence an attempt\nat using &#39;GP&#39; might fail because it depends on understanding those\ndifferences and selecting the appropriate code base. With NEAT however\nthese ideas have been central to the methodology from the outset, thus\nall of the various code bases and papers tend to implement *all* of\nthese ideas and are generally more consistent - it doesn&#39;t matter so\nmuch which one you pick.\n\nI might be wrong but it&#39;s possible. I still think that GP and NEAT\nreally sit within a spectrum of network/function evolution approaches.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
