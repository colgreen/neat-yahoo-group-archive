ES is a good example and in general I have to go \nand look these terms up to remind myself what they mean - and often I \nfind that they aren&#39;t that well defined in the first place.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;[Search Slowdown]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Generally speaking I can confirm this observation. I think in your case\n&gt;&gt;the evaluation time is constant and it&#39;s the increasing complexity of\n&gt;&gt;the solutions that consumes time, yes? which is how I arrived at the\n&gt;&gt;phased pruning idea.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Not really.  I mean at first that is what it is, the initial \n&gt;individuals are so simple that they take no time to evaluate. \n&gt;\nI should perhaps clarify what I mean here. I&#39;m thinking about the \ndistinction between the time spent by the nuts and bolts of the fitness \nfunction rather than the time spent activating the &#39;brain&#39;, whether that \nbe an ANN, SLEAT network or whatever. So e.g. if we&#39;re evolving a \nbipedal walker then as the fitness improves, the actual fitness function \ncode will take longer to execute because the walkers are walking \nfurther, the same is true of many evaluation schemes (game playing, pole \nbalancing, etc).\n\nThis is seperate to the time spent activating the controller/brain, \nwhich also increases as the controller becomes more complex. And then of \ncourse the genetic operators take longer because the genomes they \noperate on are larger, decoding takes longer, etc. A triple whammy of \nperformance degradation if you like.\n\nTherefore your fitness scheme that evaluates all board positions takes \nthe same amount of CPU time regardless of the genome geing evaluated, \nyes? But the fitness function taken as whole gets slower - because it \nincludes activating the brain (for want of a better term).\n\n&gt;&gt;I have to say that working with templates is a breath of fresh air, I\n&gt;&gt;think this new framework is going to make the old one look positively\n&gt;&gt;old hat!\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Excellent!\n&gt;\n&gt;There may be some C# in my new job (not for a while, however), so if \n&gt;I get familiar in it, I might be very interested in your new framework...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&lt;Sales Pitch Warning&gt;\n\nI may have already mentioned this but the newly released Visual Studio \nC# Express is available as a free download from microsoft (just do a \ngoogle). This is built around the new .Net 2.0 engine/framework although \nothers have reported that the existing SharpNEAT solution files import \nand compile with no problem.\n\nOh and there *will* be a fresh release of the existing sharpneat \nframework at some point that includes a re-organisation of the file/dir \nstructure and support for plugging in experiments at load time, rather \nthan compile time - thanks to Ricardo Mendez - plus a few other \ndevelopments. E.g. Real Carbonneau reports some benefit to be had from \nreducing he connection weight mutation rate quite substantially and the \nuse of alternative activation functions.\n\nEver forward :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
