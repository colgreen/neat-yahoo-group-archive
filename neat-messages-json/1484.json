But that&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;not what an ANN does, does it? \n\nWhy not?\n\nIsn&#39;t there a theorem somewhere demonstrating that a multi-layer ANN\ncan approximate any continuous function?\n\nI&#39;m pretty interested in how your project is going, since we might be\nconsidering using a neural network to perform some sort of\npre-processing on our images before identification by the eye.\n\nIs anyone on the list familiar with binarization?  It&#39;s basically the\nprocess of converting all the greyscale values of a greyscale image to\neither black or white, in order to simplify, clarify, or sharpen an\nimage for further processing.  It&#39;s used, for example, to distinguish\nforeground from background.\n\nThis probably won&#39;t be much use for our current data set, but if we&#39;re\nprocessing more complicated images, especially those with low contrast\nor a lot of background noise, we may want to apply some sort of\nbinarization technique before showing it to the ANN eye for\nidentification.\n\nThe simplest and crudest binarization function simply reads the value\nof each pixel, and if it&#39;s below a particular threshold value (e.g.\n177 out of 256 greyscale values), it sets the value to 0, and if it&#39;s\nabove the threshold it sets it to 1.  More complicated functions take\ninto consideration the contrast in a particular area and dynamically\nadjust the threshold accordingly.  For example, one technique uses a\nformula which calculates the threshold based on the mean pixel value\nand standard deviation for the 15x15 region around a given pixel.\n\nSuch a function could be performed by a neural network, right?  And\nsuch an approach is similar to what you&#39;re trying to achieve, isn&#39;t\nit?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
