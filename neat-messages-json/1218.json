I did some tests \nearly on \n&gt; while I was coding the players where I evolved against just one \nstrategy \n&gt; and if I rememebr right, NEAT was able to evolve perfect \nstartegies for \n&gt; playing single opponents that were more (but not 100%) \ndeterministic. \n&gt; It&#39;s only when you give NEAT a range of different opponents and \nincrease \n&gt; the randomness that it starts to suffer.\n&gt; \n\nThe problem with random players is not so much a problem related to \nNEAT but rather a problem for all of machine learning in general.  \nIt is the general problem of noisy evaluation: Something that \nactually isn&#39;t good can get a good evaluation if the random case \nchosen for it is lucky; conversely, it can look bad even if it&#39;s \ngood if the random case is unlucky.  There is no methodological \napproach that I can imagine that can learn through too much noise, \nsince it&#39;s not the learning algorithm but rather the evaluation that \nis inconsistent.  Thus, the best solution is to reduce noise when \nyou can, which in practice means selecting a nice variety of cases \nthat cover the space well, but that you can use over and over again \nconsistently.  Hopefully that will offset the loss of generality \nfrom foregoing some randomness (a little randomness is usually not \ntoo terrible, though, but it&#39;s a art form getting the right amount).\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
