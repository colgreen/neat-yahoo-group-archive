However, it is difficult to make informed a \npriori decisions=\r\n about the initial population before an experiment is \nrun, because little =\r\nmay be known about the structure of the search \nspace.  However, I believe =\r\nthere has been work on the composition of \ninitial populations in GAs and t=\r\nhe right random distribution (e.g. \nuniform vs. normal, or something else) =\r\nof individuals in that \npopulation to best cover the search space.  \n\nThe i=\r\ndea that you might create many initial populations and evaluate \nall of the=\r\nm is not buying any obvious advantage because you still end \nup having to e=\r\nvaluate all those initial populations.  For example, \nlet&#39;s say that the po=\r\npulation size is 100.  Then if you generate 10 \ninitial populations, you en=\r\nd up evaluating 1,000 individuals before \ndeciding in which population to i=\r\nnvest further.  On the other hand, \nif you start with simply one population=\r\n, then after 1,000 evaluatins \nyou will have proceeded 10 generations.  So =\r\nthe question is, which \nwas more effective, evaluating 10 random population=\r\ns, or evaluating \n10 generations of evolutionary search?  \n\nThe answer is n=\r\not obvious because the dynamics of both strategies are \nquite complex and d=\r\nomain-dependent.  One could argue for the \nadvantages of either.  However, =\r\nwhat can be said is that there is no \nknock-down reason that having multipl=\r\ne initial populations will \nimprove efficiency.  \n\nNote that search efficie=\r\nncy is generally considered to be number of \nevaluations, so if 1,000 evalu=\r\nations are added at the get-go, some \nconsequence would need to make up for=\r\n that initial investment. \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.=\r\ncarl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any significance to the composition of genera=\r\ntion zero \nbeyond \n&gt; that of providing a radomized evaluation/starting poin=\r\nt of the \ndesign \n&gt; space?
