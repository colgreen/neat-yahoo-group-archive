I think Kenneth De Jong&#39;s textbook, &quot;Evolutionary\n&gt; Computation: A Unified Perspective&quot; examines it.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, of course as people have pointed out in NEAT it&#39;s not just a\n&gt; question of a healthy population but of healthy species, since each\n&gt; species is like its own little population.  In other words, the\n&gt; species need enough internal diversity to drive their own\n&gt; explorations.  My own rule of thumb has been a minimum of 15 members\n&gt; per species (on average) to keep them healthy.  I&#39;m sure 30 is even\n&gt; safer.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing to note is that the population size you need can vary\n&gt; wildly by problem and it can be surprising.  For pole balancing, it\n&gt; turns out that you can solve it fastest with a minuscule population of\n&gt; size under 20 total (that&#39;s for the whole population!).   That is\n&gt; because smaller populations are greedier (they concentrate resources\n&gt; on a small part of the search space) and apparently pole balancing\n&gt; benefits greatly from greedy search.  However, that is a specific\n&gt; property of pole balancing and I would not expect it to carry over to\n&gt; more significant domains.  Surely in some domains having a population\n&gt; over 1000 would lead to the most interesting results, if only you can\n&gt; afford the luxury of the added computational cost of a large population.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That&#39;s funny. I heard the same thing about 1000...that in ecology if a\n&gt;&gt; species gets under 1000 they really start to worry about the\n&gt; population. I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t think 30 will do it, but I confess I have not read any\n&gt; literature on\n&gt;&gt; it recently.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Anyone else know?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Has anyone done any studies with NEAT on pop size to see what the\n&gt; plot of\n&gt;&gt; pop size vs. fitness looks like?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Matt Simmerson &lt;m.simmerson@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Mon, 13 Oct 2008 21:33:44 -0000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Population sizes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I typically use around 150, but set the target species to 5 using a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; changing compatability threshold.  This gives a rough specie size of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 30. I read somewhere, and I can&#39;t remember where, some article about\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Highland cattle having to have a breeding population of 30 to make the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gene pool viable.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess its also a trade off with time also.  I am evolving Torcs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; controllers for Julain Togelius&#39; CIG 2008 commpetition.  Each\n&gt;&gt;&gt; controller takes around 4 seconds to evaluate.
