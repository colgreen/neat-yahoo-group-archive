T.\n&gt; Evolving coordinated g=\r\naits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE C=\r\nongress on Evolutionary Computing Special\nSection\n&gt; on Evolutionary Robotic=\r\ns, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legged robots show promise for =\r\ncomplex mobility tasks, such as\nnavigating\n&gt; rough terrain, but the design =\r\nof their control software is both\nchallenging\n&gt; and laborious. Traditional =\r\nevolutionary algorithms can produce these\n&gt; controllers, but require manual=\r\n decomposition or other problem\n&gt; simplification because conventionally-use=\r\nd direct encodings have trouble\n&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regularit=\r\nies and symmetries. Such active\n&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits th=\r\ne range of potential\nsolutions, and\n&gt; requires the user to possess a deep u=\r\nnderstanding of the problem&#39;s\n&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that Hyp=\r\nerNEAT, a new and promising\n&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural netwo=\r\nrks, can evolve\nquadruped gaits\n&gt; without manually decomposing the problem.=\r\n Analyses suggest that\nHyperNEAT is\n&gt; successful because it employs a gener=\r\native encoding that can more easily\n&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also =\r\none of the first neuroevolutionary\n&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s g=\r\neometric symmetries, which may\naid its\n&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT =\r\nto FT-NEAT, a direct encoding\ncontrol, and\n&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to=\r\n evolve impressive quadruped gaits and\nvastly\n&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Compar=\r\native analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\nindividuals\n&gt; are more holistically af=\r\nfected by genetic operators, resulting in better\n&gt; coordination of the quad=\r\nruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results suggest that\n&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful a=\r\nlgorithm for evolving control systems for\ncomplex,\n&gt; yet regular, devices, =\r\nsuch as robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michi=\r\ngan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@... &lt;mailto:jclune%40msu.edu&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
