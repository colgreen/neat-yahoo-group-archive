It does sound like what I&#39;m looking for...though\n&gt; I was hoping to find a PhD program to enter directly, though that may\n&gt; not be realistic.  It&#39;s nice that the program is compacted into a\n&gt; year, though I&#39;d guess it&#39;s pretty intensive.\n\nFrom what I saw, most US universities at least require you to do basically \nthe same amount of work as a master&#39;s degree before actually fully \nlaunching on your PhD anyway - but someone who&#39;s actually done that should \nconfirm. If you already have a master&#39;s, PhDs over here are generally \nexpected to take 3 years of research, with a possible 6 or 12 months \nafterwards to write up. This programme has been intensive enough, but \ndefinitely not too bad.\n\n&gt; It sounds a bit like the program at the Univ. of Sussex, which I did\n&gt; run across in my search:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/1-3-2-2-7-1-2.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you (or anyone) heard anything about that program?\n\nI don&#39;t know much about their natural computation program specifically, \nbut some of my coursemates went to sussex as undergraduates and they say \nthat there are some great researchers there, although i think our NC \nprogram is better.\n\n&gt; &gt; Additionally, it only takes 1 year for a master&#39;s degree over here - which\n&gt; &gt; is a good thing because it does tend to be rather expensive in the UK. The\n&gt; &gt; course was designed to identify good researchers, with a strong push to\n&gt; &gt; continue on with a PhD. However, there are far fewer funding options for\n&gt; &gt; americans over here, which is why I&#39;m most likely not going to be able to\n&gt; &gt; continue on here after this year.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s too bad.  That does sound like it might be a significant issue\n&gt; for me.  Do they not offer research assistantships, or work programs,\n&gt; or something similar?\n\nJoe already mentioned the ORS, which is pretty much the only option for \namerican students; however, some places might offer international teaching \nassistantships, although its a bit hit or miss. The ORS looks almost \nexclusively at your undergrad grades (which was bad for me :() and \nexcellent references. Schools will each usually get a certain amount of \nORSs (the ORS is from the UK government), so some places are more \ncompetitive for them than others. However, the ORS does not apply to MSc \nprograms; those you pretty much just have to pay for. Other schools might \nhave more options but I personally just bit the bullet. And I keep telling \nmyself that it was worth it, over and over. It was worth it, right? :) \nActually, with the dollar so weak against the pound I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m \nmaking money in pounds or else I&#39;d be screwed :)\n\n&gt; So are you finishing up your degree program this summer?  Are you\n&gt; working on a thesis right now?\n\nThe way this particular program works is that there are 3 courses in the \nfall, 3 in the spring, and one &quot;mini-project&quot; each semester which takes up \nabout half of the time. Then for the summer we choose one of the two \nmini-projects and extend into a publishable project. I just finished exams \nlast week so I&#39;m taking a bit of a break but I should be starting my \nsummer project in earnest in the next week or two. The courses were for \nthe most part excellent master&#39;s level courses and I certainly learned a \ngreat deal, about evolutionary computation especially. I&#39;m a little \ndisappointed with the projects that I chose to do - you&#39;re given pretty \nmuch free choice if you can find a supervisor who will agree to supervise \nit.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the info.\n\nno problem!\n\n-KB-\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------\n k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n msc natural computation : the university of birmingham \n http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/             \n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
