I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a lowly C/C++ coder, and don&#39;t know\nanythi=\r\nng really about C#. I believe the SharpNEAT C# version is one of\nthe more p=\r\nolished NEAT libraries.\n\nThere&#39;s a 3 part tutorial using the C# version sta=\r\nrting here that might help:\nhttp://www.nashcoding.com/2010/07/17/tutorial-e=\r\nvolving-neural-networks-with-sharpneat-2-part-1/\n\nThat might help a bit. If=\r\n you have problems with going through the C#\ncode, the python version might=\r\n help. From what I understand, python is\na very intuitive language. I&#39;m not=\r\n sure if they&#39;ve released any code\nyet. There&#39;s also the Java version.\n\nSor=\r\nry I wasn&#39;t more help.

If you&#39;re particular about sticking with his implementation and C++=\r\n (his is a relatively simple implementation of NEAT from what I understand)=\r\n I can send you my code if you want (buggy work in progress).\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not =\r\na simple example at all (competitive coevolution), but it would give you so=\r\nme code examples and bug fixes to Mat Buckland&#39;s original implementation (m=\r\nine is a Linux port). Probably only useful to you for looking at the change=\r\ns I made to Mr. Buckland&#39;s code, but that would be easy as most of the code=\r\n is the same, and the classes retained their names from those described in =\r\nhis book.\n&gt;\n&gt; You might want to start with getting his minesweeper (was tha=\r\nt it?) example application running, and try putting in some of the bug fixe=\r\ns folks have recommended in his implementation (I think I can help find tho=\r\nse). Once you have that working, you might want to try the XOR test, and pe=\r\nrhaps pole balancing. I believe those are common tasks to undertake.\n&gt;\n&gt; Le=\r\nt me know if you want any code, or have any questions I might be able to he=\r\nlp with. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m far from a NEAT guru, but I don&#39;t think too many fo=\r\nlks are working with Mat Buckland&#39;s implementation now. I think that&#39;s a gr=\r\neat book, and that chapter helped me considerably in getting started workin=\r\ng with NEAT.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Drew\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 2:01 AM, adeleh ebrahim=\r\ni &lt;adlh_ebrahimi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everybody\n&gt; I am new in learnin=\r\ng NEAT.
