So if for\n&gt; &gt;example there was a partial mechanical failure the\n&gt; NN could adapt (as a\n&gt; &gt;human would) to controling the system with it&#39;s new\n&gt; dynamics\n&gt; \n&gt; How about making the simulation slightly randomised\n&gt; as regards the\n&gt; capabilities of the vehicle? (ie. Each training run\n&gt; would involve a vehicle\n&gt; with slightly different acceleration, or maybe a\n&gt; wheel not working, or\n&gt; something like that.) That way, the network would\n&gt; evolve to have a degree of\n&gt; flexibility, and determine its capabilities from its\n&gt; sensory feedback. In\n&gt; fact, if you slightly randomised your physical laws\n&gt; too, this might allow\n&gt; the network to better deal with the inevitable\n&gt; differences between the\n&gt; simulation and the real world, when it was placed\n&gt; into the vehicle.\n\nI agree with your thinking here, and its true that an\nANN can be evolved that deals with randomness.  In my\nthinking about this problem, I had planned to have\nrandomness in the &quot;boulders&quot;.  There would be a random\nnumber of boulders, in random locations, and with\nrandom diameters.  There would also be a user option\nfor a non-random run.  I had not thought about\nrandomness in the vehicle characteristics or the\ntraction of the sand, etc.  All of that is certainly\npossible, and could result in a very robust ANN\ncontroller.\n\nThis approach might be of great value if you want to\nuse the controller in a real vehicle.  It means that\nthe simulation does not have to be as accurate,\nbecause you are covering all bases, so to speak.\n \nAll of that is done in EvSail, except that the\nrandomness there is in the wind speed and direction,\nand in the boat&#39;s starting location.  EvSail succeeds\nin evolving controllers that handle this randomness. \nAs one might expect, it takes a lot longer than the\nnon-random case.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
