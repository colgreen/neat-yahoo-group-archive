The original seed topology (no \nhidden nodes) \n&gt; was still alive and kicking, and battling it out for first place \nin the \n&gt; population, which means that things weren&#39;t exactly progressing...\n&gt; \n\nLast time I looked at your fitness graph it was going up; why do you \nfeel things weren&#39;t improving?  As long as things are improving \nthere&#39;s nothing wrong with the simplest topology persisting.  \nActually that&#39;s what you&#39;d hope to happen because it means that the \ncurrent level of fitness can be achieved with a very small network, \nand you want to keep things small for as long as possible.\n\nken\n\n&gt; So I decided to speed things up.  I chopped down the number of \nnetworks in \n&gt; the population so that packets get returned sooner.  Found a bug \nin my \n&gt; offspring allocation code in the process...oops...but that&#39;s fixed \nnow.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I&#39;m trying to get through the generations faster in an \nattempt to \n&gt; make some progress.  Problem is, I think I may have done myself a \n&gt; disservice.  By having the evaluation code start at the reduction \nside and \n&gt; work its way up to enlargement, it seems the pressure is to create \na network \n&gt; that merely averages its pixel inputs.  And I&#39;m not convinced that \nit will \n&gt; be able to (easily) break away from that pressure, even as \ntopology is \n&gt; added.  It might, but I&#39;m thinking that I would be better off if I \njust went \n&gt; ahead and calculated all activations rather than trying to short-\ncircuit the \n&gt; calculations for less fit networks.  What do you guys think?\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
