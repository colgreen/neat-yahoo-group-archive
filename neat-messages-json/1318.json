I haven&#39;t written the code that does that yet.  I&#39;ve been \nputting it off because I can tell by the fitness values that it isn&#39;t able \nto do much more than average its inputs, which is a far cry from \nenlargement.\n\nSince I have so heavily modified the fitness evaluation, I decided to go \nahead and restart the experiment.  My patience is not what it was, so I&#39;ve \ncut the number of networks down to a maximum of 100 so I can get through the \npackets faster.  I want to see the generations tick by faster so I can have \na better idea of how it&#39;s doing.  Of course, it doesn&#39;t explore as many \ntopologies at once this way, so whether or not it is truly faster is \narguable.\n\nAnother thing I have decided to do is to extend my training samples, sort \nof.  For each original image, I&#39;m going to make a copy that is 1/2 the \noriginal size.  And another that is 1/3rd, 1/4th, and 1/5th.  That way, I \nknow that the networks are being exposed too more than just gradients.  \nCross your fingers, let&#39;s hope that helps.  :)\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
