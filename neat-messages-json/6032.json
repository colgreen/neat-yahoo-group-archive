Each subfield\nof AI has =\r\na different perspective on intelligence and unspoken\nassumptions about what=\r\n is critical to recreate it computationally. To\nbetter understand such diff=\r\nerences, we aim to bring together a diverse\ngroup of AI researchers interes=\r\nted in discussing and comparing how\nintelligence and processes that might c=\r\nreate it are abstracted in\nvarious subfields. For example, such discussion =\r\nmay include honest\nexamination of the strengths and weaknesses of different=\r\n approaches,\nand what features of biological intelligence are crucial or\nun=\r\nnecessary to include in algorithms.\n\nWe hope to encourage cross-pollination=\r\n of ideas between researchers\nviewing intelligence in different ways (e.g. =\r\nthrough the lens of MDPs\nor symbolic manipulation) and at  different levels=\r\n of abstraction\n(e.g. biologically-plausible neural simulations or restrict=\r\ned\nBoltzmann machines). One goal is to facilitate  revising or creating\nnew=\r\n abstractions of intelligence and intelligence-generating\nprocesses. More i=\r\nnformation can be found here:\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~risi/AAAISymposium2013=\r\n/\n\nContributions related to how intelligence can or should be abstracted\nal=\r\ngorithmically in artificial intelligence research are invited.\nExtended abs=\r\ntracts that summarize the results of a research program\nalong these lines a=\r\nre most welcome, as are personal position papers or\ncontributions describin=\r\ng speculative work or work in progress. Works\nbridging traditionally separa=\r\nte AI paradigms are encouraged.\nParticipants should be open to inspiration =\r\nfrom work and ideas in\nother subfields, and be willing to step outside thei=\r\nr intellectual\ncomfort zones.\n\nInterested participants are encouraged to su=\r\nbmit extended abstracts\n(no more than 2 pages), or full-length papers (up t=\r\no 6 pages in AAAI\nformat) in PDF format to sebastian.risi@.... Acce=\r\npted\nsubmissions will be published as citable, peer-reviewed papers in the\n=\r\nAAAI technical report.\n\nAreas of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n=\r\n- Different levels and types of knowledge representation and reasoning\n- Ab=\r\nstractions of the following:\n   - Neural networks (e.g. deep learning netwo=\r\nrks, spiking ANNs, and\nplastic ANNs)\n   - Learning (e.g. machine learning a=\r\nnd reinforcement learning)\n   - Biological development (e.g. generative and=\r\n developmental\nsystems, and developmental robotics)\n   - Evolutionary searc=\r\nh (e.g. digital evolution and evolutionary\nalgorithms)\n- Biologically-inspi=\r\nred computation\n   - Evolutionary robotics\n   - Swarm intelligence\n   - Art=\r\nificial life\n- Philosophical arguments on characteristics of appropriate ab=\r\nstractions for\nAI\n\nThe symposium will be held Friday - Sunday, November 15-=\r\n17 at the\nWestin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, Virginia (adjacent to\nWash=\r\nington, DC).\n\n** Invited Speakers **\nAndrew Ng (Stanford University, USA)\nM=\r\nore TBD\n\n** Schedule **\nFull Paper/Extended Abstract Submission: May 24, 20=\r\n13\nNoti=EF=AC=81cation: June 21, 2013\nFinal Camera-ready Paper/Extended Abs=\r\ntract: September 12, 2013\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.
