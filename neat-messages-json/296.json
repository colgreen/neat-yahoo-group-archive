By the way, if you download either \nMattias Fagerlund&#39;s demos or Ugo Vierruci&#39;s JNEAT, you can watch XOR \nin action and see how solutions should look.\n\nHow many generations are your runs going?  How many species are you \nseeing form?  What does your fitness graph look like?  When does it \ntypically lift off the plateau (where it still hasn&#39;t made the \ncrucial connection that allows the problem to be solved)?\n\nI would expect typical solutions to range between 1 and 4 hidden \nnodes, and 10 and 22 connections.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Philip and I now have a new fully-implemented version\n&gt; of NEAT and we&#39;re in the process of ironing out the\n&gt; major wrinkles.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;d like to duplicate similar results to Ken&#39;s\n&gt; original experiment with XOR.  We&#39;ve tried several\n&gt; different approaches to the fitness function, but no\n&gt; matter what we try, the average network size rises to\n&gt; 20-30 genes within a 15 or 20 generations, and by the\n&gt; end of a typical run we have 80-100 gene networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Presumably, we should be getting XOR networks that\n&gt; have a very small number of genes...correct?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Did anyone else run into this issue when implementing\n&gt; NEAT?  Did those of you who implemented a version of\n&gt; NEAT verify its functionality with XOR?\n&gt; \n&gt; We could lower the mutation rates (we&#39;re using the\n&gt; default parameters from Ken&#39;s original paper), but\n&gt; we&#39;d like to duplicate similar results with the same\n&gt; experimental parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek James\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
