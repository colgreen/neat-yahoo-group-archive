It has 7 inputs and=\r\n 1 output and \n&gt; usually around 3 or 4 hidden nodes, but the program still =\r\nruns out of \n&gt; memory on 32bit Windows, with 4GB of RAM. Task Manager shows=\r\n the slow \n&gt; but inexorable increase in memory size. The limit is usually h=\r\nit around \n&gt; 10,000 generations. It sounds a lot but tests on random Out-of=\r\n-Sample \n&gt; data, whenever there is an improvement in performance would sugg=\r\nest that \n&gt; we haven&#39;t yet reached over-fitting.\n&gt; \n&gt; So... is there anythi=\r\nng I can do to avoid the need to keep the complete \n&gt; generation history, w=\r\nhich seems to be the root of the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a different problem =\r\nto that I cited in my message of 13-Jan-2011.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Rob Marsden\n&gt; Gist=\r\nix (Northern) Limited\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
