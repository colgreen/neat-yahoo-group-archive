Unlike the other neurons, the input neurons are constantly firing, their signals don&#39;t reset to 0 after they fire.\n&gt;   \n\nThere shouldn&#39;t be any connections going *to* input nodes, only from \nthem. If you are seeing such connections then that is a bug. The input \nneurons in SharpNEAT are nothing more than memory locations with a value \nin them, whatever value you put in that location at each timestep will \nbe what gets applied to the nodes that read signals from that node. So \nif you want the input to be applied only on the first timestep then set \nthe input nodes to 0 after the first activation.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; A side question is that if I save a population in SharpNEAT as an XML file, is some information lost? Whenever I reload a population from file, it&#39;s not as fit as when it left off.\n&gt;   \n\nThere are a couple of possibilities here.\n\n1) When you save and reload a population a lot some state information is \nlost such as the current value of the speciation threshold and which \ngenomes are in which species. Therefore the population is re-speciated \nwhen you start a new run, potentially in a detrimental way if the \nspeciation threshold is way off what it should be, and some of the good \ngenomes may get culled from the population. E.g if the threshold is too \nhigh then all genomes might get put into one species, the non-elite \ngenomes are culled from this species and replaced with new (generally \nlow fitness) offspring. This results in a lower overall population \nfitness than if you had re-speciated into several species, each with \ntheir own elite (I think!). WEll anyway it won;t be exactly the same result.\n\n2) Some precision may be lost in the (de)serialization of the floating \npoint numbers that make up a genome. This is a problem that has been \nfixed in the past but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it popped up again, \ne.g. if you&#39;re running on .Net 2.0.\n\nHope that helps some,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
