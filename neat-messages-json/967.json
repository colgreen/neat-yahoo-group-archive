Natural neurons \nare generally much more complicated and more diverse than typical \nANN&#39;s.  For example, natural neurons change their connections \nweights dynamically during activation.  (See our paper on Adaptive \nNeural Networks for a NEAT implementation of this)  Also, natural \nneurons integrate activation over time, rather than working in \ndiscrete steps.  There are models for doing this in ANN&#39;s as well.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Umer Iqbal&quot; &lt;umeriqbal81@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I haven&#39;t studied much biology, so could someone guide me on this \npoint?\n&gt; We usually make ANNs with neurons that take the weighted some of \nall inputs, apply a function, and give the same result to all its \noutputs.\n&gt; Is this the case in nature as well? Is it that simple? or does the \nresult vary across different outputs? and does it vary drastically?\n&gt; \n&gt; If i&#39;ve started asking questions outside the scope of this \ndiscussion group, plz let me know :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Umer..\n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Colin Green \n&gt;   To: neat@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, June 03, 2004 3:49 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [neat] Re: Connections\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Hi Umer,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I agree with John that multiple connections between two given \nneurons \n&gt;   would be redundant. You can still represent the full range of \nvalues AND \n&gt;   reduce precision at the same time. This is sort of what is \nalready done \n&gt;   in Kens NEAT by the using the weight mutation exponent (I think \nthat&#39;s \n&gt;   what it&#39;s called). This effectively defines the size of weight \n&gt;   modifications, a larger weight mutation value gives you less \npossible \n&gt;   values between the minimum and maximum weight, hence reducing \nthe search \n&gt;   space. I might be wrong on this one with reagrds to Ken&#39;s NEAT, \nbut the \n&gt;   idea stands - if you only allow a limited set of values for \nconnection \n&gt;   weights you limit the search space. You wouldn&#39;t want to limit \nit too \n&gt;   much, otherwise you might not be able to fully explore the \nimportant \n&gt;   areas of, say, the sigmoid activation function.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Colin\n&gt; \n&gt;   Umer Iqbal wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Since, natural neural networks work good enough :), couldn&#39;t \n&gt;   &gt; decreasing our precision and allowing multiple connections be \na better \n&gt;   &gt; way of making ANNs?\n&gt;   &gt; I dont have any idea how this might be achieved.. but I \nbelieve that \n&gt;   &gt; the simpler we keep our domain and smaller our search space, \nthe \n&gt;   &gt; easier it would be to come up with solutions..\n&gt;   &gt; If we could give higher probability of changing weights than \nadding \n&gt;   &gt; new connections, we would in effect be searching in a \nconcentrated \n&gt;   &gt; part of the search-space first before moving to higher levels..\n&gt;   &gt; That brings me to another idea that I once had: Shouldn&#39;t we \ndecrease \n&gt;   &gt; the precision of our weights?\n&gt;   &gt; Since searching in let&#39;s say 15 digits after decimal would be \nmany \n&gt;   &gt; times more difficult than searching in 8-10 digits after \ndecimal.\n&gt;   &gt; And the results would not differ much.\n&gt;   &gt; What do the others say?\n&gt;   &gt; Can we achieve this somehow?\n&gt;   &gt;  \n&gt;   &gt; Umer..\n&gt;   &gt;  \n&gt;   &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
