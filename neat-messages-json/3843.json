It&#39;s interesting to that George Marsaglia&#39;s KISS RNG\nis given the thumbs up, I used his XOR shift algorithm as the basis\nfor my FastRandom class in SharpNeat. I may well switch over to using\nthe KISS algorithm though based on the discussion in this article. Oh\nand also someone made a comment on the codeproject page where\nFastRandom lives - &quot;Worst ever random generator!...Passes FIPS 140-1\nwith approximately 0.7 %. &quot;\n\nNot sure why this guy was so passionate about RNG&#39;s but I do intend to\ncheck out this FIPS test one day.\n\nOverall though I don&#39;t think NEAT is going to be particularly harmed\nby the kind of flaws inherent in some of these RNGs. For most of what\nwe do we just want uniformly distributed numbers to mix things up a\nbit. Any patterns in the generated sequence probably aren&#39;t\nparticularly detrimental IMHO. Interested to know if others agree or\nnot.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
