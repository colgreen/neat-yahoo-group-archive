Most places I looked at also r=\r\nequired\nthat your PhD be in an established field (such as Computer Science)=\r\n,\nwith only an emphasis on Cognitive Science.\n\nb) They have an &quot;Artificial =\r\nNeural Networks Analysis Project\nLaboratory&quot;.  I don&#39;t know the details, bu=\r\nt it was encouraging that\nthey&#39;re working with artificial neural networks.\n=\r\n\nc) The director of the program was friendly and receptive in\ncommunication=\r\ns.  It&#39;s a smaller school and a relatively small program,\nso I felt I would=\r\n probably have more freedom to pursue what I was\ninterested in.
