So when we do add color, we \nwant to=\r\n do it the best way possible.  In fact, there are many ways \nof doing color=\r\n with CPPNs, and we are going to make sure we do \nsomething sensible that p=\r\nreserve&#39;s Picbreeder&#39;s ability to evolve \nobjects that look meaningful.  It=\r\n may be something that has not been \ntried before (and may not be based on =\r\nRGB).  Ideally it will also \nallow users to colorize existing black and whi=\r\nte images too and \nevolve from there.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, St=\r\nephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you considered this?  =\r\nWhy did you go with a single dimension \nof  \n&gt; output?\n&gt; \n&gt; I imagine that =\r\nwith the monochromatic version, it&#39;s easier to \nobtain  \n&gt; recognizable obj=\r\nects, because we are focussed primarily on shapes \nand  \n&gt; shading (depth).=\r\n  But in RGB I bet it would be harder to obtain  \n&gt; recognizable objects be=\r\ncause while we might obtain the right \nshapes,  \n&gt; the colors would seem od=\r\nd.
