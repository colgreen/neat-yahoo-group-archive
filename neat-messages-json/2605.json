The Python program uses the captured output to create the animation.\n\nSailChallenge consists of a physics model and a controller function which create a\nvirtual sailboat and a virtual yachtsman.  The &quot;yachtsman&quot; sets the sails and rudder and\nthe model moves the boat accordingly.  This is updated in small time steps to create a\ntrajectory.\n\nThe purpose of SailChallenge is to invite others to create their own version of the\ncontroller function and compare its performance to ours.  Our virtual yachtsman is an\nANN that is the result of neuroevolution.  You are welcome to create your own, using\nNEAT, or any technology of your choice.\n\nSailChallenge-2.0 also contains an alternate controller function which does not use an\nANN.  It is a hand-coded sailboat controller which attempts to crudely simulate the\ndecisions of a human yachtsman. \n\nAmple documentation is include in the downloadable package.  It will run on Windows or\nlinux systems.  Python is required; this is a free download from python.org.\n\nThere is a screenshot on our website.\n\n\n\n\nMitchell Timin\n\nI&#39;m proud of http://ANNEvolve.sourceforge.net.  I&#39;m currently working on a major update of the SailChallenge package.  If you want to write software, or articles, or do testing for ANNEvolve, let me know.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
