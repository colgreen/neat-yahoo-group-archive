Dawkins seems\nto suggest that the genome specifies mechanisms for building the\nstructure of the brain, and not the structure of the brain itself.  If\nthat&#39;s the case, then it isn&#39;t neccessary to search the space of\npossible structures, correct?\n\nThat said, I&#39;ve thought the same about the space defined by the genome\nitself.  30,000 genes is 30,000 dimensions, and 4 billion years seems\nlike scant time to search it.  Two points which I rely on are (1)\nGenerations were occuring much more rapidly for microorganisms (and on\na much smaller genome), so a billion years is a long time and (2) The\nsearch space isn&#39;t being searched for, say, a human-like solution all\nat once.  Rather, it is searched through gradual complexification, so\nthat by the time humans are about to emerge, things like legs, lungs,\nand circulatory systems have already been sorted out.  This is also\none reason I find NEAT so compelling.\n\nOn Jan 4, 2008 1:23 AM, Thomas Johnson &lt;thomas.j.johnson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; These people must have email addresses, why not follow up with them that\n&gt; way?

Of course you\n&gt; &gt; can always speculate on how a little can be converted to a lot by\n&gt; &gt; talking about fractals and subroutines (after all, that&#39;s just\n&gt; &gt; compression), but when you realize that we are talking about\n&gt; &gt; *searching* a space of such mappings, it becomes far more complicated\n&gt; &gt; and profound. The problem then becomes compounded by the fact that\n&gt; &gt; not only must the representation be efficient but it must also warp\n&gt; &gt; in meaningful ways, e.g. a biped should have biped children. How\n&gt; &gt; does natural evolution manage to induce such a nicely structured\n&gt; &gt; search space? Not a word was said on the matter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, after I saw the video..

Like you said, they sort of answered accurately, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was no real insight or thoughtfulness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s interesting that you point out this exchange because I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; highlights a weakness in how biologists have been dealing with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question of complexity. It&#39;s such a fundamental question yet it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t really received the treatment it deserves, even from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field&#39;s luminaries. I think part of the problem is that a\n&gt; &gt; genuine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treatment requires a kind of algorithmic and representational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theory,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is perhaps better attacked from a computational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; putting evolutionary computation researchers at an advantage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we think about search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; routinely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I think you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably come at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem from an angle that might be more productive, but I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially disappointed in Wolpert, who was the main voice for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developmental biology on the panel. Your question gets to issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a developmental biologist should primarily be interested in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the\n&gt; &gt; development\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the human brain, he should have been able to give other examples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he was more familiar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A small\n&gt; &gt; step\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T0V-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3Y6PFXS-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1P&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e43\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The more than 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface without a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comparable increase in its thickness during mammalian evolution is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis of cortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development. According to the proposed model, cortical expansion\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the result of changes in proliferation kinetics that increase the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; number of radial columnar units without changing the number of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neurons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within each unit significantly. Thus, mutation of a regulatory\n&gt; &gt; gene\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that controls the timing and ratio of symmetric and asymmetric\n&gt; &gt; modes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of cell divisions in the proliferative zone, coupled with radial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints in the distribution of migrating neurons, could\n&gt; &gt; create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expanded cortical plate with enhanced capacity for establishing\n&gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns of connectivity that are validated through natural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; selection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m personally working under the assumption that the cortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minicolumn is the primary module, that repeatable bit of code that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dawkins talked about, and there are a number of good work by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biologists out there, including Rakic, who give support to such an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps they were just being curt or did not take the audience\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously enough to elaborate their thoughts. Yet I find that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanation doubtful given that we were after all at\n&gt; &gt; a &quot;debate&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and complexity, which is precisely the substance of\n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. I also agree that Dawkins seemed closest to really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would be very\n&gt; &gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our area of EC if only there was an opportunity to tell him\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.
