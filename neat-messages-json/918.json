What should be done is that species numbers get recorded\nsuch that they can be restored, and also the compat_thresh needs to be\nremembered in the case of dynamic thresholding.  Otherwise, species\nwill be renumbered on each generation, and you will forget what your\nthreshold is.\n\nSo are you saying you intend to write NEAT in Perl or just modify an\nexisting NEAT and connect it to Perl?  Either way it&#39;s an interesting\nidea, but is Perl fast enough to be the main body of NEAT?  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking I want:\n&gt; \n&gt; An executable that encapsulates the NEAT-specific functionality. \nFor \n&gt; example,\n&gt; \n&gt; $ neat-gen &lt;settings&gt;.xml &lt;in-pop&gt;.xml &lt;in-fit&gt;.xml &lt;out-pop&gt;.xml \n&gt; &lt;out-phenotype&gt;.xml\n&gt; \n&gt; Why separate it out from the main experiment loop?  Because I want\nthe \n&gt; experiment loop to be controlled by CGI scripts.  I want it to be \n&gt; event-driven.  I want an experiment to be able to pick right up\nwhere it \n&gt; left off after a reboot or power outage.  Because my ultimate goal\nis a \n&gt; distributed NEAT that may take months to get anywhere... :(\n&gt; \n&gt; Those of you with an existing NEAT implementation could probably\nconvert it \n&gt; for use in this manner in about a half-hour, huh?  :)  And if you\nare \n&gt; willing to save me the effort, I wouldn&#39;t complain...\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, I&#39;ll probably build it in Perl, since that&#39;s the language\nI&#39;m the \n&gt; most proficient in.  (YANI...yet another neat implementation.  :-) )\n Before \n&gt; I begin, would any of you like to give me some tips or suggestions?\n Some \n&gt; design suggestions that you perhaps wish you had thought of before\nyou \n&gt; started?  Anything?  Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; -- John\n\n\n"}}
