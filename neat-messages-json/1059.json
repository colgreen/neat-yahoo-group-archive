Each test would obviously be slower, but it could be as parrellel\n&gt;as the number of users, and the accuracy of the results would be very\n&gt;high, statisticly speaking. That&#39;s a great idea.\n\nWell, actually, now that you mention it...After I get my image enlargement \nexperiment running, I&#39;ve got another experiment in mind that is based on \nhuman generated data.  It&#39;s not QUITE the same thing, but close...\n\nI currently have a database of pictures I&#39;ve taken.  I have a web page where \nit shows me two pictures side-by-side.  I click on the one I like better.  I \nuse that data to build a ranking so that the best pictures appear first in \nthe list.  It works well.\n\nI&#39;d like to extract a bunch of &#39;characteristics&#39; from each image, and use \nthose as inputs into a neural network, and use that data as the training \ndata.  Then, when I add a bunch of new pictures to the database, I can let \nthe network pre-classify their relationship to the others.  If the network \ndoesn&#39;t have a CLEAR preference, it passes on the comparison.  When it is \ndone, the best pictures automatically end up near the top, the dogs \nautomatically fall to the bottom.\n\n\n\n"}}
