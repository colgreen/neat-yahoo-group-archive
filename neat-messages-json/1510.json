If I remember correctly, in nature genes are\n&gt;&gt;usually marked out with certain short sequences of DNA. Perhaps we could\n&gt;&gt;introduce the concept of a marker gene into the NEAT genome. We could\n&gt;&gt;then implement a multipoint crossover technique that is marker aware and\n&gt;&gt;hopefully genes would become re-ordered into functionaly dependent\n&gt;&gt;groups far more efficiently than using plain old random multipoint\n&gt;&gt;crossover. [...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I guess you are talking about the common, short repetitive sequences found \n&gt;in the Junk DNA?\n&gt;\n&gt;They are not used as labels.  It&#39;s purely position on the chromosome and \n&gt;homology between the two chromosomes which determines their alignment \n&gt;before crossover (they are physically lined-up next to each other). \n&gt;\nI may be getting confused. I think I read an article about finding genes \nwithin all the data generated by the human genome project, I think there \nare certain sequences that indicate that a gene end is nearby. In fact \nthey could well include the repeated sequences you mentioned - yes I \nread something on those also. But because a tell tale sequence exists \ndoes not mean that the genetic machinery is actually using it. Sure.\n\n&gt; There \n&gt;is (used to be) some talk that repetitive sequences increase the \n&gt;probability of sequence duplication (which happens by misaligning the \n&gt;chromosomes before crossover, and leads to one output with two copies of a \n&gt;section, and one with none).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThere was something in a recent Sci.Am. I think it was related to \nsections of DNA that didn&#39;t twist back into the double helix properly, \nforming loops that stick out from the main DNA helix. During duplication \nthey get jammed in the machinery, say like a piece of paper getting \nstuck in the photocopier thus causing the copy to have an even longer \nrepreated sequence.\n\n&gt;Don&#39;t let that stop you, however, we don&#39;t need to take every idea from nature.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m developing the idea. I&#39;ll keep the group posted.\n\n\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;What you are describing is what I call an Arbitrary Label System \n&gt;(ALS).  It&#39;s part of a body of proposed research that I am slowly writing \n&gt;up as a position document.  I will announce the document here when I get it \n&gt;done.  (I&#39;m not claiming to have invented the idea, I don&#39;t know where I \n&gt;got it from.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHave you read the Modular NEAT paper? Sounds similar except your labels \ncould be used to connect up disperate networks right, whereas Mod. NEAT \nmodules always connect between the input and output layers, they don;t \nconnect to each other.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
