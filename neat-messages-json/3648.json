Those are interesting\n&gt;  statistics. It is indeed best to avoid reevaluating an organism that\n&gt;  is the same as one that has come before. 10% is not terrible but it\n&gt;  does mean evolution could have been even faster.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Investigation of redundant organisms in NEAT using standard param\n&gt;  &gt; values has shown an approximate 10 percent redundancy factor as\n&gt;  follows:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Population Size: 100\n&gt;  &gt; Number Outputs: 10 (i.e. 10-dimensional coordinate space)\n&gt;  &gt; Distance Tolerance: 1.0E-6 (in non-normalized coordinates)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Duplicates in Generation 1 were ignored.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;A&quot; = Generation Number\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;B&quot; = Cum # of Redundant Organisms (i.e. less than tol distance\n&gt;  apart)\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;C&quot; = Total Number of Organisms Evaluated\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; 1,0,100\n&gt;  &gt; 2,8,200\n&gt;  &gt; 3,17,300\n&gt;  &gt; 4,30,400\n&gt;  &gt; 5,44,500\n&gt;  &gt; 6,56,600\n&gt;  &gt; 7,65,700\n&gt;  &gt; 8,76,800\n&gt;  &gt; 9,94,900\n&gt;  &gt; 10,115,1000\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In instances in which the fitness computational requirements are\n&gt;  non-\n&gt;  &gt; trivial, screening and fitness substitution for redundant organisms\n&gt;  is\n&gt;  &gt; justified.
