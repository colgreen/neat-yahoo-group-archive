I assumed it&#39;s all one\n&gt; needs but maybe there&#39;s other important information.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; no, not even close.  I was just giving it as an example of information\n&gt; that may be useful (or more useful) beyond just the raw data (e.g. the\n&gt; cards in your hands, the community cards, betting history, etc).\n&gt; \n&gt; - jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; ...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\n&gt; interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\n&gt; in, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\n&gt; well, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\n&gt; idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\n&gt; gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\n&gt; hanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\n&gt; because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\n&gt; in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\n&gt; think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Douglas Adams\n\n-- \n&quot;Feel free&quot; - 5 GB Mailbox, 50 FreeSMS/Monat ...\nJetzt GMX ProMail testen: www.gmx.net/de/go/mailfooter/promail-out\n\n"}}
