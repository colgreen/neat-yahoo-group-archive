I always hate\nit when othe=\r\nr people forget to do that. :S Oh well...\n\nAnyway, I did search back immedi=\r\nately after posting and I did find\nyour post on &quot;continuous speciation cont=\r\nrol&quot;, but, although your\nmethod looks promissing, your post did not answer =\r\nThe One Question:\nHow well were the individuals spread out over your specie=\r\ns? Your\noutput shows that the number of species stays around your target of=\r\n\n30, but it does not show the sizes of these species. Maybe half of\nyour po=\r\npulation was concentrated in single specie and all other\nspecies contained =\r\nonly 1 or 2 chromosomes? (That&#39;s the result I am\ngetting using Stanley&#39;s me=\r\nthod.) Would that even be a bad thing?\n\nBas\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;          If you look back a =\r\nfew weeks to me posts on &quot;continuous \n&gt; speciation control&quot; that might help=\r\n you.\n&gt; \n&gt;          I was doing things differently in that I was adding and=\r\n \n&gt; killing individuals one at a time, but you can probably adjust the \n&gt; i=\r\ndeas to a generational approach...\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At 13:39 05/11=\r\n/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m evolving an extension of Stanley & =\r\nMiikulainen&#39;s robot duel domain\n&gt; &gt;in ANJI 2.01, but I&#39;m having trouble set=\r\nting the speciation threshold.\n&gt; &gt;If I set it too high, all of my 100 chrom=\r\nosomes will (of course) stay\n&gt; &gt;in one specie.

On his FAQ\n&gt; &gt;(http://www.cs.ut=\r\nexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html), Kenneth Stanley\n&gt; &gt;himself presents a m=\r\nethod to automatically set the speciation\n&gt; &gt;threshold by descreasing or in=\r\ncreasing it with, say, 0.3, whenever the\n&gt; &gt;number of species becomes more =\r\nor less than a preset target amount of,\n&gt; &gt;say, 10.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;However, when I =\r\napply this method (with population size 100 and target\n&gt; &gt;species count 10)=\r\n, then after some 100 generations I end up with 20 to\n&gt; &gt;25 species and a s=\r\npeciation threshold of 40 and rising. Of the\n&gt; &gt;resulting species, one spec=\r\nie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\n&gt; &gt;contain 5 chromosomes or less and=\r\n 10 species contain just one\nchromosome.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Has anyone else encountered=\r\n such problems before, or have some idea to\n&gt; &gt;what might be causing this? =\r\nHow do you keep a &#39;normal&#39; amount of more\n&gt; &gt;or less equally sized species?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
