Trimming is \nperformed periodically.  It has the effect of evaluating every \nfeature of the genome, and if removing it does not reduce fitness, \ndiscarding it.\n\n\tTrimming is necessary to keep genomes down to reasonable sizes.  It \nis obviously a bit of a hack.  If CPU were no object, then one could \navoid anything like this altogether, and just allow the natural \nbalance of the insert and delete mutations (*) to arrive at an \nequilibrium genome size (**).  Of course, I could just increase the \ndeletion probability until the natural size was not too large.  But \nthe risk there is, since some proportion of the genome will be \nrequired to make the individual fit, too high a deletion rate will \njust swamp the system with individuals who all have &quot;something \nmissing&quot; and have to be eliminated.\n\n\t[[(*) yes, I have deletion mutations in this\n\n\t  (**) the insertion rate is not dependent on the number of elements\n\t        in the genome, but deletion is considered once per element,\n                   therefore, left to itself, the genome would increase until\n\t        insert_chance = delete_chance * num_elements...\n\n\t        if there was selection against larger genomes this would\n\t        also push on this balance]]\n\n\tA consequence of trimming is that any new structure that is going to \ndevelop and improve the champion, has to become adaptive _before_ a \ntrimming cycle comes around and hacks it out.  Not that I&#39;ve seen any \nproblem with that in earlier stages...\n\n\tSo, you can see that the stagnation of the search might be down to \nthe required developments in later stages requiring more time than is \navailable between trims.  BUT, conversely, if trimming were left too \ninfrequent (or off) then the individual genomes would grow to such a \nsize than the individual cycles would slow to a crawl, whether they \nwere going to find anything or not...\n\n--\n\n\tSo...\n\n\tI&#39;ve been thinking about speciation, not quite from the \npoint-of-view of Ken&#39;s &quot;preserving innovation&quot; idea.  But from the \nrelated idea of &quot;separating (less fit) newcomers from the mainstream \nso that they can be evolved to their full potential&quot; - and then \nseeing if what they had learned can be usefully merged into the mainstream.\n\n\tBefore I start I have:\n\n\t  &quot;Theorum #1&quot; -- a single species that is making progress (becoming \nfitter) at some reasonable rate, needs no extra-species interaction \n(splitting, merging or cross-breeding).\n\n\t((This says nothing about whether any other species might exist, \njust that we need not interact with them at this time...))\n\n\tAnd &quot;Theorum #2&quot; -- that the only purpose of a second (or more) \nspecies, is if it (i) replaces, or (ii) contributes genetic \ninformation to the mainstream.\n\n\t((Obviously it can try to do that, fail and be made extinct, but its \nobjective must be to do one of those two.))\n\n\tOK, so types of speciation:\n\n--\n\nType Zero Speciation\n\n\tThe simplest thing we could ever do, is to mimic the effect of \ngeographical separation in natural species.  e.g. if there is a \nnatural species that is well adapted to its environment, and \nsomething happens to divide it in two (like a land-bridge eroding), \nthen we are left with two identical populations, being selected under \nthe same constraints, but no-longer constrained to remain the \nsame.  In nature what you then get is that the random component to \nevolution (known as &quot;genetic drift&quot;) causes them to drift apart; and \neventually become mutually infertile (***) and thus, by definition, \nnot the same species (****).\n\n\t[[ (***) or just less-fertile, that&#39;s enough to select\n\t          for not wanting to interbreed.\n\n\t   (****) \tthere might also be an argument here about immortality...\n\t           \tbecause if there are immortal individuals in a species,\n\t           \tthey effectively also act as a brake on genetic drift\n\t           \t(because anyone who is not fertile with the immortals,\n\t            is at a disadvantage, either just because there is a part\n\t\tof the population they can&#39;t breed with, or because the\n\t\timmortals are by definition the fittest individuals)]]\n\n\tI call this type zero speciation, because it is the very minimum \nthat speciation can ever be, e.g. two populations that have been \nseparated but are not in any other way driven to differ.\n\n\tTo do this on a computer, you can do various things, such as: (i) \nsplit the individuals in the existing species equally into two new \nspecies, (ii) clone the whole existing species but make sure than one \ncopy gets different random numbers.\n\n--\n\nBottleneck Speciation\n\n\tIf 99.9% of a species is wiped out, then the randomly selected group \nof survivors can go on to repopulate the whole thing.  In a natural \nscenario, this might reflect the survivors of some large-scale \ncatastrophe.  Less dramatically, however, the same thing can happen \nif just a few members of a new species get transported to a new \nhabitat -- the small number of individuals that arrive will father a \nwhole new population.\n\n\tI don&#39;t think this is a very good model for computer-based \nstudies.  Natural species are huge and complex and contain a wide \nvariety of alternative gene forms (alleles, in genetics speak) all of \nwhich are reasonably fit.  Thus, when a bottle-neck happens to a \nnatural species, what happens is that the subset of those varied \nalleles that happen to be present in the small group of founders get \nboosted to population-spanning ubiquity.  So the new population is \n_immediately_ different from the old one.  Our populations, OTOH. , \ntend to be small (&lt; 1,000,000 individuals :) ) and homogeneous.  So \nbottlenecking one is actually far less of a change than for a natural \nsystem (I almost listed this with the previous category...)\n\n--\n\nSide-step Speciation\n\n\tThis is where it starts to get interesting.  The idea of a side-step \nis that we are going to take the existing species, change it by some \nmoderate amount (*****) and then set it evolving again from its new \nstart point.\n\n\t[[ (*****) moderate in the sense of not trivially small, but not so \nfar that it is unrelated ]]\n\n\tYou can regard this as some sense of &quot;giving the system a kick&quot; to \ntry and shake it out of the cosy local optimum it is stuck in.  The \nobvious way to implement this is to copy N individuals out of the old \nspecies, subject them to M cycles of unselected mutation, and then \nset them going as the new species.\n\n\tIf N is too large, then the chance will be that some individual will \nbe effectively unchanged and the new species will carry on just like \nthe original one did.  OTOH, N &gt; 1 might have the advantage of a far \nlesser chance of seeding the new species with a completely lame individual...\n\n\tThe equivalent of this in nature can probably only occur when (i) a \nsmall group get separated from the species and (ii) they pick up a \nlot of mutations.  That probably only happens in (a) nuclear war or \n(b) if they have wandered into a new environment where the selection \npressures are different, so they accumulate extra mutations not \nbecause they are mutating faster, but because selection can no longer \ndiscriminate against them (obviously this latter is slower than we \nsee in typical computer experiments)...\n\n\tThe resulting species from this may hold an advantage in two ways \nthat I will describe in the next section...\n\n--\n\nTry-again Speciation\n\n\tAnother interesting one.  To do this what you do is take some \nindividuals from a fit species and delete the same (random) genome \nfeature from each of them (another use for innovation \nnumbers...).  These individuals then form a new species, and may be \nquite unfit, but they only have to re-evolve the subsystem that you \ndeleted, not start completely from scratch.  In doing that they will \neither (i) re-evolve an exact equivalent of what was deleted (will \nespecially happen if the deletion was too small), (ii) evolve \ncompletely from scratch, losing their pre-existing approach \n(especially if the deletion is too small), or (iii) re-evolve a new \napproach to the section that was deleted.\n\n\tIt is that final case which is the interesting one, because when \nthey evolved the original feature, certain random decisions were made \nand subsequently &quot;locked in&quot; to the strategy of the species.  By \nforcing that fragment to re-evolve, we give the system a chance to \nfind either (i) a fitter approach, or (ii) an approach with different \nstrengths and weaknesses.  In the former case, real progress has been \nmade and the new species can replace the old one.  In the latter \ncase, the new species is less fit than the old one, but may handle \nsome aspects of the situation better, and we may get some advances \nfrom merging the two species.\n\n--\n\nOK, so that&#39;s some notes on alternative speciation.\n\n\tI&#39;m currently working up to implementing side-step and try-again \napproaches in SLEAT.  In a day or so I will mail again about ideas \nfor merging branched species back into the mainstream and retaining \nthe advantages of both...\n\n\t[[I am also interested in using &quot;type zero&quot; as the form of parallel \nprocessing that I think I mentioned late last year, where you branch \nthe population into N copies with different random number seeds (e.g. \non remote machines) and after M generations select the fittest \nversion and discard the others.]]\n\n\tIan\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
