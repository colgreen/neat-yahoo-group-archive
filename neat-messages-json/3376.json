I suddenly made the connection bet=\r\nween \nthe sensor placements and the substrates for the robot experiment in =\r\n\nD&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s paper. It is so similar. So I begin to think.. What about \nNE=\r\nRO, but using HyperNEAT? The substrates can be made geometrically \nsimilar =\r\nto the.. enivonment, you know what I mean. \nI will try to implement a 2D ve=\r\nrsion of something similar to NERO, but \nwith leaky integrator neurons, bec=\r\nause there every node has a bias and \nI don&#39;t have to care about where to p=\r\nlace the bias unit in the \nsubstrate. \nBesides, I have the following idea. =\r\nDuring evolution, in the first \ngenerations (in the rtNEAT case, the first =\r\nN minutes of evolution), the \nsubstrates will be simple, with low node coun=\r\nts. Then, given a \nthreshold (num. of generations/time), the program will a=\r\nutomatically \nscale up the substrate to a higher density. \n\nAny suggestions=\r\n/ideas about that? \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
