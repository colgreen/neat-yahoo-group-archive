I think NEAT is massively attractive\n&gt; &gt; here: topology can vary and a larger range of input data can be\n&gt; &gt; presented (I&#39;d be inclined to start with an un- or\n&gt; sparsely-connected\n&gt; &gt; network and let the program work out what&#39;s useful).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike, from recent work here, starting sparsely looks like a really\n&gt; good idea.  We are working on a paper right now that reports great\n&gt; results from starting this way as opposed to starting fully-connected.\n&gt;  An earlier workshop paper from last year on the topic is here:\n \nI&#39;m delighted to read it :)\n\nI confess to being largely motivated by laziness - there are problems\nwhere I can conceive of a large number of possible input that may be:\n&quot;raw&quot;, normalised or more expensively derived (e.g. decorrelated\npairs, or other stuff I didn&#39;t properly understand). I didn&#39;t want to\nhave to perform the up-front analysis to figure out what was most\nappropriate: I just don&#39;t have the time what with day job, kids, those\nkind of things. But I do have computers and they do have time (less of\nit now the kids are old enough to use a mouse, but that&#39;s another\nstory). So the sparse (presumably, in the limit we could start with no\nlinks, but I assume a sensible starting point is to link one input to\none output and let NEAT take it from there). Over time, the model\nshould be able to decide for itself what is useful and what&#39;s not. And\nof course, the early runs are going to be insanely fast!\n\nI lean towards &quot;constructive&quot; (?) - I&#39;ll go to a lot of effort to save\nmyself work... I seek to expend more energy up-front creating models\nthat are able to do more of that tedious searching. If it takes them a\nweek to come up with a solution, that&#39;s cool: I&#39;ll QA the results when\nI get them. In the meantime I can be doing something else.\n\nThe thing that most excites me about NEAT is the additional potential\nfor laziness: I no longer have to expend energy cooking up and\ntweaking network topologies. Having never ventured into recurrent\nnetworks before, I&#39;m also now seeing some potential uses for &quot;memory&quot;\nas provided in NEAT.\n\nNow if I could just get the kids off the PC long enough to get some\ncode written...\n\n\n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:geccows04\n&gt; \n&gt; This year&#39;s paper simplifies the technique and shows more definitive\n&gt; results in a more significant domain.  So I&#39;d say your inclination is\n&gt; promising.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n"}}
