If all of of these\n&gt; useless structures aren&#39;t participating positively in a search (on the\n&gt; whole) then every single improvement seen in a population must come from\n&gt; immediately beneficial single mutations. \n\nWell, that&#39;s not entirely accurate.  In any new individual generated\nin NEAT, there could be a very large number of mutations at once. \nMany of its connection weights may be mutated at once, along with the\naddition (or subtraction) of a fairly large number of topological\nfeatures.\n\nThus, ten or twenty mutations at once might produce an increase in\nfitness, which is quite a bit different from benefit arising from a\nsingle mutation.  (Unless you&#39;re considering all of these events as a\nsingle mutation.)\n\n&gt; I&#39;m reminded of past arguments that creationists have used against\n&gt; evolution,  it goes something like - &quot;I can&#39;t see how some biological\n&gt; structures came about because they seem like too much of a jump, there\n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be any possible gradual evolutionary steps that produced\n&gt; certain structures. therefore they were designed.&quot;  \n\nHey...you aren&#39;t actually comparing me to a creationist, are you?  I\nmight take offense at that. ;)\n\n&gt; I think this is\n&gt; because sometimes jumps are made, so e.g. a piece of  DNA that codes for\n&gt; a single protein might get accidentally copied into part of the genome\n&gt; that describes high-level morphology and instead of describing a protein\n&gt; it now describes, say, a vibration sensitive hair. \n\nYou&#39;re talking about a piece of genetic material that already encodes\nfor something adaptive.  Which, again, is quite different from simply\nhaving a glob of *untested* morphology suddenly hooked up to the stuff\naround it and suddenly increasing the fitness of the organism.\n\nThe protein in your example, already encodes for something useful in\nthe organism.\n\n&gt; So anyway, what I was proposing was a method of getting the best of both\n&gt; worlds. If excess structure is important then keep it, but if the search\n&gt; has stagnated for a period of time then I would say that the excess\n&gt; structures have now had plenty of time to prove themselves - and failed.\n&gt; They have crossed the line from being possible useful structures into\n&gt; being useless junk (bloat). \n\nIt would be interesting to see if this view could be tested\nempirically.  It was my understanding that the philosophy of NEAT was\nessentially gradualist in its approach to adding structure, and that\nwas part of the appeal of it to me.  It sounds as if you and Ken are\nboth now arguing more for the approach of jumping, via allowing chunks\nof untested morphology to accumulate in the hope that they will\neventually spontaneously contribute to increased fitness.\n\nI guess conceptually this approach just doesn&#39;t sound as efficient or\neffective to me, and it would probably need to be demonstrated\nsufficiently to really persuade me.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
