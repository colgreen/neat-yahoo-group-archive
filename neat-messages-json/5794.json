I used the robot duel problem, and\nhad normal objective fitness neat, a random search, and 8 different\nnovelty search implementations.\n\nA few approaches to using NCD for novelty search looked particularly\npromising, clearly outperforming random search, but not the objective\nfitness approach. There probably isn&#39;t a lot of deception in this\nparticular problem domain. I would have loved to add a second problem\nwith more deception for testing, but I just ran out of time I&#39;m\nafraid. Anyway, thought some of you might find it interesting.\n\nIt&#39;s written for Linux using C++. The Neat implementation is based on\nMat Buckland&#39;s. There&#39;s two implementations of NCD included, one that\nuses ZLIB and another that uses LZMA. The software is released under\nBSD license in case anyone wants to reuse parts of it or anything. If\nyou want any of it under some other license or whatever, just let me\nknow and we can get that sorted out.\n\n\n\n-Drew\n\r\n--14dae934039f0a925c04be587e53\r\nContent-Type: application/pdf; name=&quot;Thesis- Master Document.pdf&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;Thesis- Master Document.pdf&quot;\r\nX-Attachment-Id: f_h1djmxfj0\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--14dae934039f0a925c04be587e53\r\nContent-Type: application/x-bzip2; \n\tname=&quot;noveltySearchCompetitiveCoev.tar.bz2&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; \n\tfilename=&quot;noveltySearchCompetitiveCoev.tar.bz2&quot;\r\nX-Attachment-Id: f_h1djn7kk1\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--14dae934039f0a925c04be587e53--\r\n\n"}}
