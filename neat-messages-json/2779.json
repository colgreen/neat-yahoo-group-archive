In effect it takes the square of the time \nit would take =\r\nto simply run evolution in a domain with a regular \nparameter set. That is =\r\nbecause e.g. if you had populations of size \n100, then it you&#39;d need a meta=\r\n-population of 100, each of which is \nan evolution of population 100.\n\nPerh=\r\naps however on some small problems this would still be \nfeasible.  (Certain=\r\nly with parallel processing it also becomes more \nfeasible)  Yet it&#39;s impor=\r\ntant to remember that it is likely that \nwhat you are finding are the right=\r\n parameters for *that* problem, \nrather than the best ones in general (it&#39;s=\r\n likely there is no \nsuch &quot;best&quot;). \n\nIn any case, if you did run such an ex=\r\nperiment, it&#39;s a good question \nwhat the inputs would be.  I would add to y=\r\nour list inputs that let \nthe network see the current parameter settings, e=\r\n.g. the current \nmutation rate, etc.  That way, it can deduce, e.g., &quot;hey t=\r\nhe slope \nisn&#39;t good and I have a really low mutation rate so maybe I shoul=\r\nd \nnotch it up a little.&quot;  That is, it&#39;s useful to know what state \nyou&#39;re =\r\nin before you think about changing it.\n\nWith that in mind, you might consid=\r\ner the outputs being delta values \nrather than absolutes.  In other words, =\r\nthey would request \na &quot;normalized&quot; change magnitude on their respective par=\r\nameters.  \nThat way the network has (in an abstract sense) an &quot;egocentric&quot; =\r\n\nperspective of how it moves through parameter space.  However, if \nthat do=\r\nesn&#39;t work well, you can always try absolutes (on a \nnormalized range).  In=\r\n either case, I&#39;m imagining one output for \neach evolution parameter that t=\r\nhe network controls.\n\nGood luck,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl=\r\n2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;    I am currently working on a version of neat t=\r\no supervise neat, \nby \n&gt; way of manipulation of the parameters on a generat=\r\nion by \ngeneration \n&gt; basis for the purpose of attempting to accelerate the=\r\n integral of \nthe \n&gt; fitness of the underlying neat task (UNT). The byprodu=\r\nct would be \nthe \n&gt; evolution of a supervisor genome.\n&gt; \n&gt;    My current th=\r\noughts regarding inputs to the supervisor are as \n&gt; follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) normal=\r\nized log of UNT generation #,\n&gt; 2) last UNT generation highest fitness (HF)=\r\n,\n&gt; 3) last UNT generation HF accum,\n&gt; 4) # of generations since last chang=\r\ne of HF of UNT,\n&gt; 5) average of UNT generation HF,\n&gt; 6) slope of average of=\r\n UNT generation HF (last 2 points),\n&gt; 7) slope of HF accum (last 2 points).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;    Does anyone have any thoughts regarding the contemplated \ninputs, =\r\n\n&gt; and/or suggestions for possible other candidate inputs?\n&gt; \n&gt;    Thoughtf=\r\nul suggestions are always appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    Andy\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
