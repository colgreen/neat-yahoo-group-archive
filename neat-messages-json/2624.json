Another is ANNEvolve.\nANNEvolve is an open source project devoted to neuroevolution.  One of our\nsub-projects, EvSail, solves a roughly similar problem.  EvSail is a free download from\nour website. \n\nThere are several websites devoted to TORCS.  This one emphasizes the competitiion:\nhttp://www.berniw.org/trb/\n\nIf anyone wants to use ANNEvolve software as the basis for developing a TORCS\ncompetitor, I will help you.\n\nPS: I am the inventor and founder of RARS, a forerunner of TORCS\n\n\nMitchell Timin\n\nI&#39;m proud of http://ANNEvolve.sourceforge.net.  If you want to write software, or articles, or do testing, or research for ANNEvolve, let me know.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
