You \nmay have to upload it directly to the Files section of this group in \norder for people to be able to get it.  Right now we can&#39;t see what \nyou&#39;re referring to.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Richard Gong &lt;gongrichard@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I made this simple program that doesn&#39;t realistically\n&gt; simulate gravity, but it uses this thing I call the\n&gt; mattress. Which is basically just like a layer of\n&gt; numbers, that tells you the contours of a space time\n&gt; continuum (shows up as degrees of green, more green =\n&gt; more gravity). Gravity spreads out in waves,\n&gt; propagating from point to point, although it&#39;s not\n&gt; probably an accurate description of actual waves. Then\n&gt; there&#39;s this second layer that tells u how much mass\n&gt; you have (red). And the mass gravitates towards the\n&gt; spots of depression.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My guess is a mattress layer is just as good as neural\n&gt; networks. The brain is kinda a lazy thing that finds\n&gt; its way to the lowest valley in a plane.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Weird thing is whenever I put something in there\n&gt; that&#39;s not really very illogical, like the mass slowly\n&gt; fades away, or like the gravity light cone is made of\n&gt; integers and eventually lose value, then there are\n&gt; these black spots that appear, and it looks like Alife\n&gt; a lot.\n\n\n\n"}}
