It&#39;s called JN-HyperNeat.zip\n&gt; \n&gt; This was =\r\nmy first Java project, so it&#39;s really rough. I want to say I will polish it=\r\n, but I really don&#39;t have the time. Plus, nowadays I prefer coding in Commo=\r\nn Lisp and Clojure.\n&gt; \n&gt; However I&#39;m still very interested in HyperNeat, so=\r\n I may eventually implement it in Lisp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Feel free to do whatever you w=\r\nant with JN-HyperNeat.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
