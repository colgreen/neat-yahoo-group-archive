Here&#39;s my question:\n\n&gt; &quot;In smaller populations, the probability of adding a new node was \n&gt; 0.03 and the probability of a new link mutation was 0.05. In the \n&gt; larger population, the probability of adding a new link was 0.3.&quot;\n\n&gt; As for the final question of whether you can add a link and a node \n&gt; at the same time, in my system you can&#39;t.  However, it would hardly \n&gt; make a difference.  What makes a difference is adding big globs of \n&gt; structure all at once vs. adding just one or on a rare occasion two \n&gt; pieces.\n\nGiven a population, we have 2 sets of mutated individuals.  3% get a\nnew node, 5% get a new connection.  How do you handle the intersection\nif no individuals can have both?  I can see 2 ways of doing it.\n\n1) For those that would get 2 mutations, flip a coin and choose one. \nThis would mean that slightly fewer than 3% and 5% are actually\ngetting the mutation.  \n2) Ensure there is no intersection.  Take 8% of the population to be\nmutated, then to 5/8 of those add a connection and to 3/8 add a node.\n   This could get counterintuitive with larger mutation rates; e.g.,\nif we had a 60% rate for add node and 60% rate for add connection,\nwe&#39;d actally wind up with 50% for both.\n\nIt&#39;s a fine point, and won&#39;t matter much if we always use very small\nmutation rates.  But I&#39;d like my imlementation to make sense even if\nwe decide to have larger rates, and I want it to be as close to yours\nas possible for comparing results.\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\n\n\n"}}
