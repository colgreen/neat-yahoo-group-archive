There is a perfect pole balancing network in the \n&#39;networks&#39; dir, but don&#39;t take my word fot it, try evolving one for \nyourself :)\n\nThe prey capture domain is still being worked on, the fitness function \ncurrently employed punishes for the number of timesteps taken to catch \nthe prey. Right now though the punishment needs re-adjusting (it&#39;s too \nharsh) so you probably won&#39;t see very good results without modification. \nAgain, the current best network is in the &#39;networks&#39; dir.\n\nIn the main tool new search parameters are provided: &#39;Species droppoff \nage&#39; and &#39;Interspecies mating proportion&#39;.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
