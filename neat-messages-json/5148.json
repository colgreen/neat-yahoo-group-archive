Ma=\r\nybe one can even develop a single CPPN that does both. \nBut of course, one =\r\ncan use any generator technique for the substrate template - it just seems =\r\nso elegant to use the same technique for structure as well as connectivity.=\r\n\n\nNow, I remember some discussion on this topic in this list a while ago, b=\r\nut can&#39;t remember or find what came of that.\n\nHas anyone made any inroads i=\r\nnto this research area yet? Any references or pointers?\n\nCheers,\n\nEvert\n\n\n"}}
