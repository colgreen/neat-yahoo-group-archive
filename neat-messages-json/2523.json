In other \nwords, I was trying to minimize the impact of doi=\r\nng such a mutation \non what the network does.  A lot of further experience =\r\nhas led me to \nbelieve that those concerns were unfounded and the optimizat=\r\nion \nisn&#39;t really necessary on that basis.  However, it seems that having \n=\r\na steep slope may have other benefits in terms of control, at least \nin pol=\r\ne balancing.  Ultimately, the specific slope I used probably \nisn&#39;t all tha=\r\nt important.\n\n&gt; Additionally I was just wondering is there any benefit from=\r\n using \n&gt; other types of activation functions, with selection being under \n=\r\nthe \n&gt; control of the GA? (Also the same question applied to the \nactivatio=\r\nn function\n&gt; slope)\n&gt; \n\nI personally think there is a lot of potential in e=\r\nmploying a mix of \nactivation functions, wherein the network evolves which =\r\nactivation \nfunction is used at each node.  Just look at Mattias Fagerlunds=\r\n&#39; \nfunction approximator demo in DelphiNEAT.  I bet you its performance \nwo=\r\nuld be a lot worse if it didn&#39;t include the Gaussian activation \nfunction a=\r\ns well as the sigmoid.  Of course, as John pointed out, to \nsome extent kno=\r\nwing what you need up front is begging the question \nof why you&#39;re using a =\r\nGA, but in practice I believe giving the GA a \nbag of activation functions =\r\nto choose from will prove more \npowerful.  How much more powerful remains t=\r\no be seen.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
