I&#39;d like to be able to define them intuitively, e.g., in some XML =\r\nformat (a GUI is probably asking too much). I&#39;ll also want to  display them=\r\n visually.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there an accepted (XML) format for substrate (or gen=\r\neral NN) definitions? With a (C++) parser? Or should I brew my own (and if =\r\nI do, is anyone interested in it)? \n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of available visua=\r\nlisation tools or code?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; TIA,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evert\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Evert,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I wrote a 3d substrate visualizer for the HyperNEAT C++ implementation, =\r\nbut it isn&#39;t polished enough to release to the public yet.  I&#39;ve been debat=\r\ning whether or not to make a released version.\n&gt; \n&gt; In it&#39;s current state, =\r\nthe sheets are layed out on planes and the camera can rotate and move aroun=\r\nd the substrates.  The node colors represent activation levels, but when yo=\r\nu mouse over a node, the colors change to represent the connection weights =\r\nemanating from the focused node.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this the kind of thing you had in =\r\nmind?  If there is a demand for this app, I can package it with the next Hy=\r\nperNEAT C++ release.  If so, is there anything that you&#39;d want the app to d=\r\no that I haven&#39;t mentioned?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason G.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
