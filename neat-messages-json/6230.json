In the initial population I have all nodes connected so my\n&gt;=\r\n nodes will have ids of 0,1,2,3 representing the Bias,Input1,Input2,Output.=\r\n\n&gt; For the genes connecting these nodes, I will have innovation ids of 0,1,=\r\n2\n&gt; (3 connections between inputs and the output).\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand that ea=\r\nch new gene needs to have a new unique innovation id.\n&gt; Does the same rule =\r\napply to the nodes? I have assumed not and so continue\n&gt; as per below.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhen I add a new node to genome, I understand the concept of disabling the\n=\r\n&gt; existing connection and add 2 new connections. For each connection I have=\r\n\n&gt; to check if the innovation id matches any existing genes or if a new one=\r\n\n&gt; needs to be created. For the first new node I create on a random genome,=\r\n\n&gt; the genes will have 2 new innovation ids 3 and 4. Lets say that I create=\r\n\n&gt; the new node between the bias and the output, my new node will be id 4 a=\r\nnd\n&gt; my gene innovation ids will be 3 (the bias to node 4) and 4 (node 4 to=\r\n the\n&gt; output). Let&#39;s say that in another population I create a new node be=\r\ntween\n&gt; input 2 and the output. This new node will also be node id 4 becaus=\r\ne it is\n&gt; the first new nodes for this population. This means that I have 2=\r\n\n&gt; populations both with a node 4, but the nodes have different input\n&gt; con=\r\nnections. This new node will have a new innovation id for the new\n&gt; connect=\r\nion between the input 2 and the new node, but the output connection\n&gt; gene =\r\nwill have the same innovation id as the other population because it is\n&gt; fr=\r\nom node 4 to the output. Is this correct? I assume this is an important\n&gt; p=\r\noint, so guidance here would be useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; When it comes to the actual rep=\r\nroduction of the genomes I am a bit lost\n&gt; and am just making a few assumpt=\r\nions regarding the order that the\n&gt; reproduction is performed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The docu=\r\nment states the following rules :\n&gt;\n&gt; The champion of each species with mor=\r\ne than five networks was copied into\n&gt; the next generation unchanged. There=\r\n was an 80% chance of a genome having\n&gt; its connection weights mutated, in =\r\nwhich case each weight had a 90% chance\n&gt; of being uniformly perturbed and =\r\na 10% chance of being assigned a new\n&gt; random value. There was a 75% chance=\r\n that an inherited gene was disabled\n&gt; if it was disabled in either parent.=\r\n In each generation, 25% of offspring\n&gt; resulted from mutation without cros=\r\nsover. The interspecies mating rate\n&gt; was 0.001. In smaller populations, th=\r\ne probability\n&gt; of adding a new node was 0.03 and the probability of a new =\r\nlink mutation\n&gt; was\n&gt; 0.05.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, trying to turn that into a set of rules=\r\n has proved to be a bit of a\n&gt; challenge.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess that to start with ea=\r\nch genome needs to have its fitness\n&gt; evaluated. As the first population is=\r\n all of the same species that is not a\n&gt; problem. Once each genome has its =\r\nfitness calculated do you simply to a\n&gt; roulette crossover?\n&gt;\n&gt; For the int=\r\nerspecies mating values along with the probabilities of a new\n&gt; node or con=\r\nnection being made, are these values (0.001, 0.03 and 0.05)\n&gt; representing =\r\npercentages?\n&gt;\n&gt; My my basic example so far, I am doing a roulette crossove=\r\nr 75% of the\n&gt; time with 25% just performing mutation. The mating pool cont=\r\nains all\n&gt; species with the number of genomes from each species a multiple =\r\nof the\n&gt; normalized fitness of the total population.  Each population then =\r\nhas a 5%\n&gt; chance of having a node added, a new connection made of an exist=\r\ning\n&gt; connection disabled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the population size, I find that a=\r\nfter about 100 generations, I\n&gt; end up with 150 different species (the same=\r\n number as the population size),\n&gt; this is because each time I mutate or ad=\r\nd a new connection/node I am\n&gt; forming a new species. Once I have this many=\r\n species do I just continue to\n&gt; crossover and mutate etc as normal until t=\r\nhe network fitness is optimal?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry again for all the questions,\n&gt;\n&gt; R=\r\negards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Simon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8f503562e08e7e04ef16cb2f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hey Simon:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&#39;ll have to take another =\r\nlook at your questions when I get back, but note that the source code for h=\r\nyperneat is available online: &lt;a href=3D&quot;https://github.com/MisterTea/Hyper=\r\nNEAT&quot;&gt;https://github.com/MisterTea/HyperNEAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Maybe =\r\nit can help answer some of your questions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On=\r\n Jan 2, 2014 1:54 PM,  &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neatuser64@...&quot;&gt;neatuser=\r\n64@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br type=3D&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gm=\r\nail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-le=\r\nft:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have dec=\r\nided to hold back on the CPPN project because I feel that I am still missin=\r\ng something in my basic understanding of Neat.
