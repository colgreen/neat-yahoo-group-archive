My understanding\n&gt; is NEAT only uses sigmoid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, my eventual goal is to evolve an agent in a single time frame,\n&gt; say daily, then create a role which uses weekly, daily, and hourly\n&gt; agents in much the same way as the recent multi-agent paper discussed.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are correct the geometric regularity is not as strong as the\n&gt; typical robotic examples, but I was intrigued by HN&#39;s ability to\n&gt; scale.  I will look into NEAT by itself though.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Todd\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Well I don&#39;t understand what does HyperNEAT to do with it. Unless you\n&gt;&gt; believe there is some geometric regularities in those time series\n&gt;&gt; there is no point to use HyperNEAT. Try regular NEAT first.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
