The rest of the inputs\n&gt; would be initially ignored.\n\nJust to try to clarify...your network topology is a\n4x16 fully-connected feedforward network?  Is that\nright?  The four pixels of the small image are input\ninto the four input nodes, and the 16 output nodes\noutput pixel values for the enlarged image?\n\n&gt; Hmm...  What does that mean, exactly?\n\nSee the thread starting here:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/message/8\n\nBut it sounds like your already using this approach\n(unless I&#39;m misunderstanding what you&#39;re doing).  \n\nWhat are the dimensions of the images you are\nenlarging?  I&#39;m getting the impression that you&#39;re\nstarting with something like a 100x100 pixel image and\nenlarging it to 200x200, in 2x2 chunks at a time.  Is\nthat right?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance: Get your refund fast by filing online.\nhttp://taxes.yahoo.com/filing.html\n\n"}}
