We are of course very proud of this and we would be happy =\r\nto answer all your questions about this paper. Perhaps the quickest way to =\r\ngain a high-level overview is via the following short video summary: https:=\r\n//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DT-c17RKh3uE\n\nThe paper is here: http://www.natu=\r\nre.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14422.html (be careful that all=\r\n the technical details are in the supplementary file, see at the end of the=\r\n online version). For those who do not have access to Nature, someone has p=\r\nut a PDF here: http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/files/robot-adaptativ-is=\r\nir.pdf , and the supplementary can be found at the end of the pre-submissio=\r\nn version: http://www.isir.upmc.fr/files/2015ACLI3468.pdf ). There is a nic=\r\ne commentary by Chris Adami in the same issue of Nature: http://sciences.bl=\r\nogs.liberation.fr/files/robot-adaptativ-isir.pdf\n\nBesides the application t=\r\no robotics, I think this paper is interesting for our community for several=\r\n reasons:\n\n- It relies on MAP-Elites to generate a wide diversity of high-p=\r\nerforming solutions. MAP-Elites is a novel, niche-based evolutionary algori=\r\nthm that, in spite of its simplicity, can be seen as a novel abstraction of=\r\n evolution: each cell of the grid in the feature space is a niche that can =\r\nbe invaded by the best individuals of the other niches. You can learn more =\r\nabout this algorithm in our recent arxiv draft (http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.0=\r\n4909 , Mouret and Clune, 2015). Because MAP-Elites is focused on creativity=\r\n and diversity instead of pure optimization, it shares many concepts with N=\r\novelty Search (NS), NS with local competition, behavioral diversity, etc. b=\r\nut also introduces new concepts, like the fact that there is no fixed-size =\r\npopulation like in traditional evolutionary algorithms.\n\n- While we used si=\r\nmple, open-loop controllers, the exact same technique can be used with your=\r\n favorite encoding to evolve neural networks (HyperNEAT, SUPG, etc.). Actua=\r\nlly, we have already obtained nice results with SUPG, on the real robot! (w=\r\ne have a report about this in preparation and we will have a talk in the EP=\r\nS workshop at ECAL this summer).\n\n- One the main originality of this paper =\r\nis that it does not attempt to directly evolve solutions on the robot (as m=\r\nany did). Instead, we combine the best of evolution in simulation, with the=\r\n best of reinforcement learning (direct policy search). In more concrete te=\r\nrms, our approach divides the process into two steps: an exploration phase =\r\nwith an evolutionary algorithm, in simulation (this allows us to use evolut=\r\nion for what it shines: using a lot of evaluations to be creative), and an =\r\nadaptation phase based on Bayesian Optimization (which is a very data-effic=\r\nient learning/optimization algorithm). We could also see the second step as=\r\n surrogate-based evolution, with a surrogate based on the simulation.\n\n- Ov=\r\nerall, we are interested to know what you think\n\nBest regards,\n=97 Jean-Bap=\r\ntiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/\n\n\n"}}
