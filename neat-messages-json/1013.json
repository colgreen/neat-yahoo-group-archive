For example, to say &quot;NEAT is\n&gt; based on a gradualist philosophy&quot; or &quot;bloat is bad&quot; and ask whether\n&gt; such statements are true or false is entirely missing the complex\n&gt; nuances of the dynamics of a system like this.  \n\nThat&#39;s not what I said.  I said, &quot;It was my understanding that the\nphilosophy of NEAT was essentially gradualist in its approach to\nadding structure, and that\nwas part of the appeal of it to me.&quot;\n\nThe section on Minimizing Dimensionality in the paper &quot;Efficient\nEvolution of Neural Network Topologies says this:\n\n&quot;TWEANN algorithms typically start with an initial population\nof random topologies [2, 7, 21, 22]. Such topological\ndiversity must be introduced from the start because new structure\nfrequently does not survive in these methods, which do\nnot protect innovation. However, it is not clear that such diversity\nis necessary or useful. A population of random topologies\nhas a great deal of structure that has not withstood a single\nFitness evaluation. Therefore, there is no way to know if\nany of such structure is necessary. It is costly though because\nthe more connections a network contains, the higher the number\nof dimensions that need to be searched to optimize the\nnetwork. Therefore, with random topologies the algorithm\nmay waste a lot of effort by optimizing unnecessarily complex\nstructures.\nIn contrast, NEAT begins with a uniform population of networks\nwith no hidden nodes. Because NEAT protects innovation\nusing speciation, it can start this way, minimally, and\ngrow new structure only as necessary. New structure is introduced\nincrementally as structural mutations occur, and only\nthose structures survive that are found to be useful through\nFitness evaluations. This way, NEAT searches through a minimal\nnumber of weight dimensions, significantly reducing the\nnumber of generations necessary to find a solution.&quot; \n\nYou talk about starting minimally and only adding structure that is\n&quot;useful&quot; or &quot;necessary&quot;...not &quot;neutral&quot; structure.\n\nYou say only those structures that are found to be *useful* survive. \nBut that&#39;s not necessarily true, according to the discussion on this\nlist.  At least, they are not useful in the sense of contributing to\nthe fitness of an individual.  If you mean neutral in terms of\naffecting the fitness of an individual, but useful in terms of\nproviding building blocks for later innovations, fine.  But that&#39;s\ndefinitely not clear from the literature, and in fact seems a bit\ncontradictory.\n\n&gt; -&quot;Not contributing to fitness&quot; is different than &quot;reducing\n&gt; fitness.&quot;  You are using these terms interchangeably.  \n\nNo, I don&#39;t think I did.  I think I&#39;ve been fairly careful about\ndistinguishing between &quot;neutral&quot; structure and structure which either\nhelps or hurts fitness.  I&#39;ve used words like &quot;superflous&quot; and\n&quot;unnecessary&quot;, but this is not the same as saying such structure is\nmaladaptive.\n\n&gt; If I am\n&gt; stagnating and I manage to add structure that does not reduce\n&gt; fitness, that is a good thing, not a bad thing, because I&#39;m\n&gt; increasing my range of candidate spaces.\n\nBut it increases the search space and slows down network activation. \nAnd if the payoffs down the road aren&#39;t worth the extra expense, then\nit *is* a bad thing.  I don&#39;t think it is necessarily true that the\nretention of neutral structure is preferrable...I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s\nintuitive.  As I&#39;ve mentioned before, there are other possible\nexplanations for jumps out of stagnation.\n\nMy inclination, in general, is to try to keep the search as tight and\nlean as possible, and to try to deal with stagnation from the fitness\nfunction side (i.e., attempt to insure a smoother fitness gradient).\n\n&gt; The point with NEAT is that we are trying to get access to good\n&gt; parts of high-dimensional space.  To say that increasing\n&gt; dimensionality is flat out bad is a generalization.  \n\nWell, I wasn&#39;t arguing that point.  I think without proportional gains\nin the performance of the algorithm it&#39;s bad policy, because there\ndefinitely is a cost associated with increasing the dimensionality.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
