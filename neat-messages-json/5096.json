As parasitism-based and neoteny-based evolution=\r\n can be roughly and subjectively put into an algo. As far as some selection=\r\n scheme is integrated, it will even &quot;work&quot;, ie. provide solutions better th=\r\nan the initial population. But then, maybe I&#39;m close-minded, but I see thre=\r\ne paths :\n\n    - Biologic model =3D&gt; So we try to be accurate and we fit th=\r\ne model to *real* data and test it over *real* data. Every details count, e=\r\nven the weird proteins mechanic in the cells nucleus. So far, not the main =\r\nstream evolutionary computation work.\n\n    - Optimization algorithm =3D&gt; So=\r\n we don&#39;t give a damn about biology and we leave it to biologist. We design=\r\n algorithms  to solve problems, therefore the design choice are made accord=\r\ning to that objective. Optimizing seems the main focus on the evolutionary =\r\ncomputation community.\n\n    - Open experimentation & tweaking =3D&gt; Put here=\r\n whatever you like, including algorithm interpretation of whatever biologic=\r\n phenomenon we hear about. No goal out of... Watching what happens. it&#39;s we=\r\n discover unknown stuffs, usually.\n\nSo indeed, whatever you like is ok, as =\r\nfar you give yourself an objective. If you want to optimize, horizontal evo=\r\nlution, well, gimme rational explanations better than &quot;nature does it&quot;. If =\r\nyou want to do models, yeah, can be very very cool to compare to models wit=\r\nhout horizontal evolution. If it&#39;s for fun, yeah, can make a nice personal =\r\nproject ^^\n\nAlex\n\n--- En date de=C2=A0: Mer 27.1.10, R &lt;shanemcdonaldryan@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt; a =C3=A9crit=C2=A0:\n\nDe: R &lt;shanemcdonaldryan@...&gt;\nObjet: [=\r\nneat] Horizontal evolution of evolution\n=C3=80: neat@yahoogroups.com\nDate: =\r\nMercredi 27 Janvier 2010, 11h02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n  =\r\n    This is an interesting article.\n\nhttp://www.newscien tist.com/ article/=\r\nmg205274 41.500-horizonta l-and-vertical- the-evolution- of-evolution. html=\r\n?full=3D true&print=3D true\n\n\n\nIt talks essentially about the process that =\r\ngave rise to the evolutionary algorithm and protein synthesis machinery.\n\n\n=\r\n\nI wonder if you could use something like it to tweak or build an evolution=\r\nary algorithm?\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n=\r\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
