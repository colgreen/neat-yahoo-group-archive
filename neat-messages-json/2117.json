I do see how we are immediately biased towards that \n&gt; connection versus others. Perhaps instead then we can just add the \n&gt; node originally, but increase the chances of this node getting a \n&gt; connection substantially in the next several generation(s), or \n&gt; something like that, otherwise we are wasting time optimizing weights \n&gt; and a bias that has no meaning, not to mention increasing the \n&gt; probability of bloat.\n\nI seem to recall that Ken&#39;s NEAT does exactly that - is biased towards \nselecting nodes with higher innovation ID&#39;s (one&#39;s on the end of the \nnode list).\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;        Along the same lines of thinking, has anyone tried using more\n&gt;&gt;&gt;powerful functions at the nodes rather than just a threshold? For\n&gt;&gt;&gt;example an average, or maximum, or minimum, or a switch, or so on?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We discussed this as well and I believe some people started to try it.  I\n&gt;&gt;plan to try it.  I&#39;m not sure &quot;more powerful&quot; functions are the most\n&gt;&gt;important angle, however, I think just a choice of different simple\n&gt;&gt;functions can be useful.  Look for a discussion about how hard it is to\n&gt;&gt;evolve a network that multiplies two inputs...\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\nI started looking into this and it&#39;s pretty near the top o fmy list of \nthings to do. I will be trying neurons with multiple connection points, \neach point sums it&#39;s inputs and each point&#39;s signal then become a \nparameter into an activation function. This allows the function to do \nall kinds of things, but I think the key is to not go overboard, keep it \nsimple - perhaps try two connection points to start with, so one could \njust define the steepness of a sigmoid for instance. Before I attempt \nthis though I need good/fast benchmarks, hence my particualr interest in \nthat subject right now.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;I think so.  But note that the traditional function is not that accurate\n&gt;&gt;anyway and that biology does use several types of neurone.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&quot;ANN&#39;s are a gross oversimplification of bioligal NN&#39;s&quot;  is another way \nof putting it :) Well that&#39;s the viewpoint I&#39;ve settled on... for now :)\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;By functions here I meant abilities.  For example right now it is difficult for the NN to take the negation of an output (which can actually be achieved with a linear activation function), or to choose one output from a set, or to choose the maximum of a set of outputs (Joe mentioned the idea of competitive connections to do this), etc.\n&gt;\nActualy this was also discussed with regard to the multiple connection \npoints idea - as well as summing inputs we could multiply, average, min, \nmax - like I say, you could do all kinds of things.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
