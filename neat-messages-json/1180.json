We were planning to apply a similar &quot;roving\neye&quot; approach to a larger input board game with simpler strategy than\nGo, such as Go-Moku.  But because of a variety of factors, including\nsome of what we saw at GECCO, we&#39;ve decided to apply the active vision\nconcept to pattern recognition...we&#39;re specifically going to focus on\nOCR and fingerprint recognition as application domains, although we&#39;re\narchitecting our active vision system to be flexible and extensible\nenough to apply to any visual field, so that it could be applied to\nboard game domains, computer vision, x-ray analysis, satellite imaging\nanalysis, etc.\n\nKen&#39;s approach to Go showed some promise in the area of board game\nplay.  And Floreano&#39;s presentation included two examples of active\nvision that also looked promsing, one in which a zooming, panning\n&quot;retina&quot; scans the visual field for an autonomous driving agent in a\nracetrack simulation.  The retina eventually learned to zoom in to the\nwhite side line painted on the street and use it as a guide.  The\nautonomous driver was able to outperform all the humans in Floreano&#39;s\nlab.  The other example involved an active vision system for physical\nrobots, and in searching for papers on the subject, I found that they\nalso did similar experiments with an active vision system for shape\ndiscrimination (distinguishing between triangles and squares of\ndifferent sizes on a noisy background).\n\nAnyway, we just thought that we&#39;d note that we&#39;re moving in this\ndirection, especially since there are others on the list interested in\nimaging and active vision.  Hopefully we can share some useful\nresults/insights.  Later I&#39;ll probably post an SVG animation demo of\nhow we want the system to work.  We&#39;re still in the process of coding\nit up, and hopefully we&#39;ll begin experiments within the next couple of\nweeks.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
