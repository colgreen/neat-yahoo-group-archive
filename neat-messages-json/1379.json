Hmmm....  I like it!  The fitness must be 10 \ntimes more accurate in order to get an error report of half as much.\n\n&gt;The error rises faster than the difference and maxes out when the\n&gt;difference reaches 1.  An difference at or beyond 1 gets the maximum\n&gt;possible error.\n\nSo I take it you would cap the error at 1?  Any particular reason?  Just \npredictability?\n\n&gt;Some test cases, say you have two test images and for a particular\n&gt;output you are expecting the values -0.8 and 0.8.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here is the error for different output values:\n&gt;\n&gt;o = -0.8, error = 0+1 = 1\n&gt;o = 0, error = 0.935 + 0.935 = 1.87\n&gt;\n&gt;So now you value getting one of the test cases correct and one wrong,\n&gt;over getting them both halfway right.\n\nI like it.  A lot.  I&#39;ll let it run over night and see what it does...\n\n&gt;Some variation on this might work. Not that you might want to tweak the\n&gt;equation slightly - if I had used 0.5 instead of 0.8 in the example then\n&gt;your problem re-appears, so you might want the function to max out earlier.\n\nWe&#39;ll see.\n\nThanks!  Appreciate the suggestion...cross your fingers! :)\n\n\n\n"}}
