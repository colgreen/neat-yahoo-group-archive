What they do show is how \nnetworks of varying complexity are drawn, and hence the limits of these \ntypes of diagram.\n\nThe layout manager basically places the hidden neurons into a \nrectangular grid that best matches the available space, there is no \nattempt at analysing interconnections to determine which neurons should \nbe in which layers, etc.  Inputs and outputs are all drawn in their own \nlayer, so for example if there were a lot of  inputs then you would see \nan overcrowded input layer.\n\nThe connections are coloured to indicate their strength using a blue-red \nscale. Optionally I can also vary the width of the connections but this \nseems to clutter up the diagrams that much more.\n\nGoing forward then there will be the able to manipulate the networks, \ndrag neurons around and zoom in/out and save/load these as annotated xml \n(hint-xpos/ypos in the saved xml). As I mentioned before I hope to \nincorporate this stuff into the main exe to show the current best \nnetwork (and perhaps best of each species?) and also in the simulators \nto show the loaded network in realtime using varying neuron/connection \ncolors.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
