So\n  &gt; =\r\nthere is no need for an activation function at an input node.  And \n  input=\r\n node is treated as just\n  &gt; an unbounded data point.  It was my understand=\r\ning that if there \n  was to be feedback to the &quot;input&quot;,\n  &gt; it would occur =\r\nas new nodes and connections around the \n  hidden/output nodes from which t=\r\nhe\n  &gt; particular input node was connected.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Well, that sort of too=\r\nk much longer to present than I initially \n  thought.  Hmmm.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Thank=\r\n you for any clarification(s) you can offer on this.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; \n\n\n  Hey Jim,=\r\n  \n\n  I will try to respond more thoroughly now that I&#39;ve submitted my \n  d=\r\nissertation, although it looks like people on the list have already \n  work=\r\ned through these issues.  But as I said before, my \n  implementation of NEA=\r\nT does not run inputs through any kind of \n  activation function, so in fac=\r\nt I agree with you on everything here.\n\n  On the other hand, running inputs=\r\n through an activation can be seen \n  as just one of many possible ways of =\r\nscaling or normalizing inputs \n  to get them in the best form for an ANN.  =\r\nIn that sense, maybe in \n  some cases there is a good intuition behind doin=\r\ng it, but on the \n  face of it, it does seem ad hoc to me, i.e. why use a s=\r\nigmoid of all \n  possible methods for normalization?  \n\n  Still, normalizat=\r\nion in the broader sense is a good idea. (This sort \n  of answers part C of=\r\n your question.)  So in other words, if there is \n  an input that naturtall=\r\ny varies from 0 to 1,000,000, you proabably \n  want to compress that range =\r\na lot sending it into the net.  So \n  the &quot;activation function&quot; would be th=\r\ne function that compresses the \n  range.  But that really shouldn&#39;t be call=\r\ned an &quot;activation \n  function,&quot; since it&#39;s really just data preprocessing, =\r\nand also \n  because different inputs in the same net probably should be \n  =\r\nnormalized in different ways.\n\n  Anyway, I have probably been redundant wit=\r\nh some of the stuff in \n  this long thread, but I wanted to try to answer s=\r\nince I said I would \n  before when I was too swamped.\n\n  ken\n\n\n        Yaho=\r\no!
