I think the main question you are ask=\r\ning is how it knows how long those arrays are.\n\nThe answer is that rtNEAT (=\r\nor plain NEAT) C++ counts the number of inputs and number of outputs when i=\r\nt creates a neural network from a genome, which happens in the method \n\nNet=\r\nwork *Genome::genesis(int id)\n\nWhen it creates the network, it creates sepa=\r\nrate lists of inputs, hidden nodes, and outputs, as you can see here:\n\n    =\r\n            //Check for input or output designation of node\n               =\r\n if (((*curnode)-&gt;gen_node_label)=3D=3DINPUT)\n                        inlis=\r\nt.push_back(newnode);\n                if (((*curnode)-&gt;gen_node_label)=3D=\r\n=3DBIAS)\n                        inlist.push_back(newnode);\n               =\r\n if (((*curnode)-&gt;gen_node_label)=3D=3DOUTPUT)\n                        outl=\r\nist.push_back(newnode);\n\nThen it knows how many inputs there are and how ma=\r\nny outputs there are because it knows how long those lists are.\n\nGoing back=\r\n further in the chain, usually the first place this issue will ultimately b=\r\ne specified is in the starter genome file, which is usually the origin of t=\r\nhe genome data structures (which are created from this file).  Here is a po=\r\nle balancing starter genome:\n\ngenomestart 1\ntrait 1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nnode =\r\n1 0 1 1\nnode 2 0 1 1\nnode 3 0 1 1\nnode 4 0 1 3\nnode 5 0 0 2\ngene 1 1 5 0.0 =\r\n0 1 0 1\ngene 1 2 5 0.0 0 2 0 1\ngene 1 3 5 0.0 0 3 0 1\ngene 1 4 5 0.0 0 4 0 =\r\n1\ngenomeend 1\n\nHere the numerical codes next the nodes specify what type of=\r\n nodes they are.  In this case, there are 4 inputs (one is a bias) and 1 ou=\r\ntput.  These codes are defined in nnode.h:\n\n        enum nodetype {\n       =\r\n         NEURON =3D 0,\n                SENSOR =3D 1\n        };\n\n        enu=\r\nm nodeplace {\n                HIDDEN =3D 0,\n                INPUT =3D 1,\n  =\r\n              OUTPUT =3D 2,\n                BIAS =3D 3\n        };\n\nSo usual=\r\nly that is from where NEAT ultimately ends up knowing these counts.  I hope=\r\n that helps answer your question.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;arma=\r\nn.schwarz&quot; &lt;arman.schwarz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; hi everyone, \n&gt; I am currently tr=\r\nying to apply timeseries prediction to the rtNEAT c++ package, to compare i=\r\nts search performance to a fixed-size, evolving topology recurrent neural n=\r\net I wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have written a custom experiments.h/cpp file to cycle th=\r\nrough the activate() function for every time step, after loading an array o=\r\nf ~75 sensor inputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; So while I understand how to load the inputs and =\r\nretrieve the outputs, I don&#39;t quite understand how I am supposed to tell NE=\r\nAT how many inputs and outputs there are. after all, that array I&#39;m passing=\r\n to load_sensor is nothing more than a pointer to a value.\n&gt; \n&gt; so where do=\r\n I tell NEAT how many inputs I will give each net, and how many outputs I w=\r\nill be expecting? (in my RNN the outputs were simply the last x neurons, bu=\r\nt the inputs do need to be defined).\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance for the help!\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
