Valsalam wrote an excellent paper on making modular\ns=\r\nubnetworks in order to take advantage of a symmetrical configuration\nof leg=\r\ns, as in a quadruped trot, bound, pace or &quot;pronk&quot;. This sounds\nlike a good =\r\nidea, but in the case of a biped or humanoid creature (for\nexample, the rag=\r\ndoll rig I&#39;m currently working on has 20 1-dof\njoints), I&#39;m not sure I want=\r\n to limit myself from exploring behavior\nthat isn&#39;t strictly modular with r=\r\nespect to the limb. Symmetry is only\nbilateral in a humanoid, you won&#39;t ach=\r\nieve as dramatic a reduction in\nsearch space as you do with 4 or more symme=\r\ntrical limbs by\ncompartmentalizing it that way.\n\nSo the question is, how do=\r\n I lay out my ragdoll model in the substrate\nif I want to take advantage of=\r\n the geometric relationship between the\njoints in the body?\n\n\n\n"}}
