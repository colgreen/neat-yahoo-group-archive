I was having a\nlot of trouble reproducing the performance results, until I specified that\nthe starting population networks should be fully connected (every input\nconnected to every output) which I only thought to do after reading the\nbelow from the NEAT FAQ and realising that the published results would have\nused the original code that is not able to start without fully connected\nnetworks. I was then able to get the same performance as described in the\nlinked article. In the NEAT FAQ on the users page it says:\n\n*&quot;Can I start NEAT with some inputs disconnected? (IMPORTANT) *\n*The reason this question is important is that if we can start NEAT with\nsome inputs disconnected, then we can allow NEAT to decide which inputs are\nimportant. This process has two good effects: (1) You can start minimally\neven in problems with many inputs and (2) you don&#39;t need to know a priori\nwhat the important features of the domain are. Recent results *(\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:gecco05)* reported in this paper\nsuggest that this approach can be quite effective.&quot;*\n\nWhat has been others&#39; experience with initial population connectivity? I\nnoticed in SharpNEAT that the initial connectivity can be specified as a\npercentage. Have people found this sort of parameter to be useful? At the\nmoment I&#39;m experimenting with starting with initial populations which have\nbeen generated by applying the mutation operators with an increased\nmutation rate (adding between 0 and the maximum number of connections (ie\nfully connected)), with these results (averaged over 50 runs, with maximum\nof 500 generations):\n\nFully connected with randomly set initial weight values:\n   All runs solved in average of 26 generations.\nNo initial connections:\n   Only 4 runs solved.\nEach member in population has between 0 and the maximum number of\nconnections:\n   All runs solved in average of 93 generations.\nNo initial connections (add connection mutation rate = 0.5):\n   All runs solved in average of 40 generations.\n\nWhen starting with no initial connections it seems evolution really\nstruggles to find a solution and is getting stuck in local optima. After\n100 or 200 generations there will be around 15 species, but none of these\nmanages to improve (I tried enabling and disabling the killing off of\nspecies after 15 generations but this made no difference). Increasing the\nnumber of generations to 1000 didn&#39;t seem to help (I did about 10 runs with\n1000 generations, none of them found a solution). It seems that in this\ncase with these parameter settings NEAT is unable to add the necessary\nstructure despite protection of innovation via speciation.\n\nThe results when starting with a population where members have between 0\nand the maximum number of connections took about 3.5 times as long as with\na population where all members start fully connected, further indicating\nthat starting with a minimal topology doesn&#39;t help for this task. Perhaps\nthese minimally connected networks take up a large part of the population\nand slow down the evolution of the larger networks.\n\nFinally, to test the hypothesis that NEAT is unable to add the necessary\nstructure I increased the add connection mutation rate from 0.05 to 0.5.\nNEAT was able to find a solution for all runs in an average of 40\ngenerations. I think Ken Stanley mentioned this as an important factor\nrecently, perhaps in a similar context, but I don&#39;t remember the details,\nsorry Ken!\n\nSo this opens the question of whether it&#39;s generally better to start\nminimally and have a higher structural mutation rate, or start with a\nsignificant number of initial connections and have a lower add connection\nmutation rate. I have not implemented the feature selection mutation\noperator that connects an input to all output connections (\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:gecco05), perhaps this is the best\nsolution for some kinds of tasks, however it may be fairly task dependent\n(eg I&#39;m not sure how useful it would be for HyperNEAT where the only inputs\nare substrate neuron coordinates and in nearly all cases they will all be\nuseful).\n\nCheers,\nOliver\n\nT: 0421 972 953 | E: oliver.coleman@... | W: http://ojcoleman.com\n\r\n--001a11c2297c92ce0404e5735b18\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:georgia,=\r\nserif&quot;&gt;Hi all,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:georg=\r\nia,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:georg=\r\nia,serif&quot;&gt;Apologies if some or all of the below has been discussed previous=\r\nly, I searched but found nothing about it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_defaul=\r\nt&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:georgia,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_defaul=\r\nt&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:georgia,serif&quot;&gt;I&#39;m in the process of verifying =\r\nmy implementation of NEAT by comparing its performance against published re=\r\nsults (eg double pole balancing in=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/dow=\r\nnloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf&quot;&gt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/st=\r\nanley.ec02.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).
