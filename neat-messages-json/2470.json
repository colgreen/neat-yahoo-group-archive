Note that that code was \nwritten and d=\r\nistributed before I actually did the adapative work.  \nAt the time, my inte=\r\nntion was simply to keep all possible options \nopen.  It is true that Hebbi=\r\nan learning does not require a special \nfunction at the neuron, but some ot=\r\nher kinds of learning *could*, \nsuch as classic sensitization where an inco=\r\nming connection to a \nneuron becomes more sensitive because of a level of a=\r\nctivity on \nanother incoming connection.  The traits are really meant to be=\r\n \ngeneric parameter holders for any arbitrary function to be possible \nto p=\r\narameterize in the future, for nodes or connections.  \n\nYou may want to che=\r\nck out the leakyNEAT.zip files in the Files \nsection of this group, and als=\r\no my own NEATadaptcore.tar code.  The \nNEATadaptcore contains the actual co=\r\nde for making hebbian updates on \nconnections based on trait parameters, so=\r\n that will answer your \nquestions on how it actually works.  The leakyNEAT =\r\nis interesting \nbecause it adds a time constant parameter to each node, so =\r\nit&#39;s an \nexample of how nodes might have their own independent parameters, =\r\n\nthough I am not certain the author (Tyler Streeter) actually used \ntraits =\r\nto add that parameter.\n\nBy the way, there will soon be a new release of NEA=\r\nT in the form of \nrtNEAT (but which works as normal NEAT as well) with a lo=\r\nt of this \nstuff built in (i.e. the adaptation code).  The trait code will =\r\nalso \nbe cleaner and work better in this new release.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;tomoljack&quot; &lt;thomasjack@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Investigating the C+=\r\n+ source, it seems like NNodes are assigned\n&gt; Traits. I&#39;ve read &quot;EVOLVING A=\r\nDAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORKS WITH AND \nWITHOUT\n&gt; ADAPTIVE SYNAPSES&quot;, but I can&#39;t=\r\n find anything about neurons having\n&gt; traits, only connection genes. Is thi=\r\ns something standard \nin &quot;Hebbian\n&gt; learning&quot;, so that it wasn&#39;t mentioned =\r\nin that publication?\n&gt; \n&gt; The adjustment in weight is a function of the act=\r\nivities of the\n&gt; incoming and outgoing neuron. How could this be applied to=\r\n a \nneuron?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, when the learning equation refers to the &quot;activities=\r\n&quot; of the\n&gt; incoming and outgoing neurons, does it mean the sum of the input=\r\ns \nto\n&gt; those neurons, or the outputs of those neurons?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
