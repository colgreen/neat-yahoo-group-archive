In fact, I would go further an say I\n&gt; w=\r\nas only treating it as a way of increasing search efficiency.  The\n&gt; theory=\r\n is that this happens by increasing diversity, but I wouldn&#39;t\n&gt; call that p=\r\nroven...\n\nWell, obviously the best way to increase search efficiency is to =\r\nonly\nlook where the solution actually lies.  But since we don&#39;t know where\n=\r\nthat is...\n\n&gt; &gt;The more I think about it, the more I think that the hard-ed=\r\nged\n&gt; &gt;demarcation of boundaries is not the best way to go.\n&gt;\n&gt; This was th=\r\ne idea behind my &quot;heap selection&quot; but I still didn&#39;t come\n&gt; up with a formu=\r\nlation of that that really gelled.\n\nI don&#39;t remember that discussion, can y=\r\nou refresh my memory?\n\n&gt; &gt;Well, speciation, done right, is basically &#39;clust=\r\nering&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; An alternative view is that each species represents a\n&gt; semi-in=\r\ndependent search.\n\nTrue.  If you assign an individual to a species because =\r\nhe was born\ninto that species.  But if you go through the population and tr=\r\ny to\nallocate individuals to species, THAT is a clustering problem.  And\nty=\r\npical clustering algorithms will address it.\n\n&gt; Their solution spaces have =\r\ninternal structure\n&gt; (partial-independence of the parts of the solution) so=\r\n that merging\n&gt; parts of different solutions can lead to good results.  e.g=\r\n. in TTT\n&gt; you might merge an individual who can play for winning lines wit=\r\nh one\n&gt; who can block losing lines, and end up with a better player overall=\r\n...\n\nHave you been able to demonstrate this?\n\n&gt; All this is true, but I thi=\r\nnk you are making the implicit assumption\n&gt; that the distance metric used t=\r\no determine the distance between\n&gt; individuals reflects something real abou=\r\nt the solution\n&gt; space.\n\nHow does one define &#39;real&#39; in a case like this?  ;=\r\n)\n\n&gt; Unfortunately this is not the case, one small area of space\n&gt; might co=\r\nntain several solutions that we would want to call different,\n&gt; whereas ano=\r\nther area might be huge but contain only solutions that we\n&gt; would want to =\r\ncall the same...\n\nCorrect.  Why would we want to call them different?  Beca=\r\nuse they are\nin an area of the search space that is profitable, and we want=\r\n to\nfocus more resources there.  That was why I talked about combining the\n=\r\ndistance metric with the fitness metric.  I would also find a way to\nfactor=\r\n in more than just the nodal connections in determining\ndifference.  Two in=\r\ndividuals with the same structure and all nearly\nthe same weights should be=\r\n much closer together than two with the same\nstructure, but each having ran=\r\ndom weights.\n\nBut then, what about two individuals who are mirror images of=\r\n one\nanother?  Well, for the purposes of breeding, they probably aren&#39;t\n&#39;si=\r\nmilar&#39; even though they are, from a functional stand point.  So\nperhaps we =\r\ncan disregard that factor.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately any distance metric is going to=\r\n be at best an estimate\n&gt; of how different two individuals are algorithmica=\r\nlly.\n\nMaybe.  But if we could devise a better distance metric...\n\n&gt; So what=\r\n I&#39;m saying is if you spread the individuals too evenly\n&gt; according to the =\r\ndistance metric, you might doom 99% of them to be in\n&gt; unproductive areas, =\r\njust because the productive areas are relatively small...\n\nAgreed.  Again, =\r\nthat&#39;s why it would be altered by fitness.  Like a\ngaussian distribution, w=\r\nhere &#39;samples&#39; are selected from the\npopulation more densely in the space w=\r\nhere there is higher fitness. \nBut because you DO choose some individuals i=\r\nn lower-fitness areas, you\npreserve that genetic diversity.\n\n&gt; &gt;Let&#39;s say t=\r\nhat your 1000 individuals become, for the sake of argument,\n&gt; &gt;10,000 indiv=\r\niduals.  Now, you don&#39;t want to test them all.  So,\n&gt; &gt;instead, you sample =\r\nthe 1000 of them that best represent the whole\n&gt; &gt;search space covered by t=\r\nhat 10,000, with a little bias for areas of\n&gt; &gt;the search space where the f=\r\nitness is higher.\n&gt;\n&gt; You lost me.  There can&#39;t be any point in generating =\r\nindividuals that\n&gt; are not tested?  I can understand if you wanted to test =\r\nsome of them\n&gt; more heavily than others, but surely an individual that is c=\r\nreated\n&gt; and deleted without ever being tested has effectively never existe=\r\nd?\n\nCorrect.  It&#39;s a thought experiment.  You wouldn&#39;t likely implement it\n=\r\nlike that, since it would be such a waste of computation resources. \nBut th=\r\nink of the concept.  Picture a 2-dimensional &#39;space&#39; where\nindividuals are =\r\nplotted somewhere in that space.  Now imagine applying\nthe reproduction des=\r\ncribed.  Suddenly, there is better than 10 times\nas many points.  We know f=\r\nrom the evaluation of the last generation\nwhat &#39;areas&#39; of the search space =\r\nare of higher significance (fitness),\nso we concentrate our search there.  =\r\nWe select &#39;points&#39; in the search\nspace and say &quot;let&#39;s test here&quot;.  Then we =\r\nselect the individual that\nrepresents that point in space.\n\nThe problem wit=\r\nh the current method is that you choose individuals\nthat are close to that =\r\narea, breed them, and HOPE that you get an\noffspring that is in the area th=\r\nat is worth searching.  Unfortunately,\nthat isn&#39;t necessarily what happens.=\r\n  You could breed two individuals\nthat are on opposite sides of the ideal s=\r\nolution, hoping that their\noffspring would be in the area right in the midd=\r\nle.  But it could end\nup being actually somewhere way off in left field.\n\nW=\r\nhereas by defining the individuals and then selecting the one that is\nin th=\r\ne &#39;space&#39; you are interested in persuing, that goes away.  Now,\nit is a tot=\r\nal WASTE to generate that many individuals, of course. \nWhat would be bette=\r\nr would be to identify the space you are interested\nin, and then be able to=\r\n deliberately merge the two individuals in such\na way as to create an indiv=\r\nidual in that exact location in the search\nspace.  And if you can tell me h=\r\now to do that with a reasonable amount\nof CPU cycles, GREAT!  But in the me=\r\nan time, generating a whole bunch\nof extra genomes and then selecting the o=\r\nnes that are the most\ninteresting seems to me to be a more pragmatic approa=\r\nch to\naccomplishing that goal.\n\nThink of the 10k new individuals as &#39;Where =\r\nCOULD we go from here?&#39;. \nThen the sampling of them as &#39;Where WILL we go fr=\r\nom here?&#39;\n\nBut yes, it does pre-suppose that it is possible to define an\nn-=\r\ndimensional space that has structure related to the ability of\nindividuals =\r\nto solve the problem.  Is that achievable?   Is there a\nway to define a &#39;po=\r\nint&#39; in space using N data points, and having them\nactually be related in s=\r\nuch a way that the measurement of &#39;distance&#39;\nbetween points actually bears =\r\nsome useful result?  It is assumed that\ntwo individuals that are very close=\r\n in structure should have very\nsimilar fitness.  Thus, it is assumed that s=\r\nuch a &#39;structure&#39; exists. \nSo how can we effectively model it such that we =\r\ncan use what we know\nfrom what we have tested to be able to identify where =\r\nto test next? \nHill climbing, for example, assumes this very ability.\n\nHere=\r\n&#39;s a silly thought.  Let me just throw it out there.\n\nImagine creating a ne=\r\nural network whose inputs are the structure of a\nneural network.  For each =\r\nindividual with that topology that you test,\npass their weights to this net=\r\nwork, and use back propagation to adjust\nthe weights of that meta-network. =\r\n Once the meta-network achieves a\nmeasure of success at predicting the fitn=\r\ness of an actual network, we\ncan use the &#39;model&#39; that exists inside that ne=\r\ntwork to identify where,\nbased on that model, would be the best area in the=\r\n search space (for\nthat topology) to look.\n\nThe whole idea is &#39;more efficie=\r\nnt searches&#39;.  The idea of hill\nclimbing rests on the assumption that an im=\r\nprovement is always a good\nidea.  But the reality of a local optima proves =\r\nthat the assumption is\nwrong.  So we look for ways around it, but without l=\r\netting go of that\nbasic assumption.\n\nBut if instead of making assumptions w=\r\ne actually make models of our\nsearch, perhaps we CAN be more efficient for =\r\nthose more complicated\nsearches where the search space is full of local opt=\r\nima.\n\nJust throwing out ideas...\n\n-- John\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;          Ian\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The puris=\r\nt that tries to squeeze out every last bit of performance\n&gt; &gt;from the genom=\r\ne portion of the evolution would probably call that a\n&gt; &gt;waste of computati=\r\nonal resources.  But for a really large and complex\n&gt; &gt;search space, I prop=\r\nose that this will make for a much more efficient\n&gt; &gt;search that is less li=\r\nkely to get stuck in a local optima.  Thus,\n&gt; &gt;reducing the amount of fitne=\r\nss evaluations (the really expensive part\n&gt; &gt;of any non-trivial domain), yo=\r\nu win in the end.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But the only way to know for sure is to try it out=\r\n and see what the\n&gt; &gt;results are.  That means figuring out the right way to=\r\n do that\n&gt; &gt;&#39;sampling&#39;.  Anybody have any suggestions on how best do do tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;representative sampling of the search space covered by the 10,000\n&gt; &gt;i=\r\nndividuals?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-- John\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
