This surprises me.  Surely I&#39;m not the only\n&gt; code monkey here. :)  How are you guys spending your time?\n\nI&#39;ve mentioned it before, but Philip Tucker and I are working on a \nnew Java implementation of NEAT that we hope to opensource the first \nversion of within the next month or so.\n\nOur primary focus is on board game domains.  Initially, we&#39;re going \nto be running some experiments with Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku (five-in-a-\nrow).  Some of the areas we&#39;re interested in exploring are:\n\n1) Coevolutionary Algorithms -- I&#39;d like to do some extensive \ncomparisons of various coevolutionary algorithms, such as comparisons \nbetween single and two-or-more population coevolution, and the most \neffective ways to sample opponents each generation to ensure that \ndesirable coevolutionary &quot;arms races&quot; continue throughout a run.\n\n2) Variations on NEAT -- The &quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;augmenting&quot;, and all the \ntopological mutations in NEAT are additive.  We&#39;d like to experiment \nwith subtractive mutations, as a way of pruning inefficient or \nunnecessary topology in a mature individual.\n\n3) Indirect Encoding -- We&#39;ve thought of some approaches to indirect \nencoding within the context of NEAT.  I&#39;d personally like to \nexperiment with mutations that replace single neurons with modular \nsubnets, kept in a pool (as in SANE and Joseph&#39;s modular NEAT \nexperiments).\n\nSo there are lots of different experimental tangents we&#39;d like to \nexplore in the coming year, though these are the three that interest \nme the most.  But for the moment, we&#39;re still coding away...\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
