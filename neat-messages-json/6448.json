It can be considered as a subfield of robotics that aims\nto create more robust and adaptive robots. A pivotal feature of the\nevolutionary approach is that it considers the whole robot at once, and\nenables the exploitation of robot features in a holistic manner.\nEvolutionary robotics can also be seen as an innovative approach to the\nstudy of evolution based on a new kind of experimentalism. The use of\nrobots as a substrate can help to address questions that are difficult,\nif not impossible, to investigate through computer simulations or\nbiological studies. In this paper, we consider the main achievements of\nevolutionary robotics, focusing particularly on its contributions to\nboth engineering and biology. We briefly elaborate on methodological\nissues, review some of the most interesting findings, and discuss\nimportant open issues and promising avenues for future work.\n\nBest,\n\nstef\n\n\r\n--------------040204040007080405000801\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body text=&quot;#000000&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Nicolas Bredeche, Jean-Baptiste Mouret, Gusz Eiben and myself are\n    pleased to announce the release of our review article on\n    evolutionary robotics in the new Frontiers in Robotics and AI\n    journal (specialty section Evolutionary Robotics).&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Link to the paper (open access): &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot;\n      href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2015.00004&quot;&gt;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2015.00004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Title:&lt;br&gt;\n    Evolutionary Robotics: what, why and where to&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Abstract:&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;\n    Evolutionary robotics applies the selection, variation, and heredity\n    principles of natural evolution to the design of robots with\n    embodied intelligence.
