My\n&gt; system was able to pick games where the away team wins over 60% of the\n&gt; time, which is a nice improvement over 25%. However;\n&gt; \n&gt; The downside is that when the strategy was able to pick a winner, it was\n&gt; usually very poor odds (1.5 times the money or less on average) and in\n&gt; the end, the system couldn&#39;t be profitable. If you&#39;re able to predict the\n&gt; result (home, draw, away) 67% of the time, the payback must be 1.5 to\n&gt; break even. And the more predictable games are, the lower the odds are on\n&gt; the winner - that&#39;s what odds are. At best, a strategy would be able to\n&gt; find errors in the odds makers strategies which is fairly hard.\n\nAh - my other (and more recent) hobby-horse!\n\n&gt; Further, if you invest 100% of your capital on each predictable game, one\n&gt; loss will wipe out all your funds. So I played 20% of the (simulated)\n&gt; capital per game. While this limits the downside, it severely limits the\n&gt; upside.\n\n20% is a scary number.  Bear in mind that you may have simultaneous\nbets running. What if 40 games kick off at 3pm on Saturday and your\nsystem wants to bet on 10 of them?\n\nIf you can correctly estimate your &quot;edge&quot; then the Kelly Criterion can\nbe applied to determine stake size. I rather like the idea of having\nthe model tell me how much it thinks I should bet (or tell me its\nestimate of the edge and I&#39;ll work out how much to bet).\n\nSay you estimate the likelihood of an away win at 70% and the bookies\nhave it at 60% (odds are 1.67). You have an edge of about 16% and\nKelly would suggest you bet an amount that increases your bank by that\namount: about 25% in this case. A more conservative measure might be\nto bet half that amount (a &quot;Half-Kelly&quot; staking plan).\n\nBut the bookies are very accurate in pricing Home-Draw-Away results:\nif your model is predicting a large mispricing, be careful: the model\nmay be wrong.\n\n&gt; Sadly, it wasn&#39;t as good picking winners out of bounds as it was in\n&gt; bounds, which kinda killed the usefulness even if it had been able to\n&gt; predict profitably.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone else done any work in this vein?\n\nI did have some success with identifying matches where the likelihood\nof half-time/full-time draw-draw was greater than implied by the\nbookmakers&#39; odds: it was profitable the first season I operated it\n(for small stakes while I tested it) and blew up spectacularly the\nfollowing season. If the correct scores market were more competitively\npriced then I think it could be profitable: 1-1 draws would probably\nbe the place to start as they&#39;re the most frequent result (in English\ngames at least). There&#39;s a colossal overround in that market though,\nwhich is hard to overcome. There may be some advantage to using the\nexchanges over the fixed-odds bookmakers. I do know of at least one\nguy who has a Ward Systems Predictor-based system that just takes the\nlast six scores for each team. He seems to get some promising results,\nalthough I don&#39;t think he&#39;s made his first million yet...\n\nI was evolving the weights on a fixed-topology network working from\nheavily-preprocessed data. I also played with a version of GEP\n(interesting but fruitless).  I think NEAT is massively attractive\nhere: topology can vary and a larger range of input data can be\npresented (I&#39;d be inclined to start with an un- or sparsely-connected\nnetwork and let the program work out what&#39;s useful).\n\nAs with the stock market stuff, this is a topic about which I can go\non and on and on.... So I&#39;d better stop for now. If you&#39;re brave\nenough to want to ask questions I am more than happy to bore you some\nmore!\n\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias\n\n"}}
