It has 7 inputs and 1 output and \nusually around 3 or 4 hidden nodes, but the program still runs out of \nmemory on 32bit Windows, with 4GB of RAM. Task Manager shows the slow \nbut inexorable increase in memory size. The limit is usually hit around \n10,000 generations. It sounds a lot but tests on random Out-of-Sample \ndata, whenever there is an improvement in performance would suggest that \nwe haven&#39;t yet reached over-fitting.\n\nSo... is there anything I can do to avoid the need to keep the complete \ngeneration history, which seems to be the root of the problem.\n\nThis is a different problem to that I cited in my message of 13-Jan-2011.\n\n-- \nRob Marsden\nGistix (Northern) Limited\n\n"}}
