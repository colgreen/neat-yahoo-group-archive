So I think we should model our work after\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; simplest organisms that we know something about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, but NEAT does employ sexual reproduction,\n&gt; albeit\n&gt; a very simplified representation of it, which is\n&gt; obviously a more complicated mode of reproduction\n&gt; than\n&gt; asexual reproduction.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we only used the simplest models from nature,\n&gt; then\n&gt; we would be potentially excluding some of the most\n&gt; effective evolutionary features.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re right that we should keep in mind that our\n&gt; models are nowhere near the complexity of biological\n&gt; ones, and so analogy with real-world organisms\n&gt; sometimes breaks down.  But if we&#39;re modeling sexual\n&gt; reproduction, obviously we need to draw analogies\n&gt; from\n&gt; organisms that actually reproduce that way.\n\nPerhaps we don&#39;t mean the same thing by the term\n&quot;sexual reproduction&quot;.  I was referring to the\nphenomenon of gender, whereby the population of one\nspecies is divided into two groups, and mating can\nonly be with an individual from the other group. \nAlso, each individual carries a pair of homologous\nchromosomes, one of which came from the father and the\nother from the mother.  The phenotype depends on both\nchromosomes in a complicated way. (And of course there\nare multiple pairs of chromosomes in most species.)\n\nNEAT doesn&#39;t model any of that, or did I miss that in\nmy reading?  That&#39;s why I suggested bacteria, yeast\nand algae as our natural models.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
