My main point was not about \nreaching any particular l=\r\nong term goal.  My point was that there is \nan analogy between the *process=\r\n* of IEC and natural evolution.  \nRemember that the original statement that=\r\n spawned this discussion \nwas about IEC being more natural than TBE.  \n\nWhe=\r\nn you mention that IEC can no better reproduce an image than TBE \n(and that=\r\n you had trouble with your tiger), you are really making my \npoint.  As soo=\r\nn as you start setting a target (such as your tiger), \nyou are in effect im=\r\nposing TBE.  That is, an individual who starts \nplaying with an IEC interfa=\r\nce from scratch who is intent on \nachieving a particular image will be disa=\r\nppointed because they are \nbasically just doing TBE.  \n\nHowever, Picbreeder=\r\n *as a whole* is not like that because it is not \npossible for there to be =\r\nany overriding goal across the whole \nsystem.  That was why I emphasized th=\r\ne fact that each individual in \na chain of branches has a different set of =\r\nmotivations.  So \nsomeone&#39;s flower could end up the seed for a tiger that n=\r\nobody was \neven looking for, even though you coudln&#39;t volitionally direct i=\r\nt \ntowards a tiger.  The target, in effect, is irrelevant. \n\nWhat&#39;s importa=\r\nnt is the proliferation of jumping-off points.  And \nremember when I say &quot;i=\r\nmportant&quot; all I&#39;m talking about is importance \ntoward making an anology wit=\r\nh natural evolution, which similarly had \nno overriding goal and still has =\r\nno overriding goal.  Remember what \nDawkins said about how as soon as organ=\r\nisms fill all the simple \nniches the only way to find a new niche is to com=\r\nplexity (Jeff and I \nboth saw Dawkins speak at GECCO).  I am not talking ab=\r\nout importance \ntowards any particular goal.  The side effect of the proces=\r\ns I&#39;m \nreferring to is thus a kind of natural complexification.\n\nThat&#39;s why=\r\n I said, &quot;Stop telling evolution what you want and let \nevolution show you =\r\nwhat it can do.&quot;  Evolution can do a lot of \namazing things if we just let =\r\nit show us the paths it is disposed to \ntake.  IEC is a way of exploring al=\r\nl those paths with no particular \npurpose in mind (just like nature).\n\nBy t=\r\nhe way, you are right there have been a number of group-IEC \nsystems in the=\r\n past.  It&#39;s good you pointed that out because it \nfurther clarifies what I=\r\n&#39;m meaning to get at.  What makes Picbreeder \nunique is that it is based en=\r\ntirely on branching.  These past \nsystems generally averaged the input of t=\r\nheir users in one way or \nanother, which tends to cause a washout effect.  =\r\nWhat IEC should do \nto create a process like nature is proliferate jumping-=\r\noff points, \nbut an averaging system does the opposite- it only admits thin=\r\ngs \nthat are universally acceptable.\n\nIn fact, I can even demonstrate to yo=\r\nu that it is not just the CPPN \nencoding that is allowing the impressive re=\r\nsults on Picbreeder \nbecause one such project on the internet actually alre=\r\nady used \nDelphiNEAT-based encoding, but they implemented the collaboration=\r\n \nwith the traditional averaging method.  It&#39;s called the &quot;Living \nImage Pr=\r\noject.&quot;  Look at the massive difference between what this \nsystem produces =\r\nand Picbreeder (the Living Image Project has been \ngoing more than a year):=\r\n\n\nhttp://w-shadow.com/li/\n\nIt&#39;s important to note that I don&#39;t mean to pick=\r\n on this project.  \nIt was one of the very few of its kind when it began an=\r\nd was \ngenuinely groundbreaking.  Its author deserves to be commended and \n=\r\nits a lot of fun to follow.  Yet it does show that when you are \ncollating =\r\na mass of opinions, you cannot go off in a myriad of \ndifferent directions.=\r\n  In fact, you can barely move anywhere at \nall.  Collaborative Genetic Art=\r\n installations of the past generally \nused this collating method (in one wa=\r\ny or another) and produced \nimages that look generally pretty, but don&#39;t sh=\r\now any real \nprogression.\n\nAnyway, the main point is that the multi-user br=\r\nanching-style of IEC \n(like Picbreeder) leads to a process that is more ana=\r\nlogous to \nnatural evolution than TBE.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; See below. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; image as a target an=\r\nd evaluate against that.  Could we then \nevolve a\n&gt; &gt; CPPN (or ANN if you p=\r\nrefer) that produces the desired image?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer is surprising (=\r\nwe&#39;ve tried it!).  It turns out to be \nvery\n&gt; &gt; hard with anything but the =\r\nsimplest of images.  What you discover\n&gt; &gt; quickly is that the fitness func=\r\ntion isn&#39;t rewarding the right\n&gt; &gt; things.  The images tends to devolve int=\r\no a gray cloud that \nminimizes\n&gt; &gt; error by choosing an intermediate shade-=\r\n not what you want at \nall.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet the issue is deeper than that.  In=\r\n fact, here is what is \nreally\n&gt; &gt; interesting: If you take any image (exce=\r\npt the simplest ones) on\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder- images that were evolved through I=\r\nEC with NEAT- you \nwill\n&gt; &gt; not be able to evolve to those same images thro=\r\nugh TBE with \nNEAT!  I\n&gt; &gt; challenge anyone to disprove me on this; I&#39;d be =\r\nvery interested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is a remarkable observation: NEAT can&#39;t repr=\r\noduce it&#39;s own\n&gt; &gt; results!  The only conclusion is that the selection meth=\r\nod is the\n&gt; &gt; culprit.  That is, it has to do with how you decide what&#39;s go=\r\nod \nin\n&gt; &gt; any particular generation, which of course is different in IEC \n=\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; TBE.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t reproduce images using IEC either.=\r\n..I tried \nto get to\n&gt; a tiger looking shape and did not get very far (thou=\r\ngh I only \nstuck around\n&gt; for about 40 generations). Note: a tiger&#39;s entire=\r\n body in profile, \nnot a\n&gt; face. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So let&#39;s look more closely at this=\r\n issue:  How did we evolve \nimages\n&gt; &gt; interactively that could not be reac=\r\nhed through regular TBE?  The\n&gt; &gt; answer is that humans have a different wa=\r\ny of rewarding \nintermediate\n&gt; &gt; results.  In particular, human breeders in=\r\n IEC examine what is \ngood\n&gt; &gt; *in the present* and make their decision bas=\r\ned on that whereas \nTBE\n&gt; &gt; compares what you have in the present to a long=\r\n-term future goal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps if you&#39;ve used Picbreeder or IEC you ma=\r\ny think that you \nwere\n&gt; &gt; actually evolving to a target and thus that I am=\r\n wrong.  But\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder disproves this view.  As soon as *someone else*=\r\n \nbranches\n&gt; &gt; from your image, whatever &quot;target&quot; you may have had in mind =\r\n(if \nany)\n&gt; &gt; is irrelevant.  They have their own ideas about what is good.=\r\n  \nSo it\n&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t possible that what the next person in the chain evolved =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; your original intent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On the other hand I may not need to =\r\ngo that far to make the point\n&gt; &gt; because if you&#39;re like me, you kind of di=\r\nscover what&#39;s cool as \nyou\n&gt; &gt; go.  I may have a vague idea in mind, but on=\r\n the road to that \nidea I\n&gt; &gt; see that something cool I hadn&#39;t thought of b=\r\nefore pops up, so I \ngo\n&gt; &gt; off in that direction instead.  What matters mo=\r\nst is what&#39;s good \nin\n&gt; &gt; the present.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now here is the connection =\r\nto natural evolution:  Natural \nevolution\n&gt; &gt; is also completely unconcerne=\r\nd with ultimate goals or targets.  \nIt\n&gt; &gt; only concerns itself with whethe=\r\nr the present candidates are \ngood in\n&gt; &gt; the present.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am goin=\r\ng to argue that that is a major source of its power; it\n&gt; &gt; explains in par=\r\nt its prolific creativity and its astounding \nability\n&gt; &gt; to elaborate inde=\r\nfinitely.  Yes, I am claiming that it can do all\n&gt; &gt; that because it *doesn=\r\n&#39;t* have a target.\n&gt; \n&gt; True, but the problem is not IEC vs TBE...it is lon=\r\ng-term targets \nvs.\n&gt; something like co-evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So then what&#39;s so=\r\n great about not having a target?  What&#39;s great \nis\n&gt; &gt; that you get reward=\r\ned for doing what you *can* do.  And a good\n&gt; &gt; encoding can do a lot.  How=\r\never, what&#39;s very difficult, even for \na\n&gt; &gt; good encoding, is to do a comp=\r\nletely arbitrary complex thing \nthat is\n&gt; &gt; nowhere close to the current po=\r\npulation in the search space.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is why I called TBE a liability=\r\n:  It evaluates the current\n&gt; &gt; candidates against something that ignores t=\r\nheir current strengths\n&gt; &gt; completely.  For example, imagine if the first b=\r\nilateria \n(bilaterally-\n&gt; &gt; symmetric organisms) were evaluated for their h=\r\numanity.  They \nwould\n&gt; &gt; all fail miserably and they would all therefore b=\r\ne eliminated.\n&gt; &gt; Humanity would never have evolved even though we in fact =\r\ndid \nevolve\n&gt; &gt; from the first bilateria!  If TBE were in charge and humans=\r\n were \nthe\n&gt; &gt; goal, we wouldn&#39;t exist right now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Try going back e=\r\nven farther.  Can you imagine evaluating single\n&gt; &gt; celled organisms for th=\r\neir &quot;human-ness?&quot;  That would be silly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet that is exactly what w=\r\ne are doing in most evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; experiments.  We do nothing to capture=\r\n good intermediate ideas \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; which it would be possible to build our =\r\nultimate objectives.  So \nwe\n&gt; &gt; are hampered from getting anywhere truly i=\r\nnteresting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that true in experiments like Karl Sims, or in the Gole=\r\nm \nProject, were\n&gt; goals were things like &quot;whatever can move the farthest f=\r\nrom the \nstarting\n&gt; point in x seconds is more fit&quot;? It seems like you can =\r\nequally \njudge\n&gt; bilaterals vs. humans on this goals (and man do those bila=\r\nterals \nsuck...but\n&gt; they are probably better than single cells).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Then you might ask, that&#39;s all well and good, but how in the \nworld\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncan we reward the intermediate serendipitous discoveries if we \ndon&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; k=\r\nnow what they should be?  The  answer is: Respect the fact that \nyou\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t know what they are.  Stop trying to *tell* evolution what \nit\n&gt; &gt; can d=\r\no and let it *show* you what it can do.  When it shows you\n&gt; &gt; something co=\r\nol, then keep that for later.  Keep everything with \nany\n&gt; &gt; promise for la=\r\nter.  You never know what might be a foundation \nfor the\n&gt; &gt; next level up.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s exactly what natural evolution did and that&#39;s exactly \nwha=\r\nt IEC\n&gt; &gt; (Picbreeder variety) does:  In nature what happened was that \nthe=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; were many ways of doing a good job (at surviving) and there was \nroo=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; enough on Earth to support a lot of them at once.  Nobody &quot;knew&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhich ones would form a good foundation for something more \ncomplex\n&gt; &gt; (an=\r\nd many lineages didn&#39;t go anywhere), but because a lot of cool\n&gt; &gt; ideas we=\r\nre able to hang around, some of them happened to be good\n&gt; &gt; stepping stone=\r\ns to the next big thing.  The issue was where the \nDNA\n&gt; &gt; encoding could g=\r\no next from where it is now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Same with IEC in Picbreeder:  We don&#39;=\r\nt know what we want to \nevolve\n&gt; &gt; collectively.  I think it&#39;s fair to say =\r\nthat we have no \ncollective\n&gt; &gt; common goal at all.  We are all just trying=\r\n different paths.  \nSome of\n&gt; &gt; us, when we see a cool path, take that path=\r\n a bit farther and a \nbit\n&gt; &gt; farther still.  We keep all the intermediate =\r\nstages around \nforever\n&gt; &gt; and we therefore preserve all possible stepping =\r\nstones.  Some \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; to be genuinely good foundations for future progr=\r\ness, like those \nthat\n&gt; &gt; produced the car, or the recent skull.  Yet who w=\r\nould have seen \nthat\n&gt; &gt; coming?  If we had tried to evolve to them from th=\r\ne start, we&#39;d \nbe\n&gt; &gt; nowhere (we&#39;d be in the usual TBE trap).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For=\r\n this reason, what&#39;s going on in Picbreeder is really \nintriguing.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s=\r\n the first artificial evolutionary experiment that is really\n&gt; &gt; doing some=\r\nthing like natural evolution!  We may have some amazing\n&gt; \n&gt; Karl Sims had =\r\nexhibits where the length of time people stood in \nfront of an\n&gt; image dete=\r\nrmined its fitness...and there have been others that put \nthe\n&gt; fitness eva=\r\nluation in the hands of distributed users (one at Gecco \nthis\n&gt; year, for e=\r\nxample)...so, while I think that (because of the CPPN)\n&gt; picbreeder&#39;s image=\r\ns are cooler than what others are producing, \nisn&#39;t it a\n&gt; stretch to call =\r\nit the first?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; encodings out there, but we don&#39;t get to see it becaus=\r\ne all we \ndo is\n&gt; &gt; TBE, where we keep losing the intermediate foundations =\r\nwe would \nneed\n&gt; &gt; to get to a new level.  Picbreeder is the first time tha=\r\nt we let\n&gt; &gt; evolution show us what it can do instead of telling it what we=\r\n \nwant\n&gt; &gt; it to do.  We are respecting the encoding just as nature \nrespec=\r\nted\n&gt; &gt; DNA.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are some important corollaries: First, TBE is n=\r\not just \nabout\n&gt; &gt; images.  In effect, all regular fitness functions have t=\r\nhe same \nTBE\n&gt; &gt; liability.  Do you think you can evolve an amazing neural =\r\nnetwork\n&gt; &gt; with NEAT or with HyperNEAT?  Or something else?  Well, if you =\r\n\nhave a\n&gt; &gt; target behavior that you evaluate against, you are never going =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; know how amazing things could be.  This is a sobering \nrealization.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s just as true with behaviors as it is with images.  (This\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nnsight suggests that evolving behaviors interactively instead of\n&gt; &gt; throug=\r\nh a fitness function is a really promising path)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One exception is =\r\ncompetitive coevolution, wherein individuals\n&gt; &gt; actually are evaluated aga=\r\ninst other individuals, so it&#39;s not \nreally\n&gt; &gt; target-based.  In a sense i=\r\nndividuals are recognized for being as\n&gt; &gt; good as they can be in the prese=\r\nnt.  Of course, nature is a kind \nof\n&gt; &gt; coevolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet I don&#39;t =\r\nwant to pretend that competitive coevolution is the\n&gt; &gt; perfect pathway to =\r\ncomplexity because the task may be defined in \nsuch\n&gt; &gt; a way that it might=\r\n as well be necessary to solve some gigantic\n&gt; &gt; problem to become good.  F=\r\nor example, competitive coevolution on \nGo\n&gt; &gt; may not really end up reward=\r\ning individuals for finding really \nbasic\n&gt; &gt; regularities that are necessa=\r\nry to eventually evolving a good Go\n&gt; &gt; player.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a good place t=\r\no reiterate my claim from above: would \nhumans be any\n&gt; better at providing=\r\n the right pathway to complexity for Go? I \nthink you and\n&gt; I agree that th=\r\ne hard part is knowing what cookie crumb trail to \nleave the\n&gt; populations.=\r\n..but I don&#39;t know that IEC is better than co-\nevolution or\n&gt; (well-done) T=\r\nBE at rewarding good intermediate steps. Maybe a good \nGo\n&gt; teacher could d=\r\no a good job because it knows the correct path to\n&gt; complexity...but that i=\r\ns simply because they have learned how to \nteach\n&gt; (reward) Go players...so=\r\n using them seems to be cheating a bit. \nIronically,\n&gt; it is because they k=\r\nnow the long term goal, and how to get there, \nthat they\n&gt; can help players=\r\n take longer routes through many valleys to higher \npeaks\n&gt; instead of rush=\r\ning up the closest peak. So, here, it seems like \nlong-term\n&gt; targets might=\r\n actually be one of the reasons IEC is better! Except \nin humans\n&gt; it is a =\r\nknowledge of long term goals *plus* a decent idea of the \npath to get\n&gt; the=\r\nre. For example, if an engineer was able to interactively \nevolve Karl\n&gt; Si=\r\nms creature it could, with the right representations, make \nsomething like\n=\r\n&gt; a ferrari....but the whole point of evolutionary computation to \nfigure o=\r\nut\n&gt; how nature did it without long-term goals. No? As such, it seems \nless=\r\n\n&gt; natural to me. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for why things complexified on Earth and they do=\r\nn&#39;t in EC...my \nleading\n&gt; theory (theories?) is that the Earth is just more=\r\n massive (which \nleads to\n&gt; more parallel processing), spatially structured=\r\n (which allows more\n&gt; diversity), co-evolving, has been running for a long =\r\ntime (if you \nchop off\n&gt; the last 20% of the run you don&#39;t get most higher-=\r\norder life), and\n&gt; fine-grained (which increases the possibilities). Much o=\r\nf that \ndoes not\n&gt; exist in EC yet. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The key to natural =\r\nevolution was that there were a lot of easy \nways\n&gt; &gt; to do well in the beg=\r\ninning.  So we got a diversity of viable \njumping\n&gt; &gt; off points.  That is =\r\nalso true on Picbreeder:  You can easily \nget a\n&gt; &gt; picture that&#39;s good eno=\r\nugh to be worth showing others.  So it&#39;s \ngot a\n&gt; &gt; very natural property: =\r\nIt proliferates jumping-off points too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you like, you can think=\r\n of Picbreeder as an ecology where the\n&gt; &gt; environment is just the preferen=\r\nces of its myriad users.  The\n&gt; &gt; environment in nature is just Earth and p=\r\nhysics.  These are quite\n&gt; &gt; different environments, but their effect on th=\r\ne dynamics of \nselection\n&gt; &gt; form an analogy.  So at that level, it doesn&#39;t=\r\n matter if a human \nis\n&gt; &gt; in the loop or not.  What humans like is just th=\r\ne environment.  \nAnd\n&gt; &gt; the nice things is, humans are very sensitive to r=\r\negularity and\n&gt; &gt; organization at all levels: exactly what a good environme=\r\nnt \nshould\n&gt; &gt; reward if we want to build up.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know where P=\r\nicbreeder will go because part of it depends \non\n&gt; &gt; how many users we get =\r\nand how much they persevere.  So it may \nnever\n&gt; &gt; produce great works of a=\r\nrt; I&#39;d be surprised if it did.  Yet it \nhas\n&gt; &gt; these intriguing ingredien=\r\nts that we have not had before, so it \nis a\n&gt; &gt; much more significant exper=\r\niment than just a bunch of people \nplaying\n&gt; &gt; with an art toy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ho=\r\npefully this endless message answers the question with some \nextra\n&gt; &gt; food=\r\n for thought to boot.

You can be sure that I am not trying to\n&gt; &gt; present these ideas=\r\n as settled facts by any means.\n&gt; \n&gt; I enjoy the conversation. Thanks for s=\r\ntarting it. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dere=\r\nk James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ken wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course the r=\r\neason it was possible is because humans are \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evaluation=\r\n- which yields another lesson: The fitness function \nin\n&gt; &gt; most\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; evol=\r\nutionary computation is a liability against getting to \nhigh-\n&gt; &gt; level\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; complexity. There are deep reasons that human evaluation is\n&gt; &gt; actually=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more analogous to what happened over natural evolution than any\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nother\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type of evaluation scheme we run on computers. We are often \nmi=\r\nsled\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; into believing that interactive evolution is less &quot;natural&quot; \ntha=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; normal EC. Actually, the opposite is true.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Like Jeff, I&#39;=\r\nd be interested in hearing you expand your \nthoughts on\n&gt; &gt; this.  I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhink the demonstration is no less impressive, but it seems to \nme\n&gt; &gt; that =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; distinction between natural and artificial selection is an \nimport=\r\nant\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conceptual one.  Natural selection is based on the attributes \nof =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment, while artificial selection is the result of \nattribut=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; selected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by an agent (akin to animal breeding or horticulture).=\r\n  In \nfact, in\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Origin of Species, Darwin used many many exampl=\r\nes of rapid\n&gt; &gt; evolutionary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; change in domesticated species such as pi=\r\ngeons and dogs to \nbolster\n&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; argument for his theory.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Maybe you&#39;re taking issue with the terms &quot;natural&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;artificial&quot;, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe there are better ways to make the distinction (&quot;agent-\n&gt; &gt; di=\r\nrected&quot; vs.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;environment-directed&quot;, &quot;conscious&quot; vs. &quot;unconscious&quot; \nevo=\r\nlution...I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; know).  But while I don&#39;t think artificial select=\r\nion is any less\n&gt; &gt; effective\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or powerful, probably moreso in some cas=\r\nes, I think it&#39;s useful \nto\n&gt; &gt; maintain\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that distinction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n--Derek\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
