I am most intereste=\r\nd in \noptimizing the sigmoid for now. I have implemented many of the other =\r\n\ngreat optimizations mentioned. I saw the other sigmoid approximations \nand=\r\n some of them were quite fast but this speed was offset by poor \nlearning c=\r\nharacteristics of the resulting programs. \n\nI ran my code with the standard=\r\n sigmoid for a given number of \ngenerations and kept track of the random se=\r\ned, the final fitness and \nthe run time. I replaced the standard sigmoid wi=\r\nth an approximated \nsigmoid. Then I evolved a net using the same seed and m=\r\neasured how \nlong it took to arrive at the same fitness as the net with the=\r\n \nstandard sigmoid ( although when the approximated sigmoids when run \nin i=\r\nsolation they were much faster than the standard sigmoid). When \ntrying to =\r\nevolve a net with the same level of fitness in a given \namount of time they=\r\n actually negatively impacted performance! I think \nthis is a more accurate=\r\n way to measure real performance of the \napplication. I think it doesn&#39;t re=\r\nally matter how fast the parts of \nthe program run but how fast the program=\r\n completes the task it was \ncreated for.\n\nBecause of the problems I saw wit=\r\nh the other approximations I decided \nto try and create my own sigmoid appr=\r\noximation with good learning \ncharacteristics and a fast runtime. To do thi=\r\ns I created an \napproximation that closely follows the curve of the origina=\r\nl sigmoid \nand that is relatively smooth and continuous. I think the reason=\r\n why \nthe other sigmoid approximations has such poor learning \ncharacterist=\r\nics is because they were either to simple, or not smooth. \nI think if they =\r\nare too simple you can&#39;t combine them in very may \nways to arrive at a good=\r\n approximation of a given function. This is \nwhy a straight line or a stepp=\r\ned function generally makes a poor \nactivation function. If they aren&#39;t con=\r\ntinuous small changes in the \nweights can cause big jumps or erratic jumps.=\r\n Which can make it hard \nto converge on an optimal solution.\n\nI have only r=\r\nun my sigmoid approx on the problems I am interested in \nso my high regard =\r\nfor it is probably unfounded and naive. But it \ndefinitely seems to improve=\r\n the rate of learning for the problems I \nam interested in right now.\n\nMy n=\r\next major optimization project is going to be implementing a \nGPGPU ANN imp=\r\nlementation. I am hopefully hiring a chap in a few days \nto work on this pr=\r\noject. It will be exciting to see if I can get the \nsame performance gains =\r\n(30 fold) from the GPGPU as others have in the \npapers I have read. Anyone =\r\nhave any experience with this?\n\nWow I wrote way to much.
