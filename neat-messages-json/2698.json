I like the approach taken in the book &#39;Blondie24&#39; \n- give the neural net just the basic info and allow it to combine it as \nit sees fit. The net may come up with an amazing new indicator within \nit&#39;s weights that no-one has thought of before. I think it&#39;s better to \nput as little human knowledge in there as possible and allow it to \ndiscover things for itself.\nI&#39;ve been working on my own little project for ages now - I keep \nstopping and restarting and redoing things so my progress has been terrible!\nAgain, using Blondie24 as my inspiration, I&#39;m intending to give the last \n&#39;N&#39; days (N to be determined - but after looking at at Sidhant&#39;s paper, \nI might borrow the concept of adding input nodes so that neat would come \nup with an optimal value of N for itself) of open, high, low, close & \nvolume as input to the net, and getting the output to be -1 to +1 to \nrepresent a strong sell signal through to a strong buy signal.\nAssuming that I can get a net that can give good buy / sell signals \nbased on what the normalised stock graph I show it as input looks like, \nI&#39;ll then run it against every stock in the FTSE All-Share say each \nnight then look at the top 10 stocks ranked by net output to see if I \nfancy buying any of them.\nI have perl programs to site-scrape all the historic data off \nfinance.yahoo.com. I&#39;m in the middle of donwloading it all - which \naccording to my estimates will take about a month of constant \ndownloading to get the whole lot!.\nAll I need now is to get off my arse and finish the thing!!\nPart of the delay is that I&#39;m trying to write my own implementation of \nneat in C++ which borrows heavily from SharpNEAT, but keep getting side \ntracked.\nI&#39;m cutting out all the recurrent stuff - I don&#39;t need it for my \npurposes. Consequently the Neural Net&#39;s are Directed Acyclic Graphs, and \nusing that fact enables me to make some good optimisations over a more \ngeneral neat that includes recurrency.\nYes - I should be using an &#39;off-the-shelf&#39; version of neat and just \ngetting on with things, but half the fun is writing my own version ;-)\n\nCheers,\nEmyr\n\nMatt Simmerson wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Sidhant\n&gt;\n&gt; Great paper. I have been trying to do much the same thing, except\n&gt; rather than value prediction, I have been creating a trader that\n&gt; essentially decides to go short, long or take the 5th ;). I&#39;ve had\n&gt; mixed success, and not had the confidence to actually lay any money\n&gt; out yet. It would be interesting to know what input data sets have\n&gt; you been using for the Forex part of your paper, as I have tried all\n&gt; sorts of things including technical indicators etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; Matt\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Sidhant \n&gt; Dash &lt;sidhantdash@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As part of an undergraduate research project, I did implement\n&gt; something on those lines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I worked on a NEAT based approach to predicting a noisy financial\n&gt; time series (Yen-USD exchange rate). The original NEAT algorithm was\n&gt; modified to start with an initial population of 3 different neural\n&gt; network architectures, which included Elman networks and MLPs apart\n&gt; from the normal recurrent networks that NEAT begins with. The networks\n&gt; (winners) produced by NEAT were then put through a conjugate gradient\n&gt; based optimization process, and finally the optimized networks were\n&gt; combined using an ensembling technique to produce the final results.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I personally think the local optimization is necessary when we are\n&gt; using NEAT to produce networks to accomplish tasks that require a high\n&gt; degree of precision. It kind of fine tunes the performance of the\n&gt; networks. Ensembling then is one of the standard tools in the ML\n&gt; repertoire to produce results that none of NEAT&#39;s &#39;winner&#39; networks\n&gt; could individually produce.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A detailed project report is posted in the Files section.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; Sidhant\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; aklein07 &lt;a.klein@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ken&#39;s papers mention (at least I think that they do) that (dynamic)\n&gt; &gt; annealing of mutation rates might be advantageous in order to confine\n&gt; &gt; global searching after a while to a promising region in search space.\n&gt; &gt; Having read some papers, I also found indications that a hybrid\n&gt; &gt; weight training algorithm (global search by means of genetic\n&gt; &gt; algorithms and local search using some gradient descent algorithm)\n&gt; &gt; might be able to produce better results than genetic algorithm search\n&gt; &gt; alone. The reason is, that each type of algorithm performs well\n&gt; &gt; mostly only in its specific field. Has anyone further insights into\n&gt; &gt; this topic ? Has anyone tried to implement any of the approaches\n&gt; &gt; mentioned ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also time delay network connections might provide improvements for\n&gt; &gt; some model estimation tasks. Has anyone tested / implemented yet any\n&gt; &gt; of these ideas ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for any comments,\n&gt; &gt; Achim\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fear is only as deep as the mind allows.\n&gt; &gt; --Japanese proverb\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My blog\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Groups are talking.
