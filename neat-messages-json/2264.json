Does\n&gt; it mean you are do=\r\ning dynamic thresholding in the style of my NEAT\n&gt; system, or does it mean =\r\nyou literally stop speciation from\n&gt; progressing after some number already =\r\nexist?  (I guess Derek or you\n&gt; may be able to answer this question) My dyn=\r\namic thresholding is\n&gt; constantly moving towards a target number by moving =\r\nthe\n&gt; compatibility threshold, which doesn&#39;t seem like a &quot;clamp&quot; exactly,\n&gt;=\r\n so I think clamping may be a third option.\n\nOkay, not sure &quot;clamped&quot; is a =\r\ngood word either, or that I even\nunderstood exactly what Ken&#39;s code was doi=\r\nng.\n\nI remember early on when we were working on our implementation, and\nwe=\r\nre specifically working on some of the visualization tools, I saw\nthe speci=\r\nation graphic in Ken&#39;s 2002 paper, and it looked like for a\npopulation of 1=\r\n50 there were something like 8 species.  We hadn&#39;t\nreally tuned our compabi=\r\nlity threshold so we were getting way more\nspecies than this.\n\nI thought th=\r\nat in an email exchange Ken said that he set a maximum\nnumber of species (t=\r\nhis is what I was referring to as &quot;clamping&quot; the\nnumber of species).  It so=\r\nunds though, in this discussion, that it\nactually works by restricting the =\r\nmaximum number of members each\nspecies can have, which would in practice wo=\r\nuld very much the same way\nI would guess.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting that you brough=\r\nt this up.  We&#39;re going to be looking\na lot more closely at our population =\r\ndynamics in the coming months. \nWe&#39;ve had discussions on this list about ki=\r\nlling off stagnating\nspecies in order to add more dynamism to the search al=\r\ngorithm.  That\nis something else we currently haven&#39;t implemented.  So we&#39;d=\r\n like to\ntake a closer look at what&#39;s going there, but yeah, these issues a=\r\nre\nstill pretty hazy.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
