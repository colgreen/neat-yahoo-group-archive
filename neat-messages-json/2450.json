I will be ever so  grateful or any  suggestions would be\n&gt; highly appreciated.\n\nHi Ramen,\n\nIf you haven&#39;t already, I&#39;d suggest reading Ken&#39;s paper &quot;Evolving a\nRoving Eye for Go&quot;\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:gecco04\n\nas well as our paper &quot;Evolving a Neural Network Active Vision System\nfor Shape Discrimination&quot;.  The first describes Ken&#39;s approach to\napplying a roving eye paradigm to small-board Go and scaling up to\nslightly larger boards.  The second describes how our version of the\nroving (or &quot;floating&quot;) eye is implemented, at a fairly high level of\ndescription.\n\nThen you might want to poke around the code.  Here are the ANJI\njavadocs:\n\nhttp://anji.sourceforge.net/javadoc/index.html\n\nAll the stuff that handles the eye is in the com.anji.floatingeye\npackage.  Logic for playing ANNs against each other or against\nhand-coded algorithms is in com.anji.tournament, and logic specific to\nTic-Tac-Toe is in com.anji.ttt.\n\nWe implemented the floating eye for scanning any 2D surface, but have\nnot yet applied it specifically to board games, although I&#39;m going to\ntry to implement this for 9x9 Go next semester for my first-year\nproject, so please let me know how you&#39;re progressing.  Carrying on\nthe discussion through the list is probably a good idea, so that\nothers who might be working on similar issues can chime in or simply\nreference the thread.\n\nDerek\n\n\n\n \nYahoo!
