In nature, not all parts of a chromosome exhibit equal \n&gt;mutation rates. \n&gt;\nSee my reply to Yuri!\n\n&gt;\tNode creation would then be, I guess, a probability on each connection, \n&gt;maybe (waves hands vaguely)...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think we&#39;re all getting carried away a bit here. As Derek points out, \nthe parameters probably don&#39;t effect a search that much anyway so \nco-evolving parameters will probbaly cause them to drift all over the \nshop, whilst having the same effect as the far simpler system we started \nout with! Probably the best we can hope for is to discover some &#39;ball \npark&#39; numbers for each of a given set of problem domains - so we can \njust pick a set that is best suited to a given problem domain each time \nwe want to do a search.\n\nPerhaps there is a case to be made for varying the NEAT parameters as a \nsearch progresses, as the search shifts from wide ranging exploration of \nthe search space over to refinement, but full fledged co-evolution of \nneat parameters seems like overkill.\n\nAgain, sorry for being a naysayer :(\n\n&gt;\tAs an aside, this also gives us another angle on modularity, since a \n&gt;useful module should have a net mutability which has dropped quite low, and \n&gt;one might also want to allow a quite different value for the probability of \n&gt;intra-module connection formation vs. inter-module connection formation...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh fair point. Or you could just have two sets of params, one for \nnormal connections and one for connections that are part of a module \ninstance.\n\n&gt;(*) I think it is &quot;Evolution Strategy&quot; (ES).  I checked here \n&gt;http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.de.uu.net/EC/clife/www/top.htm), but \n&gt;it&#39;s too heavy for me to (re)comprehend in a short time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHmm, that&#39;s the 2nd time Hitchikers guide as come up this evening. It&#39;s \na shame the EC FAQ  hasn&#39;t been updated for 4 years huh.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
