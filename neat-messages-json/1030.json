(Of course, you might want to put the caveat that\nit doesn&#39;t work *exactly* like NEAT.) ;)\n\nWe look forward to anyone who uses the implementation and might wish\nto contribute to helping improve future versions.  At the very least,\nwe wouldn&#39;t mind using you guys as guinea pigs to just download it and\ngive it a spin, then offer any feedback.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
