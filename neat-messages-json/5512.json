Let me try to respond below...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: Kenneth Stanley [mailto:kstanley@...]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, Apr=\r\nil 02, 2011 2:57 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: &#39;Kenneth Stanley&#39;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: todelete2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First off, I&#39;ll say that what I take as the central point, t=\r\nhat EAs can\n&gt; &gt; miss\n&gt; &gt; critical intermediate objectives because they are =\r\nawkwardly placed on the\n&gt; &gt; fitness landscape, is a good one. However, I ha=\r\nve some concerns about the\n&gt; &gt; experimental design in this paper:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (=\r\n1) You appear to be manipulating two variables at once. (a) whether the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n EA\n&gt; &gt; has an objective and (b) whether there is a human in the loop. Sure=\r\nly you\n&gt; &gt; have to pick only one at a time and control for everything else,=\r\n right?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s only a problem if you believe that somehow a human wou=\r\nld do better at\n&gt; evolving to these objectives, which of course humans woul=\r\nd not. Good luck to\n&gt; anyone who wants to re-evolve the skull from scratch =\r\nagain. It will never\n&gt; happen. Nor will anyone evolve any reasonably comple=\r\nx *preconceived* picture\n&gt; from scratch no matter where it came from, wheth=\r\ner once evolved in the past\n&gt; or not.\n&gt;\n\n\nOk, interesting.  I think I have =\r\nmisjudged the scope of the experiment.  I\nassumed you were trying to *prove=\r\n* something significant about the fact that\nGAs can&#39;t evolve the solutions =\r\nproduced in picbreeder.  This was the basis\nfor my primary objection (3).  =\r\nBut you admit that the IGA won&#39;t evolve those\nspecific images either, with =\r\nor without an objective.  Instead, you&#39;re just\ntrying to persuade the reade=\r\nr of a suspicion based on just how bad the\nperformance is.  So really this =\r\npaper would fall more under the category of\n&quot;evidence-based musings&quot;, is th=\r\nat fair?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand if you want to see non-objective search w=\r\nithout a human\n&gt; in the loop, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing with novelty sea=\r\nrch, so there is\n&gt; plenty of literature on that combination at this point. =\r\nYou can find a lot\n&gt; here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/noveltysearch/usersp=\r\nage/\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me suggest to you or anyone who remains a skeptic (which is=\r\n perfectly\n&gt; reasonable) to check out my talk on the topic (recorded in vid=\r\neo), which\n&gt; lays out the ideas much more broadly. It&#39;s only 70 minutes and=\r\n I think you\n&gt; will find it worth the time to see how I try to defend this\n=\r\n&gt; counter-intuitive position, if nothing else to stimulate some thinking ev=\r\nen\n&gt; if you still feel skeptical:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Se=\r\narching-Without-Objectives\n&gt;\n\n\nI haven&#39;t seen your talk on novelty search, =\r\nI&#39;ll take a look at this.\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) Furthermore, if it&#39;s IGA v. GA and &#39;=\r\ninterestingness&#39; is the\n&gt; evaluation\n&gt; &gt; criteria, that ain&#39;t a fair fight.=\r\n Why should I believe there is more to\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; than that?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; But in=\r\nterestingness wasn&#39;t the evaluation criteria. This paper played by\n&gt; the tr=\r\naditional ground rules to whose defense you are now jumping. The\n&gt; objectiv=\r\ne was definitively the skull (or the butterfly, or the eye..), not\n&gt; &quot;inter=\r\nestingness.&quot; The fact that the results come out so abysmally and leave\n&gt; yo=\r\nu wanting to argue about interestingness just shows how unreasonable\n&gt; pedd=\r\nling these objectives as meaningful benchmarks can be. That&#39;s the whole\n&gt; p=\r\noint - the paper is a play on the traditional algorithmic evaluation scheme=\r\n\n&gt; that leaves the reader squirming, as it should.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, if you real=\r\nly think that IGA vs. GA isn&#39;t a &quot;fair fight&quot; when we\n&gt; are aiming for inte=\r\nrestingness, then you are in part in agreement (though\n&gt; inadvertently) wit=\r\nh the spirit of our message. That is, if you are really\n&gt; convinced that IG=\r\nA is so far superior to GAs at doing something interesting\n&gt; that it isn&#39;t =\r\neven fair to contrast them, then unless we are somehow\n&gt; intentionally tryi=\r\nng to avoid evolving anything interesting, what are we\n&gt; doing wasting our =\r\ntime with objective GAs? Does it not highlight a central\n&gt; paradox in our p=\r\nosition that we might actually care more about being &quot;fair&quot;\n&gt; than being &quot;i=\r\nnteresting?&quot; Why are we even running these algorithms?\n&gt;\n\n\nThere&#39;s a differ=\r\nence between objectively and subjectively interesting.  The\nformer includes=\r\n the conventional optimization domains (e.g. travelling\nsalesmen) and the l=\r\natter include things like evolutionary art and music.  Is\nthis branch of yo=\r\nur research only concerned with the latter type of problem\n(at least curren=\r\ntly)?\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) How do we know that intermediate objectives are in any=\r\n way\n&gt; significant\n&gt; &gt; to discovering interesting pictures in Picbreeder? I=\r\n have a sneaking\n&gt; &gt; suspicion that totally random search, followed by focu=\r\nsed objective based\n&gt; &gt; search when something &#39;pops&#39; might be just as effec=\r\ntive, and that the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;intermediate objectives&#39;, while certainly necessary=\r\n to find a particular\n&gt; &gt; image, are not very helpful in general to finding=\r\n interesting images. If\n&gt; &gt; so, this is no chink in the armor of objective =\r\nbased search. I suppose\n&gt; &gt; without intermediate objectives there can be no=\r\n exaptation, but does that\n&gt; &gt; matter? What percentage of evolved features =\r\nin biological organisms have\n&gt; &gt; any exaptation at all in their history?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When you say the random search followed by objective-based search wou=\r\nld be\n&gt; &quot;just as effective,&quot; I don&#39;t really understand: just as effective a=\r\nt what?\n&gt; At doing something &quot;interesting?&quot; At achieving a specific objecti=\r\nve? Surely\n&gt; you don&#39;t believe that random search will produce images as in=\r\nteresting as\n&gt; Picbreeder? The stepping stones (i.e. intermediate objective=\r\ns) in Picbreeder\n&gt; are in effect fundamental discoveries of important regul=\r\narities that are\n&gt; later elaborated. For example, this simple face-like ste=\r\npping stone leads to\n&gt; a whole family of subsequent faces:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://picbr=\r\needer.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D542\n&gt;\n&gt; Here you can get a family-tre=\r\ne expansion from that individual:\n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/familytree=\r\n.php?sid=3D542\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are willing to skip bridges like that because the=\r\ny are intermediate,\n&gt; you would never find any of the treasures on the othe=\r\nr side of the bridge.\n&gt; If you look back in the lineages of almost any inte=\r\nresting image on the site\n&gt; you will find a similar story wherein fundament=\r\nal regularities that were\n&gt; later exploited were first discovered in a diff=\r\nerent context.\n&gt;\n\n\nThis point seems to beg for some controls for bias.  Wou=\r\nld we not expect\nusers to choose interesting pictures to start from most of=\r\nten?  And then\nshouldn&#39;t we be unsurprised when most of the new interesting=\r\n images have\nthese in their lineages?  And shouldn&#39;t we be least surprised =\r\nof all that\nthey share fundamental regularities with these ancestors?\n\nComp=\r\nlicating this even further is the fact that small genotypic changes in\npicb=\r\nreeder genomes create significant divergence in phenotype (correct me if\nI&#39;=\r\nm wrong).  So a varied set of interesting pictures can readily proliferate\n=\r\na short evolutionary distance away from a single ancestor, which exaggerate=\r\ns\nthe representation of interesting pictures of the type you describe.\n\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Just compare figure 6 and figure 7 in the paper to see how horrible it=\r\n is\n&gt; to start from a random place and then lock in on an objective (figure=\r\n 7). It\n&gt; takes 29,000 generations to do the same thing it took 12 to do be=\r\ntter.\n&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) Finally - and this is the big one - one of the deadly si=\r\nns of Science\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; claiming a result as the objective a posteriori, a=\r\n point which eludes\n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; some very famous scientists. It&#39;s what allow=\r\ns publications like this,\n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &#39;prove&#39; psychic phenomena by mining=\r\n data for &#39;statistically significant&#39;\n&gt; &gt; results. The problem is, a result=\r\n isn&#39;t significant unless you were\n&gt; &gt; specifically attempting to confirm i=\r\nt when the experiment was designed\n&gt; &gt; (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; always follow up explorato=\r\nry experiment with a confirmatory experiment!).\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; heartily endorse =\r\nexploring for/marvelling at results you weren&#39;t\n&gt; initially\n&gt; &gt; looking for=\r\n, but one should never use such results as the basis for any\n&gt; &gt; sort\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nf comparison. In the case of the eye experiment, who cares if the GA\n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nuldn&#39;t evolve the eye? The IGA can&#39;t either, and the fact that it\n&gt; &gt; alrea=\r\ndy\n&gt; &gt; did is immaterial! I could be persuaded that the IGA is better at\n&gt; =\r\nevolving\n&gt; &gt; interesting images, but I do not believe it&#39;s any better at ev=\r\nolving the\n&gt; &gt; &#39;eye&#39; (or &#39;dolphin&#39;, or &#39;apple&#39;). In fact, I would bet that&#39;=\r\ns it&#39;s worse\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt; evolving those specific images, intermediate object=\r\nives notwithstanding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Should we really believe your statement? : &quot;I=\r\n heartily endorse exploring\n&gt; for/marvelling at results you weren&#39;t initial=\r\nly looking for, but one should\n&gt; never use such results as the basis for an=\r\ny sort of comparison.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is not our entire infatuation with evolution, th=\r\ne very reason we choose to\n&gt; explore it as an algorithm, for the very reaso=\r\nn that you say we should never\n&gt; use such comparisons? After all, natural e=\r\nvolution is just such a gallery of\n&gt; &quot;results you weren&#39;t initially looking=\r\n for&quot; yet it is the core inspiration\n&gt; for all our hopes and dreams for the=\r\n field and the example against which\n&gt; many of us compare our algorithms. T=\r\nhus I strongly disagree with the\n&gt; principle you want to impose that marvel=\r\ns attained without explicit a priori\n&gt; intent are outside of the realm of s=\r\ncientific interest.\n&gt;\n\n\nNo, not out of the realm of scientific interest!  J=\r\nust out of the realm of\nnaive scientific experimentation (unless, as I susp=\r\nect is the case here, you\nare reporting the results because they are *inter=\r\nesting*, not because they\nprove anything).  Note that I am not using &#39;naive=\r\n&#39; perjoratively, just\npointing out that this problem that you&#39;ve decided to=\r\n tackle will require\nexceedingly clever experimental design if you want to =\r\nprove something.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; On the contrary, in fact the point of the paper is t=\r\nhat our mistake is\n&gt; precisely that we have been misled by such a restricti=\r\nve and dogmatic\n&gt; doctrine. It is time that we did begin to contemplate the=\r\n marvel of what is\n&gt; discovered a posteriori. Asking why such amazing disco=\r\nveries as human beings\n&gt; happens in nature is nothing like entertaining psy=\r\nchic phenomena.\n&gt;\n\n\nJust as an aside, I was not suggesting that it was.  Th=\r\ne fact that the paper\nI cited was about &#39;psi&#39; was incidental, it was just t=\r\nhe most\nfresh-in-my-mind example of a mistake I thought you were making.\n\n\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Imagine if we had left out the part about Picbreeder and simply run so=\r\nme\n&gt; experiments to see if NEAT can evolve a set of pictures. After it fail=\r\ned\n&gt; miserably every time, following the traditional interpretation, we wou=\r\nld\n&gt; conclude that NEAT cannot evolve such pictures, or even pictures *like=\r\n*\n&gt; them. The fact that Picbreeder did evolve many such pictures is thus\n&gt; =\r\nrelevant and scientifically interesting; it shows why the traditional\n&gt; imp=\r\nlications we draw from such &quot;failures&quot; are far too expansive.\n&gt;\n&gt; You say t=\r\nhat you could be persuaded that the IGA is better at evolving\n&gt; interesting=\r\n images yet then you say that you don&#39;t think it is better at\n&gt; evolving th=\r\ne eye. Yet the whole point is that it is better at evolving\n&gt; interesting i=\r\nmages. Beware of missing the forest for the trees: It is not\n&gt; important wh=\r\nether the IGA is good at evolving the eye (or dolphin, or\n&gt; apple); it is i=\r\nmportant that it is good at evolving images *like* those.\n&gt; There is no oth=\r\ner algorithm on Earth that can do that. That is, there is no\n&gt; other approa=\r\nch that we know of that could get NEAT to actually encode images\n&gt; *like* c=\r\nars and butterflies in a CPPN. That fact should be startling to us,\n&gt; not d=\r\nismissed as a mere curiosity.\n&gt;\n\n\n\nOk, I mostly agree with this, but I must=\r\n reiterate my discomfort with the\nfact that the experiment does not disenta=\r\nngle the &quot;interactive&quot; and\n&quot;objective-driven&quot; variables.  Without doing so,=\r\n how are we to know what is\nreally doing the heavy lifting of creating thes=\r\ne interesting pictures?\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, though I have a lot of doubts a=\r\nbout this particular paper, I\n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; appreciate these sorts of resear=\r\nch directions. Keep up the good work!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure, I understand.

Why should I believe there is more to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nhan that?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nBut interestingness wasn&#39;t the evalu=\r\nation criteria.  This paper played by the traditional ground rules to whose=\r\n defense you are now jumping.  The objective was definitively the skull (or=\r\n the butterfly, or the eye..), not &quot;interestingness.&quot;  The fact t=\r\nhat the results come out so abysmally and leave you wanting to argue about =\r\ninterestingness just shows how unreasonable peddling these objectives as me=\r\naningful benchmarks can be.  That&#39;s the whole point - the paper is a pl=\r\nay on the traditional algorithmic evaluation scheme that leaves the reader =\r\nsquirming, as it should.  &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn fact, if you really think that IG=\r\nA vs. GA isn&#39;t a &quot;fair fight&quot; when we are aiming for interest=\r\ningness, then you are in part in agreement (though inadvertently) with the =\r\nspirit of our message.  That is, if you are really convinced that IGA is so=\r\n far superior to GAs at doing something interesting that it isn&#39;t even =\r\nfair to contrast them, then unless we are somehow intentionally trying to a=\r\nvoid evolving anything interesting, what are we doing wasting our time with=\r\n objective GAs?  Does it not highlight a central paradox in our position th=\r\nat we might actually care more about being &quot;fair&quot; than being &quo=\r\nt;interesting?&quot;  Why are we even running these algorithms?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There&#39;s =\r\na difference between objectively and subjectively interesting. =A0The forme=\r\nr includes the conventional optimization domains (e.g. travelling salesmen)=\r\n and the latter include things like evolutionary art and music. =A0Is this =\r\nbranch of your research only concerned with the latter type of problem (at =\r\nleast currently)?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D=\r\n&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding=\r\n-left:1ex&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#fff&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; (3) How do we know that intermediate objectives are in any way sign=\r\nificant&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to discovering interesting pictures in Picbreeder?  I have=\r\n a sneaking&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; suspicion that totally random search, followed by focu=\r\nsed objective based&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; search when something &#39;pops&#39; might be =\r\njust as effective, and that the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &#39;intermediate objectives&#39;,=\r\n while certainly necessary to find a particular&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; image, are not ver=\r\ny helpful in general to finding interesting images.  If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so, this i=\r\ns no chink in the armor of objective based search.  I suppose&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with=\r\nout intermediate objectives there can be no exaptation, but does that&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; matter?  What percentage of evolved features in biological organisms ha=\r\nve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; any exaptation at all in their history?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\nWhen you say the random search followed by objective-based search would b=\r\ne &quot;just as effective,&quot; I don&#39;t really understand: just as eff=\r\nective at what?  At doing something &quot;interesting?&quot;  At achieving =\r\na specific objective?  Surely you don&#39;t believe that random search will=\r\n produce images as interesting as Picbreeder?  The stepping stones (i.e. in=\r\ntermediate objectives) in Picbreeder are in effect fundamental discoveries =\r\nof important regularities that are later elaborated.  For example, this sim=\r\nple face-like stepping stone leads to a whole family of subsequent faces:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D542=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D542&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHere you can get a family-tree expansion from that individual: =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://picbreeder.org/search/familytree.php?sid=3D542&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://picbreeder.org/search/familytree.php?sid=3D542&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you are willing to skip bridges like that because they are interme=\r\ndiate, you would never find any of the treasures on the other side of the b=\r\nridge.  If you look back in the lineages of almost any interesting image on=\r\n the site you will find a similar story wherein fundamental regularities th=\r\nat were later exploited were first discovered in a different context. &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This =\r\npoint seems to beg for some controls for bias. =A0Would we not expect users=\r\n to choose interesting pictures to start from most often? =A0And then shoul=\r\ndn&#39;t we be unsurprised when most of the new interesting images have the=\r\nse in their lineages? =A0And shouldn&#39;t we be least surprised of all tha=\r\nt they share fundamental regularities with these ancestors?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Complicating this even further is the fact that small genotypi=\r\nc changes in picbreeder genomes create significant divergence in phenotype =\r\n(correct me if I&#39;m wrong). =A0So a varied set of interesting pictures c=\r\nan readily proliferate a short evolutionary distance away from a single anc=\r\nestor, which exaggerates the representation of interesting pictures of the =\r\ntype you describe.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padd=\r\ning-left:1ex&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#fff&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nJust compare figure 6 and figure 7 in the paper to see how horrible it is=\r\n to start from a random place and then lock in on an objective (figure 7). =\r\n It takes 29,000 generations to do the same thing it took 12 to do better.&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;background-color:#fff&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (4) Fina=\r\nlly - and this is the big one - one of the deadly sins of Science&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; claiming a result as the objective a posteriori, a point which =\r\neludes even&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; some very famous scientists.

I could be persuaded tha=\r\nt the IGA is better at evolving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; interesting images, but I do not b=\r\nelieve it&#39;s any better at evolving the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &#39;eye&#39; (or &#39;=\r\ndolphin&#39;, or &#39;apple&#39;).

The fact that Picbreeder did evolve many such pictures is th=\r\nus relevant and scientifically interesting; it shows why the traditional im=\r\nplications we draw from such &quot;failures&quot; are far too expansive.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou say that you could be persuaded that the IGA is better at evo=\r\nlving interesting images yet then you say that you don&#39;t think it is be=\r\ntter at evolving the eye.

Beware of missing the forest for the trees:  It i=\r\ns not important whether the IGA is good at evolving the eye (or dolphin, or=\r\n apple); it is important that it is good at evolving images *like* those.  =\r\nThere is no other algorithm on Earth that can do that.  That is, there is n=\r\no other approach that we know of that could get NEAT to actually encode ima=\r\nges *like* cars and butterflies in a CPPN.
