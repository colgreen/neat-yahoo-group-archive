The inputs are various technical\nindi=\r\ncators, but I like the output to indicate five states--Buy/Sell\n(going long=\r\n), Short/Cover (going short), and do nothing.  Ideally,\neach signal would b=\r\ne a 1 or 0 (all zeros indicates to do nothing (i.e.\nkeep current position -=\r\n long, short, or out).\n\n1. Is this best framed as a classification problem =\r\n(now is a good time\nto buy, sell, short, cover), or would some type of 0-1 =\r\nanalog output\nbe best (meaning buy when buy is &gt; sell by 0.2 or something)?=\r\n  How do\nyou force a binary output in the software anyway?\n\n2. Should I try=\r\n to predict the percentage change (up or down) over the\nnext n time periods=\r\n, and then only buy or sell when there is say a 3%\nchange from now?\n\n3. whe=\r\nn recurrence evolves in NEAT, does it look back only 1 time\nperiod, or can =\r\nit evolve longer lookbacks?\n\n--Thanks, Todd\n\n\n\n"}}
