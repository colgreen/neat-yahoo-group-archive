You noted:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This program violates a few of the NEAT advantages;\n&gt;  * It doesn&#39;t use species (there&#39;d be not point)\n&gt;  * It doesn&#39;t start minimally (that would be dull)\n&gt; \n\nI have a feeling starting minimally could still be made pretty \ncool.  The reason is that if you have some kind of vague shape or \ndesign in mind, you could kind of use the principle of \ncomplexification to get there.  In other words, you&#39;d first start \nout with really simple base shapes and then as NEAT adds neurons \nprogressively elaborate on them.  You could even let the user decide \nexactly when or how often to complexify.  You might even put a \nlittle number next to each picture representing network complexity.  \nThat way, a user can consciously protect innovation by giving a \nchance to more complex artists even if their pictures are initially \na bit off from the simpler ones.  I think a program that lets you \nexplore from the simple to the complex on your own could be made \nquite compelling.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
