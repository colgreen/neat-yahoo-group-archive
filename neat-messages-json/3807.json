Note that the meaning of \nthings like=\r\n &quot;gene duplication&quot; or &quot;whole genome duplication&quot; is \ndifferent for CPPNs b=\r\necause the genome in CPPNs is a network.  The \ngenome in DNA or something l=\r\nike AGE is implicitly a network as well, \nbut because it is not explicitly =\r\nencoded as a network, copying a \ngene actually has an indirect effect on th=\r\ne implicit network \nstructure.  In other words, duplicating a gene in a lin=\r\near genome is \nsimilar to adding a new node to a CPPN that connects two nod=\r\nes that \nwere already connected, even though that new node is not really \na=\r\n &quot;duplicate&quot; in the usual sense.  In any case, therefore there \nisn&#39;t much =\r\ndifference in the operator effects.\n\nI think AGE is doing better than GP an=\r\nd NEAT for a number of \nreasons.  One big reason should be that it still ha=\r\ns the advantage \nof being an indirect encoding, even if it could be improve=\r\nd.  An \nindirect encoding should do better than NEAT in tasks that require =\r\n\ndiscovering nontrivial patterns.\n\nYet probably in reality it has to do mos=\r\ntly with the test domains.  \nPole balancing is starting to become a meaning=\r\nless benchmark.  The \npaper where they compare NEAT to AGE in pole balancin=\r\ng shows a \nperformance level for AGE that is actually lower than the NEAT \n=\r\nperformance that I reported in my dissertation.  However, they \nreported an=\r\n older result for NEAT from 2002.  \n\nHere is their paper making this compar=\r\nison:\n\nhttp://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/87949/files/DuerrMattiussiFloreano=\r\n2\n006_PPSNIX_NeuroAGE.pdf\n\nThe point is not that NEAT is therefore better a=\r\nfter all.  I think \nthe real point is that pole balancing is a bad benchmar=\r\nk because now \nthat it is understood, it is easy to rig a method to be exce=\r\nllent at \nit.  In particular, NEAT showed that it can be solved with zero \n=\r\nhidden nodes!  So you barely need any structure at all to solve it.  \nSo if=\r\n you in effect reduce the probability of creating structure \n(through any m=\r\neans), you give yourelf a large advantage.  At that \npoint, small factors l=\r\nike weight mutation strength start to make a \ndifference.  Yet such minutia=\r\n are not the point of such experiments, \nwhich shows that they are starting=\r\n to lose their import.  In a way, \nI think NEAT kind of broke the utility o=\r\nf the pole balancing \nbenchmark by showing that pole balancing requires alm=\r\nost no \nstructure to solve.\n\nMore problematic for an indirect encoding like=\r\n AGE is that it makes \nno sense to test it on pole balancing.  Pole balanci=\r\nng networks have \nno regularity whatsoever and virtually no structure.  So =\r\nwhat could \nsuch a benchmark show us to be useful about an indirect encodin=\r\ng?  \nIf anything, one might argue an indirect encoding should be worse on \n=\r\nsuch problems because indirect encodings should ideally be biased to \nsearc=\r\nhing for large-scale patterns.  Anyway, it&#39;s hard to know what \nto conclude=\r\n from a benchmark test on a task like that when the goal \nis to test the po=\r\nwer of indirect encoding. \n\nIt would be more intereting to see AGE tested o=\r\nn problems that \nrequire large networks such as those in our HyperNEAT pape=\r\nrs.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; H=\r\nello-\n&gt; \n&gt; I just read the AGE paper, thanks for posting it JT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, I=\r\n think you raise excellent issues in your analysis of their \nwork. I\n&gt; agre=\r\ne that they do not do a good job of motivating their choice of \nthe\n&gt; funct=\r\nion used in their interaction map (the local alignment of \nsequences).\n&gt; Pa=\r\nrtly because of that, I am inclined to think it unlikely that \nthey\n&gt; stumb=\r\nled onto a good one by accident. However, we do know that (at \nleast in\n&gt; t=\r\nheir 4 example problems) AGE seems to do well in comparison to GP \nand NEAT=\r\n.\n&gt; Why is it that it does well?\n&gt; \n&gt; As you emphasize more in your first r=\r\neply in this thread, it seems \nthat the\n&gt; reason AGE does well is because i=\r\nt can take advantage of powerful \ngenetic\n&gt; operators such as genome and ge=\r\nne duplication. I get the gist from \ntheir\n&gt; paper that they think this is =\r\nthe main advantage of AGE as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be really interesting to s=\r\nee them experiment with AGE by\n&gt; systematically turning off some of these g=\r\nenetic operators and see \nhow\n&gt; performance is affected. Has anyone here re=\r\nad the two other AGE \nworks they\n&gt; cite (reference numbers 35 and 37 in the=\r\n paper)? They might \nperform such\n&gt; experiments there. \n&gt; \n&gt; As far as comp=\r\naring AGE to HyperNEAT, if it is the case that the \ngenetic\n&gt; operators are=\r\n what is driving AGE&#39;s success, how do you feel \nHyperNEAT\n&gt; allows (or sub=\r\nstitutes) for such operators? I can think of \nHyperNEAT analogs\n&gt; to things=\r\n like gene duplication, but I would be interested in \nhearing your\n&gt; take o=\r\nn it. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan St=\r\nate University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; 517.214.1060\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Kenneth=\r\n Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2008 23:40:19 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [neat] Re: Hi Ken. How do you fe=\r\nel about Analog Genetic \nEncoding\n&gt; &gt; (AGE)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, you make a good =\r\npoint.  If you strip down the whole idea of\n&gt; &gt; an &quot;interaction map,&quot; all y=\r\nou really have left is a function that\n&gt; &gt; takes two nodes as input and out=\r\nputs the parameters of the\n&gt; &gt; associated connection between them.  In AGE,=\r\n that function is \nbased\n&gt; &gt; on a matching scheme.  So the deeper question =\r\nis, towards what \nkinds\n&gt; &gt; of patterns are matching schemes biased? It&#39;s a=\r\nll about bias when\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re talking about indirect encoding.  I do not se=\r\ne any \nargument\n&gt; &gt; that there is a beneficial bias for a matching scheme. =\r\n The only\n&gt; &gt; thing the authors really say to recommend the matching scheme=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; that it allows a continuum of values.  Yet so do many other \ntypes =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; functions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So yes, the crux of the issue is that any method=\r\n for assigning\n&gt; &gt; values to compoments of a structure should ideally be ba=\r\nsed on \nsome\n&gt; &gt; kind of principle that addresses how (i.e. in what kinds o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; patterns) we would like those values to relate to the underlying\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nstructure.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that the AGE papers seem to imply that AGE could \n=\r\ntheoretically\n&gt; &gt; use methods other than matching schemes in the interactio=\r\nn map.  \nBut\n&gt; &gt; then, what other methods?  It seems the most viable altern=\r\native\n&gt; &gt; assignment method is just to collapse into HyperNEAT.  So the \nre=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; core focus should be the matching scheme itself, i.e. not the \ngene\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; alphabet and methods of recombination that AGE focuses on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Y=\r\nes Ken. That&#39;s also what my question was referring, what \nadvantage\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do=\r\nes it have. I can see AGE producing complex patterns via a\n&gt; &gt; intricate\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; interaction map (or matching scheme, are they just different \nterms\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same mechanism?)

It seems to me HyperNeat take one more abstraction =\r\naway \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; made it more focus on the end result with is patterns of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n organization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Or maybe I am just not understanding the essence of GRN=\r\n and AGE?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanl=\r\ney@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (This is my first post.)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I recently came =\r\nupon some literatures on Analog Genetic\n&gt; &gt; Encoding\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; developed by Ma=\r\nttiussi and Floreano. It&#39;s interesting but\n&gt; &gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not revolut=\r\nionary.

In particular, it broa=\r\ndens our perspective on how such\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; abstractions can work and from which=\r\n aspects of development \nthey\n&gt; &gt; can \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; draw.  The abstraction seems f=\r\nairly high-level, i.e. it\n&gt; &gt; abstracts \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; away such details as chemica=\r\nl diffusion and growth from an\n&gt; &gt; embryo.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In that way, it has some=\r\n similarities to HyperNEAT.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The main question it brings to my =\r\nmind is what exactly\n&gt; &gt; recommends \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; this particular abstraction over=\r\n any other.  Although the\n&gt; &gt; authors \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; note that it allows a large va=\r\nriety of genetic operations, \naside\n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that, it is unclear wha=\r\nt the main principle is that supports \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; approach, i.e. why we shou=\r\nld prefer it to any other indirect\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Of course=\r\n, as a proponent of CPPNs and HyperNEAT, I think that\n&gt; &gt; one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import=\r\nant ingredient for a developmental encoding is the \nability\n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; c=\r\nreate patterns as a function of the domain geometry (as in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; substr=\r\nate in HyperNEAT).  AGE does not have such a capability.\n&gt; &gt; Its \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; int=\r\neractions are detached from the geometry of the ultimate\n&gt; &gt; network \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n it encodes, which suggests to me that it may fare worse in\n&gt; &gt; domains \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with a geometric basis, especially those with high\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; resolution/gra=\r\nnularity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I also wonder why connection-centric parameters (suc=\r\nh as\n&gt; &gt; weights) \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; should be derived through a matching scheme like s=\r\nequence\n&gt; &gt; alignment \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (which is one way AGE sets up its &quot;device inte=\r\nraction map.&quot;)\n&gt; &gt; This \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; idea seems to be taken from biology simply f=\r\nor the sake of \ndoing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; something similarly to biology.  Yet such match=\r\ning schemes are\n&gt; &gt; ad hoc \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; because they do not relate to anything ex=\r\ntrinsic to the genome.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT relates its connection weights to th=\r\ne outside world \nby\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; computing them as a function of the locations of =\r\nnodes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As for comparisons with NEAT, I do believe that indirec=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; encodings, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; including AGE, should generally be superior to dire=\r\nct encodings\n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tasks that involve moderate-sized patterns.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
