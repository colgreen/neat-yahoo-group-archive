I&#39;ve been working on a research project recently that is\nexactly along the lines you mention.  I think that the implications of\nstarting absolutely minimally are even greater than you say.  In addition to\navoiding possibly unnecessary connections, starting minimally can eliminate\nentire inputs that might be superfluous.  In some domains with very rich\nfeature sets, pruning out the irrelevant ones is critical to success (i.e.\nthe feature selection problem).  But even if you already know you have the\noptimal feature set, starting with a population of networks with no\nconnections can still yield an improvement for the same reason that NEAT can\ndo better than fixed-topology neuro-evolution: because it concentrates the\nearly part of the search in lower dimensional spaces.  You mention in your\nmessage that starting w/o connections could slow things down but in many\ncases it may speed things up because it reduces the dimensionality of search\nin early generations.\n\nKen and I have written a paper that describes our preliminary results in\nthis area and are submitting it to a workshop at GECCO.  Drop me a line if\nyou want me to e-mail you a copy.\n\n-Shimon\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Philip Tucker&quot; &lt;tucker0171@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 15, 2004 8:13 PM\nSubject: [neat] minimal topologies\n\n\n&gt; In the original version of NEAT, the default initial topology is to\n&gt; have 0 hidden nodes and the input and output layers fully\n&gt; connected.  In doing some runs with XOR with subtractive mutations,\n&gt; we found that our smallest solutions do not require a connection\n&gt; from the bias input node.  This led me to wonder what would happen\n&gt; if I were to start with a more minimal arhitecture.  I did some runs\n&gt; starting with 0 connections, and was still able to solve it in about\n&gt; the same number of generations.\n&gt;\n&gt; So a few question:\n&gt; - has anyone else tinkered with alternate starting architectures?\n&gt; - is there any reason to start with ANY hidden neurons or\n&gt; connections?\n&gt; - Ken, in your experiments, do you have the bias input fully\n&gt; connected along with the other inputs?\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s possible that, with more complex domains, starting with such a\n&gt; small architecture would yield significantly slower results as the\n&gt; members of the population take longer to start up.  We&#39;ve read other\n&gt; experiments where the starting architecture is a sparse randomly\n&gt; connected matrix.  But that would still allow for the possibility of\n&gt; starting with a connection that you never need, and never being able\n&gt; to get rid of it.  Starting with fewer connections might take\n&gt; longer, but gives you a better shot at a minimal solution.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
