There is a precision trade off to consider, however, since you will need to guess the depth of what a good network may look\n&gt; like. I&#39;m sure Colin could speak more to this design decision as well as your other questions.\n\nHi, FTYI the latest version (2.1) allows for evolving of acyclic\nnetworks. So I basically do a little more work when performing\nmutations in order to avoid cyclic nets. Then at activation time there\nis an acyclic network class that propagates input signals through the\nnet layer by layer - so it&#39;s more efficient than the old approach of\nguessing the appropriate depth and activating the net that number of\ntimes.\n\nIn fact there is a class that performs depth analysis on both cyclic\nand acyclic nets, it was originally written for the acyclic nets only\nbut as I was writing it I realised that it only required a small tweak\nto make it work for cylic nets. This then got used to improve the\nlayout of nodes in the network visualization window - but I didn&#39;t\nupdate the cyclic network /activation/ to use it, but that&#39;s also a\npossibility now I think of it.\n\nHope that helps a bit.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
