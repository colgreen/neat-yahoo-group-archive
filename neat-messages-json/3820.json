You can provid=\r\ne a \nbias (distance between nodes) to encourage relationships between \nnode=\r\ns close to each other in space. \nWhat do you mean by &quot;gravitating&quot;? Nodes w=\r\nill change position over \ntime? It is not really necessary. Just position t=\r\nhe nodes in such a \ngeometric way that is meaningful to you and the problem=\r\n at hand, then \nleave all the learning to HyperNEAT. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;christofer_fransson&quot; \n&lt;christofer_fransson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Dear all,\n&gt; \n&gt; The human brain has different areas that solve different ki=\r\nnd of\n&gt; problems. My question is if you think it is a good idea to try\n&gt; en=\r\ncouraging a network to divide a problem into smaller sub problems\n&gt; and the=\r\nn solve it.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is my thought:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Let say that every neuron has 3=\r\n coordinates (x,y,z) \n&gt; - Assuming that you can tell which neurons were per=\r\nforming well in \none\n&gt; epoch \n&gt; (Backprop run, network weights that didn&#39;t =\r\nhave to be changed much \netc)\n&gt; - All those nodes should &quot;gravitate&quot; toward=\r\ns each other\n&gt; - Nodes close to each other have a higher probability to for=\r\nm a\n&gt; connection.\n&gt; \n&gt; The result should be a network that in someway tries=\r\n to be modular.\n&gt; Next step should be to see if it is possible to do indivi=\r\ndual \ntraining\n&gt; of different areas of the network.\n&gt; \n&gt; I mean when you le=\r\narn math and when you are painting, different \nareas\n&gt; of the brain is acti=\r\nve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Comments?\n&gt; \n&gt; Br,\n&gt; Christofer\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
