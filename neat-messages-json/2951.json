I&#39;m not using neat yet as I haven&#39;t had time to parallelise it yet.\n\nAt the moment I&#39;m not doing any explicit opponent modeling but letting the networks pass some values on to the next hand.\n\nI represent the hand simply by giving a probability value vs random opponent as input to the net (one continuous and one binned into discrete binary input nodes). I can do this very quickly since I&#39;ve got a large (350MB) lookup table in memory and don&#39;t have to do any on-the-fly hand evaluation.\n\nBasically I&#39;ve just finished the framework (which also allows for non-NN table based strategies, etc) and have evolved the first solutions which definitely look promising.\n\nThe general idea is that I evolve a network that plays a near optimal game without opponent information and then evolve a second network that modifies the probabilities of the first network&#39;s outputs based on the opponent history. I think modularising is the way to go and not having one monster network doing everything.\n\nI&#39;ll keep you posted on how things go as I&#39;m only starting the big evolutionary runs today and tomorrow.\n\nThomas\n\n-------- Original-Nachricht --------\nDatum: Thu, 15 Feb 2007 20:29:15 -0500\nVon: &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;feedyurhed@...&gt;\nAn: neat@yahoogroups.com\nCC: \nBetreff: Re: [neat] Re: Questions about NEAT for poker\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Sorry Jeff, my 4am emails don&#39;t really get the point across very well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  When I say having a simulation engine, I am talking about one that\n&gt; &gt;  provides everything needed to an agent.  Things like statistics are\n&gt; &gt;  part of the engine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Whether it&#39;s &quot;too much information&quot; for the nets to learn, I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;  know...that&#39;s what experiments are for. :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I see...well, it&#39;s hard to say insofar as I don&#39;t know what that\n&gt; information is right now.  That is to say, I&#39;m still up in the air in\n&gt; my own mind as to what we would need to supply.  But by all means post\n&gt; the code somewhere and let&#39;s take a look.\n&gt; \n&gt; jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; ...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\n&gt; interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\n&gt; in, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\n&gt; well, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\n&gt; idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\n&gt; gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\n&gt; hanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\n&gt; because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\n&gt; in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\n&gt; think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n&gt; \n&gt; -- Douglas Adams\n\n-- \n&quot;Feel free&quot; - 10 GB Mailbox, 100 FreeSMS/Monat ...\nJetzt GMX TopMail testen: www.gmx.net/de/go/mailfooter/topmail-out\n\n"}}
