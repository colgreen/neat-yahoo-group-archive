(Of course, I may be\nwrong.)\n\nAnimals in nature are called upon to do that all the\ntime.  For example, when a small mammal migrates to a\nnew territory, he needs to leave his nest, explore for\nfood while remembering his route.  Then, to return\nhome, he recalls the route in reverse.\n\nHumans do it when they remember a new telephone number\nfor a short time.  Like when you say to someone:\nPlease dial 380-6637.  The person then dials the\nnumber, perhaps never having heard it before.  Clearly\nhe had to memorize it and then recall it, even if it\nis forgotten a few minutes later.\n\nI think this is a worthwhile challenge for recurrent ANNs.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
