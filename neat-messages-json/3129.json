From all I&#39;ve seen, they perform \nabout the same.  But=\r\n the caveat is that the only task I really ever \nused the in-order method o=\r\nn was pole balancing, which can be solved \nby a shallow network.  So it&#39;s s=\r\ntill possible that it would be worse \nin highly recurrent tasks with deep n=\r\networks, since less activation \ntravels over the recurrent connections per =\r\npass through the \nnetwork.  That would be my main concern.\n\nOn the other ha=\r\nnd, in strictly feed-forward tasks there should be no \ndifference at all.\n\n=\r\nBy the way, I think the way I do activation in NEAT is &quot;standard&quot; \nfor arbi=\r\ntrary-topology neural networks (like large meshes in \ncortical simulations)=\r\n.  In such systems order is often pretty \nambiguous.  So that is another an=\r\ngle you could use to decide which \nway to go- is there a real benefit to di=\r\nverging from a kind of \nstandard that people expect?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 12, 2007, at 7:=\r\n22 AM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To add on to Jason&#39;s point about netwo=\r\nrk activation,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, I replied independently to Jason be=\r\nfore seeing your reply.  \nI  \n&gt; understand your preference.
