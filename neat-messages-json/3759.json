If so, approximately how long would it\n&gt;  take before we can expect any learned behavior?\n\nThis is kind of a broad set of questions that apply to learning\nanything, with any learning algorithm. It&#39;s understandable if the\ninputs are never *exactly* the same. We never have the same exact\nimage processed by our retina, because of changes in lighting, POV,\netc. But the inputs should be sufficiently *similar* to learn the\nproper associations.\n\nIf there are no discernible patterns or regularity in the input then\nthe input is basically noise, and of course your system won&#39;t learn\nanything because there&#39;s nothing to learn.\n\nWhat are you trying to teach the networks, exactly?\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
