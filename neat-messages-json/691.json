I am not against making sensors\n&gt; plausible, but at\n&gt; least the point should made that it&#39;s not really\n&gt; important what&#39;s\n&gt; plausible if your main goal is for it to work. \n&gt; While that point is\n&gt; somewhat obvious, the more subtle point is that a\n&gt; lot of the time two\n&gt; different types of sensor are really just coordiante\n&gt; transformations\n&gt; of each other (e.g. polar vs. cartesian\n&gt; coordinates).  In other words,\n&gt; they are essentially the same thing represented in\n&gt; different ways. \n&gt; And because of that, the real question is not what&#39;s\n&gt; &quot;actually&quot; going\n&gt; on, but rather what is the most convenient\n&gt; representation from the\n&gt; perspective of an NN.  And that&#39;s a bit of a\n&gt; different question than\n&gt; &quot;what senses do humans use&quot; (although that is\n&gt; certainly a good source\n&gt; for inspiration).  But we need to be careful about\n&gt; jumping at complex\n&gt; or convoluted representations that are really just\n&gt; transformations of\n&gt; some simple concept.  \n\nDefinitely.\n\n&gt; For example, if all that really matters is how high\n&gt; your head is off\n&gt; the ground, then *that* is what should be fed to the\n&gt; NN, rather than a\n&gt; complex of angles and vestibular information which\n&gt; ultimately boils\n&gt; down the same piece of information.  I&#39;m not\n&gt; claiming that this\n&gt; example is true (i.e. that we don&#39;t need the extra\n&gt; stuff), but just\n&gt; making the point that it&#39;s the simplest most\n&gt; straightforward\n&gt; representation of the key concept that needs to be\n&gt; conveyed to the\n&gt; network, and sometimes it is not necessary to use\n&gt; exactly the same\n&gt; representation scheme as biology.\n\nI agree.  Thanks for putting that so clearly.  I am\ndefinitely more interested in &quot;making it work&quot; than\nsticking to a biological realistic model at this\npoint.\n\nHere&#39;s the reason why I&#39;m interested in making virtual\nhumans work like real humans (eventually):\n\nWhen I look at how AI is used in things like video\ngames, there are all kinds of hacks being used simply\nbecause they help get the job done (hacks being\ndefined as exploiting things in the simulated world\nthat couldn&#39;t be used in the real world).  Down the\nroad, once computers are REALLY fast, it would be nice\nto have AI-controlled simulated humans that can behave\njust like real humans (including natural language\nprocessing, body control, etc.).  \n\nI think a good way to get this kind of behavior is to\ngive the simulated humans bodies and control systems\nthat are similar to ours.  (I don&#39;t know what will be\nthe best way to handle speech.  Maybe a gigantic\n(human brain-sized) artificial neural net be used for\nthat, too?)  Anyway, my point is that in the future,\nwith more computing power, we might not have to use as\nmany hacks to make AI seem real if we can model\nsimulated humans after biological ones.\n\nI guess that&#39;s kind of my inspiration for this\nproject.\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
