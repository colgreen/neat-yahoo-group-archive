I w=\r\nonder what \n&gt; sort of performance impact these changes might have.\n&gt; \n&gt; I w=\r\nanted to clarify your last remark about novelty search. The \n&gt; algorithm yo=\r\nu suggest does have certain surface similarities to \n&gt; novelty search. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The idea of avoiding previously explored areas of search space is not \n&gt; =\r\nnew, and is known as tabu search. The combination of this with \n&gt; speciatio=\r\nn may allow for more efficient search by avoiding previously \n&gt; explored ar=\r\neas of search space while promoting genotypic diversity. As \n&gt; I understand=\r\n it, this is what you were suggesting. Feel free to \n&gt; correct me if I have=\r\n misrepresented your idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Novelty search also uses a tabu-search like=\r\n approach to bias search, \n&gt; although it operates in behavior space (phenot=\r\nype, behavior within a \n&gt; domain) as opposed to search space (genotype). Th=\r\nis in itself is not \n&gt; original, as there exists previous work that used be=\r\nhavior-based \n&gt; speciation with NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main contribution of novelty=\r\n search is to demonstrate that in \n&gt; deceptive domains searching only for n=\r\novel behaviors (i.e. completely \n&gt; ignoring any measure of fitness) can be =\r\nmore effective than a method \n&gt; that uses a measure of fitness to bias sear=\r\nch. This is a surprising \n&gt; result because nearly all practical search meth=\r\nods rely on measuring \n&gt; progress towards a goal. While in deceptive domain=\r\ns fitness may be led \n&gt; into cul-de-sacs in search space (local optima), no=\r\nvelty search cannot \n&gt; be deceived in the same way since it is not looking =\r\nfor anything other \n&gt; than different ways to behave.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do agree that t=\r\nhe archive in novelty search may be similar in \n&gt; philosophy to your idea o=\r\nf a FIFO list of dead species that guide \n&gt; search away from explored areas=\r\n of search space. That is, both methods \n&gt; keep a historical record of prev=\r\nious individuals and use that record \n&gt; to encourage search to progress in =\r\nalternate directions.  However, I \n&gt; would say that the archive is not the =\r\ndefining feature of novelty \n&gt; search. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, I think your ideas fo=\r\nr further exploration into speciation \n&gt; are promising, and would be intere=\r\nsted in seeing their effect on hard \n&gt; problems. I am looking forward to se=\r\neing version 2 of sharpneat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=\r\nolin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here are some thoughts on specia=\r\ntion that probably don&#39;t warrant a\n&gt; &gt; deep discussion but I post them for =\r\nthe record.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Currently sharpneat takes a casual approach to speciat=\r\nion and I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; wondering if there are improvements to be had. This ties in=\r\n with my\n&gt; &gt; recent post about genome compatibilty metrics and \n&gt; euclidean=\r\n/manhattan\n&gt; &gt; distance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In sharpneat v2 I&#39;m trying to make the co=\r\nde base more abstract and\n&gt; &gt; re-usable, e.g. I&#39;m separating the NeatGenome=\r\n and EvolutionAlgorithm\n&gt; &gt; classes from being dependent on each other and =\r\nalso using generics \n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; that we can plug in new genomes or algorithms=\r\n with minimum effort.\n&gt; &gt; Thus my previous discussion resulted in my creati=\r\nng an\n&gt; &gt; ICompatibilityMetric&lt;TGenome&gt; interface which can be plugged in t=\r\no \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; NeatEvolutionAlgorithm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Looking at speciation again I=\r\n see that at the outset I simply assign\n&gt; &gt; genomes to species if they are =\r\nwithin some distance and if not then \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; place the new genome in its o=\r\nwn species. Independent of this I also\n&gt; &gt; adjust the compatibility thresho=\r\nld once per generation in an attempt\n&gt; &gt; to keep the species count between =\r\nsome limits (which has its own\n&gt; &gt; problems and is another email in the mak=\r\ning). A possible problem \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; this approach is that the first attemp=\r\nt at speciation will probably\n&gt; &gt; just assign the first N genomes in the po=\r\npulation as being the first\n&gt; &gt; genome in each species - these genomes then=\r\n become [temporary]\n&gt; &gt; exemplars for the species, that is, the remaining g=\r\nenomes are \n&gt; compared\n&gt; &gt; against them and if they are close enough to an =\r\nexemplar they are\n&gt; &gt; assigned to that species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As an alternative =\r\napproach I was thinking of taking the discussion\n&gt; &gt; about compatibility (o=\r\nr distance) metrics a step further and \n&gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; explicitly represent=\r\ning where genomes are in the encoding space with\n&gt; &gt; something like an IEnc=\r\nodingSpace interface, the idea being that I \n&gt; take\n&gt; &gt; the total number of=\r\n unique connection IDs in the whole population as\n&gt; &gt; being the number of s=\r\npacial dimensions, I then define the location \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; each genome in each=\r\n dimension as being the connection weight for \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; ID (using 0 if a =\r\ngenome doesn&#39;t have a connection for agiven ID). \n&gt; From\n&gt; &gt; here I can fin=\r\nd the range/limits of locations (weights) in each\n&gt; &gt; dimension, which effe=\r\nctively defines an enclosing hypercube that the\n&gt; &gt; current population is i=\r\nnside. I can now divide up the hypercube into\n&gt; &gt; equally sized sub-cubes i=\r\nn order to find clusters of genomes that \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; close together and use =\r\nthis as the basis of my initial set of \n&gt; species.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In addition to =\r\nall that I suspect it makes sense to keep the \n&gt; exemplar\n&gt; &gt; for each spec=\r\nies consistent throughout the life of the species - so \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; genome (rep=\r\nresenting a point in space) we keep to one side, that may\n&gt; &gt; have been rem=\r\noved from the population long ago. This keeps each\n&gt; &gt; species &#39;anchored&#39; i=\r\nn space and prevents it from drifting. We then\n&gt; &gt; have the choice of keepi=\r\nng a FIFO buffer of dead species as an\n&gt; &gt; indicator of parts of the search=\r\n space that have recently been\n&gt; &gt; searched - avoiding these spaces when cr=\r\neating new genomes. This is \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; idea I raised a few years ago and whi=\r\nch I think is known as novelty\n&gt; &gt; search.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
