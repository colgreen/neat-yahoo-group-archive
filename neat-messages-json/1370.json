Are all these\n&gt;images from the same domain?  e.g. are you training the network to fill in\n&gt;detail which can reasonably be expected to be in same way &quot;consistent&quot; from\n&gt;image to image.  If you are not, and the images are drawn from anywhere,\n&gt;then the task is impossible because one can readily construct a set of\n&gt;images which all average to the same reduced data and the net won&#39;t succeed\n&gt;at them all.  Note that a &quot;domain&quot; could be as wide as &quot;photos&quot;, however...\n\nYes and no.  The &#39;domain&#39; is &#39;natural&#39; photos.  While it is technically true \nthat there are nearly an infinite number of enlargements that could result \nin the smaller input image, statistically the majority of those will be \neffectively random noise that just happens to produce it.  The &#39;enlargement&#39; \nimages that can and do appear in nature are a very small subset of the total \npossible set of output images.  And there will be a high degree of \ncorrelation in those images.    By minimizing the error only within that \nsubset, the network would tend to output highly plausable enlargements, \nwhich is the most you could ask of it.\n\nCan a neural network be trained to do enlargements?  Yes.  I have several \npapers printed out and sitting on my desk where it has been done.  One of \nthem does such a good job that in my opinion it is better than anything \nPhotoShop could produce.  Which is why I started this project...  But I \ndon&#39;t want to throw more topology at it than is necessary, which is why I am \nusing NEAT.  Of course, it&#39;s also proven a highly educational experience, \nand given me ideas for other neat (pun intended) stuff to do when I get \ndone. :)\n\n\n\n"}}
