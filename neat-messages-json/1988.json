A comment on slashdot pointed out that this \ntype of research isn&#39;t new per se, that the main point to register is \nthe computer IBM are/will be building to run the simulations and that \nthe overblown reporting mainly exists to push IBM&#39;s share price up.\n\n&gt;There&#39;s a popular folk-lore that neocortical columns have somehting to do \n&gt;with general intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt;There are about a million of them in the human brain, all roughly repeats \n&gt;of the same &quot;module&quot;...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMaybe something to mull over for the folks considering a developmental \ngenome encoding. I wonder if there is anything particularly useful to be \ngained from arranging neurons in columns as opposed to some other \nshape/arrangment? I suppose it gives some basic level of organisation to \nwork up from, in that respect maybe the use of columns is an \nevolutionary accident - which is to say that perhaps some ancestor of \nours &#39;evolved&#39; columns, and they worked as well as any other arrangement \nand therefore evolution hasn&#39;t &#39;bothered&#39; to explore other arrangments - \na local maxima of sorts. maybe.\n\n&gt;However, they are being (written up as) very ambitious and might crash and \n&gt;burn.  e.g in an experiment like this, OK you can copy the topology but \n&gt;then you need to choose a model neurone behaviour.  If the whole does not \n&gt;behave, you cannot extrapolate back to what the error in the neurone \n&gt;equations was...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think they have been experimenting with biological neurons in the lab. \nI would guess that initially they&#39;ll be tweaking the parameters and \nobserving what behaviour results. Nothing more. I wonder what a single \ncolumn can achieve? I suppose very roughly you could extrapolate up from \nANN experiments, or down from mouse brains. Most insects I think have \nsomething in the range of 50k neurons, but their arrangement and use is \nlikely to be very different from a typical 50k column in a mammalian \nbrain. Which makes me wonder how much of an insect&#39;s brain circuitry is \nencoded in DNA, since they are mainly(entirely?) creatures operating on \ninstinct.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
