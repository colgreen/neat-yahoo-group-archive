It is based on the work\nthat I did (and am doing) for the thesis for my MSc. A.I., on the topic of\nHyperNEAT.\n\nThis paper presents a series of experiments designed to examine the\ncritical factors for its success. First, we determine the fewest hidden\nnodes a genotypic network needs to solve several of these tasks. Our\nresults show that all of these tasks are easy: they can be solved with at\nmost one hidden node and require generating only trivial regular patterns.\nThen, we examine how HyperNEAT performs when the tasks are made harder. Our\nresults show that HyperNEAT&#39;s performance decays quickly: it fails to solve\nall variants of these tasks that require more complex solutions. Next, we\nexamine the hypothesis that fracture in the problem space, known to be\nchallenging for regular NEAT, is even more so for HyperNEAT. Our results\nsuggest that quite complex networks are needed to cope with even modest\nfracture and HyperNEAT has difficulty discovering them. Finally, we connect\nthese results to previous experiments showing that HyperNEAT&#39;s performance\ndecreases on irregular tasks. Our results suggest irregularity is an\nextreme form of fracture and that HyperNEAT&#39;s limitations are thus more\nsevere than those experiments suggested.\n\nFind it here:\nhttp://staff.science.uva.nl/~whiteson/pubs/b2hd-vandenberggecco13.html\n\nRegards,\n\nThomas van den Berg\n\r\n--047d7bdca5cab8e20404dc0ed1bb\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div style&gt;Dear Colleagues,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n style&gt;The paper &quot;Critical Factors in the Performance of HyperNEAT&quo=\r\nt;, written by Shimon Whiteson and me, was accepted for GECCO2013.
