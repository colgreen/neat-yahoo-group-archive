Don&#39;t be discouraged\n&gt; if it&#39;s a bit of a\n&gt; learning curve starting up.

We&#39;ve learned a\nlot in the meantime, but it&#39;s taken quite a bit of\neffort, even though we built it on top of an existing\nopensource neural network engine and an opensource GA\nframework.\n\nWe had to ask quite a few questions along the way...as\nKen said, hopefully this list will make it easier for\npeople who are undertaking their own implementations.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
