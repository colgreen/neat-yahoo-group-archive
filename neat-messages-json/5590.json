It does sound like you\n&gt;&gt; have a workable idea for integrating novel=\r\nty search into competitive\n&gt;&gt; coevolution. Of course, I&#39;d be particularly c=\r\nareful on the way behavior is\n&gt;&gt; measured because it is the key to identify=\r\ning novelty. One tip is to make\n&gt;&gt; sure you don&#39;t only include raw outputs =\r\nor raw inputs as part of the\n&gt;&gt; behavior characterization, because what mat=\r\nters most is what an agent\n&gt;&gt; actually does, as opposed to what it wants to=\r\n do. For example, if an agent\n&gt;&gt; spend 100 timesteps trying to run through =\r\na wall, we would want to\n&gt;&gt; characterize its behavior as being stalled rath=\r\ner than as moving forward.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, one of the big challenges in com=\r\npetitive coevolution (and alife in\n&gt;&gt; general) is to create a domain that i=\r\ns open-ended enough to support\n&gt;&gt; something interesting arising. The robot =\r\nduel was my attempt to do that, but\n&gt;&gt; perhaps it could be enhanced to supp=\r\nort more open-endedness, though I don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; know how off-hand. But the risk =\r\nyou always have in these domains is that\n&gt;&gt; even if you have a fantastic al=\r\ngorithmic setup that in principle could\n&gt;&gt; discover amazing behaviors, it i=\r\ns always possible that the domain itself\n&gt;&gt; only supports a limited range o=\r\nf strategies. For example, it is hard to\n&gt;&gt; imagine strategies in the robot=\r\n duel that go very far beyond the one shown\n&gt;&gt; here:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.c=\r\ns.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In any=\r\n case, overall I think your idea can make a good experiment.

I&#39;m thinking in particular about the robot\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nduel from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; your paper &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary C=\r\nomplexi=EF=AC\n&gt;&gt; cation&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of categorizing the parasite behav=\r\nior, I was thinking break\n&gt;&gt; out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meaningful classifications of senso=\r\nr inputs. Classification of\n&gt;&gt; behavior of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the host would based on i=\r\nt&#39;s movement vector and speed (moving away,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; towards, fast/slow, goin=\r\ng after food, etc). Of course, this is a\n&gt;&gt; dynamic\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So for each time the classification of inputs changes, the behav=\r\nior of\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; host is classified and checked for novelty. These indi=\r\nvidual novelty\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measurements are all added up at the end of the run, =\r\nand divided by\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; number of class of input changes to normalize =\r\nthings.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as maki=\r\nng it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, of course a record\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; who w=\r\non is essentially a fitness measure, so there&#39;d have to be a\n&gt;&gt; hybrid\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; novelty/fitness in there somewhere, because measuring who won is not a\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty measure.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a =\r\nlot of benefits to the table. My\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is =\r\nan added parameter for population\n&gt;&gt; growth\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; allowance for the host g=\r\nroup. Instead of a fitness function, a novelty\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; metric is used (assum=\r\ning one can be made, obviously that&#39;s tricky).\n&gt;&gt; The host\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; populatio=\r\nn remains the hosts until their population has grown the\n&gt;&gt; specified\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; amount. I&#39;m hoping that will encourage a nice broad range of\n&gt;&gt; strategie=\r\ns to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be evaluated. Once that max population % has been hit, a &quot;catac=\r\nlysmic\n&gt;&gt; event&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; occurs (cataclysm-neat? rapture-neat? Harold Campin=\r\ng-neat?) to wipe\n&gt;&gt; out the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extra population, and only the best perf=\r\norming hosts are kept, which\n&gt;&gt; would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; be how it integrates into the =\r\ncompetition side of things. .\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Then the parasites and hosts fl=\r\nip. Essentially novelty is used to\n&gt;&gt; explore\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; differing behaviors up=\r\n until the cataclysmic event, then performance\n&gt;&gt; is used\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to prune t=\r\nhe population back down, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNot sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but if I\n&gt;&gt; can=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gonna give it a\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; whirl.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Gotta write up something interesting to graduate I suppose=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -D=\r\nrew\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I just wanted t=\r\no echo that I think combining novelty search\n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interaction b=\r\netween evolving agents is very interesting, if only we\n&gt;&gt; can find\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n a way to characterize behavior generally enough to overcome the\n&gt;&gt; inheren=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noisiness of interaction.

It does sound like yo=\r\nu have a workable idea for integrating novelty search into competitive coev=\r\nolution.  Of course, I&#39;d be particularly careful on the way behavior is=\r\n measured because it is the key to identifying novelty.  One tip is to make=\r\n sure you don&#39;t only include raw outputs or raw inputs as part of the b=\r\nehavior characterization, because what matters most is what an agent actual=\r\nly does, as opposed to what it wants to do.  For example, if an agent spend=\r\n 100 timesteps trying to run through a wall, we would want to characterize =\r\nits behavior as being stalled rather than as moving forward.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Also, one of the big challenges in competitive coevolution (and ali=\r\nfe in general) is to create a domain that is open-ended enough to support s=\r\nomething interesting arising.  The robot duel was my attempt to do that, bu=\r\nt perhaps it could be enhanced to support more open-endedness, though I don=\r\n&#39;t know how off-hand.  But the risk you always have in these domains is=\r\n that even if you have a fantastic algorithmic setup that in principle coul=\r\nd discover amazing behaviors, it is always possible that the domain itself =\r\nonly supports a limited range of strategies.  For example, it is hard to im=\r\nagine strategies in the robot duel that go very far beyond the one shown he=\r\nre: &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pag=\r\nes/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.cs.utexas.e=\r\ndu/users/nn/pages/research/robotmovies/clip8.gif&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nn any case, overall I think your idea can make a good experiment.

Classification of behavior of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the host would based on=\r\n it&#39;s movement vector and speed (moving away,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; towards, fa=\r\nst/slow, going after food, etc). Of course, this is a dynamic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n environment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So for each time the classificat=\r\nion of inputs changes, the behavior of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; host is classified=\r\n and checked for novelty. These individual novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; measuremen=\r\nts are all added up at the end of the run, and divided by the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n number of class of input changes to normalize things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Still spit-balling here.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; As far as ma=\r\nking it real &quot;competitive coevolution&quot;, of course a record of&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; who won is essentially a fitness measure, so there&#39;d have to=\r\n be a hybrid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; novelty/fitness in there somewhere, because meas=\r\nuring who won is not a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; novelty measure.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; I still think novelty search brings a lot of benefits to the table.=\r\n My&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; current spit-ball is that there is an added parameter for=\r\n population growth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; allowance for the host group. Instead of a=\r\n fitness function, a novelty&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; metric is used (assuming one can=\r\n be made, obviously that&#39;s tricky). The host&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; population r=\r\nemains the hosts until their population has grown the specified&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; amount. I&#39;m hoping that will encourage a nice broad range of strateg=\r\nies to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be evaluated.

Essentially novelty is u=\r\nsed to explore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; differing behaviors up until the cataclysmic e=\r\nvent, then performance is used&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to prune the population back d=\r\nown, and give the &quot;other team&quot; their go.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Not sure if there would be any benefit to such an approach, but if I c=\r\nan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; figure out a means of quantifying the novelty, I&#39;m gon=\r\nna give it a whirl.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gotta write up something interesting to g=\r\nraduate I suppose.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts would be great=\r\nly appreciated.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Drew&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; On Sat, May 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Drew, I just wanted to echo that I think comb=\r\nining novelty search with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction between evolving a=\r\ngents is very interesting, if only we can find&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a way to =\r\ncharacterize behavior generally enough to overcome the inherent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; noisiness of interaction.
