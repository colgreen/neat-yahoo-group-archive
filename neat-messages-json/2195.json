No of rows in the training data is 1260.\nHow should I set the properties initially?\n\nI have run several evolving with  different properties, but the score \nreturned is about 0.3 all the time. Why? How to solve it?\n\nWhat does the score itself means? Fitness score?\n\nHow to set in properties the input layer as a linear layer and hidden \nas tanh layer and output layer as sigmoid layer?\n\nIf let&#39;s say I run evolving for second time, does it continue from \nprevious one, or just start everything from beginning?\nIf from beginning, how can I set it so that it can start from previous \nresult of evolving?\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nKing regards,\n\n\n\nChivas\n\n\n\n"}}
