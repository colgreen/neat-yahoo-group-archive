Thanks for the clarification.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Your question about why the creatures are not more regular one is an\n&gt; interesting one that I myself have been puzzling over since the beginning\n&gt; of this project. I originally expected that we&#39;d get creatures like those\n&gt; from EndlessForms.com that walk around. As you point out, though, the\n&gt; creatures in this paper are not nearly that symmetric (either bilaterally\n&gt; or radially). There is clearly a lot of regularity, especially compared to\n&gt; the direct encoding (as Ken points out), but not nearly as much as in\n&gt; EndlessForms and Picbreeder.

Good luck with this work going forward.\n\n\n&gt; As for when different types of symmetry evolved in nature: a lot of that\n&gt; is addressed in Raff&#39;s book &quot;The Shape of Life&quot;, which Ken recommended to\n&gt; me long ago.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nThanks for the book recommendation.

I look forward to seeing your evolved\n&gt; creature work when it comes out.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI&#39;ll definitely post it to the group when I make some headway. My first cut\njust involved a static body with 3 parts, a torso and two limbs, each limb\nconnected with a 6-degree-of-freedom joint. I used NEAT to evolve the\nneural network controllers for the joints. I just used a simple fitness\nfunction favoring distance traveled. Even with this simple first pass, in\nonly 15 generations I was able to get individuals that moved around pretty\nwell (a sort of breast stroke on solid ground was the most common\nstrategy). It&#39;s pretty satisfying seeing your creations progress from\nnon-functional to actually doing cool stuff in relatively short periods of\ntime.\n\nAnyway, congrats again, and good luck on the work!\n\n--Derek\n\r\n--047d7bdca2a25406d604da6c297e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Sun, Apr 14, 2013 at 5:01 PM, Jeff Clune &lt;span dir=3D&quot;l=\r\ntr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jclune@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jclune@gmail.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail=\r\n_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border=\r\n-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;\n&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for your comments on our work.
