The\n&gt; only alternative is to open up CVS to anyone who asks and who wa=\r\nnts to\n&gt; submit a patch, which may lead to chaos. It&#39;s probably a moot poin=\r\nt\n&gt; for SharpNeat given that there aren&#39;t more than a handful of people a\n&gt;=\r\n year wanting to submit a patch - but the possibility exists of the\n&gt; codeb=\r\nase getting out of control.\n\nPatches against specific versions can be poste=\r\nd anywhere Sourceforge\nmessage forums etc so no need to open up write acces=\r\ns to everybody.\nEven if you did open write access up to many people as most=\r\n popular OS\nprojects do, you can always use &quot;blame&quot; mode of SVN to see who =\r\ndid\nwhat and when, and roll back mistakes easily - so it is _very_\ndifficul=\r\nt for chaos to rein :). Under most circumstances you would\nonly bother to r=\r\noll patches into the main release if they proved to be\npopular/useful (it o=\r\nnly takes a few seconds to do anyway if the patch\nis done correctly - which=\r\n it normally is if your using subversion\nclients to make the patch).  \nAs f=\r\nor major branching modifications like Hyper/Parralel neat it is a\nsimple ma=\r\ntter to create a branch in a SVN repository and hand out\nbranch write acces=\r\ns to whoever you choose. The advantage for everyone\nof this is that any bug=\r\n fixes, upgrades and improvements to common\ncode on any branch or in the ma=\r\nin release can easily be merged across\nor patches created (by anyone not ju=\r\nst code maintainers) so all\nflavors of SharpNeat can benefit from the hard =\r\nwork... \n\n\n\n"}}
