I run\n&gt; a Linux cluster but generally develop on a Windows machine, so I will\n&gt; make a .bat.\n\nI&#39;m going to contact him in order to send you the code.

I have been stalling on making the\n&gt;&gt; upgrades past breve 2.5 i.e. not really using the new python\n&gt;&gt; capabilities, simply because Klein deprecated the data class.\n&gt;&gt; Progress has a way of dragging us forward! What type of experiments?\n&gt;&gt; Are you the guys with the learning bipedal walker on you tube?\n&gt;&gt; ck\n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G. Miguel&quot; &lt;cesar.gomes@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Peter B. and I have been doing some experiments with Breve using the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; NEAT-Python implementation. It&#39;s not a plugin, though. You have to set\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up a fitness function that calls the Breve engine from the command\n&gt;&gt; &gt; line and passes the chromosomes by argument. Once the Breve simulation\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is finished, it returns the fitness for each individual.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; So it&#39;s a two-step problem: first set-up your environment within\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Breve, as you&#39;d do in a normal experiment; then you define a fitness\n&gt;&gt; &gt; function to load that environment every time you need to evaluate the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; population. Think of Breve as the &quot;evaluator&quot; and not part of NEAT.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a completely separated module.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you have interest, we can send you the code. It only works in linux\n&gt;&gt; &gt; right now, given that you need to use some shell scripts. But I think\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it won&#39;t be hard to translate that into a bat file.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cesar\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 10, 2008 at 11:20 AM, Correy Allen Kowall\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;coolbeanskowall@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a NEAT or hyperNEAT plugin for the breve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; simulation engine?
