I have a few questions that \nmight\n&gt; &gt; help me get started.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. I&#39;ve looked around for documentation for NEAT, I see a lot of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npapers on &quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-list.php&quot; but they all \nseem\n&gt; &gt; ver=\r\ny experiment specific. Is there a paper anywhere describing \nNEAT\n&gt; &gt; in ge=\r\nneral, and the theory behind how it works?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d recommend one of Ke=\r\nn&#39;s early publications where he first lays \nout the\n&gt; algorithm, like this =\r\none:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=3DPubID&Pub=\r\nID\n(Pubs)=3D114\n&gt; \n\nTo expand on to Derek&#39;s suggestion- although our papers=\r\n on NEAT do \ntend to focus on specific experiments, the earlier ones also \n=\r\nemphasize the general theory behind the methodology, since they are \nwhere =\r\nit was first introduced.
