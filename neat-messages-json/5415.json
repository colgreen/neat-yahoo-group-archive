The tasks required directly\nprocessing raw image data, including some from a robot-mounted camera,\nrequiring the neural networks to directly process hundreds or thousands\nof inputs. The tasks included object recognition and robot navigation.\nThe complexity and properties of the tasks, as well as the neural\nnetwork substrate topologies, were varied and the performance and\ncharacteristics of the evolutionary process and solutions generated were\nanalysed. Positive results were achieved for non-trivial tasks, and some\nimportant characteristics of HyperNEAT not previously reported were\ndiscovered: a bias towards generating weight patterns aligned with the\ntopographical arrangement of neurons within the layers of the substrate\nnetwork; the impact on performance of the number of dimensions in the\ntopographical arrangement of neurons in hidden layers; the ability to\nevolve solutions more quickly with larger substrate networks; and a\npossible difficulty co-evolving weight patterns for substrate networks\ncontaining more than one hidden layer. New directions for further\nresearch and possible enhancements to HyperNEAT are proposed based on\nthese findings.\n\n\n-- \n\n*E:* oliver@...\n*P:* 0421 972 953 (Aus.), +61 421 972 953 (Intl.)\n*Skype:* oliver.coleman\n*W:* www.e-geek.com.au - /commercial web services./\n*W:* www.enviro-geek.net - /not-for-profit web services./\n\n\r\n--------------030100040107040209080303\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; text=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;\nHi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;ve recently completed a&nbsp;thesis on some of the properties and\ncharacteristics of HyperNEAT.
