Currently we haven&#39;t\nimplemented this aspect of NEAT, but any XML standard\nwe agree on should have some sort of boolean enabled\nattribute (e.g., &quot;&lt;connection id=&quot;10&quot;\nenabled=&quot;true&quot;...&gt;&quot;)\n\n&gt;    -A recurrency flag\n\nTo clarify a bit...we&#39;ve got both &quot;Chromosome XML&quot; and\n&quot;Network XML&quot; in our implementation.  The chromosome\nXML is used for handling all the GA logic, which only\nneeds to know which individuals are in the same\nspecies, who mates with whom, etc.  The genetic\nmaterial, in other words, doesn&#39;t need to know how the\nphenotype functions.  We have a transcriber object\nthat takes chromosome XML and translates it into\nnetwork XML, from which a working phenotype can then\nbe constructed.  So network XML does contain boolean\nrecurrency attributes for connections.\n\n&gt; In particular, I am not sure how the NEAT algorithm\n&gt; can be \n&gt; implemented (with respect to the standard operations\n&gt; in our papers)\n&gt; without the ability to disable a gene?  \n\nIt seems to work reasonably well without that\nfunctionality implemented.  As we incrementally added\nfeatures into our implementation, the one that seemed\nto have the most impact was elitism.  \n\n&gt; Also the\n&gt; previous discussion\n&gt; on simplification would require such a tag.\n\nYou could simply delete genes, but I agree that\ndisabling them, with a chance for later reactivation\nis the most biologically plausible approach, and\nprobably the best.\n \n&gt; One other thing about printing out entire\n&gt; populations.  In my\n&gt; population files (which C++ NEAT users may have\n&gt; noticed are usually\n&gt; called gen_#) I concatenate the whole population of\n&gt; genomes into\n&gt; a single file, wherein the genomes are clustered by\n&gt; species, and\n&gt; there is a comment line before each species and\n&gt; before each individual\n&gt; giving stats.  \n\nWell, again, XML is fairly easy to parse using XSL\ninto pretty much any text-based layout.  Just in\ngeneral, it&#39;s a lot easier to manipulate and reformat\ninformation, and create the types of summaries you\nlisted, and the nice thing about it is that it&#39;s all\nimplementation-neutral.\n\nIf we can agree on a decent XML standard, we can all\nuse each other&#39;s XSL style sheets to sort and group\ninformation from runs.\n\n&gt; Anyway, just some ideas to keep in mind.  I&#39;ve found\n&gt; it very \n&gt; convenient to to be able to do these things with my\n&gt; output\n&gt; files, although I realize there are a million ways\n&gt; you can\n&gt; visualize, edit, summarize, etc. population files.\n\nRight...and XML should be a good,\nimplementation-neutral standard.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
