I guess the AAAI\n&gt;&quot;Challenges in Game AI Workshop&quot; gets the most submissions (and is the\n&gt;most relevant to modern day computer game dev) but there is also the\n&gt;IEEE CIG symposium, which is of interest. I&#39;m sure there are others.\n\nHi,\n         Yes I know there is more of this now, I was even on the \nprogram committee for CIG 2005.\n\n         Since I no longer work in that industry it&#39;s no longer relevant.\n\n         I was just illustrating the point with an account from a few \nyears ago.\n\n         Ian\n\n&gt;Here&#39;s are a couple of links for you\n&gt;\n&gt;http://csapps.essex.ac.uk/cig/\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.simbionic.com/gameai/schedule.html\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards\n&gt;\n&gt;Mat Buckland\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of\n&gt;Ian Badcoe\n&gt;Sent: Tuesday, October 11, 2005 3:01 PM\n&gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [neat] Publish and be damned?\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;         I experiment with NEAT purely because I enjoy it, and I think\n&gt;there\n&gt;is some good progress to be made on a reasonable time-frame.\n&gt;\n&gt;         And for the purposes of that, there is no need for me to do\n&gt;anything\n&gt;more than write the odd web-page (very odd, in all probability :) and\n&gt;post things here.\n&gt;\n&gt;         BUT, with half an eye on the future, I might want to get back\n&gt;into\n&gt;academia one day (say if its raining and I happen to be passing a\n&gt;university), and to do that, you really do have to have a\n&gt;track-record of publications you can point at.  I know this to be a\n&gt;particularly acute problem (at least here in the UK) because I tried\n&gt;it a few years ago and, even explaining that I hadn&#39;t published\n&gt;anything because the games industry is paranoid and _never_ publishes\n&gt;anything (this 99.5% true) I still couldn&#39;t get them to rate me.\n&gt;\n&gt;         SO, I&#39;d quite like to publish some of my current work (when it\n&gt;gets\n&gt;results that is, but the reason I mention this now is that at the\n&gt;moment its looking very promising).  And I was wondering what people\n&gt;thought the prospects are.  I mean, do journals generally have a rule\n&gt;that says you have to be a member of a university before they&#39;ll look\n&gt;at your work?  I&#39;m guessing not because, of course, many corporate\n&gt;R&D depts also regularly publish.  But what are the prospects for an\n&gt;unknown individual?  Would your submission get the same treatment as\n&gt;anybody&#39;s?  Or would they throw it on a &quot;possible loonies&quot; pile and\n&gt;forget about it?\n&gt;\n&gt;         Would I need somebody in a university to &quot;front&quot; it for me --\n&gt;e.g.\n&gt;list themselves as the corresponding author and me as the co-author\n&gt;of the work?  If that&#39;s the case, I would be quite open to the idea,\n&gt;I mean it even seems reasonably honest, not really different from\n&gt;putting your laboratory head on your papers because he provided the\n&gt;environment in which the work happened (even if he actually\n&gt;understand nothing of your work -- this used to happen in\n&gt;biochemistry, mentioning no names...).\n&gt;\n&gt;         Opinions?\n&gt;\n&gt;         Ian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;___________________________________________________________\n&gt;How much free photo storage do you get?
