What kind of data are you \n&gt; thinking of using for input? \n\nTo do the training I have written some perl scripts to site scrape \nhistorical price data off yahoo finance. I now have a database of \n17,000 stocks from Europe and America, with historical end of day \ndata for each. Some (e.g. IBM) going back as far as 1962. Adding the \ndays of trading for all these stocks gives 29 million trading days, \nwith open,high,low,close and volume for each day. There should be \nplenty there for training and testing.\n\nAs for how I&#39;m going to use this data to provide inputs to a neural \nnet and use it to compose a fitness function for the GA....I have \nsome well developed ideas but I don&#39;t think this is the best place to \ndiscuss them. If anyone wants to collaborate on the NEAT side of \nthings I&#39;ll happily divulge my ideas to you - drop me a direct mail.\n\nIf anyone wants to download the database (3 large binary files \ncontaining the raw data) and the C++ classes to access it drop me a \nline and we can sort out an ftp transfer. I can also share the \nscripts I used to do the site scraping, although it would not be a \ngood idea if lots of people started using them - the yahoo finance \nsite would grind to a halt and they&#39;d probably start making it harder \nto do such things in future :-)\n\nI&#39;m currently trying to get my head around the NEAT C++ code so I may \nwell come back with some questions and observations in the near \nfuture.\n\nRegards,\nEmyr\n\n\n"}}
