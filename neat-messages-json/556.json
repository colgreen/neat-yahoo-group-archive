It has a couple of holes in it, but I \nwouldn&#39;t want _all_ the good work to be already done :)\n\n&gt;   In the Hayek system, is\n&gt;there a difference between training and testing?  The way you\n&gt;described it, it sounds like it i always training, so there is always\n&gt;a chance of a mutant making a bid.\n\nThere&#39;s no probability in the decision to make a bid, it&#39;s a deterministic \noutcome of the individuals response to its input.  The authors report on \nsystems using the bids to form a probability distribution with poor results.\n\nIn the examples that they&#39;ve documented bidding mostly (if not always) \ntakes the form of a yes/no decision whether to make a fixed bid.  The bid \nsize is a simple mutatable property of the individual.  The decision \nwhether to bid or not tends to be from quite simple forms of pattern matching.\n\nNeither the fixed bid, nor the pattern matching is part of the basic \nconcept, however.  I think they were just simple approaches taken because \nthey suited the problems studied.  I have been assuming that when I get \naround to try a similar approach, I will treat the bid as a general output \nfrom the individual (I&#39;m starting with GP, but ultimately I plan to support \nGP and ANN individuals in the same system, so this output might be derived \ninternally in a few different ways).\n\nSince learning only occurs via the creation and destruction of individuals, \ntraining can be halted merely by suppressing these activities.  Bids would \nstill act to select the next active individual, but there would be no need \nto actually transfer the funds (although if you did, it might form useful \nperformance tracking data).\n\n&gt;   Or does the probability go down\n&gt;for some reason?  I guess I should go read the paper...\n\nThey&#39;re not too long and easy to read....\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
