Many systems today *rigidly* define\n&gt;the translation steps from genome to neural phenome.  How do we know that\n&gt;our translation of the genetic code of our organisms into neural structure\n&gt;is *the* optimal translation algorithm?  Perhaps other translation methods\n&gt;that use structures like homeotic boxes, replicative units, optimally\n&gt;balanced &#39;exxons&#39; or others might more optimally step through topologies.\n&gt;Early work in Artificial Life strongly suggests that life was created and\n&gt;destroyed millions perhaps trillions of times.  Early life competed in a\n&gt;palette of likely vastly different translation methods of their genotypes to\n&gt;neural phenotypes.  Ultimately, the most rapid system for topological and\n&gt;phenotypical evolution likely triumphed and is the system we see today.\n\nI should have read this before replying to Kenneth (except I&#39;ve learned if \nI do that I forget my point :).\n\nThis is how nature has approached the issues I raised in my previous \nmessage.  It uses development rules, implemented in the genes, not as a \ndirect blueprint for a neural net, but as a set of rules for how that net \nis assembled.  This has two advantages:\n\n1) modularity -- because rules are applied by recognising existing \nstructures and acting accordingly, a rule can be correctly applied to \ndifferent sub-structures in the developing net, this allows it to support \ndifferent sub-systems with a common framework (effectively via a common \n&quot;interface&quot; I mentioned in the other post)\n\n2) robustness -- also because because rules are able to recognise existing \nstructures, they have same ability to work-around any errors from previous \ndevelopmental stages\n\n&gt;Call this process Genotypic Evolutionary Translation (GET).  Though many\n&gt;might dismiss GET as unnecessary, strong evidence points to its need.\n&gt;Perhaps most strongly is the fact that the only evolutionary system we know\n&gt;of that has successfully evolved sentience, had GET in its toolbox.  : )\n&gt;\n&gt;To me, creating GET is one of the pre-eminent intellectual challenges of\n&gt;neural-evolution today.  Kudos to the individual who solves this conundrum\n&gt;and is able to still obtain the evolutionary simulation speeds we see today.\n\nRight with you, although I would not be tempted to follow nature too closely...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
