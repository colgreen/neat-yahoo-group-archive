You can try reducing the population size.  It really \ndoesn&#39;t have to be big to be effective.  Just remember that the \nnumber of species should be roughly popsize/12. \n\n-See the question on the NEAT Users Page FAQ: \n &quot;NEAT takes up too much memory. Can I save memory somehow? &quot;\nIt is aimed at my C++ code but I think the same principle can \nprobably be applied in JNEAT.\n\n-Use a memory monitor and figure out exactly when the memory is \noverflowing.  Is it right when the pop is created or does it \ngradually build up over generations?\n\n-Try a computer with more memory.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Reuben Grinberg &lt;reuben.grinberg@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using jNeat and I just modified the code so I could do \n&gt; pole-balacing. It works fine, and now I&#39;m trying to use image \ninput. \n&gt; Right now the input is small-ish - 30 x 50 = 1500. I generated one \n&gt; random genome, and am using that as the starting genome file. Now \nI&#39;m \n&gt; getting OutOfMemory errors. Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Reuben\n\n\n\n\n"}}
