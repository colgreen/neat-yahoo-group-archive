Having said that, often the difficulty is in \nachieving that last little bit of fitness so maybe the function does \nstand as a benchmark. All we need to do is use a fitness function (for \nreporting purposes at least) that puts more enphasis on little \nimprovments near the target value over improvements further out.\n\n\nHere&#39;s the result of another run I did using a sawtooth shaped function:\n\nhttp://tinypic.com/etrxhv.png\n\nNote how well the sharp edges have been approximated, which is a nice \nresult considering a sigmoid activation fn is being used. One symptom of \nthis can be seen on close inspection the straight rising edges of the \nteeth, which are slightly wavy.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
