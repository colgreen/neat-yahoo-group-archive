It just reminded me of those \n&gt;approaches I&#39;d seen in the literature of backprop-trained nets being \n&gt;pruned with EAs.\n&gt;\n&gt;I haven&#39;t seen an approach that uses an EA to alternately complexify, \n&gt;then simplify, but I&#39;d be inclined to think that it would be less \n&gt;efficient than using both dynamics simultaneously.  Dunno, though.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThat&#39;s the conclusion I came to - dunno :)  After several thousand \ngenerations you&#39;re probably going to have acquired a lot of connections \nand nodes that aren&#39;t contributing to the network fitness and yet they \nare taking up valuable search time - in running the network itself, in \nthe comptibilty calculations (longer genomes take longer to compare) and \nin the sexual recombination/reproduction. If you trim away all of that \n&#39;dead-wood&#39; the search should be given a new lease of life. Could be an \ninteresting one to investigate.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
