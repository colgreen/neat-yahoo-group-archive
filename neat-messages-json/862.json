In the code there\n&gt; appears to be several different stopping conditions \n&gt; some of which are commented out.  I&#39;m trying to see if\n&gt; my implementation at least produces comparable \n&gt; results.  \n&gt; \n&gt; If the condition is:\n&gt; \n&gt; output for [0,0] &lt; 0.5\n&gt; output for [1,0] &gt;= 0.5\n&gt; output for [0,1] &gt;= 0.5\n&gt; output for [1,1] &lt; 0.5\n&gt; \n\nI believe that&#39;s the condition I used, yes.\n\n&gt; Then I am getting reasonably comparable results.  I \n&gt; haven&#39;t collected statistics yet but it seems to \n&gt; evolve a successful net in 15-40 generations \n&gt; (population size 100) on average.\n&gt; \n\nYeah that sounds about right.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m almost positvie I haven&#39;t implemented all the \n&gt; different routines/options for generating a new \n&gt; population.  Am I cheating by doing (approximately) \n&gt; this:\n&gt; \n\nJust to make sure I&#39;m following, I think you mean generating the \nnext generation (new population usually implies the start of a run \nonly).\n\n&gt; 0. Number of children for each species determined by \n&gt; species average fitness\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Direct copy species champ for any species that is\n&gt; designated to get at least 1 child.\n&gt; \n\nActually I had it only do this for species designated to\nget at least (I think) 5 children.  The reason is that a\nspecies that is going to have very few children needs room\nfor diversity or else it will never change.\n\n&gt; 2.  70% chance for child by crossover of parents \n&gt; selected from species.  Selection is biased by \n&gt; individual fitness within species.  Weights can be\n&gt; perturbed by a small amount\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. 3% chance for child created adding node by \n&gt; mutation. Selection of individual to mutate is biased \n&gt; by individual fitness within species\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. 4% chance for child created adding connection by \n&gt; mutation. Selection of individual to mutate is biased \n&gt; by individual fitness within species\n&gt; \n\nI believe it was 5% but no big deal.\n\nNote that &quot;selection of individuals to mutate&quot; and &quot;selection of \nindividuals to mate&quot; is the same thing.  First it \nselects &quot;individuals to reproduce&quot; and then it decides during \nreproduction whether to mate or mutate them.\n\n&gt; After I feel a little more comfortable with my code,\n&gt; I&#39;ll make it available if anyone wants.  Its fairly slow.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nIt sounds like you&#39;ve got more or less the right setup.   Of course \nthere are likely odds and ends that are bit different in our \nimplementations, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.  I think it \nwould be great to make it available if you feel comfortable it&#39;s \nactually working properly.  Does it have any visualization or data \ncollection to check what happens over the course of a run?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
