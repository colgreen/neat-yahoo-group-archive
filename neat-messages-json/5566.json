Goal of the GECCO 2011 Indust=\r\nrial Challenge is to find profitable trading strategies for automatic forei=\r\ngn exchange trading. A trading strategy is a function that generates a trad=\r\ning signal based on exchange rate time series data. Trading strategies are =\r\nscored by cost-corrected profitability and risk. This scoring is based on a=\r\n representative set of real-world exchange rate time series.\nThe challenge =\r\nis organized in two rounds. In the first round, participants submit the sum=\r\n of their scores reached on three test data sets supplied. They also submit=\r\n their executable software together with short report describing their appr=\r\noach. In the second and final round, the ten best submissions of the first =\r\nround will be ranked by their scores computed on new test data sets collect=\r\ned after the submission date, for the same currency pairs as used in the fi=\r\nrst round. The winner of the challenge will be the participant with the hig=\r\nhest score in the final round.\n\nHighlights of the GECCO 2011 Industrial Cha=\r\nllenge include:\n* Interesting Problem Domain: The FX market, with its compl=\r\nex patterns and behavior, offers a fascinating test case for innovative opt=\r\nimization methods.\n* Real-world Data: Multiple real intraday FX return time=\r\n series are provided for training and testing trading strategies.\n* Realist=\r\nic Quality Measurement: Trading strategies are scored using a simple but re=\r\nalistic trading simulator that takes trading costs and risk into account.\n*=\r\n Fair Submission Assessment: Winners are determined in a second round by si=\r\nmulated trading based on new FX return data sets, rendering accidental over=\r\nfitting or cheating impossible.\n\nImportant Dates and Contacts\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n* =\r\nSoftware and Data Availability: immediately\n* Challenge Submission Deadline=\r\n: June 1, 2011\n* Start of Second Round: June 13, 2011\n* GECCO-2011 Conferen=\r\nce: July 12-16, 2011\n* Contact: gecco@...-koeln.de\n\nSubmission Guideline=\r\ns\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n* Downloa=\r\nd the Call for Participation in PDF format at http://gociop.de/gecco-2011-i=\r\nndustrial-challenge/ .\n* Download the GECCO 2011 IC Resource Package, conta=\r\nining the required datasets, software, and the official rules and regulatio=\r\nns at http://gociop.de/gecco-2011-industrial-challenge/ .
