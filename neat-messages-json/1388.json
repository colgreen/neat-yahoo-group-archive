And I am talking about\n&gt;&gt;NEAT-type high cpu utilization applications, with\n&gt;&gt;arithmetic and trignometric calculations as well as\n&gt;&gt;image processing.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m also very interested in this question.  The C#\n&gt;enthusiasts like to claim that there is not much\n&gt;difference.  I&#39;m of the opinion that there will be a\n&gt;10-fold slowdown if C# is used in place of C++, for\n&gt;cpu intensive applications.  But I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m\n&gt;correct, and I don&#39;t have any evidence to present,\n&gt;just memories of anecdotes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJust to clarify, When I stated the 80% figure I was talking about CPU \nintensive stuff. Apart from SharpNEAT I have (in the last 12 months) \nworked on a few other CPU intensive C# projects, including a port of a \nfull javascript parser and an XML lexer. Both of these projects were \nable to handle loads comparable to a C++ version - we&#39;re talking in the \nregion of 10s to 100s of thousands of lines per second.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
