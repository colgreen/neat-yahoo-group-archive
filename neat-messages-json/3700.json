Given the conversion will cost you developme=\r\nnt time, what \nadvantages are you gaining in Java, or disadvantages in movi=\r\nng away \nfrom .NET/C#?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, I ask this as I have been attempting to=\r\n evaluate performance \nbetween these two platforms. To what degree, if at a=\r\nll, is your move \nperformance motivated?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually performance isn&#39;t=\r\n really a major factor in my thinking. The\n&gt; Java and .Net compilers and ru=\r\nntime environments are all well \nthought\n&gt; out and fast environments in my =\r\nopinion. OK so you&#39;ve got different\n&gt; Java VM&#39;s from different vendors for =\r\ndifferent scenarios, but \nthey&#39;re\n&gt; all good including the standard (free) =\r\nones. And in the .Net world \nyou\n&gt; have Mono which was quite slow when I la=\r\nst tried it last (12 months\n&gt; ago ish). But generally if you see significan=\r\nt performance \ndifferences\n&gt; it&#39;s most likely the code you&#39;re using, not th=\r\ne environment. As I \nsay\n&gt; the generics support in .Net is more performant,=\r\n so that does tilt \nthe\n&gt; performance argument slightly in favour of .Net\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; For me the main argument for Java is the Eclipse IDE. It&#39;s far \neasier\n=\r\n&gt; to navigate through code using views such as the type and call\n&gt; hierarch=\r\ny, highlighting of variables, errors, warnings, TODO \ncomments,\n&gt; etc. on t=\r\nhe right hand margin. The CVS/SVN support is really nice to\n&gt; use - Visual =\r\nStudio&#39;s equivalents are either very poor by comparison\n&gt; (SourceSafe) or v=\r\nery expensive (TeamSuite). Ultimately the Java \ncoding\n&gt; experience is nice=\r\nr and makes more efficient use of programmer time\n&gt; IMO - a big plus in my =\r\nbook.\n&gt; \n&gt; So although I prefer the .Net framework, the IDE&#39;s let the side =\r\n\ndown.\n&gt; Add to that the fact that Java is more open source friendly and th=\r\nat\n&gt; could sway the argument for me. Yes you can get a free version of \nVS,=\r\n\n&gt; but (a) it&#39;s not as good as Eclipse (also free) and (b) it has some\n&gt; fe=\r\natures disabled - 64bit support and multithreaded debugging are \ntwo\n&gt; I bu=\r\nmped into recently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Development time is an issue. Not so much porting =\r\nthe core algorithm\n&gt; stuff as I&#39;m intending to refactor all of that anyway,=\r\n but all the\n&gt; graphical stuff and GUI interfaces could be a serious headac=\r\nhe.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
