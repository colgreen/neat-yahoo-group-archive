I&#39;ve been looking at the food gathering experimen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; discussed in the paper  &quot;A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploiting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Neural Network Sensor and Output Geometry,&quot; and would love to have the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; source code for it because i plan on doing a similar experiment. I\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nownloaded the  HyperNeat v 1.0 source code and it included some\n&gt; &gt; experim=\r\nents, but not that one. Could anyone send me that code or point\n&gt; &gt; me to a=\r\n download? Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
