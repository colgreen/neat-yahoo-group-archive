An outsider might think our ultimate goal is to create a French\n&gt; flag! I think it would be great to see such benchmarking of\n&gt; artificial embryogeny, as things seem to be about the same as when Ken\n&gt; wrote his paper: everyone is just trying stuff with their own system,\n&gt; without any regard to the other systems out there.\n\nRight. It seems like there&#39;s a lack of rigor in determining the\nrepresentational power of these systems, and this is what I liked\nabout the way Ken addressed the issue in his 2003 paper. French flags\nseem like a very rudimentary benchmark, possibly one that could be\nincluded in a suite of benchmarks, but by itself seems to shed little\nlight about the representational power of a given system.\n\n&gt; Ken and I did try to do something like (although not as indepth as his\n&gt; paper suggests) with my 2007 HyperNEAT paper&#39;s results. I built a\n&gt; program that let me look at the Hypercube patterns and we were able to\n&gt; learn a lot about HyperNEAT by watching how the patterns changed over\n&gt; evolution, and were able to isolate modules that contributed to things\n&gt; like symmetry. We have a forthcoming journal publication about\n&gt; HyperNEAT in general that talks a bit about this.\n\nAh, nice. Please post a notice on this list when the article becomes available.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
