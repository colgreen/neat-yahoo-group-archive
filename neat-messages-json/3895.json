First, I would not predict with any confidence that=\r\n EC will\nenter into the machine learning mainstream. I just think that it i=\r\ns a\npossibility.  But it would be a major cultural shift and I would be\nnai=\r\nve to expect it with any confidence.\n\nHowever, there is a chance for it to =\r\nhappen because EAs do have some\nthings going for them.  The first factor is=\r\n mainly a social advantage:\nEC is very popular at the grass-roots level com=\r\npared to other methods\nin machine learning.  Many kids in high school have =\r\nheard of EAs or\neven used one.  Almost none have programmed Q-Learning or a=\r\nnother RL\nmethod.  In fact, this group is a good example of how accessible =\r\nEAs\nare outside the academic community: Many significant contributors to\nNE=\r\nAT who have genuinely impacted the field of neuroevolution are not\nacademic=\r\ns (and in fact post often on this group)!  I think that fact\nis remarkable =\r\nwhen you compare to other areas of machine learning,\nwhere usually only exp=\r\nerts with Ph.D.&#39;s are making significant\ncontributions.  \n\nThe long-term im=\r\nplications of this social phenomenon are yet to be\ndetermined, but I am gue=\r\nssing it will have an impact as the younger\ngeneration gets to grad-school =\r\nage.  What university is going to meet\ntheir demands?  People are going to =\r\nstart filling up the few slots\nthat are available at the schools that were =\r\nforward thinking enough to\nhire in the EC area.  That will put pressure on =\r\nother universities to\nfollow suit to attract the best students.  So that is=\r\n one possibility\nover the long-term.\n\nSecond, I think EAs are a highly prom=\r\nising research direction in\nmachine learning at this time.  It is difficult=\r\n to research issues\nsuch as indirect representation in other paradigms.  EA=\r\ns are in the\nunique position of not requiring any explicit gradient informa=\r\ntion and\ntherefore are free to research radical new ideas much more than e.=\r\ng.\nvalue-function techniques.  I am not saying that such research is\nimposs=\r\nible elsewhere, just that it is easier and more natural in EAs.\n In fact, E=\r\nC research is ahead of RL in the area of representation for\nthis reason. \n\n=\r\nBecause I believe that representation is at the heart of artificial\nintelli=\r\ngence, I think there&#39;s a reasonable chance that the advantage\nof researchin=\r\ng representation will start to bear fruit in the next 10\nyears.  At that ti=\r\nme, the gap between what EC can do and what RL can\ndo will start to widen a=\r\nnd it will become difficult to ignore EC in\nthe mainstream.\n\nSo I think the=\r\n social advantage plus the research advantage together\nsuggest a promising =\r\nfuture.  Of course, prognostication like this is\npure speculation, so like =\r\nI said, don&#39;t hold me to it.  I am not\nsaying any of this with confidence. =\r\n I would not count any fields\n(such as RL) out because like I said before, =\r\nthe best way to view a\nfield as a researcher is not to see if for what it h=\r\nas or has not\naccomplished so far, but for what it might accomplish in the =\r\nfuture,\nand it is very difficult to make predictions in that spirit outside=\r\n\none&#39;s own expertise.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;ta=\r\nnsey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s interesting that you mention value-func=\r\ntion RL, as I remember \n&gt; reading the NEAT journal paper in ML where you de=\r\nscribe NEAT as a \n&gt; &quot;policy-search reinforcement learning algorithm.&quot; I rec=\r\nall thinking to \n&gt; myself &quot;that had to be a political maneuver...&quot; and it l=\r\nooks like I was \n&gt; right. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The academic lineage issue is an interest=\r\ning one. I wish there was an \n&gt; academic AI genealogy that was on par with =\r\nthe software engineering one \n&gt; (http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/sefamily.=\r\nhtm). The one at UT Austin \n&gt; seems to have a lot of entries, but as far as=\r\n visualization goes (e.g., \n&gt; seeing the trace from Schank -&gt; Lehnert -&gt; Dy=\r\ner -&gt; Miikkulainen -&gt; \n&gt; Stanley) it is relatively non-existent. I think it=\r\n would shed a lot of \n&gt; light on the issues and provide some useful guidanc=\r\ne to incoming \n&gt; graduate students looking to find an advisor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m cur=\r\nious though, you mentioned that you envision EAs making their\nway \n&gt; back i=\r\nnto the mainstream eventually. Would you mind elaborating on\nthat? \n&gt; How d=\r\no you see things progressing over the next ~10 years?\n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; K=\r\nenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Great points, Wesley.  You do a great job charact=\r\nerizing the\nsituation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for your last question on why there is no=\r\nt a top tier conference in\n&gt; &gt; EAs, that is a serious problem in the commun=\r\nity.  You mentioned\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Foundations on EAs&quot; but I think your meant &quot;Founda=\r\ntions of Genetic\n&gt; &gt; Algorithms&quot; (FOGA), which indeed has a low acceptance =\r\nrate.  But FOGA\n&gt; &gt; is not the conference you&#39;re looking for unless your pa=\r\nper is\n&gt; &gt; theoretical because FOGA is a theory conference.  For the rest o=\r\nf us,\n&gt; &gt; there is no venue with a low acceptance rate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The reason =\r\nfor this lack of a selective venue is historical and\n&gt; &gt; complicated.  Many=\r\n of the major figures in EA history had different\n&gt; &gt; views about how a con=\r\nference should be run and what its goals should\n&gt; &gt; be than people in other=\r\n areas of machine learning.  There was an\n&gt; &gt; emphasis on inclusiveness and=\r\n some had the philosophy that the prism\n&gt; &gt; of history, rather than a few r=\r\neviewers, should have the final say on\n&gt; &gt; what paper is great or not great=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately for those of us in academia, that philosophy is no =\r\nhelp\n&gt; &gt; to us (as you point out) when we are tying to get jobs or tenure,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; where acceptance rates are scrutinized.  It really needs to change,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and I believe it will, but it is probably going to take a generational\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n change in leadership.  So unfortunately it could take a long time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n In the meantime, we can still submit to conferences like AAAI and\n&gt; &gt; ICML=\r\n.  The only problem is that the barrier to entry for EAs is higher\n&gt; &gt; than=\r\n for other areas because of their lack of mainstream acceptance in\n&gt; &gt; mach=\r\nine learning.  So we have to first justify using an EA at all,\n&gt; &gt; whereas =\r\nanother method like value-function RL can just start from the\n&gt; &gt; premise t=\r\nhat it&#39;s a good idea to begin with.  Still, people have\n&gt; &gt; succeeded in ge=\r\ntting into these conferences with EA-based work, and it\n&gt; &gt; is seeping in m=\r\nore and more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, the floodgates could open if EAs really star=\r\nt to have\n&gt; &gt; significantly better results.  I believe that is possible bec=\r\nause the\n&gt; &gt; emphasis on representation in EAs is going to lead to new doma=\r\nins\n&gt; &gt; being accessible.  We will see.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another historical factor i=\r\ns that in America, the academic lineages\n&gt; &gt; coming out of other areas of A=\r\nI for whatever reason established\n&gt; &gt; themselves in the top departments bef=\r\nore EAs became popular, which\n&gt; &gt; means EAs are not well-represented in US =\r\ncomputer science departments,\n&gt; &gt; which is a self-perpetuating problem.  In=\r\nterestingly, the situation is\n&gt; &gt; somewhat different in Europe than in the =\r\nUS.  In Europe, EAs are more\n&gt; &gt; mainstream.  In the UK for example most fa=\r\nculties that have AI\n&gt; &gt; researchers include EA researchers.  There is just=\r\n a different history\n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I just want to add to two =\r\nof the issues raised here.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  So you see, in\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; build=\r\ning a new algorithm or a new theory with practical\nimplications,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ofte=\r\nn traditional problems are exactly the wrong vehicle to\ndiscovery\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; bec=\r\nause they perpetuate the same dogmatic perspectives that already\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perm=\r\neate the field to begin with and cause it to be staying in one\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; place.=\r\n   Thus all of these applications are chosen with careful\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; scrutiny wi=\r\nth a sincere belief in their practical ramifications.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;       =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This is really starting to be recognized by a lot of the machine \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; learning crowd. At ILP 2007, Pedro Domingos gave an invited\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n presentation \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; entitled &quot;Structured Machine Learning: Ten Probl=\r\nems for the Next Ten \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Years.&quot; (http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/pedr=\r\nod/papers/ilp07.pdf) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; While it&#39;s a different subdomain of machine lear=\r\nning, he had the\nsame \n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts on &quot;traditional&quot; problems as targets f=\r\nor new research. From\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; article:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    =\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; We need to avoid falling into local optima in our research: once a =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; problem is solved\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;80/20,&quot; we should move on to the next large=\r\nr one that includes it, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not continue to refine our\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; solution wi=\r\nth diminishing returns. Our natural tendency to do the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; latter greatl=\r\ny slows down the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; progress of research. Moreover, the best solutions t=\r\no subproblems \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; taken in isolation are often not\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the best ones i=\r\nn combination. Because of this, refining\nsolutions to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; subproblems ca=\r\nn in fact be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; counterproductive=97digging deeper into the local optimu=\r\nm instead of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; escaping it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The second point I want =\r\nto address is on the use of NEAT, or more \n&gt; &gt;&gt; generally EAs, in &quot;Fortune =\r\n100 defense firms.&quot; I recently\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; interviewed at \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; BB=\r\nN Technologies, and they told me about one project their Cambridge \n&gt; &gt;&gt; te=\r\nam worked on and is now deployed in Iraq. When a convoy of\ntroops is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ntraveling and a sniper fires a shot, an array of microphones\nmounted on \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; top of one of the vehicles records the sound, then runs a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; multi-ob=\r\njective evolutionary algorithm to determine the distance, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; elevation, =\r\netc., that the shot originated from. The result is\nthat when \n&gt; &gt;&gt; an insur=\r\ngent sniper fires a shot, within 3 seconds the entire convoy \n&gt; &gt;&gt; turns ar=\r\nound and fires everything at that spot. Apparently the mic\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; ar=\r\nray \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; system works well enough that it has been nicknamed the &quot;O=\r\nctopus of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; Death.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Warning: the rest of this messa=\r\nge is extremely off topic.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That&#39;s just my thoughts/experiences th=\r\nough. For what it&#39;s worth, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; think \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; it&#39;s pretty h=\r\nard to deny that EAs have fallen out of favor with the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mainstream mac=\r\nhine learning crowd. To a large degree, I believe\nthis is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the result =\r\nof an easily satisfied community. Groucho Marx said, &quot;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t want=\r\n to belong to any club that would have me as a\nmember&quot; and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same i=\r\ns true of research communities. Conference quality is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; determined almo=\r\nst entirely by acceptance rates. The &quot;top tier&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conferences in AI lik=\r\ne AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, etc. all have acceptance\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; rates \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; around or below 25%. The EA community decided to break off and form\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; lots \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of specialized conferences, which would be fin=\r\ne, except that these \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conferences have ridiculous acceptance rates of =\r\naround ~45% or\nhigher. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; With such a low barrier to entry, the amount o=\r\nf rigor applied to EA \n&gt; &gt;&gt; papers is routinely unacceptable and occasional=\r\nly shameful. The\nresult \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is that work by Ken&#39;s group at UCF or Risto&#39;s=\r\n group at UT Austin\ngets \n&gt; &gt;&gt; best paper at GECCO or CEC, but among a lot =\r\nof machine learning\nfaculty \n&gt; &gt;&gt; it still isn&#39;t considered as prestigious =\r\nas a paper accepted to\none of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the top tier conferences mentioned abov=\r\ne, despite the fact that the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; work \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is more likely=\r\n to have a significant impact on practical machine\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; learning.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; As a Software Engineering student, I know what it&#39;s like to be =\r\non\nthe \n&gt; &gt;&gt; other extreme end of the spectrum. SE conference acceptance ra=\r\ntes at\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; top tier are dipping into the low tee=\r\nns or even single digits. This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; certainly has a lot of negative implic=\r\nations for researchers. Many \n&gt; &gt;&gt; times, reviewers simply look for any lit=\r\ntle way to reject a\npaper, and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you typically have to resubmit 2 or 3 =\r\ntimes, with major revisions\nand \n&gt; &gt;&gt; additions each time, before a paper i=\r\ns accepted. However, when a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; graduating PhD. student has several publi=\r\ncations at ICSE, OOPSLA,\nFSE, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc., their resume automatically gets t=\r\nhem considered for\ntenure-track \n&gt; &gt;&gt; positions at top 10 schools. There ar=\r\ne just no such conferences\nin the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; EA domain where people would look a=\r\nt a set of publications and say\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Wow, \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; he got in =\r\nthere--TWICE!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So I guess the question that I&#39;m throwing in here =\r\nis: why isn&#39;t\nthere a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; top tier conference for EAs? How about Foundati=\r\nons of Evolutionary \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Algorithms (FEA)?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
