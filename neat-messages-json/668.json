The two main options I&#39;ve thought of are\n&gt;these:\n&gt;\n&gt;1.  Ray-casting.  Shoot a grid of rays out from the\n&gt;face that each return the distance of the nearest\n&gt;intersection (i.e. distance sensors).  More rays could\n&gt;be added throughout evolution.  I&#39;ve heard that such\n&gt;intersection testing in large quantities is pretty\n&gt;expensive if the environment is complex.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Tyler,\n\nKeep in mind that sight&#39;s primary purpose is to allow the mind to build \nan internal model of physical surroundings. Within the computer there \nare far more efficient ways of providing this information to your \nartificial human&#39;s &#39;brain&#39; since the surroundings are already described \nmathematically, so unless you were intending to transfer the whole \nproject to a real-world scenario I see eye simulation as unnecessary.\n\nIt&#39;s really nice work so far though, actually I thought watching the CGI \nman falling over was kind of amusing as well :)\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
