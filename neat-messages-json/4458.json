If you think of a\nP-NEAT=\r\n\n&gt; substrate for a checkers board evaluation, maybe it would be better\nto t=\r\nake\n&gt; contiguous regions instead of ordering based on age.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be=\r\n an interesting area for someone to conduct research.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for=\r\n clarifying these issues.\n&gt;\n\nHey Jeff,\n\nThe problem with trying to use P-NE=\r\nAT on checkers is tied to the\ndirect encoding of genes.  If P-NEAT was to r=\r\nun on the 4100-connection\nsubstrate that HyperNEAT encodes, it would not be=\r\n possible to defeat\nthe simplech heuristic within 20 generations as HyperNE=\r\nAT does.  I do\nnot believe that anything besides an extraordinary amount of=\r\n luck\nwould allow the weights to behave in concert to form even something a=\r\ns\nsimple as a piece counter (which actually, by itself, is not complex\nenou=\r\ngh to defeat the heuristic).\n\nIgnoring the evolution speed difference betwe=\r\nen HyperNEAT and P-NEAT,\nthe other problem is generalization.  Because P-NE=\r\nAT is a direct\nencoding, it can only learn weights that it has needed for a=\r\n single\ngame of checkers in a single generation.  Even with a deterministic=\r\n\nopponent, mutating a few links in the substrate causes radical changes\nin =\r\nthe following generation&#39;s evaluation because picking a different\nmove once=\r\n causes simplech to pick a different move and this in turn\ncauses a snowbal=\r\nl effect that results in a completely different game.\nWith a direct encodin=\r\ng, all of the link weights have a chance of being\nmutated, even ones that h=\r\nad no bearing on fitness.  This means that as\nthe games keep changing their=\r\n focus on different configurations,\nP-NEAT is potentially destroying valid =\r\nconnections in mutation.\n\nI believe that these problems would affect any di=\r\nrect encoding.  IMHO,\nanything besides using another technique to reduce th=\r\ne input space\n(i.e. NEAT-EI) cannot compete on the same level as an indirec=\r\nt\nencoding for highly geometric tasks.  Even if adding crossover could\ngive=\r\n NEAT-EI or P-NEAT an order of magnitude faster convergence on a\nsolution f=\r\nor defeating simplech, it would still not learn as fast as\nHyperNEAT and st=\r\nill faces the problem of generalization against the\nnon-deterministic heuri=\r\nstic.\n\n\n"}}
