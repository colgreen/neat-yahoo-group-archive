I will keep it in mind.  You know, \n&gt; &gt;ultimately what we are up against is just the fact that no sample \n&gt; &gt;can be guaranteed to perfectly represent its generating \ndistribution.\n&gt; &gt;It&#39;s likely there will always be extraordinary situations that \nwere \n&gt; &gt;not encountered in whatever training set was experienced during \n&gt; &gt;evolution.  At the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do \nbetter, \n&gt; &gt;it just means reaching exactly 100% of all possible test cases is \n&gt; &gt;unlikely for complicated problems or domains.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; What has been surprising to me is how this problem has come up \nwhile \n&gt; evolving for relatively simple problems, e.g. with prey capture \nthe \n&gt; difficulty level is increased by allowing the prey more &#39;head \nstart&#39; \n&gt; moves before the agent can move. At below 4 moves the prey should \nalways \n&gt; remain within the agent&#39;s sensor range, thus a very simple \nsolution is \n&gt; possible whereby sensors are directly connected to motor outputs. \nAnd \n&gt; yet the pass rate is still not 100% in all but the easiest \nproblem, take \n&gt; a look at these success rates for champs at each difficultly level:\n&gt; \n&gt; Initial moves   100 tests   1000 tests\n&gt; -------------------------------------\n&gt; 0                     100%         100%\n&gt; 1                     96.48%      99.9%\n&gt; 2                     94.56%      99.9%\n&gt; 3                     95.10%      99.9%\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hopefully that table didn&#39;t get too mangled in transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there is a balance between the sample size (and therefore \nsearch \n&gt; speed) and solution quality, and for all but the most trivial \nproblems \n&gt; this balance seems to follow the law of dimishing returns. \nHopefuly by \n&gt; using a buffer of failed tests I can tip the balance more in our \nfavour \n&gt; - better solutions without all of the cost of performing 1000 \ntests.\n&gt; \n&gt; But yes I&#39;m beginning to see that obtaining 100% perfect solutions \nfor \n&gt; most problems is perhaps unrealistic, but a 99.9% sucess is a lot \nmore \n&gt; useful that 95% - that could be the difference between a \ncommercially \n&gt; viable technique (say fingerprint ID&#39;ing) and one that isn&#39;t.\n&gt; \n\nAnother factor is the kinds of sensors and outputs you use.  If you \nuse absolute sensors and outputs, e.g. &quot;look north, south, east, \nwest&quot; and &quot;move north, south, east, or west,&quot; then there is a need \nto rediscover the same principle more than once: if something is \nperceived in a certain direction then move in that direction.  \nBecause this principle would need to be discovered for each \navailable direction, there is more room for failure or subtle flaws \nin at least one of the directions.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use relative (i.e. egocentric) \nrepresentations, principles generally only need be discovered once.  \nFor example, if something is in front of you, then move towards it.  \nOtherwise, if something is at angle from your front (notice- \nrelative), then turn until you point towards it.  These principles \napply in any position, and therefore are likely to end up more \naccurate overall.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
