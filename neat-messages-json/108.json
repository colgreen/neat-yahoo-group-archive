This problem requires short\n&gt; term memory, and use of what is stored there, so an\n&gt; MLP can&#39;t do the job.  It must be some kind of\n&gt; recurrent ANN.  The problem is to play the game of\n&gt; concentration.  That&#39;s the card game where all the\n&gt; cards are spread face down and each player gets to\n&gt; turn over two cards.  If they are a pair he keeps them\n&gt; and gets another turn.  Otherwise they go face down\n&gt; again.  When humans play it its mainly a test of\n&gt; memory, although if your memory is perfect there is\n&gt; some strategy involved.  (see Sci. Am. Oct. 1991)\n&gt; \n\nHi Mitchell, concentration does sound like a very\ninteresting problem for an ANN.  It is probably\nquite difficult since it involves long term \naccurate and discrete memory.  But the input representaiton,\ni.e. how you represent the cards to the network,\nis probably a major issue.  And it&#39;s not clear what\nthe right way would be, so it needs careful consideration\nsince some representations are likely impossible for an ANN to\ndeal with.  But I think it&#39;s quite an interesting experiment,\nand I hope someone tries it out.  I am unfortunately \ninvolved in plugging NEAT into too many experiments at\nthe present time, but if you put your code in the\nfiles section of this board, hopefully someone will take\ninterest.  If I find time I might play with it myself.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
