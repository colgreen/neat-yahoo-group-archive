The newer\n&gt; paper has been expanded and updated, and includes\n&gt; significantly more\n&gt; experimental results.  \n\nCool...thanks for the update, Ken.\n\nI&#39;m interested to read this updated paper.\n\nI had a question about how you implemented your robot\nsimulation.  Did you do all the simulation stuff from\nscratch?\n\nThough we&#39;re primarily concentrating on game domains,\nwe&#39;ve been looking at robot control as well.  There\nare a few good opensource robot simulators out there. \nIn Java, there are KSIM and TeamBots:\n\nhttp://ehrg.cs.wright.edu/ksim/ksim.html\nhttp://www.teambots.org/\n\nI had previously looked at JRobots, but it is not\nopensource, and the restrictions for developing the\nbots is prohibitive for research.\n\nKSIM models Khepera robots and TeamBots models Nomad\nand Cye robots.  TeamBots also includes a SoccerBots\npackage which pits teams of five against one another,\nand it includes a fairly large range of hard-coded\nstrategies.\n\nOur focus right now is trying to finally get our NEAT\nimplementation released (we&#39;ve settled on the name of\nANJI--Another NEAT Java Implementation), but we&#39;d like\nto look down the road at a variety of domains to\nextend it, and robot simulations seem like a pretty\ninteresting domain (but we&#39;d rather not code\neverything from scratch if we can help it).\n\nI was also wondering if any of the NEAT control\nalgorithms that you evolved for your robot control\nexperiments might be portable to a physical robot.  I\nnotice a professor named Peter Stone there at UT\nAustin who seems to be involved in RoboCup competition\nwith both wheeled and legged robots, both physical and\nsimulated.  Is there any crossover in what you guys\ndo?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
