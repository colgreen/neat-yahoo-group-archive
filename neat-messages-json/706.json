I was looking at some of your parameters and \nI wanted to ask a few implementation questions and make a few \ncomments:\n\n-Why is the default pmutate_add_connection setting at 77%?  That \nseems extremeley high..so almost every mating leads to a new \nconnection?  \n\n-Why is pmutate_connections_weights on the other hand at only 0.2?  \nDoes that mean only 20% of matings have any mutation of weights?\n\n-What is &quot;elitism proportion?&quot; The standard NEAT use of elitism is \nto just keep one clone of the champ of every species that has been \nalotted over 5 offspring in the next generation.  So it is species-\nbased elitism.  But what does yours do?\n\n-The selection proportion of 0.1 is very low and will likely cause \npremature convergence.\n\n-My version of NEAT generally solves the single pole balancing \nproblem (with velocities) in under 1000 evaluations...so some of the \ndifferences between the implementations probably are worth looking \ninto.  It looks like it takes maybe 10 times longer or more in \nSharpNEAT.\n\n-What is the weight mutation power and rate, i.e. how much do you \nperturb weights and how likely is it any particular weight will be \nperturbed?  Also, is there a max weight?\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There is a new release on the (slightly reorganized) SharpNEAT web \nsite \n&gt; http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; A single-pole-balancing domain is available along with a pole \nbalancing \n&gt; simulation tool. There is a perfect pole balancing network in the \n&gt; &#39;networks&#39; dir, but don&#39;t take my word fot it, try evolving one \nfor \n&gt; yourself :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The prey capture domain is still being worked on, the fitness \nfunction \n&gt; currently employed punishes for the number of timesteps taken to \ncatch \n&gt; the prey. Right now though the punishment needs re-adjusting (it&#39;s \ntoo \n&gt; harsh) so you probably won&#39;t see very good results without \nmodification. \n&gt; Again, the current best network is in the &#39;networks&#39; dir.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the main tool new search parameters are provided: &#39;Species \ndroppoff \n&gt; age&#39; and &#39;Interspecies mating proportion&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
