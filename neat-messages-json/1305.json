Thanks for the recap. :)\n\nYeah, I understand that this is just a sort of test domain.  If you\nhad any variance in your input, it wouldn&#39;t work.  This is probably\nmore akin to a memorization task than a pattern recognition one, since\nthere&#39;s no noise or variance in your samples.\n\n&gt; 50x50 represnts a massive input space, but since I understand you&#39;re\n&gt; using a roving eye technique that seems reasonable to me, although\n&gt; personally I would be tempted to start a bit smaller.\n\nYou think that&#39;s big...some of the images for other patterns we want\nto experiment with are an order of magnitude bigger: about 300x400. :)\n\nI think John&#39;s image enlargement experiments are using relatively\nlarge images as well.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
