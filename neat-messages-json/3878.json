The fitness function can&#39;t exactly be defined, since they \ncan be evolved towards some tasks like &quot;go there&quot; or something. I \nwant to briefly describe the details behind it. \n\nThe same network is used for both the body and the nervous system of \nthe creature. First the body is built by a spatial CPPN and converted \nto a mass-spring model. There are several tissues (the CPPN outputs \ntissue type instead of level of expression). One type of tissue is a \nsensor tissue, which excites upon collision. Another type of tissue \nis a muscle tissue, which contracts the springs when excited. Like a \nregular bilogical muscle. \n\nThe key point is, that after the spatial CPPN builds the body, the \nsame CPPN is then used for HyperNEAT (additional outputs, though), to \nevolve the connectivity of the neural network controlling the body. \nInputs are located on sensor tissue only. Outputs are located on \nmuscle tissue. Hidden nodes are located on the remaining tissue. This \nis essentially evolving both the substrate and the connectivity of \nthe network, but in a meaningful way, because of the geometry and the \nsimulated 2D physics space. \n\nThe simulation is like this - when the sensor tissue is excited by \nsome collision, this also plugs 1.0 into the associated HyperNEAT&#39;s \nnetwork&#39;s inputs. When the outputs activation level exceeds some \ntreshold, the associated springs on the muscle tissue are contracted. \n\nI believe that using the same network for both pusposes (spatial and \nconnective) is better than using different networks. Do you think \nthis in general is a good idea? \n\nPeter\n\n\n\n \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_017F_01C88817.C3194E20\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.=\r\nw3c.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-eq=\r\nuiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dus-ascii&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16608&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY style=3D&quot;BACKGRO=\r\nUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D187260116-17032008&gt;Peter,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dl=\r\ntr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D187260116-170320=\r\n08&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D187260116-17032008&gt;Yes, I believe this is a power=\r\nful idea.&nbsp; In effect \nthe perturbations need not be a collision, altho=\r\nugh that analogy works, but can \nbe an output from other networks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN \n=\r\nclass=3D187260116-17032008&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN \nclass=3D187260116-17032008&gt;There=\r\n are many things one can do with an intersection \nof graph thermodynamics (=\r\nincluding, Fruchterman-Reingold, Kamada-Kawai, Eades, \netc) force directed =\r\ngraph layout and artificial neural networks.
