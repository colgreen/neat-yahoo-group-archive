Nice to meet you.  I enjoyed your book quite\na bit.  Your chapter on NEAT was nice to read in\nconjunction with Ken&#39;s academic papers.  It helped\nflesh out the concepts and suggest some interesting\nalternate ways of implementing NEAT.\n  \n&gt; It took me a while to get here -- I&#39;ve just moved to\n&gt; India and my \n&gt; internet connection is poor -- but I&#39;m looking\n&gt; forward to some \n&gt; interesting discussions.\n&gt; \n&gt; This Yahoo forum is proving a little tedious to\n&gt; browse, would you \n&gt; guys be interested in me setting up a dedicated NEAT\n&gt; forum at my \n&gt; website (ai-junkie.com)?\n\nSorry to hear about your poor connection (I lived for\ntwo years in Japan on a laptop with\ndial-up...excruciatingly slow).\n\nThanks for the offer of setting up a NEAT forum on\nyour website, but personally I&#39;d prefer this\nlist/group as the primary forum...we just got settled\nin. :)\n\nYou&#39;re set up for individual e-mails, which should all\nbe text, and there&#39;s also the &quot;daily digest&quot; option in\nYahoo Groups that let&#39;s you receive all the e-mails\nfrom a given day in a single mailing.  Sounds like\nyour primary concern is browsing the archives.  If\nyou&#39;re on a dial-up, I&#39;d suggest disabling &quot;Load\nImages&quot; in your browser anyway, which should make it\neasier...besides, we don&#39;t have that many messages\narchived yet anyway. :)\n\nAnyway, thanks for joining the list.  I&#39;m interested\nin hearing your perspective on various issues\nregarding NEAT, and I hope technical difficulties\ndon&#39;t make things unmanageable for you.\n\nDerek \n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
