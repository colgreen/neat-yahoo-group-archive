It&#39;s also a great example of what I was talking about in my previous =\r\ncomment in response to Ken. First, I&#39;ll answer your question.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nThanks=\r\n. I&#39;m glad you found it interesting. \n\n&gt; &gt; I won&#39;t take any criticism of ou=\r\nr paper personally. I just think that sometimes arguments are more informat=\r\nive when there is a specific example to be discussed, instead of remaining =\r\nentirely abstract. I also think this paper is a nice example of a technique=\r\n that can&#39;t be quantified in an informative way, yet remains an interesting=\r\n contribution. If you were our reviewer, would you insist upon a quantitati=\r\nve comparison for this paper? How would you recommend such a test be made? =\r\nDo you agree that we should encourage reviewers to reject such papers, or t=\r\nhat we should work to encourage reviewers to consider such papers?\n&gt; \n&gt; I a=\r\ngree that it&#39;s hard to quantify the results in this paper because the resul=\r\nt is &quot;yup, it worked in my system.&quot; At this point, the best you could&#39;ve do=\r\nne was (as you mentioned) compared it to how closely targeted evolution get=\r\ns to the desired target. Since you have a measure of how &quot;close&quot; the phenot=\r\nype is to the target phenotype (distanceFromSurface), you can quantify the =\r\ndistance from the desired target that each method achieves. Of course, each=\r\n method would need to be run in replicate at least 30 times to get a reason=\r\nable mean and 95% confidence interval.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nBut we already know the resul=\r\nt of that experiment. Ken has shown that target-based evolution doesn&#39;t wor=\r\nk, so the error for target-based evolution will be non-zero (and likely lar=\r\nge). But (as we mention in the paper) the error in our method can be tuned =\r\ntoward zero by increasing the resolution of the workspace, so the error for=\r\n the Seeded-CPPN technique effectively is zero. Thus, we know ahead of time=\r\n that our method won&#39;t produce error. The only uncertainty is how bad targe=\r\nt based evolution would be, but that is not the focus of this paper, so the=\r\n experiment would be off-topic. In other words, we introduce a technique th=\r\nat eliminates the issue of error, since it skips right to the correct shape=\r\n=85to compare it against an obviously bad technique that we know produces e=\r\nrror would only be to satisfy reviewers that insist on quantification; it d=\r\noes not address a broader hypothesis, no?\n\n&gt; Some more comments about the p=\r\naper:\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s what I got from the paper: You wanted to create a method =\r\nto seed a 3D object generator with a predetermined 3D object. You devised a=\r\n method to enable this feature based on CPPNs. You showed that it works pre=\r\ntty well and matches the desired object on EndlessForms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Notice how ea=\r\nch sentence narrows the relevant audience down more and more. The question =\r\nwent from &quot;How do I seed a 3D object generator with a predetermined object?=\r\n&quot; to &quot;How do I seed a 3D object generator based on CPPNs with a predetermin=\r\ned object?&quot; to &quot;How do I seed my 3D object generator based on CPPNs, Endles=\r\nsForms, with a predetermined object?&quot;\n&gt; \nThe last statement is too narrow. =\r\nWhile we used some examples from EndlessForms, we also used many example ob=\r\njects from Thingiverse that were not produced on EndlessForms and show that=\r\n the Seeded-CPPN technique works for any object. I&#39;d argue that we actually=\r\n answered the first, broadest question as well: one answer to how to seed a=\r\n 3D object generator with a predetermined object is to use the Seeded-CPPN =\r\ntechnique. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say I had my own 3D object generating website, Unli=\r\nmitedForms, but it was based on regular ANNs. What could I take from this p=\r\naper?\n&gt; \nYou would know that you could seed objects if you switch to CPPNs =\r\nand use the Seeded-CPPN technique. That sounds cheeky (sorry, I&#39;m in the UK=\r\n at the moment), but I think it is the honest answer to your question. I do=\r\nn&#39;t think that&#39;s a narrow answer, either: in your current system what you w=\r\nant has not been invented, and may not be possible, but this paper shows an=\r\n alternative technique that can accomplish the goal. \n\n&gt; Or what if I was o=\r\nnly interested in 2D pictures, but still wanted to seed them similarly? Or =\r\nwhat if I have no interest in evolving 2D/3D objects at all, but want to kn=\r\now clever methods for seeding a GA with a predetermined phenotype? These ar=\r\ne all important points to consider when presenting a new method, especially=\r\n because everyone has their own pet method that they like to use.\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou did the work discussed in Section 4B for this paper, you would have a mu=\r\nch easier time quantifying the results. You also would&#39;ve gotten at a much =\r\nmore broadly interesting question about evolvability while simultaneously p=\r\nresenting your new technique.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nAgreed. Any paper would be stronger if =\r\nit also did its Future Work section. In fact, a lot of the reviewers were u=\r\npset that so much time in the paper was spent discussing the future work th=\r\nat this technique enables. But I believe that&#39;s often precisely what makes =\r\nnew techniques interesting: the possibilities they enable. There is always =\r\na tension between doing the future work, or just mentioning that it can be =\r\ndone. For a conference paper, I think it is fine to publish a smaller packa=\r\nge of work and point to future possible work. But I&#39;d like to point out tha=\r\nt whether there is enough work in this paper is orthogonal to the quantitat=\r\nive vs. qualitative discussion. Quite a bit of the future evolvability work=\r\n would also be qualitative. One could say &quot;you should have done the quantit=\r\native portions of the future work, because then you&#39;d at least have somethi=\r\nng quantitive.&quot; That&#39;s clearly the prudent strategy given that some reviewe=\r\nrs won&#39;t accept a paper unless it has a few quantitative comparisons, but t=\r\nhis discussion is about whether that demand for some quantitative compariso=\r\nn should be the prevailing attitude. There&#39;s plenty of work in this area th=\r\nat won&#39;t be quantifiable=85.and saying that it has to be packaged with some=\r\nthing quantitative shows that we have a bizarre &quot;checkbox rule&quot; for papers:=\r\n you can publish something qualitative and interesting, but only if you als=\r\no pair it with some quantifiable metric so you check the quantitative box. =\r\nIf the qualitative work is inadmissible as science, as the GECCO reviewer f=\r\nor this paper claimed, then it shouldn&#39;t be publishable even as a sub-secti=\r\non of a paper. And if it is admissible, then it should be able to be publis=\r\nhable on its own (if there is enough of such qualitative work to be a publi=\r\nshable unit).  \n\n&gt; Also, given that this is a methods paper, I&#39;m surprised =\r\nthe methods section is so short. The new technique that you introduced in t=\r\nhis paper (Section 2C) only received about 2/3 page of text, and no figures=\r\n dedicated to it. From my first two reads through that section, I still don=\r\n&#39;t completely understand how the method works. I would say that that would =\r\nbe the critical section of the paper for readers to understand if they were=\r\n to use your technique, worthy of at least one figure and more detailed exp=\r\nlanation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nI&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t make it clear to you. Of course, that i=\r\nssue is also orthogonal to the quantitative vs. qualitative conversation, b=\r\nut it is something I would like to address. Can you tell me what questions =\r\nyou have? I&#39;d be happy to try to answer them in this thread. If anyone read=\r\ning this also has questions about the technique, please let me know. \n\nThan=\r\nks for the fascinating conversation.

That pap=\r\ner was recently accepted at CEC. I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on=\r\n this paper in light of our conversation now that you can see the specific =\r\npaper that was rejected. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d be especially interested to hear fro=\r\nm those of you who argued that non-quantitative papers should be rejected (=\r\nor, at least, should have a much higher threshold to gain acceptance). Obvi=\r\nously I think this paper is interesting and will benefit the scientific com=\r\nmunity, partly because it suggests new ideas (though it can&#39;t quantify all =\r\nof them yet). Do you think our field is better off barring such papers beca=\r\nuse they can&#39;t quantitatively &quot;prove&quot; they are better than some alternate a=\r\nlgorithm in some way? Of course I&#39;m not advocating that all papers should l=\r\nack quantitative results; just that we should not rule out such papers if t=\r\nhey don&#39;t have statistical comparisons. I do want to stress that I always i=\r\nnclude--and as a reviewer, insist upon--a statistical test with a p-value *=\r\nif* a quantitative claim is made, but that policy is not inconsistent with =\r\nthe view that many interesting, subjective, qualitative observations are sc=\r\nientifically worthwhile too. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I won&#39;t take any criticism of our pa=\r\nper personally.

You also would&#39;ve gotten at a much more broadly interesting qu=\r\nestion about evolvability while simultaneously presenting your new techniqu=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agreed. Any paper =\r\nwould be stronger if it also did its Future Work section. In fact, a lot of=\r\n the reviewers were upset that so much time in the paper was spent discussi=\r\nng the future work that this technique enables. But I believe that&#39;s often =\r\nprecisely what makes new techniques interesting: the possibilities they ena=\r\nble. There is always a tension between doing the future work, or just menti=\r\noning that it can be done. For a conference paper, I think it is fine to pu=\r\nblish a smaller package of work and point to future possible work. But I&#39;d =\r\nlike to point out that whether there is enough work in this paper is orthog=\r\nonal to the quantitative vs. qualitative discussion. Quite a bit of the fut=\r\nure evolvability work would also be qualitative. One could say &quot;you should =\r\nhave done the quantitative portions of the future work, because then you&#39;d =\r\nat least have something quantitive.&quot; That&#39;s clearly the prudent strategy gi=\r\nven that some reviewers won&#39;t accept a paper unless it has a few quantitati=\r\nve comparisons, but this discussion is about whether that demand for some q=\r\nuantitative comparison should be the prevailing attitude. There&#39;s plenty of=\r\n work in this area that won&#39;t be quantifiable=85.and saying that it has to =\r\nbe packaged with something quantitative shows that we have a bizarre &quot;check=\r\nbox rule&quot; for papers: you can publish something qualitative and interesting=\r\n, but only if you also pair it with some quantifiable metric so you check t=\r\nhe quantitative box. If the qualitative work is inadmissible as science, as=\r\n the GECCO reviewer for this paper claimed, then it shouldn&#39;t be publishabl=\r\ne even as a sub-section of a paper. And if it is admissible, then it should=\r\n be able to be publishable on its own (if there is enough of such qualitati=\r\nve work to be a publishable unit). &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote t=\r\nype=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position: =\r\nstatic; z-index: auto; &quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nAlso=\r\n, given that this is a methods paper, I&#39;m surprised the methods section is =\r\nso short. The new technique that you introduced in this paper (Section 2C) =\r\nonly received about 2/3 page of text, and no figures dedicated to it. From =\r\nmy first two reads through that section, I still don&#39;t completely understan=\r\nd how the method works. I would say that that would be the critical section=\r\n of the paper for readers to understand if they were to use your technique,=\r\n worthy of at least one figure and more detailed explanation.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t make it clear =\r\nto you. Of course, that issue is also orthogonal to the quantitative vs. qu=\r\nalitative conversation, but it is something I would like to address. Can yo=\r\nu tell me what questions you have? I&#39;d be happy to try to answer them in th=\r\nis thread. If anyone reading this also has questions about the technique, p=\r\nlease let me know.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for the fascinatin=\r\ng conversation. I am enjoying it! I appreciate you voicing your constructiv=\r\ne criticisms of the paper.

That paper was recently accepted at CEC. =\r\nI&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on this paper in light of our conve=\r\nrsation now that you can see the specific paper that was rejected. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d be especially interested to hear from those of you who argu=\r\ned that non-quantitative papers should be rejected (or, at least, should ha=\r\nve a much higher threshold to gain acceptance). Obviously I think this pape=\r\nr is interesting and will benefit the scientific community, partly because =\r\nit suggests new ideas (though it can&#39;t quantify all of them yet). Do you th=\r\nink our field is better off barring such papers because they can&#39;t quantita=\r\ntively &quot;prove&quot; they are better than some alternate algorithm in some way? O=\r\nf course I&#39;m not advocating that all papers should lack quantitative result=\r\ns; just that we should not rule out such papers if they don&#39;t have statisti=\r\ncal comparisons. I do want to stress that I always include--and as a review=\r\ner, insist upon--a statistical test with a p-value *if* a quantitative clai=\r\nm is made, but that policy is not inconsistent with the view that many inte=\r\nresting, subjective, qualitative observations are scientifically worthwhile=\r\n too. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I won&#39;t take any criticism of our paper personall=\r\ny. I just think that sometimes arguments are more informative when there is=\r\n a specific example to be discussed, instead of remaining entirely abstract=\r\n. I also think this paper is a nice example of a technique that can&#39;t be qu=\r\nantified in an informative way, yet remains an interesting contribution. If=\r\n you were our reviewer, would you insist upon a quantitative comparison for=\r\n this paper? How would you recommend such a test be made? Do you agree that=\r\n we should encourage reviewers to reject such papers, or that we should wor=\r\nk to encourage reviewers to consider such papers?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Here i=\r\ns the cite and PDF: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Clune J, Chen A, Lipson H (2013) Up=\r\nload Any Object and Evolve it: Injecting Complex Geometric Patterns into CP=\r\nPNs for Further Evolution.
