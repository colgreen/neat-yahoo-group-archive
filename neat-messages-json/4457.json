So far i came up with a few, I&#39;d say less complex problems\n&gt; for testing.\n&gt; So far I got the following:\n&gt; - XOR, (a xor b) and (c xor d)\n&gt; - Pole Balancing\n&gt; - Obstacle Navigator\n&gt; - Khepera Robot Simulator\n&gt; - two spiral classification\n&gt; - mathematical function approximation\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have some more complex problems which can be evaluated in\n&gt; bearable time on a dual core, maybe something involving ODE.\n&gt;\n&gt; Robin\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
