And ANJI is solving them fine,\nwith both Ken&#39;s mu=\r\ntation operators and with ours.  We haven&#39;t quite\nimplemented the No Wiggli=\r\nng penalty, but are about to do that.\n\nOne question we had was this: Were a=\r\nll experiments with double pole\nbalancing started from the same, determinis=\r\ntic state?  That is, with\none pole at 0 degrees (upright), and the other le=\r\naning at exactly 1\ndegree?\n\nSince we hadn&#39;t implemented the domain before, =\r\nwe hadn&#39;t really\nthought about it much, but wouldn&#39;t it be fairly easy to s=\r\ncale up the\ndifficulty of this domain by randomizing the initial starting\nc=\r\nonditions?  That is, have the poles start at random initial\npositions?\n\nIf =\r\nwe&#39;re evolving a controller, this thing would be extremely brittle\nif it on=\r\nly learned to balance poles from a single starting position,\nwouldn&#39;t it?\n\n=\r\nBy extension, the initial cart position could also be randomized.  The\ncont=\r\nrollers could be given a small amount of noise.  There could also\nbe &quot;wind&quot;=\r\n or some other sort of noise added to the system to scale up\ndifficulty.\n\nI=\r\ns anyone aware of this being done with any of the previous pole\nbalancing w=\r\nork?  If not, why?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
