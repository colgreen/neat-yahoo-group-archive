These interpolations you have listed here are generally for\n&gt; interpolation between pixels when zooming in*.  Zooming-out most commonly\n&gt; works by averaging pixels in an area.  I would not normally think of it as\n&gt; expensive, but I guess it depends whether you have to recalculate it over\n&gt; and over...\n\nWell, &quot;zooming in&quot; and &quot;zooming out&quot; can be a little misleading...what\nwe&#39;re basically doing is interpreting a 100x100 image as input for a\n5x5 retina.  Call it what you will.\n\n&gt; Why is averaging too expensive?\n\nIt is more expensive to average all the pixel values in a 20x20 area\nthan to take, for example, the value of the upper-leftmost pixel. \nHere is the Kato/Floreano paper:\n\nhttp://asl.epfl.ch/abstract.php?ID=24\n\nIt has nice figures visually demonstrating what I&#39;m referring to.\n\n&gt; How about providing the net with Min(area) and Max(area)?  When you get\n&gt; down to a single pixel, they are the same.  Is the area always\n&gt; square?  (and it so, why? :)  \n\nYes, the images are square, and the viewable area is always square\nbecause the shape of the eye is square.\n\n&gt; Is it axis aligned?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n&gt; Counterintuitive at first, yes, but since the network is learning the\n&gt; sampling system...\n\nBut what I&#39;m saying is that there are performance difference *between*\nsampling systems.  Each network is adapting to the sampling system\nused, but some are easier to learn than others, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m\ninquiring about.  I would expect that an area averaging sampling\nscheme would perform better than nearest neighbor, but that doesn&#39;t\nseem to be the case.\n\nAnyway, here is a graphic of an image, and how the different sampling\nschemes interpret the image:\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=Interpolation+Demo.gif&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
