In other words, evolving for adaptive behavior =\r\nand synaptic plasticity is inherently deceptive.  Because novelty search is=\r\n hypothesized to effectively avoid deception, the potential is there for a =\r\npowerful combination.  The results indeed show that novelty search is immun=\r\ne to deception in the target domain (with respect to desired performance). =\r\n \n\nMore generally, this paper increases the body of evidence supporting the=\r\n counter-intuitive hypothesis behind novelty search that it is often more e=\r\nffective to ignore improvement in objective fitness than to select for it. =\r\n \n\nWe are hoping that this work inspires more research in evolving adaptive=\r\n (i.e. plastic) neural networks by offering a new tool to make it work more=\r\n effectively without worrying about non-adaptive (i.e. static) behavior dec=\r\neiving the fitness function.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
