So would you say that both the id and \nthe &#39;recurrent&#39; \n&gt; flag can be considered optional? Sorry to seem pedantic on this \none but \n&gt; I want to be 100% sure we&#39;re all undestanding each other.\n\nNo problem. :)\n\nAs far as converting to SVG, no the id is *not* optional.  In order \nto associate other graphical attributes to a connection (such as its \ncorresponding weight), it needs to have a unique identifier.\n\nI cannot create one dynamically because XSL does not allow for the \nupdating of variables, so it needs to be explicit in the XML.\n\nAs far as the recurrency tag, that could be considered optional for \ngraphical representation (as you say, you&#39;ll just get all black \nconnections), but it is necessary for determining how the network \nfunctions.  \n\nNow would probably be a good time to hash out what we mean when we \nuse the term &quot;recurrent&quot;. :)  \n\nIn terms of our implementation (and I believe Ken&#39;s) any connection \nwhich creates a loop, including self-connections, is considered \nrecurrent. \n\nWe probably do need a way to represent different functionality (yes, \nthe fact that all of your connections have a memory, and combine the \noutput from the previous timestep with the current one, works a bit \ndifferently than the standard NEAT network...someone correct me if \nI&#39;m wrong here).\n\n&gt; If the recuurency flag is an integral part of the network&#39;s \noperation \n&gt; then yes I agree.\n\nYeah, I pretty much think it is, though again, we probably need to \nhash out a clear common usage of the term.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
