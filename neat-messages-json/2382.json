I suppose if e.g. some neuron is acting as a feature \ndetector but we can&#39;t re-use its output in some neurons just because \nit&#39;s depth value is too high, then that does sound quite limiting.\n\n&gt;That&#39;s right, but I thought I had a scheme which sorted this, give me \n&gt;a while to think it through....\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMy instinct here is that any such technique will tend towards a time \ncomplexity similar to the algorithm that just searches for \nrecursiveness. I&#39;ll be glad to be proved wrong though.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
