I think\nI&#39;ve got a better handle on it now. :)\n\nI still have a few questions though.\n\n&gt; The cat is red, the mouse is yellow.  The cat has 16 inputs:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0-3: Distance to walls in U,R,D,L\n&gt; 4-7: Proximity to mouse in U,R,D,L (-1.0 for no sight)\n\nSo are all your inputs between 0 and 1?  So for example, if the cat\nstarted in the center of the grid, it&#39;s input for distance to wall\nLeft would be 0.5?  And if the mouse were midway between the left wall\nand the cat starting out the input for distance to mouse would be\n0.25?\n\n&gt; 12-15: Measure of how long since walking on tiles in U,R,D,L\n\nI don&#39;t understand this set of inputs.\n \n&gt; The cat can only see through LOS.  There are five outputs of the cat:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 - Move Up\n&gt; 1 - Move Right\n&gt; 2 - Move Down\n&gt; 3 - Move Left\n&gt; 4 - Make Sound\n&gt; \n&gt; The sounds can be ignored at this point.  If no direction value is &gt;=\n&gt; 0.9 then the cat stays put.  Otherwise whichever direction value is\n&gt; highest, the cat goes that way.  This is processed every game tick.\n\nOkay, so the cat really is more like a radially symetrical robot...it\ncan see &quot;behind&quot; itself wihtout turning that way.  In fact, it doesn&#39;t\nneed to turn at all, correct?  It&#39;s got eyes in all four directions.\n\nAnd it doesn&#39;t have any forward momentum.  That is, it can sit still\nif it wants.  I would be interested to know how much time in failed\nexperiments, the cat spends stationary.\n\nAnd if I&#39;m understand the mouse movement in the experiments where the\nmouse moves, it&#39;s moves are entirely deterministic, usually limited,\nand alternated left or right.  So when the mouse reaches it&#39;s fixed\nnumber of moves, it sits still?  Maybe I missed it, but how much time\ndo you give the cat to find the mouse?\n \nSo is a &quot;tile&quot; an area equivalent to the size of each actor?\n\n\n&gt; D) Mouse goes out of sight (4 tiles max).  Mouse starts in an\n&gt; intersection (screenshot above) and on his first move will go out of\n&gt; sight from the cat.  With a 4 move maximum you will notice that the\n&gt; mouse will never be able to turn at another intersection.  The cat\n&gt; receives the direction vector of the mouse for the frame after it\n&gt; dissapeared (if he could see) but otherwise all he has is anything\n&gt; left in his memory.  Obviously for this test to be successful, some\n&gt; recurrent connections must be developed. \n\nHmm...I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s necessarily true, is it?  If I&#39;m\nunderstanding correctly, on the first time step, the cat has LOS to\nthe mouse, then the next time step the mouse goes out of sight, either\nto the right or the left.  Is that correct?\n\nSo if the cat headed in that direction on step two, and reached the\nintersection, the mouse would be in line of sight again, right?  I\nthink you are saying the mouse doesn&#39;t have enough movement to get out\nof LOS a second time.  I&#39;m not sure this behavior would require a\nrecurrent connections.  The initial sight of the mouse just has to\nkeep it moving in that direction until it gets line of sight again,\nright?\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only significant difference in behavior\ndesired is &quot;go in the direction the mouse *was*&quot; as opposed to &quot;go in\nthe direction the mouse *is*&quot;.  And the main difference in inputs is\nthat there is a constant input for mouse detection in the first ones,\nand only a single blip for input before the mouse ducks out of sight\nin the last.  Is this correct?\n\nI&#39;m thinking that maybe that single blip of an input may not be enough\nto drive the cat in that direction, especially with a complicated\nrecurrent network.\n\nI&#39;d be interested to see how a couple of variations might perform:\n\n1) Clamp movement for both agents (cat and mouse) for something like\n10 time steps, so that the cat is receiving direction and distance\ninput for the mouse for more than 1 time step.  Then &quot;let them go&quot;.  I\nwould be interested to see if the repeated input as opposed to a\nsingle glimpse of the mouse might make alter behavior.\n\n2) Explicitly feed in an input for last known direction.  At this\npoint it&#39;s not memorizing last position, but this might be a good\nintermediate step between C and D.  The mouse goes out of sight, but\nyou&#39;re still feeding a positive input for that direction.  I would be\ninterested to know how this performs too.\n\nAnyway, good luck no matter what you decide to do.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
