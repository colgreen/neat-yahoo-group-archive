In the one run I&#39;ve performed so far the chain grew to\n&gt;length 19 in about 6 hrs. Over a further 4 hrs max fitness increased 9\n&gt;times, but no new dominant genome was found.\n\nHow can this happen?  Isn&#39;t the only way max-fitness increases by finding a \ngenome that beats the whole of the previous chain?\n\n&gt;  Actually I didn&#39;t have time\n&gt;to get back to this run so it&#39;s been running for 2 days now and there\n&gt;have been no further improvements to date.\n&gt;\n&gt;Compared against a random player the best genome found rates as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;                          Win       Draw   Lose\n&gt;playing 1st         89.6%   5.2%   5.2%\n&gt;playing 2nd        81.0%   8.1%   10.9%\n&gt;------------\n&gt;overall               85.3%   6.65%  16.1%\n&gt;\n&gt;As a baseline two random players give the following win/draw/loose rates\n&gt;(showing that playing first is an advantage):\n&gt;\n&gt;   Win       Draw       Lose\n&gt;   58.3%   12.64%   29.0%\n&gt;\n&gt;Performance against a random player isn;t a brilliant metric but it&#39;s\n&gt;the best I have to hand. I&#39;m thinking of trying a combination of random\n&gt;and Derek & Philips &#39;best&#39; player strategy - alternating between the two\n&gt;strategies for each move. That way the player isn&#39;t unbeatable, isn&#39;t\n&gt;deterministic (always plays the same game!) but plays a better game than\n&gt;pure randomness.\n\nAs another option, I could give you some code that for any board and \nproposed move will tell you whether against a perfect minimax player that \nmove would lead to a win, lose or draw...\n\nOr maybe, using normalisation to reduce the number of boards, it would now \nbe possible to iterate over all possible games and just count the \nproportion of win/lose/draw.\n\n_IS_ it ever correct to count wins in TTT?  e.g. because you cannot win \nagainst  a perfect player, the best you can do is draw...\n\nI would certainly ponder for quite a long time before counting a win as \nbetter than a draw in a fitness function, because if you do that, you give \nplayers no incentive to sacrifice a win against one opponent, in order to \nstop losing against another -- when the first opponent will inevitably, in \nthe long term, eventually stop losing all on its own...\n\n&gt;Anyway the figures above are the best I&#39;ve seen so far from any of my\n&gt;recent TTT experiments. Also note that Derek & Philip reported these\n&gt;rates against a random player in their TTT paper:\n\nIf this is the best so far, why is it &quot;not brilliant&quot;?  Do you just mean in \nthe sense of you didn&#39;t find a perfect player yet?\n\n&gt;                          Win           Draw       Lose\n&gt;overall               75.88%     16.44%    7.68%\n&gt;\n&gt;This is more like the kind of figures I was seeing before, though\n&gt;perhaps not quite as good as this - maybe if you swap their draw and\n&gt;lose figrues around you&#39;ll something like my previous best. Playing the\n&gt;best network directly is not particularly impressive, often our champ\n&gt;doesn&#39;t take the opportunity to complete a winning line.\n&gt;\n&gt;So unless I&#39;ve overlooked some bug it seems to me that my TT search has\n&gt;got stuck in a rut. This isn&#39;t surprising really since I evaluate\n&gt;againat a dominance chain that represents just 19 strategies, all or\n&gt;most of which are probably what Ken termed alien strategies, as far as\n&gt;it&#39;s possible to have an alien strategy in TTT! After all it is a pretty\n&gt;simple game.\n\nYou could also try probing the relationship between a player and a \ndominance-chain entry more deeply...\n\ne.g. you start with an empty board, which means there is only one game they \ncan play against each other...\n\nOn the other hand, if you made the first two moves for them, you can force \nthem to play errr, I think its 12 different games...\n\n&gt;Directions then are to try more traditional co-ev techniques, I only\n&gt;used a dominance chain because it seemed like a nice solution and was\n&gt;easy to implement. oh and maybe implementing dead spots in the fitnes\n&gt;space as discussed recently.\n\nI must have missed that discussion?  Or &quot;dead spots&quot; something I know under \na different name?\n\nw.r.t fitness functions.  I&#39;ve been actively, if slowly working on evolving \nTTT for a week now.  My technique is a bit different from yours.  Can we \ncome up with a way to compare my progress against yours?\n\n&gt;Colin\n\nIan\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
