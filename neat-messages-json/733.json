However I though some might like to see \nthe various improvements as they stand today...\n\n - Marked improvement on single-pole search. In fact it&#39;s quite normal \nto see perfect solutions within the initial population! This is mainly \ndue to using fully connected networks in the initial population. I \ndiscussed this with Ken and this is was also seen in his experiment&#39;s. \nThe connection weight mutation has also been refined.\n\n - New double-pole-balancing and double-pole-without-velocity-input \nexperiments.\n\n - Updated the pole balancing simulator to show force acting on cart and \nsupport double-pole experiment.\n\nZipped source code and .Net binaries here: http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/\n\nOne thing I&#39;m just playing with now is an alternative fitness scheme to \nprevent the double-pole-without-velocity problem being solved by quickly \nwiggling the poles, as described in &quot;Efficient Reinforcement Learning \nthrough Evolving Neural Network Topologies&quot; (Ken and Risto \nMiikkulainen). This is in the released code/binaries but I haven&#39;t had \nchance to experiment with this yet, I did a quick run and it still \nevolved &#39;wiggling&#39; solutions.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
