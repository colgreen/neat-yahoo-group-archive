The \n&gt; program is also\n&gt; &gt;  using alpha-beta and the like. I&#39;ll bet a rather poor position evaluator\n&gt; &gt;  plus Alpha-Beta with a decent amount of lookahead could beat me at\n&gt; &gt; checkers, even if I was better at evaluating board positions on average.\n&gt;\n&gt;Good point, Jeff. This was one of my big problems with Blondie24\n&gt;(although to the author&#39;s credit, he did address the issue, along with\n&gt;many other objections). The question is the amount of work being done\n&gt;by the ANN vs. the brute-force approach of tree search. The Blondie24\n&gt;network did better than a crude board estimation such as simply\n&gt;counting the number of opponent and friendly pieces on the board, but\n&gt;not a whole lot better.\n\nHi,\n\nSo how about using a search pruning method but evolve a separate \nnetwork(s) to make decisions about when to prune.\n\nThat feels to me a bit like how I play games, mentally doing a bit of \nlook ahead and then deciding whether to do more look ahead according \nto what I&#39;ve found.  But not necessarily using exactly the same \nheuristics for shallow and deep evaluation...\n\nOf course, that might leave you with a need to do more than assess \nsingle boards.  e.g. if I&#39;ve looked ahead to several very different \nsituations, I probably want to do some sort of general comparison of \nthe broad situations before picking one or two to concentrate \non.  OTOH, maybe the brute-force of a computer approach can \ncompensate for that and still be a bit more like natural thought.\n\nThis isn&#39;t have expert players play, of course...\n\nIan\n\nOh, b.t.w. great paper Ken and Jason... \n\n\n"}}
