But this solution has the \ndrawback to increase very quickl=\r\ny the distance between two genome.\n\nThe benefits of adding this kind of mut=\r\nation may be not worth the \nprice of the inherent complexity it adds.\n\nRega=\r\nrds,\nGreg.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Greg, welcome to the group.  I believe it would be okay to le=\r\nt\n&gt; activation functions inside nodes mutate, but if that is done I \nwould\n=\r\n&gt; not change the neuron to a neuron with a different innovation \nnumber.\n&gt; =\r\n That would not work well for NEAT because it would mean that the \nsame\n&gt; c=\r\nonnection connects to more than one neuron (i.e. in some cases the\n&gt; origin=\r\nal neuron and in some cases the new neuron), which means that\n&gt; the actual =\r\nnetwork structure becomes ambiguous e.g. during mating of\n&gt; such individual=\r\ns.    \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I understand the motivation for your suggestion, but I=\r\n am\n&gt; guessing if the chance of mutation is low enough it will not be all\n&gt;=\r\n that destructive to simply mutate the functions while leaving the\n&gt; innova=\r\ntion numbers for their respective nodes unchanged.  \n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, I wou=\r\nld consider this issue an implementation detail, so\n&gt; it is not necessarily=\r\n an &quot;official&quot; part of the HyperNEAT system \nthat\n&gt; it does or does not mut=\r\nate the activation functions of\n&gt; already-existing nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;godin.gregory&quot; &lt;godin.gregory@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; H=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First off, let me introduce myself.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a french developper=\r\n working in IT software compagny \ncompletely \n&gt; &gt; non related to IA. Well a=\r\nctually, I&#39;m a complete newbie \nconcerning \n&gt; &gt; IA ;).\n&gt; &gt; Few times ago, I=\r\n started a personnal project that aims to evolve \nANN \n&gt; &gt; with genetic pro=\r\ngramming for a simple food gathering problem. I \n&gt; &gt; discovered NEAT and Hy=\r\nperNeat (and this group) by googleing the \n&gt; &gt; subject.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m still readi=\r\nng the litterature, and I sometimes do have hard \ntime \n&gt; &gt; to fully unders=\r\ntand the whole picture.\n&gt; &gt; (Btw, sorry for my poor english, I read a lot i=\r\nn english but I \nalmost \n&gt; &gt; never write/spoke, and thus I&#39;m just loosing m=\r\ny skills over time.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My question is quite simple. After a quick lo=\r\nok on HyperNeat \npackage, \n&gt; &gt; I saw there is no mutation that shift the ac=\r\ntivation function of \nCPNN.\n&gt; &gt; So I was wondering if this mutation could b=\r\ne relevant, and if \nNeat \n&gt; &gt; can handle this kind of mutation?\n&gt; &gt; I think=\r\n it could be done by simply disabling the neuron and add a \nnew \n&gt; &gt; neuron=\r\n with the same name but with a different innovation number.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Greg.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PS: My apologies if the question is just stupid ;)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
