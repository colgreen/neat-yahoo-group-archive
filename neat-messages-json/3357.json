What is causing \nthem to g=\r\net zero fitness?\n\nOf course the fitness function in this domain can be tric=\r\nky since \nwhat you want to encourage is balance, which is not necesarily al=\r\nways \ncorrelated to duration standing (e.g. when someone is flailing \naroun=\r\nd).\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervensk=\r\ni@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Attachment(not stored)&quot; :(\n&gt; \n&gt; This is beginning to pis=\r\ns me off.
