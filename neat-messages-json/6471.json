The position is at Inria Nancy (East of France).\n\nThe selected=\r\n PhD student will work in the ERC project ResiBots (funded by the European =\r\nResearch Commission). The overall goal of the project is to develop novel l=\r\nearning algorithms that make it possible for autonomous robots to quickly d=\r\niscover compensatory behaviors when they are damaged (e.g. a broken motor) =\r\nor when they encounter an unforeseen situation. \n\nThe technique that we wil=\r\nl use is based on MAP-Elites (an evolutionary algorithm), Bayesian optimiza=\r\ntion (a model-based optimization algorithm), and possibly some neuro-evolut=\r\nion.\n\nDemonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dp6oegqDrCDs\nSee also=\r\n: http://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret\n\nThe deadline for application is the fi=\r\nrst of June!\n\nDetails and application form: http://t.co/d4q3bJOnL8\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\n=97 Jean-Baptiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/\n\n\n"}}
