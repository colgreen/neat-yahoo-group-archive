Have you seen &quot;Morph Lab?&quot;  I think it&#39;s basically what \nDawkins did:\n\nhttp://alife.fusebox.com/morph_lab.html\n\nYou can play with it yourself there.\n\nOf course these kinds of apps are limited by their very greedy \nsingle-user evaluation wherein a user rewards only one organism in \nthe entire population for each generation.\n\nIt&#39;s interesting to speculate how it would be possible to have a \nmore sophisticated speciated/NEAT-style evolutionary system yet \nstill with interactive input.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Thu, 10 Jun 2004 16:02:45 -0000, Philip Tucker &lt;ptucker@g...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;d pretty much have to have interaction with humans for the\n&gt; &gt; fitness function, right?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I think it would be interesting to have a website where people\n&gt; could visit, which would load up two ANN-controlled faces.  The \nuser\n&gt; could be asked to observe each face for a set amount of time \n(e.g., 30\n&gt; seconds), and choose the one that looked &quot;more natural&quot;.  Success\n&gt; would be contingent upon lots of traffic, but it would be an\n&gt; interesting fitness function.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m reminded of Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, I \nthink. \n&gt; He uses himself as the fitness function for evolving digital \nimages of\n&gt; creatures, like wasps.  The computer just initially created random\n&gt; bitmap pictures, like 100x100.  He would pick the ones that &quot;looked\n&gt; more like a wasp&quot;, and they would then survive and mutate.  \nEventually\n&gt; he got bitmaps that looked like a whole lot like wasps.  (I could \nbe\n&gt; butchering the explanation...it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read\n&gt; that bit...)\n&gt; \n&gt; But the concept of using human judgment as a fitness function is \nstill\n&gt; interesting and valid, I would think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
