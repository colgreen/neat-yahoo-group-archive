The =\r\nCPNN\nis used to exploit the geometric information in HyperNeat, but if this=\r\n\nis not relevant to a domain, such as stock trading, how do you get it\nto e=\r\nncode the substrate in a meaningful way? \n\nBe great to further this discuss=\r\nion.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are other benefits to HyperNEAT that have nothing to do with=\r\n\ngeometry,\n&gt; no? It is an indirect encoding, and thus is more likely to cre=\r\nate\nmodular\n&gt; phenotypes that exhibit repetitions and symmetry (with and wi=\r\nthout\n&gt; variation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Unless I am mistaken, these benefits can cause Hyp=\r\nerNEAT to\noutperform NEAT\n&gt; even on problems where geometry is not being ex=\r\nploited.

Unless you\n&gt; &gt; believe th=\r\nere is some geometric regularities in those time series\n&gt; &gt; there is no poi=\r\nnt to use HyperNEAT. Try regular NEAT first.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Todd Owen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; My goal is to evolve a s=\r\ntock trader.  The inputs are various\n&gt; &gt; technical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; indicators, but I l=\r\nike the output to indicate five states--Buy/Sell\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (going long), Short/C=\r\nover (going short), and do nothing.  Ideally,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; each signal would be a 1=\r\n or 0 (all zeros indicates to do nothing\n&gt; &gt; (i.e.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; keep current positi=\r\non - long, short, or out).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Is this best framed as a classific=\r\nation problem (now is a good\n&gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to buy, sell, short, cover), or =\r\nwould some type of 0-1 analog output\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be best (meaning buy when buy is =\r\n&gt; sell by 0.2 or something)?  How\n&gt; &gt; do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you force a binary output in =\r\nthe software anyway?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Should I try to predict the percentage c=\r\nhange (up or down) over\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; next n time periods, and then only buy=\r\n or sell when there is say a\n&gt; &gt; 3%\n&gt; &gt;&gt; change from now?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. whe=\r\nn recurrence evolves in NEAT, does it look back only 1 time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; period, or=\r\n can it evolve longer lookbacks?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; --Thanks, Todd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
