So far the \nbasic\n&gt; system is complete, but I&#39;m missing a lot of the nicer data vis and\n&gt; recording features. Hopefully the system is extensible enough that \nI can\n&gt; easily leverage some of the XML vis work going on here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Joseph Reisinger\n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n\n"}}
