So it&#39;s useful to search for \nthat in addition to &quot;leaky integrator=\r\n neuron.&quot;  Floreano has a good \npaper on them with implementation equations=\r\n.  My dissertation also \ncontains leaky integrator equations in its discuss=\r\nion section in the \nback.  There is also actually a modified version of my =\r\nNEAT code in \nthe files section of this group by Tyler Streeter that evolve=\r\ns leaky \nintegrator networks from a few years ago.  (He used it to evolve \n=\r\nwalking gaits)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just have a general neural network question:\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a=\r\n general term for artificial neurons that have residual \noutput in\n&gt; the ab=\r\nsence of new input?
