Therefore, when\nthe outputs are derivatives of the inputs, the network corresponds\ndirectly to the ODEs, i.e. the network has the mathematical form of a\ncoupled oscillator.  I suggested using angular velocities as network\noutputs to take advantage of this mathematical formalism.  I thought\nsome more about whether we would still have similar advantages if the\nnetwork outputs desired angles instead of angular velocities.  It\nturns out that such a network represents an approximation of the ODEs.\nTo elaborate, let us write the derivatives in discrete form.  For\nexample,\n\n  .\n  x = F(x)\n\nbecomes\n\n  (x_(n+1) - x_n)/(t_(n+1) - t_n) = F(x_n)\n\nfor the nth time step.  For constant step size, we can rewrite it as\n\n  x_(n+1) = G(x_n)\n\nWe can represent such equations using a network that takes the current\njoint angle as input and produces the desired angle for the next time\nstep as output.  So such a network should work as an approximation of\nthe coupled oscillator system.  I will run some experiments to find\nout how well this approximation works in practice.\n\nVinod\n\n\nAt Fri, 27 Feb 2009 02:13:44 -0000,\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Vinod, thanks for the detailed reply; it was very informative.  One\n&gt; issue on which I am still unclear is why it is important that the\n&gt; outputs be derivatives?  Why do you say that that is critical?  For\n&gt; example, if I had a system that took angle as input and output desired\n&gt; angle (like Jeff&#39;s), could not such a system form coupled oscillators\n&gt; just as well?  If not, what makes it more effective when outputs are\n&gt; desired velocities?  Is it simply that velocities require less\n&gt; accuracy to express than target angles?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vinod K.

What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to be considered a coupled non-linear oscillators?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken!  The coupling here means that the oscillators influence each\n&gt; &gt; other&#39;s behavior.  Let me use the term &quot;coupled cell system&quot; to be\n&gt; &gt; more precise.  A coupled cell system is a collection of cells, where\n&gt; &gt; each cell i is a dynamical system with state x_i.  If cell i is\n&gt; &gt; coupled to another cell j, then it means that the state of cell i\n&gt; &gt; depends on the state of cell j.  Such a system is represented by a\n&gt; &gt; system of ODEs.  For example, the ODEs for a system with two cells\n&gt; &gt; that are coupled to each other can be written as follows:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    .\n&gt; &gt;    x_1 = F_1(x_1, x_2)   ........ cell 1\n&gt; &gt;    .\n&gt; &gt;    x_2 = F_2(x_2, x_1)   ........ cell 2\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The LHS of the above ODEs represent the time derivatives of the state\n&gt; &gt; variables, and the functions F_1 and F_2 represent the internal\n&gt; &gt; dynamics of the cells.  The linearity or non-linearity of the system\n&gt; &gt; is determined by the nature of F_1 and F_2.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The term &quot;cell&quot; is used instead of &quot;oscillator&quot; in the above\n&gt; &gt; terminology because it is not necessary for individual cells to be\n&gt; &gt; capable of producing oscillations.  However, the coupled cell system\n&gt; &gt; as a whole can display oscillatory behaviors.  More importantly,\n&gt; &gt; making some of the cells and couplings identical can constrain the\n&gt; &gt; cells to oscillate synchronously or with constant phase relations with\n&gt; &gt; each other, a property that is useful for modeling gaits.  For\n&gt; &gt; example, making the cells and couplings identical in the above\n&gt; &gt; two-cell system results in F_1 = F_2 = F.  It is then possible to show\n&gt; &gt; that functions F exist for which solutions x_1 and x_2 of the system\n&gt; &gt; are periodic and half a period out of phase with each other (see [1]\n&gt; &gt; below for details).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gaits are produced by assigning these cells to control the legs of a\n&gt; &gt; robot.  But how do we find an appropriate function F?  In my GECCO\n&gt; &gt; paper, I found F by representing it as a neural network module and\n&gt; &gt; then evolving it.  That is, the coupled cell system is implemented as\n&gt; &gt; a neural network controller, where each network module represents one\n&gt; &gt; ODE of the system.  The state variables x_i are the leg joint angles.\n&gt; &gt; Thus the network takes joint angles as input and produces desired\n&gt; &gt; joint angular velocities as output.  This formalism has the following\n&gt; &gt; advantages:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   1. Theoretical understanding of the possible gaits.  Coupled cell\n&gt; &gt;      systems can be designed that model central pattern generators in\n&gt; &gt;      animals, producing symmetric, animal-like gaits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   2. Modularity: The coupled cell system I used for quadrupeds has\n&gt; &gt;      four identical cells/modules that differ only in the permutation\n&gt; &gt;      of inputs they receive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   3. Simple feed-forward neural network implementation, i.e. no need\n&gt; &gt;      for leaky integrators or recurrency.  Notice that the sigmoid\n&gt; &gt;      activation function of the neurons in the network provides any\n&gt; &gt;      necessary non-linearity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, I had to manually specify the modules and the permutation of\n&gt; &gt; inputs to each module. It would be cool if HyperNEAT can evolve that\n&gt; &gt; specification automatically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, I am assuming that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; part of a coupled non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate for the neurons to be non-leaky?  I guess I am curious why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; having a non-leaky neuron would be the most favorable choice in such a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model, or whether it is somehow a matter of definition.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Notice that my description above did not make any assumptions about\n&gt; &gt; leaky or non-leaky neurons.  Either type should be OK.  I used\n&gt; &gt; non-leaky neurons because they are simpler and sufficient.  I did not\n&gt; &gt; experiment with leaky neurons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, what are the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that would create this kind of system?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Essentially, the substrate needs to implement the ODEs of the coupled\n&gt; &gt; cell system, i.e. substrate outputs must be the time derivatives of\n&gt; &gt; its inputs.  This condition is satisfied if inputs are joint angles\n&gt; &gt; and outputs are desired angular velocities.  The minor adjustment to\n&gt; &gt; Jeff&#39;s substrate that I mentioned was to interpret outputs as desired\n&gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of desired angles.  In principle, inputs\n&gt; &gt; besides joint angles are also not necessary for generating gaits.\n&gt; &gt; However, the other inputs he used (roll, pitch, yaw, and touch) may be\n&gt; &gt; useful for more complex behaviors that require such additional sensory\n&gt; &gt; inputs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce oscillations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reliably, but I am not sure if that is actually anything different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from what you are describing or just another instance of the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomenon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I mentioned above, a coupled cell system is a dynamical system.\n&gt; &gt; Since networks of leaky neurons can approximate any dynamical system,\n&gt; &gt; you are right that it is another instance of the same phenomenon.\n&gt; &gt; However, the coupled cell system framework allows us to reason about\n&gt; &gt; the high level properties of the system such as synchronicity and\n&gt; &gt; phase relations that are useful for gait generation, producing the\n&gt; &gt; advantages I listed above.  As a result, evolutionary search can be\n&gt; &gt; biased to discover robust and effective gaits more easily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; References:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several papers by Stewart, Golubitsky and others on the\n&gt; &gt; theory of coupled cell systems and how they can be used to model\n&gt; &gt; animal gaits.

I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perform on this domain.  The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for\n&gt; last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With regard to the discussion about generating oscillations, I used\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neither sine wave as input nor leaky integrators.  Instead, neural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; network controllers with standard sigmoid neurons were\n&gt; modularized to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behave as coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems).  As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explained in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; post, such oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; periodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits.  They are easy to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and trot for quadrupeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With only minor adjustments to your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillators.  In\n&gt; fact,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you would get a configuration similar to my modular controllers by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint angles and\n&gt; producing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs.  HyperNEAT\n&gt; would then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand.  I think\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if successful would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.  BTW, did you find\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were\n&gt; necessary to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vinod\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
