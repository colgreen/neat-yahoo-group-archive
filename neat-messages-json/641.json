All you need to do \nis load the app, load a network xml file and click go!  There are some \nexample networks in the &#39;networks&#39; folder, a word of warning though, if \nthe network has the wrong number of input and output neurons then an \nexception will be thrown, so be aware for now if you are modifying them.\n\nThe networks provided aren&#39;t particularly successful, though still \nintersting to watch. I have yet to see a perfect network for prey \ncapture although this is very likely to be due to a flaw somewhere in my \ncode! - I ironed out a few minor problems just today. To be sure though \nI think i&#39;ll attempt to port a more tried and tested problem domain such \nas pole balancing, that should help me gauge whether i&#39;m looking at bugs \nor if I just need to tweak search parameters.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt;Colin, one suggestion I have is to make it possible to view champion\n&gt;networks playing the predator-prey domain, in other words to be able\n&gt;to see the predator and prey running around.  That would be a nice\n&gt;demo.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
