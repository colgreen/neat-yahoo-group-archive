In this case the action needed is an\n&gt; ANN \n&gt; &gt; that can be presented with a random sequence of\n&gt; binary \n&gt; &gt; patterns, and then repeats them back one at a\n&gt; time. \n&gt; &gt; It could be in reverse order, or in the order of \n&gt; &gt; presentation. Each pattern might be 16 bits, or\n&gt; maybe \n&gt; &gt; only 8 or 10. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The model is a human who is told to dial a phone \n&gt; &gt; number, and then dials it. \n&gt; \n&gt; This is not the form of memory I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; develop. I&#39;ll try to \n&gt; explain. \n&gt; A human is very advanced form of intelligence and\n&gt; remembering \n&gt; a sequence if a very machine-like process. I don&#39;t\n&gt; think I&#39;m a \n&gt; very stupid human, and more than five or six ones\n&gt; and zero&#39;s in \n&gt; a row is not only very difficult to remember, ( I\n&gt; would have to \n&gt; explicitly apply heuristics like grouping and rhythm\n&gt; ), it&#39;s also \n&gt; totally meaningless. \n&gt; Like Ion said, doing a small part of a task is\n&gt; really really hard, \n&gt; but looking at the task as a whole starts to make\n&gt; sense. What \n&gt; do we need this sequence of bits for? \n&gt; If I were going to dial the phone number, ( because\n&gt; I have a \n&gt; terrible memory ) I would first find a way to record\n&gt; the number \n&gt; to a long term memory ( like pen and paper or palm\n&gt; pilot ) then \n&gt; use the phone and the paper together to make the\n&gt; call. \n&gt; these are learned behaviors in long term memory, but\n&gt; while \n&gt; the behavior of &#39;make the phone call&#39; is being\n&gt; carried out, there \n&gt; is short term memory of where the paper is. I never\n&gt; had to store \n&gt; any sequences of numbers to my own long term memory.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you see the difference in the kind of memory I&#39;m\n&gt; describing? \n&gt; In the future, I think the integration of long term\n&gt; memory with \n&gt; short term memory will make for very powerful\n&gt; systems. I just \n&gt; don&#39;t think we fully understand short term memory\n&gt; yet. \n\nNo, I don&#39;t understand your objective.  Mine is clear\nand simple, to demonstrate that a recurrent neural\nnetwork can do what animals frequently do, which is\nremember a sequence of patterns, and then recall them\nin order.  The telephone dialing task is an easy to\nunderstand example of this.  (and most people can hear\na 7 digit number and immediately dial it, showing that\nthey remembered it at least briefly.)  Animals do it\nwhen they remember a route and then find their way\nback.  I&#39;m not aware that this has been done by any\nANN researcher.  I plan to do it after my next two\nreleases, so It&#39;s likely to be in the early fall.  One\nof you NEAT people could beat me to it if you got\ncrackin&#39;. :)\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nSBC Yahoo! - Internet access at a great low price.\nhttp://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/\n\n"}}
