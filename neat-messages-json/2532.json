This is against the previous breeding regime where only 10,000 \ncycles would have been enough to push the size up to around 150 or so...\n\n\tAlso note the other good effect, that I ran nearly a million cycles \nin just under two hours (CSI was a double bill :-), whereas the old \nscheme used to start getting _a_lot_ slower as the genome size \nincreased, mostly due to the longer evaluation time, but possibly \nalso due to the cost of breeding all those dud genes over and over... ?\n\n\tAnd the cost of the dead-wood trimming itself used to count, that is \nalso slow...\n\n\tOf course the big question is, does it still search \nefficiently?  It&#39;s a little soon to tell, the score has risen to 86% \n(a PPT-type score) which is low for 900,000 cycles, but since that \nmany cycles would previously have taken 4 - 5 DAYS, it&#39;s a lot faster \nin real-time (if it holds up when I resume the run).  And since I \nlive in real-time (mostly) that sounds like a win to me.\n\n\tI&#39;ll try to remember to leave it going while I&#39;m at work tomorrow \nand see how it does with another 3 or 4 million cycles.\n\n\tIan\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
