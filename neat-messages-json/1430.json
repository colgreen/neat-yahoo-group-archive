What have you done to deal with this problem?  Did\n&gt; you just tweak stuff until you got good results?  Or have you analyzed the\n&gt; problem and determined an optimal solution?\n\nWell, if the problem really is as you&#39;ve conceptualized it, that you\nwant to mutate a topology, then only perturb weights before adding new\ntopology, you could implement something similar to Colin&#39;s phased\napproach.  Only instead of alternating phases of adding and\nsubtracting topology, you could have alternating phases of adding\ntopology and mutating weights only.\n\nOtherwise, yeah, it sounds like it&#39;s just a matter of experimenting\nand tweaking to find the appropriate mutation rate.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
