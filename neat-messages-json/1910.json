That does indeed clear up a whole lot.\n\n&gt;&gt; [inquiry regarding &quot;lowest performing species older than N\n&gt;&gt; generations is sterilized&quot;]\n\n&gt; I know what happened here.  The papers you are talking about are \n&gt; coevolution experiments.  In coevolution, you can&#39;t use absolute \n&gt; fitness to check for stagnation since fitness is *relative* in \n&gt; coevolution.  In other words, even if the fitness of a species \n&gt; stayed the same for 100 generations, that doesn&#39;t mean that its \n&gt; performance is staying the same in coevolution.  It might be worse \n&gt; and it might be better, in an absolute sense, than where it started.\n&gt; Therefore, it uses the heuristic you mentioned, where it just culls \n&gt; the worst species as long as it&#39;s been around for a while.\n\nThat makes perfect sense, thank you.\n\n&gt; The point of this special &quot;delta coding&quot; case is that the entire \n&gt; population is stuck, and you have nothing available to work with \n&gt; other than the current population.  It makes sense in that case to \n&gt; *focus in* on the best species, simply because they are most \n&gt; promising by virtue of being most fit.  Since basically everyone is \n&gt; stagnating, there isn&#39;t anything else to go on.  \n\nI see now how powerful this could be (didn&#39;t see the connection to\nSANE until now).  However, isn&#39;t there a major risk that if the best\nspecies is stuck in or near a local minima that the entire population\nwill simply get stuck in there as well?  In my experiment, when it\ngoes nowhere, I find that the &quot;delta coding&quot; simply ensures that every\ngenome is the same and then they all go nowhere together.\n\n&gt; Finally, let me suggest that from reading about your (Mike&#39;s)\n&gt; specific problem that it is probably something about the domain that \n&gt; is causing you to get stuck.  It may simply be too hard to evolve \n&gt; from scratch, or there could be a bug.  But I have a feeling that \n&gt; stagnation detection is not the primary factor in this problem.\n\nI think that you are right and I am now looking at the problem with,\nwhat feels like, fresh eyes.  Thanks!\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
