The one question I have is about the computational\n&gt;complexity:  Does computing the net force on a node requires comparing\n&gt;it to every other node?  I wasn&#39;t clear how the net&quot;repulsive\n&gt;proximity force&quot; is computed?  I imagine if it&#39;s n^2 in the number of\n&gt;nodes it might be prohibitive?  In any case I think this is a clever\n&gt;approach.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, I should note that using Mat Buckland&#39;s approach or one like\n&gt;it should be sufficient for determining vertical node placement in\n&gt;NEAT, since over the course of evolution it is possible to always know\n&gt;what level/layer a new node should be in based on the level/layer of\n&gt;already existing nodes around it.  Still, there is the question of\n&gt;horizontal placement, which actually could still benefit from an\n&gt;approach what you are proposing.  (Though I think Mat had a horizontal\n&gt;split value as well...I need to look up how that was computed)\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d be very interested to see net visualizations generated through\n&gt;your method.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; This is mildly off-topic, and yet relevant...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have some data I want to visualize.  The nature of the data is a\n&gt;network\n&gt; &gt; or mesh of associations.  It is far more complicated than the\n&gt;networks that\n&gt; &gt; NEAT generates.  Thus, the solution for visualizing this data might\n&gt;be a\n&gt; &gt; good way of visualizing a complex NEAT network, too.  So I thought\n&gt;perhaps\n&gt; &gt; the people on this list might have some interest in a contributing\n&gt;to a\n&gt; &gt; solution to this problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The origins of the data is the dictionary.  Specifically\n&gt; &gt; dictionary.reference.com and thesaurus.reference.com.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I started with a word.  It really doesn&#39;t matter which word, but I\n&gt;started\n&gt; &gt; with &#39;intelligence&#39;.  I query the dictionary and thesaurus entries\n&gt;for that\n&gt; &gt; word and parse the results.  I get a list of words that appear in\n&gt;those two\n&gt; &gt; pages.  I save that list as the list of &#39;associations&#39; for that\n&gt;word.  Now\n&gt; &gt; for each of those words (which I have not already processed), I\n&gt;repeat the\n&gt; &gt; process.  Virtually no matter what word I start with, I end up with\n&gt; &gt; basically the whole dictionary.  Then I prune those associations to\n&gt;include\n&gt; &gt; only those that are reciprocal.  That is, word A references B, and B\n&gt;also\n&gt; &gt; references A.  An example would be Tree and Bark.  This pruning\n&gt;makes the\n&gt; &gt; data SIGNIFICANTLY smaller, but still pretty large.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now I would like to present the data as a visual &#39;mesh&#39; or network.\n&gt;  It\n&gt; &gt; would help me to &#39;see&#39; the connections.  I want to minimize the\n&gt;lengths of\n&gt; &gt; the connections so that related words appear close to one another.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s what I had in mind.  Load the data into memory.  Randomly\n&gt;assign x,y\n&gt; &gt; positions to each node.  Then treat every direct connection as an\n&gt;attractive\n&gt; &gt; force, and treat physical proximity as a repulsive force that falls\n&gt;off with\n&gt; &gt; the square of the distance.  For each time step, calculate the net\n&gt;force.\n&gt; &gt; Then reposition the nodes based on that net force.  Repeat until the\n&gt;net\n&gt; &gt; movement approaches zero.  Then save the positions of everything\n&gt;and\n&gt; &gt; generate a visualization of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For NEAT, I thought that you could add an additional &#39;force&#39; that\n&gt;is an\n&gt; &gt; extra repulsive force between input and output nodes.  Then, the\n&gt;input nodes\n&gt; &gt; would tend to cluster towards one side, and the output nodes on the\n&gt;other,\n&gt; &gt; with a delicate balance forming in the nodes in between.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -- John\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
