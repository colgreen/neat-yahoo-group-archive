In NEAT there is a bias input which has a constant value \nof 1.0.=\r\n There is clear advantage for using it, otherwise the \nhyperplanes that the=\r\n nodes represent would all cross the origin of the \nhyperspace, which is li=\r\nmiting the possible behaviors the NN can have. \nBut not all nodes in NEAT h=\r\nave a connection to the bias node. Evolution \nconnects nodes to it when onl=\r\ny when it is useful. In this way the \nsearch space is further minimized, NE=\r\nAT does not have to search for a \nproper bias on every node. \nHowever, in H=\r\nyperNEAT substrates, it is better to have a bias in every \nneuron anyway, t=\r\nhen the biases will be &quot;drawn&quot; by the CPPN. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;stig.bergestad&quot; &lt;stig.bergestad@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; I was won=\r\ndering if the original NEAT(c++) used/uses threshold values\n&gt; for node acti=\r\nvation?
