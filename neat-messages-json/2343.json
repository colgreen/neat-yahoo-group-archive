So I think I might try and adapt something\n&gt;similar to the scheme you describe.\n&gt;\n&gt;BTW are you still evaluating with Tic-Tac-Toe players?\n\nYup.  I&#39;ve not been saying anything, because I&#39;m also upgrading the \nalgorithm at the same time, but I have been keeping going with a \npopulation, even though the algorithm operating on it is still \nregularly upgraded.  Obviously once the algorithm stabilizes I&#39;ll \nhave to rerun it from the start with a constant environment.\n\nFor the moment, my top player has normalised PPS(legal-nl) of 0.9219 \n(or 92.19%, which is easier to think about).  There&#39;s definitely a \nsharp decrease in rate of progress at around 90% so things are \ngetting quite slow now.  That&#39;s one of the main reasons I&#39;ve \ncontinued to upgrade the algorithm, trying to keep the rate of progress up :)\n\n&gt;I find that more\n&gt;simple and hence faster fitness functions are more conducive for testing\n&gt;and experimenting with when developing code. Just a thought.\n\nIt&#39;s a good thought, but in this case I think I need to validate both \nthe search method and the definition of PPS, so I&#39;m kinda stuck with \nit.  I have been considering ways of rapidly estimating the PPS, \ninstead of iterating through all 627 boards, but I didn&#39;t try coding \nanything yet...\n\n&gt;Seems like good progress is being made anyway. Keep it coming!\n\nHow are you doing, I hope you are still on it?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
