It seems like a\n&gt;really promising idea to &#39;shakedown&#39; the evolutionary process, but what\n&gt;if the network comes to depend on that noise to consistantly &#39;shake out&#39;\n&gt;a solution, instead evolving weights down to zero out the influence?\n\nWould it be guaranteed to evolve out?  No...if the presence of the noise \ngives it an advantage, then it will remain.  What is most likely to happens \nis:  during the early phases, before it has evolved a solution, the presence \nof the noise will be neither helpful nor hurtful, so it will persist.  As it \nbegins to find a solution, *if* that solution is robust with respect to the \nnoise, then the noise will continue to persist.  If it is a solution that \nbenefits from less noise, the noise will be dampened over time by evolved \nreduction in weights to the random input node.  I doubt that it would ever \nevolve to zero, simply by virtue of the evolution process.  But its presence \nwould apply significant pressure to the rest of the network to be robust and \nadaptable.\n\nAnd what if the network does come to depend on that noise?
