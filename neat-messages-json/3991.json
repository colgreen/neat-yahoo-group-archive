Becau=\r\nse it is a \n&gt; &gt; challenge to affect the holistic policy of a neural network=\r\n with \na \n&gt; &gt; single input, I am guessing it would not work as well.  In \nc=\r\nontrast, \n&gt; &gt; in HyperNEAT, the x position naturally has a holistic effect =\r\non \nthe \n&gt; &gt; substrate because the whole substrate is generated from that \n=\r\nvalue.  \n&gt; &gt; Yet it is an empirical issue and I could be wrong; your idea \n=\r\nmight \n&gt; &gt; work as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; with regards,\n&gt; mattias\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
