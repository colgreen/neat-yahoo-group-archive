Mine is clear\n&gt;and simple, to demonstrate that a recurrent neural\n&gt;network can do what animals frequently do, which is\n&gt;remember a sequence of patterns, and then recall them\n&gt;in order.  The telephone dialing task is an easy to\n&gt;understand example of this.  (and most people can hear\n&gt;a 7 digit number and immediately dial it, showing that\n&gt;they remembered it at least briefly.)  Animals do it\n&gt;when they remember a route and then find their way\n&gt;back.  I&#39;m not aware that this has been done by any\n&gt;ANN researcher.  I plan to do it after my next two\n&gt;releases, so It&#39;s likely to be in the early fall.
