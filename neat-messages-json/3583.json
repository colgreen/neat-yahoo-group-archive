Yet I do believe that \nwhat is going on in NEAT =\r\nis justifiably analogous to natural \nspeciation in the way that you questio=\r\nn.  While you point out that \neveryone in NEAT is competing on the same fit=\r\nness function and \ntherefore it is not really like nature, I would disagree=\r\n.  In \nnature, there is also only one fitness function, which is &quot;to \nrepro=\r\nduce.&quot;  All species are just variations on ways of getting that \ndone.  In =\r\nanalogy, all species in NEAT are variations on ways of \ngetting done whatev=\r\ner it is the fitness function requires.  \nA &quot;niche&quot; in this sense means an =\r\nalternate means to accomplish a \ntask, which is an idea well suited to diff=\r\nerent topologies and \nweights that do the same thing in different ways.\n\nI =\r\nalso do not fully understand the assertion that &quot;All chromosomes\nin NEAT ca=\r\nn potentially mate with one another.&quot;  NEAT was highly \ninfluenced by the c=\r\nompeting conventions problem, which had been a \nknown pathology in neuroevo=\r\nlution for many years.  It was perhaps \nthe worst of all problems with such=\r\n sustems.  The problem is of \ncourse exacerbated by differing topologies as=\r\n well as weights.  The \ncompeting conventions problem is actually a very de=\r\nep problem \nbecause there are indeed inviduals that have no hope of mating =\r\n\neffectively, which is evidenced all over nature.  A bird and pig \nwill nev=\r\ner yield a flying pig, even through some kind of artificial \ninsemination o=\r\nr chimeric hybridization.  They should simply not be \nmating with each othe=\r\nr (since it would waste precious evaluations \nfrom a computational standpoi=\r\nnt, not to mention the ethical \ndisaster).  \n\nIt was well known that enormo=\r\nus damage was being inflicted in non-\nspeciated neuroevolving populations w=\r\nherein similar bird-pig-like \nmating events were happening routinely.  Thus=\r\n, just because one can \nalign genes optimally does not mean one should if s=\r\npecies have \ndiverged too far afield.\n\nIn any case, it is probably wise to =\r\nquestion the precise mechanisms \nthrough which NEAT accomplishes or aims to=\r\n accomplish these ends, \nand I would not be surprised if competitive altern=\r\natives arise.  \nHowever, I do still believe that the underlying motivations=\r\n make \ngood sense.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djam=\r\nes@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NEAT uses speciation, according to Ken, for two reasons:=\r\n protecting\n&gt; innovation and &quot;preventing incompatible genes from crossing o=\r\nver&quot; \n(from his\n&gt; dissertation). Though it seems to me the first reason is =\r\n\nemphasized and\n&gt; presumably the most important. Is this correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nsecond reason doesn&#39;t seem particularly well-justified. All \nchromosomes\n&gt; =\r\nin NEAT can potentially mate with one another. I understand the \nidea of\n&gt; =\r\nniching, but in biological terms it means that organisms can \nsurvive and\n&gt;=\r\n reproduce by exploiting different resources. In a fitness function \nwhere =\r\nall\n&gt; the individuals are performing the same task, e.g. pole balancing, \nt=\r\nhis\n&gt; analogy doesn&#39;t seem to hold. The networks might be using different\n&gt;=\r\n strategies, but this seems to be more analogous to two individuals \nin the=\r\n\n&gt; same species fighting for the same niche.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, if protecting inn=\r\novation really is the prime motivation for\n&gt; speciation, why not use a simp=\r\nler mechanism? I was thinking of \njust keeping\n&gt; the population unspeciated=\r\n, and giving a fitness bonus to \nevolutionarily\n&gt; younger individuals. This=\r\n would be a lot less complex than \nspeciating the\n&gt; population, and wouldn&#39;=\r\nt it essentially accomplish the same thing, \nin terms\n&gt; of giving innovatio=\r\nns a chance to prove themselves by making them\n&gt; competitive with older ind=\r\nividuals?\n&gt; \n&gt; Has this sort of strategy been used before? And if so, how d=\r\noes it \ncompare?\n&gt; If not, why wouldn&#39;t it work as well to protect innovati=\r\non?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
