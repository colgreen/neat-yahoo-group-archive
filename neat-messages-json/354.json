And especially complex or\ndifficult processes are that much more difficult to\ndefine.\n\nIt seems to me, though, that AI researchers who are\nborrowing conceptually from across disciplines may\nfind it less confusing and more beneficial to try to\nremain more consistent with the concepts from those\nolder, more mature fields.\n\nAnd from everything I&#39;ve read in evolutionary biology\nor population genetics, the overriding\nconceptualization of evolution as a process of\nheritable change over time, with that change being\nbrought about by several forces, only one of which is\nnatural selection.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, I prefer to use\n&gt; terminology in a way that\n&gt; is intuitive and simple, and I feel that Derek&#39;s\n&gt; definition of\n&gt; evolution, though arguably technically sound, does\n&gt; not fit my\n&gt; intuitions and is therefore potentially misleading. \n&gt; (Misleading\n&gt; because only someone who knew Derek and his\n&gt; reasoning would be able to\n&gt; appreciate his assumptions.)  \n\nWell they aren&#39;t just my assumptions.  By the way, are\nthere any life sciences majors or degree holders\nlurking around here?\n\n&gt; The problem I have is\n&gt; that evolution to\n&gt; me includes the central notion of &quot;survival of the\n&gt; fittest,&quot; and\n&gt; Derek&#39;s &quot;evolution with pure drift&quot; has no notion of\n&gt; fitness at all,\n&gt; making it quite in contrast to my intuitions.  \n\nAgain, it&#39;s not just my notion.  It&#39;s an inherent\nconcept in evolutionary biology.\n\nFrom the University of Arizona web page:\n\nhttp://www.biology.arizona.edu/evolution/act/drift/drift.html\n\n&quot;The three major forces of evolution are mutation,\nselection, and random genetic drift. These forces\ncause changes in genotypes and phenotypes over time,\nand also determine the amount and kind of variation\nseen in a population.&quot;\n\nFrom an NYU profs site:\n\nhttp://www.nyu.edu/projects/fitch/courses/evolution/html/genetic_drift.html#GeneticDrift\n\n&quot;I.  Genetic drift:  the effect of population size\nalone on allele and genotype frequencies\n\nA.  Finite population size alone results in a change\nin allele frequency (which results in a decline in\nheterozygosity)\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nII.  Genetic drift can result in evolutionary\ndivergence\n\n1.  Because of genetic drift, the variance between\ndemes (small subpopulations) increases over time\n(i.e., demes will diverge, esp. if they become\nisolated).&quot;\n\n\nAnd genetic drift plays a huge role in biological\nspeciation.  Small groups of individuals may diverge\nevolutionarily for reasons that have *nothing* to do\nwith their fitness.\n\nHere&#39;s a good article from ScienceDaily Magazine that\nexplains the impact of genetic drift on evolution:\n\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/encyclopedia/Genetic_drift\n\n&quot;Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution that acts\nin concert with natural selection to change species\ncharacteristics over time. Like selection, it acts on\npopulations, altering which traits and which alleles\npredominate among members and changing the diversity\nof the group. Unlike selection, however, drift occurs\nonly in small populations and results in changes that\nneed not be adaptive. A statistical effect, it arises\nfrom the role of chance in the production of\noffspring.&quot;\n\nSo I&#39;m not the only one arguing that genetic drift (or\nthe sampling effect, or whatever you&#39;d like to call\nit) may have a profound effect on the evolution of a\npopulation, especially if that population is\nrelatively small (like many used in GAs).  \n\nTo view evolution as *only* a result of natural\nselection is misleading, I believe.  Especially in our\ncase, when we&#39;re trying to emulate evolution and\nharness it to solve particular\nproblems...understanding the pressures at work that\naffect the dynamics of the evolving population are\ncrucial.  Especially when it comes to trying to\ndetermine optimal parameters such as population sizes\nand survival rates.  \n\nSmaller populations and smaller survival (or\nselection, or sampling) rates are going to increase\nthe effect of genetic drift, are they not?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
