The xml \nloading/saving I did last week should work just as well for passing \ngenomes around a network during a distrbuted search. I recon such a \nsearch wouldn&#39;t actually require much data to be passed around so it \ncould just as easily be distibuted over the internet as over a local \nLAN. One slight complication would be distributing co-evolution searches \nwhere a fitness score on one PC bares no relation to any other, thus \nmaking it hard for a given PC to determine if it has found a new \nbest-genome or not.  I don&#39;t envisage this to be a major problem though.\n\nColin.\n\n\nKenneth Stanley wrote:\n\n&gt;Hey Colin,\n&gt;\n&gt;Wow it sounds like SharpNEAT is getting pretty fancy.
