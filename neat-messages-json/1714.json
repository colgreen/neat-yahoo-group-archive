In other words, if it asks to zoom, make it zoom a little \nmore or a little less than it asked (i.e. add some noise).  If it \nasks to rotate, have a probability of slight over or under \nrotation.  Faustino Gomez from our group has shown that model noise \n(noise added to actions) is more effective than noise added to \nsensors.  Anyway, the point here would be that it would have to \nlearn to deal with rotations it hasn&#39;t seen before.  The danger of \ncourse is that too much noise will make evaluation meaningless, so \nyou&#39;d have to be careful.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At 18:31 08/11/2004, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;On Mon, 08 Nov 2004 16:56:18 +0000, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          I read your paper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          It&#39;s good.  The only comment I had is the same one I \nhad before,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you do not define the &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; algorithm used \nin zooming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the images and the picture you show does not look like what I \nthink of as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nearest neighbour.  But I doubt that many in your audience \nwill pick up on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that and I don&#39;t know whether it matters anyway...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks for the feedback, Ian.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yes, we could have spent a bit more space discussing interpolation\n&gt; &gt;algorithms, but thought it might be a distraction.  We might \npossibly\n&gt; &gt;be asked to add something in by reviewers, if it makes it that \nfar.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          In what sense is the image processing the \nbottleneck?  Is is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because you have to zoom, translate and rotate the viewed \nportion of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; image in every evaluation frame?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yes, basically.  Each individual gets about 100 steps to move \nacross\n&gt; &gt;the canvass and view portions of the image.  On a given step, the\n&gt; &gt;image can be moved up/down, left/right, zoomed in/out, and \nrotated, so\n&gt; &gt;there&#39;s an affine transform for every step, and this is\n&gt; &gt;computationally expensive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Writing your own (simple) image manipulation in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C will cut the run-time hugely.  If you are already doing that \nthen your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem is more severe...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;No, right now we&#39;re using Java&#39;s image processing package.  We&#39;re\n&gt; &gt;looking at using a package called ImageMagick, and exploiting \nnative\n&gt; &gt;methods to speed up the processing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But we also hope to use Jim&#39;s SEMIANN neural net framework to gain\n&gt; &gt;some speed there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;          Just one small thought on this.  That since what you want \nis a \n&gt; fairly simple zoom/rotate facility, it may be than these packages \nare over \n&gt; the top for your needs.  In which case some simple hand coding \nmight out \n&gt; perform them...\n&gt; \n&gt;                  Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
