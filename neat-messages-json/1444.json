Firstly, I stick by what I said previously...\n\nColin Green wrote:\n\n&gt;I still beleive \n&gt;that the drop in population fitness is due to the phenomena I described, \n&gt;that is:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) A rising species compatibilty threshold caused by the quickly rising \n&gt;complexity. This causes like species to be combined into fewer species.\n&gt;\n&gt;2) SharpNEAT culling fit species when they reach the drop off age.\n&gt;\n&gt;3) SharpNEATs current crossover technique which is very likely causing \n&gt;complexity to rise far quicker than in other NEAT implementations and \n&gt;thus exacerbating (1).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nFor brevity I&#39;ll refer to the two crossover techniques as, Original NEAT \ncrossover (Co) and Inclusive crossover (Ci). Ci being the technique that \nSharpNEAT currently uses whereby the disjoint and excess genes are \nalways included from both parents, regardless of which is fittest. Kens \nNEAT only does this when the parents have equal fitness.\n\nI did some runs of my OCR domain. Witha complexifying run, when using Co \ninstead of Ci the complexity still rises in a roughly linear manner but \ndoes so slower. The result is that the population fitness rises quickly \nto about 100 and then maintains this level, perhaps with a slight drop \noff (so very similar to the blended run graph in my write-up). A blended \nrun gave a similar profile but reaching a peak fitness of 120.\n\nOk so now consider that Derek&#39;s blended runs with ANJI/Tic-Tac-Toe \ndemonstrated a steady amount of complexity. Why is SharpNEAT showing a \nsteady rise but ANJI not?  The answer lies in the domains being used and \nthe fitness schemes used. I tried SharpNEAT with the TTT domain and Co, \nthe result was a steady amount of complexity, rising from a start value \nof 10 to just 11.5 in 1000 generations.\n\nBecause TTT is non-determinstic the fitness values assigend to each \ngenome will almost always be different, even for very similar or \nidentical genomes. This means that the part of Co that includes genes \nfrom both parents when their fitness is equal will hardly ever be \ninvoked. In contrast the OCR experiment only has 27 distinct fitness \nvalues (0 to 260 in steps of  10) and within an evolving population most \nof the genomes will have about the same fitness. This means that Co will \nactually be performing inclusive crossover most of the time, which in \nturn causes complexity to rise.\n\nSo OCR&#39;s fitness scheme causes the inclusive crossover to be invoked, \nwhich in turn causes complexity to rise which  causes species to become \nmerged. The overall population fitness then drops when the few good \nspecies are culled.\n\nHopefully this explains the discrepancies noted so far. It&#39;s interesting \nthat only a slight increase in the rate that complexity rises causes the \npopulation fitness to drop off, but then this is tied to the species \nculling age, the greater the age the greater the amount of tolerance \ntowards rising complexity. If you cross some threshold then the pop. \nfitness will collapse.\n\nIn light of all this I&#39;m going to make a few changes to SharpNEAT, #1 \nbeing the preservation of the fittest species. If  there are several \nspecies with the maximum species then I will just cull them as normal, \nso I only preserve the fittest species if is the only one. Yeh that \nshould work I think. By culling the fittest species I think I was trying \nto achieve to much in the context of a single search, it&#39;s better to \nallow the user to decide when a search has stagnated and needs \nresetting. I suppose I could add in a new, &#39;re-start age&#39; parameter that \ndetects when the entire search has stagnated for some [large] # of \ngenerations and resets the population.\n\nI also think that getting crossover to include genes from both parents \nmore often would be a good thing. Though perhaps not the 100% inclusive \nscheme I&#39;ve been using up until now, perhaps 10% of the genes from the \nweakest parent and I&#39;ll parameterize this value.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
