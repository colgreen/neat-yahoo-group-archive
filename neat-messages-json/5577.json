Yannakakis and Simon Colto=\r\nn\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nAI research seeks to optimise the performance =\r\nof artificial agents in\ntheir given domains, and in the area of games this =\r\ndoes not mean\nsimply making stronger opponents. We do not increase the play=\r\ner=CA=BCs\nenjoyment of a game by beating them as quickly as possible, but b=\r\ny\nmatching them at their level of expertise to engage them and provide\nan e=\r\nntertaining experience. While such aesthetic considerations are\nmore diffic=\r\nult to quantify and measure than playing strength, they are\nbecoming increa=\r\nsingly important as more consumer content becomes\ndigitally created and tes=\r\nted.\n\nComputational aesthetics in games covers a range of aspects from\nvisu=\r\nal presentation and the elegance of the underlying mechanics, to\nless tangi=\r\nble aspects such as player engagement and enjoyment; a good\ngame will provi=\r\nde a rich player experience and afford sensual,\nvisceral and/or intellectua=\r\nl stimulation. We are seeing the emergence\nof game telemetry as a growing r=\r\nesearch area and the development of\nincreasingly sophisticated tools such a=\r\ns biostatistical indicators of\nuser engagement, yet much work remains to be=\r\n done to maximise the true\nentertainment potential that is now available to=\r\n game and AI\ndesigners.\n\nThe purpose of this special issue is to draw toget=\r\nher the various\naspects of computational aesthetics as they relate to AI in=\r\n games, and\nto shed light on the relationship between game aesthetics and p=\r\nlayer\nsatisfaction. It will explore questions such as: What exactly is\nbeau=\r\nty in a game? How do we measure this and use it to best effect?\nHow do we m=\r\nake AIs more entertaining? We invite high quality work on\nany aspect of com=\r\nputational aesthetics in any genre of game,\nelectronic or physical. Papers =\r\nshould be of a technical nature with\nclaims backed up by experimental resul=\r\nts or case studies. Topics\ninclude but are not limited to:\n\n* Modeling game=\r\n aesthetics\n* Notions of creativity and beauty in game design and AI behavi=\r\nour\n* Agent-based game aesthetics\n* Self-adaptation/tailoring of aesthetic =\r\nmodels\n* Fitness (entertainment) functions for procedural content generatio=\r\nn\n* Player experience/affect and adaptive AI response\n* Methods for verifyi=\r\nng and interpreting aesthetic measurements and\nquality assurance\n* Player b=\r\niases and the perceived value of automated vs handmade\ncontent\n* Game telem=\r\netry, user engagement, player immersion\n* Culture-driven aesthetics modelli=\r\nng\n* The relationship between games and art\n* Other aspects of AI in game p=\r\nlaying contexts, e.g. generative mood\nmusic\n* Nonlinear game story scriptin=\r\ng\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nAuthors should follow normal T-CIAIG guideline=\r\ns for their submissions,\nbut clearly identify their papers for this special=\r\n issue during the\nsubmission process. Seehttp://www.ieee-cis.org/pubs/tciai=\r\ng/  for\nauthor information. Submissions should be between 8 and 12 pages lo=\r\nng,\nbut may exceed these limits in special cases.
