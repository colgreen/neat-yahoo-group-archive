In\nparticular, for steering and navigation.  Here&#39;s\nsomething I posted to the ANNEvolve mailing list:\n--------------------------------------------\nToday was the big robot desert race that fizzled.  All\nthe contestants did lousy.  But Eric and I were\ntalking about doing a much-simplified simulation of\nthat problem.   We would use a minimal car model,\ntraveling in a rectangular region, with &quot;boulders&quot;. \nThe &quot;boulders&quot; are just small circles like the island\nin EvSail.  So there are several circular forbidden\nregions of different sizes within the large\nrectangular region.   An ANN controls power and\nsteering of the car, and is supposed to guide it. \nIt&#39;s goal is to travel from lower left to upper right\nwithout hitting any &quot;boulders&quot;.  Besides that, it\nshould do it as fast as possible.  The inputs to the\nANN tell it where the goal is and where the nearby\nboulders are.\n\nBut I don&#39;t want to do this by myself.  Eric is\nwilling to be the project manager.  I will do the\nmathematics and the physical modeling, and maybe some\nC code.  I can give lots of advice and explanations if\nneeded.  We need one or two programmers.  The reason I\nmention two is that I would like this project to\ninclude some basic graphics.  I want to see the region\nwith the boulders, and see the car moving through it.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI anyone would like to apply NEAT to this same\nproblem, I willing to provide my vehicle model, along\nwith the terrain, boulders, sensor inputs, etc.  I\nhave not written this yet, but I expect it to be\nsimilar to the sailboat model used in EvSail (see our\nwebsite).  So I think I can get it out rather quickly.\nMy approach is highly simplified when compared to a\nreal vehicle on real desert terrain, but I believe it\nmodels the most essential aspects of the situation.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
