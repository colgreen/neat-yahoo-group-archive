It&#39;s too bad this newsgroup isn&#39;t threaded.  I\nam thinking to release it sometime in early to mid 2004, but I&#39;m not\nsure exactly.  I may speed it up if there is specific demand, i.e.\nsomeone has some specific experiment they are serious about doing with\nit.  But otherwise I want to clean up the code a bit.  The thing is\nthat my latest NEAT source code has a lot of baggage (i.e. extra\nexperiments, neural network variations, etc..) that&#39;s gotten attached\nover the years, and I think that might make it difficult to deal with\nfor people not familiar with the core parts of the system.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
