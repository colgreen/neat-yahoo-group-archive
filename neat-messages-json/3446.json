I believe I asked Karl Lewin for\n&gt; permission to do that \n&gt; &gt; about three years ago, but he told me the code\n&gt; wasn&#39;t in suitable \n&gt; &gt; condition to be released.  Since then, we seem to\n&gt; have lost touch.  \n&gt; &gt; You are correct that he is the one who produced a\n&gt; python NEAT version.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think I remember others mentioning they were\n&gt; working on Python \n&gt; &gt; versions of NEAT but I can&#39;t remember who it was. \n&gt; If someone has \n&gt; &gt; such a version and wants to make it available, I\n&gt; will be happy to \n&gt; &gt; link it from my website.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Cesar G.
