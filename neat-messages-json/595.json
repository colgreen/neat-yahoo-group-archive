This\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOK so the hint-* attributes are needed to generate the SVG output but \nfor other purposes they are optional. Perhaps this is where the \nconfusion set in elsewhere on this thread.\n\n&gt;that way, you can use whatever logic you like to place\n&gt;neurons in any given layer and position, and the XSL\n&gt;style sheet can just handle laying them out and\n&gt;graphing them.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes. and if you write your own XSLT or devise some other visualisation \ntechnique you may choose to ignore the hint-*&#39;s completely and do your \nown layout based purely on the network topology.\n\n&gt;Note that connections need to have an id, as well as a\n&gt;&quot;recurrent&quot; attribute.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDo you need the ID for your XSLT? I had omitted it from my phenotype XML \nsince it&#39;s not really relevent. I think the same applies to the \nrecurrent flag.\n\n&gt;I&#39;ll write a second XSL style sheet to handle the\n&gt;transformation from this XML into a form that my\n&gt;current style sheet can parse into an SVG image. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n[...]\n\nThanks Derek. This is actually quite useful to me at the moment since I \ndidn&#39;t have any network visualisation at all until now.\n\n\nIn answer to other queries about other types of information that people \nwant storing (and just to reinforce what Derek has already said) - the \nphilosophy I would like to see adopted here is to store all experimental \ninformation including ID&#39;s and genomes within the run-xml and \ngenome-xml.  If you then wish to pick one of the evolved networks for \nfurther simulation then you should rebuild the network from the \navailable genome-xml.  Right now of course NEAT  uses a direct encoding \nand therefore the network-xml is just the genome-xml with some of the \nattributes and tags missing, this may not always be the case though.\n\nOne you have a plain network.xml file (minus the hint-* attributes and \nwhatever) you could then load it into a tool that analyses the network \nand inserts hint-* data for the visualisation. Or you might just choose \nto work out the layout &#39;on-the-fly&#39; as part of the visualisation \nroutine, in which case you would never need to store hint-* data.  One \npossibility though is that we create a tool that does it&#39;s best at \nlaying out the network, but then allows us to manually move neurons \nabout with the mouse, we can then save the network-xml with hint-xpos, \nhint-ypos coordinate attributes.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
