Given that there are only 14 test cases I would\n&gt;say that this network has just learned to give the correct answers\n&gt;rather than actually calculating the average of the inputs.\n\nAgreed.  So the next step is to evaluate it multiple times per generation \nwith different inputs each time.  Assign the 9 pixel inputs a random number \nfrom -1 to 1.  Then calculate the expected outputs based on those random \ninputs.  Calculate each network against the same 100 different random inputs \nper generation, but each generation select a different set of test \nconditions.\n\n&gt;but for now I would say your NEAT code has some problems if it&#39;s\n&gt;not finding a solution.\n\nIt did have a problem, actually, which I fixed.  But remember, my code is \n(by design) slower.  It tries to be very thorough about the search.  That \nmeans it will take longer, in terms of generations, before it finds a \nsolution.  But it is unlikely to fail to find a solution if one exists.  \nHowever, I&#39;m still contemplating how I can speed it up without unnecessarily \nincreasing the risk of not finding a solution.  It&#39;s easier to find ways of \nmaking it MORE thorough (=slower) than it is to find shortcuts and \nequivalences that let us reduce the computational complexity of the search.\n\n&gt;A couple of quick questions - what activation\n&gt;fn are you using?\n\nFor the hidden nodes, sigmoid.  For the output node, a simple summation.  \nThat way the output can be greater than 1.\n\n&gt;and are you scaling the outputs to the expected range?\n\nNo.  The use of a summation node for the output should take care of that for \nme.\n\n\n\n"}}
