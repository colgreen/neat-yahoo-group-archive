The fitness function has so much to do in shaping the\nlandscape that I don&#39;t understand how its sensible to say something\nlike &quot;we can solve the ___ task.&quot;  It is essentially possible to cheat\nto solve a task by constructing a fitness function which is\nmulti-tiered and points the algorithm in the right direction to the\nsolution for most complicated problems, right?  Or am I just crazy?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nI agree with the sentiment but in practice it turns out people\ngenerally follow your recommendation anyway.  Most people who do pole\nbalancing, for example, follow the same fitness criterion as their\npredecessors.  And if they didn&#39;t, they would generally report the\ndiscrepency.  It would be a bit disingenuous to claim solving a task\nthat is actually using a different fitness function than normal.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
