That&#39;s also what my question was referring, what advantage\ndoes it=\r\n have. I can see AGE producing complex patterns via a intricate\ninteraction=\r\n map (or matching scheme, are they just different terms for\nthe same mechan=\r\nism?) And I suppose you can evolve the interaction map\ntoo. But then how wo=\r\nuld that be any different than HyperNeat if you\njust consider a matching sc=\r\nheme as a general function with input and\noutput. It seems to me HyperNeat =\r\ntake one more abstraction away and\nmade it more focus on the end result wit=\r\nh is patterns of organization.\nOr maybe I am just not understanding the ess=\r\nence of GRN and AGE?\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstan=\r\nley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (This is my first post.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recently came upon some literatur=\r\nes on Analog Genetic Encoding\n&gt; &gt; developed by Mattiussi and Floreano. It&#39;s=\r\n interesting but certainly\n&gt; &gt; not revolutionary. After all it&#39;s just a sim=\r\nplified version of\n&gt; &gt; gene-regulation in real biological system. Some stat=\r\ns shows it is as\n&gt; &gt; robust as Neat. (Probably not tested against HyperNeat=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you had any experience with it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no experien=\r\nce with Mattiussi&#39;s Analog Genetic Encoding aside \n&gt; from reading about it =\r\nmyself.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is similar in a way to Joseph Reisinger&#39;s work with evolvin=\r\ng a GRN-\n&gt; based encoding with NEAT, as Joe mentions in his response to you=\r\nr \n&gt; post.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting as an abstraction of  developmental encod=\r\ning in \n&gt; nature.  In particular, it broadens our perspective on how such \n=\r\n&gt; abstractions can work and from which aspects of development they can \n&gt; d=\r\nraw.  The abstraction seems fairly high-level, i.e. it abstracts \n&gt; away su=\r\nch details as chemical diffusion and growth from an embryo.  \n&gt; In that way=\r\n, it has some similarities to HyperNEAT.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The main question it brings=\r\n to my mind is what exactly recommends \n&gt; this particular abstraction over =\r\nany other.  Although the authors \n&gt; note that it allows a large variety of =\r\ngenetic operations, aside from \n&gt; that, it is unclear what the main princip=\r\nle is that supports the \n&gt; approach, i.e. why we should prefer it to any ot=\r\nher indirect \n&gt; encoding.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, as a proponent of CPPNs and Hyp=\r\nerNEAT, I think that one \n&gt; important ingredient for a developmental encodi=\r\nng is the ability to \n&gt; create patterns as a function of the domain geometr=\r\ny (as in the \n&gt; substrate in HyperNEAT).  AGE does not have such a capabili=\r\nty.  Its \n&gt; interactions are detached from the geometry of the ultimate net=\r\nwork \n&gt; it encodes, which suggests to me that it may fare worse in domains =\r\n\n&gt; with a geometric basis, especially those with high \n&gt; resolution/granula=\r\nrity.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I also wonder why connection-centric parameters (such as weigh=\r\nts) \n&gt; should be derived through a matching scheme like sequence alignment =\r\n\n&gt; (which is one way AGE sets up its &quot;device interaction map.&quot;)  This \n&gt; id=\r\nea seems to be taken from biology simply for the sake of doing \n&gt; something=\r\n similarly to biology.  Yet such matching schemes are ad hoc \n&gt; because the=\r\ny do not relate to anything extrinsic to the genome.  \n&gt; HyperNEAT relates =\r\nits connection weights to the outside world by \n&gt; computing them as a funct=\r\nion of the locations of nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for comparisons with NEAT, I do beli=\r\neve that indirect encodings, \n&gt; including AGE, should generally be superior=\r\n to direct encodings in \n&gt; tasks that involve moderate-sized patterns.  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
