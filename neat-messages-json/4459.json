But now the time has come to ask a few questions, \nbecaus=\r\ne for over two months now I&#39;ve been trying very hard to get my \nproject wor=\r\nking - without success. As I am totally new to NEAT, my \nquestions may soun=\r\nd trivial or naive to you, so please don&#39;t be \noffended by that. I read a l=\r\not of earlier posts on this group, but I \ndidn&#39;t have the time to read them=\r\n all. Additionally, as I&#39;m German, \nmy English may be not very good, but I&#39;=\r\nm trying my best. ;)\n\nMy project includes the following facts: 3-degrees-of=\r\n-freedom robotic \narm (dynamic simulation with gravitation), for each joint=\r\n three \ninputs (current joint angle, goal joint angle, current speed) and o=\r\nne \noutput (motor command), all inputs are scaled to [-1;1] before being \nf=\r\ned to the system, all other nodes are sigmoid [0;1]. The arm gets 6 \ntraini=\r\nng samples with different start and goal angles, each sample \nconsisting of=\r\n 500 timesteps. In each of these 3000 timesteps, the \ndifference between cu=\r\nrrent and goal angles is calculated. The sum of \nthese differences becomes =\r\nthe errorsum. I assume this is not the best \nfitness function for this prob=\r\nlem, but it should work to continually \nreduce the mean difference and ther=\r\nefor to make the arm &quot;want&quot; to go \nto the goal.\n\nMy problem is the followin=\r\ng: I do not know which kind of settings for \nthe parameters I should use fo=\r\nr such an experiment. I tried tons of \npossibilites, but without any signif=\r\nicant results. Most of the time, \nthere is a gradual improvement in fitness=\r\n, but after some time it \njust stagnates and doesn&#39;t evolve any further at =\r\nall. I thought this \nto be a problem of overcomplexification, so I scaled d=\r\nown the \nadd_node_probability, which in turn resulted in slower learning \nc=\r\nurve, but after some time the same stagnation.\nSo to clearify this: My main=\r\n problem is stagnation after some time \nwithout having produced reasonable =\r\nresults. What can I do about it? \nWhat&#39;s it&#39;s cause and what can I do to ge=\r\nt it done right? \n\nI would very much appreciate your helpful advice!\nWith b=\r\nest regards,\nMatthias\n\n\n"}}
