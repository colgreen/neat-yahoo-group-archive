There currently exists a problem in the genome \n&gt; crossover code that allows multiple connections to accrue between \ntwo \n&gt; neurons, or between a single neuron in the case of recurrent \n&gt; conenctions. This will have some detrimental effect on searches, \n&gt; although how much of an effect is not known. This problem is being \n&gt; worked on.\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the last point, I was intending to resolve this problem \ntoday \n&gt; but I&#39;m still deciding on the best way to do this. I was going to \ntry \n&gt; and maintain a full history of all additions, which would solve \nthe \n&gt; problem and actually it sounds like a better strategy. \nUnfortunately if \n&gt; I do it this way then the problem re-appears when you distribute a \n&gt; search over multiple PCs - or at least the using the way I was \nthinking \n&gt; of doing distribution anyhow.\n\nWhy not just check during crossover whether any connection you are \nadding to the offspring genome is already there under a different \nnumber?  Crossover code has almost no effect on overall performance \nregardless of how much you optimize it.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
