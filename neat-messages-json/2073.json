There is a lot of \n&gt;work right now going into ways to make sure progress is real \n&gt;progress and not just going in circles or going off in bizarre \n&gt;tangents in the strategy space.  This problem seems likely to happen \n&gt;in board games where the initial strategies will be quite alien, so \n&gt;the improvements you get will be geared toward beating aliens.  It \n&gt;seems less of a problem in for example control domains like Robot \n&gt;Duel where it&#39;s hard to really have an &quot;alien&quot; strategy.  In any \n&gt;case, the mathematics behind tracking progress or ensuring progress \n&gt;have to do with game theory and Pareto optimality, and were \n&gt;discussed extensively at the Coevolution workshop this year at GECCO \n&gt;(where I was on the panel).  I would suggest reading papers by Edwin \n&gt;De Jong, Sevan Ficici, and Anthony Bucci.  Paul Wiegand also has a \n&gt;lot of cooperative coevolution issues.  Anyway, these guys (most \n&gt;alumni of the DEMO lab at Brandeis) are really moving towards \n&gt;theoretically founded theory of coevolution, which is quite \n&gt;interesting and deep.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nUltimately a population will force itself away from existing strategies \nin search of new strategies. How successful this &#39;strategy walking&#39; is \ndepends on how many alien strategies are in the search space and their \ndistance from each other. In very complex games it&#39;s likely we could \ndescribe a path through a never ending series of alien strategies, \nwhereas in more simple games we might expect the alien strategies to be \nexhausted and so our population is forced into adopting a good robust \nstrategy.\n\nAnyway thanks for the references. I&#39;ll definitely take a look.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
