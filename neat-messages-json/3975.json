It would require=\r\n a great deal of computation time (it has to \nrebuild the phenotype once pe=\r\nr timestep per individual) but it may \nshow interesting results. \n\nPeter\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dav=\r\nid D&#39;Ambrosio and I discuss the potential for HyperNEAT \n&gt; controlling mult=\r\niple heterogeneous agents in this new \n&gt; paper, &quot;Generative Encoding for Mu=\r\nltiagent Learning,&quot; to appear at \n&gt; GECCO 2008:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/index.php?\n&gt; option=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#dambros=\r\nio.gecco08\n&gt; \n&gt; Direct Link:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_=\r\ngecco08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; We also have a nice sample of videos that depict various e=\r\nvolved \n&gt; teams in action:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/multiagenthyperneat=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The interesting idea in this paper is that just as a single \n&gt; connec=\r\ntive CPPN can encode how a single network varies over space, \n&gt; it can also=\r\n encode how a *set* of networks (each representing the \n&gt; policy of one age=\r\nnt on the team) varies over space.  In this way, \n&gt; HyperNEAT can learn an =\r\nexpression that encodes how policies vary \n&gt; over the team geometry.  For e=\r\nxample, in a soccer team agents vary \n&gt; from defensive to offensive as you =\r\nmove away from the goal.  Part \nof \n&gt; the power of this approach is that it=\r\n means basic skills can be \n&gt; learned and shared among the whole team, sinc=\r\ne the CPPN encodes how \n&gt; those skills vary across the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
