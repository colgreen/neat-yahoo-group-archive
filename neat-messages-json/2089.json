I should say that my version is not a\n&gt; carbon copy of the original in implementation and is in fact different\n&gt; in a few areas by quite a bit (although I think functionally mostly\n&gt; equivalent).  The three biggest differences that I can think of are\n&gt; that speciation is done continuously without distinct species\n&gt; (individuals get fitness modifications depending on how new and how\n&gt; rare their innovations are, and probablistically mated based on\n&gt; similarity), there is no genotype - crossover and mutation is just\n&gt; done directly, and links don&#39;t have their own innovation ids (instead\n&gt; its a tuple of the innovation ids that they connect).   I can describe\n&gt; these in more detail, but I don&#39;t think they are very interesting.\n&gt; Suffice it to say that I can&#39;t guarantee that this will work\n&gt; identically to original NEAT on every problem, although it has done\n&gt; well thus far.\n\nThis is very neat work (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun). Can you elaborate more \non your speciation/fitness modification methods?\n\n&gt; \tAlso, I have implemented a module to save and retrieve networks and\n&gt; evolutionary runs to and from a mySQL database, a module to visualize\n&gt; arbitrary parameters from the database, a 3d network visualizer, and a\n&gt; soccer domain with a monitor.  I ported the network evaluation code to\n&gt; Pyrex (C) to speed up the simulations some as well.  If Tom or anyone\n&gt; else is interested in any this the code it is relatively simple (the\n&gt; part that implements NEAT is ~500 lines), it will be here soon (once\n&gt; I&#39;m finished cleaning it):\n&gt;\n&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neat\n&gt;\n&gt; \t(at the moment you can see a screenshot and some videos of evolved\n&gt; behaviour)\n\nThis is a very nice network visualization, is the code python as well? And \na bigger question, is it portable to linux? :)\n\n&gt; \tJoe (or anyone really) - I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at your code\n&gt; yet, but I am curious to know how you kept the GA and the network\n&gt; seperate and still had innovation numbers?  I found that this was the\n&gt; most difficult thing to deal with and essentially made any sort of\n&gt; strict meaningful OO seperation difficult to impossible.\n\nMy most recent implementation uses a function like:\n\nnetwork = genotype_to_phenotype( genome )\n\nI think Ken&#39;s implementation does this as well. MNEAT implemented networks \nas a class that took in a genome in the constructor. I&#39;m not sure if this \nmeets the criterion of &quot;strict meaningful OO separation&quot; but it seems \nclean enough to me.\n\n&gt; \tAlso, when I was first looking over Ken&#39;s code as a reference I\n&gt; massaged his comments into Natural Docs format, in case someone finds\n&gt; this useful it is here:\n&gt;\n&gt; \thttp://www.freshraisins.com/neatdoc\n\nThis is very nice as well, though honestly I have very fond memories of \nprinting out the original NEAT C source code and marking it up with a \nhighlighter. :P You should petition Ken to get a link to this on his NEAT \nsite.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
