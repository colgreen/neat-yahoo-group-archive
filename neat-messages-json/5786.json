Suppose a=\r\n CPPN substrate is being pruned for a Go game board evaluator.  If ideally =\r\nthe weights along the board edge should be expressed they will be removed b=\r\ny band pruning. Am I missing something?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony \n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi Tony, I believe th=\r\ne issue there is with the definition of a &quot;band&quot;:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;points that are=\r\n enclosed by at least two neighbors on opposite sides (e.g. left and right)=\r\n with di=0Bfferent CPPN activation levels&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Note that the points in=\r\n the outer black region do not have _two_ neighbors of different level on o=\r\npposite sides, so I believe that is the reason they are pruned away.  Howev=\r\ner, it&#39;s possible that I&#39;m misunderstanding the question, in which case ple=\r\nase let me know.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding the quote that says, &quot;the CPPN speaks a=\r\n language through its pattern,&quot; this idea conveys that of course there is m=\r\nore than one way to interpret the patterns output by CPPNs for this purpose=\r\n, and any such method of interpretation is a kind of language.  In other wo=\r\nrds, there might be other perfectly legitimate ways of deciding which conne=\r\nctions to express from an infinite-resolution pattern that are different fr=\r\nom the method in the paper (i.e. those would be different &quot;languages&quot; for t=\r\nhe CPPN to express what it wants).  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, the &quot;language&quot; sugge=\r\nsted in the paper is nice in the sense that it allows the CPPN to express o=\r\nne type of connection without being forced to express another at the same t=\r\nime - that&#39;s what the band pruning achieves.  Otherwise you&#39;d get points ch=\r\nosen on both sides of a sharp border, forcing connections often to be chose=\r\nn in pairs (which seems an undesirable tendency).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;wilsontg80&quot; &lt;wilsontg@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI am puzzled by the result of band pruning in Figure 3: Example point selec=\r\ntion in two dimensions, from Evolving the Placement and Density of Neurons =\r\nin the HyperNEAT Substrate.  It seems like the information inherent in the =\r\nimage should include points along the black-white edge of the outer black r=\r\negion, but band pruning removes them all.  The figure explains &quot;In effect, =\r\nthe CPPN speaks a language through its pattern that denotes exactly which w=\r\neights within the hypercube should be expressed.&quot;  I am curious why &quot;langua=\r\nge&quot; is used here.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My goal is to add iterated ES-HyperNEAT to=\r\n the C++ version at https://github.com/MisterTea/HyperNEAT.
