Thanks for sharing the paper and video&#39;s.  I&#39;ve given the paper a\n&gt; quick read, but I really need to spend more time on it.\n\nHi Ken. Thanks for checking it out. What did you think of the videos? I am\ninterested to see if others agree with my feelings that the HyperNEAT\nrobotic gaits look pretty natural and are of high quality.\n\nOne thing that some of the reviewers said is that they did not think these\nHyperNEAT gaits were as impressive as other gaits currently being produced.\nIt was not clear if they meant &quot;being produced via evolution&quot; or &quot;being\nproduced by computer science.&quot;\n\nDoes anyone know of other work out there where more better or more natural\ngaits are being produced? I&#39;m interested in determining how competitive\nthese gaits are with the best gaits that computer science and evolutionary\ncomputing have to offer.\n\nI really wish there was a benchmark in the legged robotics domain. It would\nbe cool if there was one robot body and simulator that we could all download\nand apply our techniques to, and then we could compare the top speed\nproduced or some other metric.\n\n&gt; I hope to be able to produce a paper from research we are conducting in a\n&gt; bio-med test environment.  We are running a compute fabric on a Linux Rocks\n&gt; cluster implementing a CUDA Roll.  HyperNEAT is implemented on the GPU warps\n&gt; with Bayesian forward and inverse refinement running on the CPU&#39;s (wefts)\n&gt; using MPI to share info.\n\nThat sounds very cool, although I must admit that I don&#39;t fully understand\neverything you describe. What is the problem domain? What exactly does &quot;\nBayesian forward and inverse refinement&quot; mean in this context?\n\nBest of luck with your project though. I look forward to learning more about\nit. \n\n-Jeff\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; We&#39;ll see how quickly we can resolve and refine myriad patterned models from\n&gt; large datasets.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ken Lloyd\n&gt; Watt Systems Technologies\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: neat@yahoogroups.com [mailto:neat@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Jeff\n&gt; Clune\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 13, 2009 3:29 PM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Evolving Coordinated Quadruped Gaits with the HyperNEAT\n&gt; Generative Encoding\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT I have wanted to see how it would\n&gt; perform at controlling legged robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepted, so I can share it with\n&gt; you now. \n&gt; \n&gt; A copy of the paper, and videos of the simulated robots, can be obtained\n&gt; here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://devolab.\n&gt; &lt;http://devolab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNEAT&gt;\n&gt; msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNEAT\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you find it interesting.

T.\n&gt; Evolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative encoding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing Special Section\n&gt; on Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. To appear.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks, such as navigating\n&gt; rough terrain, but the design of their control software is both challenging\n&gt; and laborious. Traditional evolutionary algorithms can produce these\n&gt; controllers, but require manual decomposition or other problem\n&gt; simplification because conventionally-used direct encodings have trouble\n&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. Such active\n&gt; intervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential solutions, and\n&gt; requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the problem&#39;s\n&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and promising\n&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can evolve quadruped gaits\n&gt; without manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that HyperNEAT is\n&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more easily\n&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first neuroevolutionary\n&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, which may aid its\n&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encoding control, and\n&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressive quadruped gaits and vastly\n&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT individuals\n&gt; are more holistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in better\n&gt; coordination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results suggest that\n&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems for complex,\n&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@... &lt;mailto:jclune%40msu.edu&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
