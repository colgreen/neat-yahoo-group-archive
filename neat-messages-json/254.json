What did\nyou think of it?\n\nI found some of the ideas interesting, though I didn&#39;t\nunderstand some, and I wasn&#39;t especially clear on the\nexperimental setup.\n\nI like the idea of Multi-Objective Optimization and of\nspecifying a population of Evaluators that test\nLearners on specific objectives, though I don&#39;t admit\nto understanding how this actually works in practice.\n\nI&#39;ve already found in some informal experimentation\nwith unspeciated NEAT applied to Tic-Tac-Toe that\npopulations evolved directly against random movers\nlearn how to complete 2-in-a-row to get to a\n3-in-a-row win, and that those evolved directly\nagainst perfect players learn how to block opponent&#39;s\nwinning moves but perform poorly against random movers\nbecause they never learn how to complete winning moves\n(a perfect player never allows this situation).\n\nCan these two behavioral traits (completing winning\nmoves and blocking opponent&#39;s winning moves) be viewed\nas discrete objectives?  And then both of these types\nof Evaluators (one that allows completions of winning\nmoves and one that makes winning moves to be blocked)\nwould have to evolve in de Jong and Pollack&#39;s DELPHI\nparadigm, in order to test Learners against?\n\nI&#39;m just not clear on how Evaluators are chosen to be\nrepresentatives of specific objectives and how DELPHI\nwould work in practice with a game domain, even a\nsimple one such as Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
