Many people assume that it would =\r\nbe beneficial\nto evolve the parameters of a run (e.g. mutation rate, crosso=\r\nver rate,\netc.). After having done some research in the area I have conclud=\r\ned that it\ndoes not work well.\n\nWhen I expressed this view previously, some=\r\n of you were very skeptical. At\nthat point, I promised to share a manuscrip=\r\nt that investigates the issue\nonce it was published.\n\nThat manuscript final=\r\nly came out yesterday in the journal PLoS Computational\nBiology. I am rathe=\r\nr excited because they chose it for the cover of the\nSeptember issue. \n\nYou=\r\n can see it here:\nwww.ploscompbiol.org\n\nClune, et. al. =B3Natural Selection=\r\n Fails to Optimize Mutation Rates for\nLong-Term Adaptation on Rugged Fitnes=\r\ns Landscapes.=B2\n\nI am interested to see what you think. In particular, I w=\r\nould like to hear\nfrom those of you that were skeptical of my claim. Do you=\r\n still feel that\nevolution can manage itself in light of this work? Note: I=\r\n recognize that\nthis paper only covers mutation rates. However, the mutatio=\r\nn rate is one of\nthe most important parameters. Furthermore, I think simila=\r\nr issues will\narise with other parameters that result in the perturbation o=\r\nf genomes (e.g.\ncrossover type and rate).\n\n\nPS. PLoS allows readers to rate=\r\n articles. If you enjoyed the article, and\nhave a second, please rate it hi=\r\nghly. I would really appreciate it!\n\nPPS. If you are reading this email aft=\r\ner October 25th or so, here is a\ndirect link to the article.\n\nhttp://www.pl=\r\noscompbiol.org/doi/pcbi.1000187\n\nPPPS. I have another paper that found that=\r\n evolving parameters did not work\ntremendously well. That paper covered mor=\r\ne than just mutation rates. You can\ncheck that out here:\n\nhttps://www.msu.e=\r\ndu/~jclune/publications/CluneEtAl-meta-GAs.pdf\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigita=\r\nl Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
