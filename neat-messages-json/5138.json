It does not necessarily indicate a problem with the NEAT code it=\r\nself; more likely it reflects something about the system parameters used in=\r\n the particular experiment.  For example, if the compatibility threshold C_=\r\nt is too low, it will encourage having many species.  The coefficients of c=\r\nompatibility (c1,c2,c3) also can have an affect on how whether individuals =\r\nare considered compatible (i.e. in the same species).\n\nThe compatibility th=\r\nreshold can be difficult to decide, so many version of NEAT shift it dynami=\r\ncally to try to maintain a target number of species.  For example, if you w=\r\nant an equilibrium of 10 species but you have 15, then C_t should be raised=\r\n to make species more inclusive.  Conversely, if you have 5 species, C_t sh=\r\nould be lowered to make species more strict.  C_t can be raised or lowered =\r\nby an increment at each generation.  That way the system will always be cha=\r\nsing the desired target state, though it will not necessarily always hit it=\r\n perfectly.\n\nGrowth in species may also reflect too much structural mutatio=\r\nn.  For example, if the probably of adding a node or connection is very hig=\r\nh, then new species will proliferate so fast that NEAT cannot keep up (i.e.=\r\n the new species won&#39;t have time to optimize before they in turn start spaw=\r\nning new species).  So turning down mutation can also help with this kind o=\r\nf species explosion.\n\nThe dropoff_age is a way to penalize stagnation.  It =\r\ndoes not kill of species after e.g. 50 generations;  rather, it kills the s=\r\npecies off after 50 generations of *stagnation*, which means lack of improv=\r\nement in maximum fitness.  The idea is, if a species has not improved in a =\r\nlong time, then the investment that it represents in CPU resources may not =\r\nbe worth it, so it can be caused to die out by massively penalizing it.  Of=\r\n course, using this technique is optional and up to the experimenter.\n\nken\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry=\r\n, that last message was sent prematurely.

There is  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a lot going on here, but I think I can state =\r\nthe problem simply  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; without getting into the details of the JNeat cod=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ken&#39;s paper describes speciation as occuring every generation.=\r\n   \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Speciation entails iterating over the population, and performing  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some rudimentary clustering using a compatibility function and  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n threshhold.  Pretty straightforward.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Indeed, this algorithm is i=\r\nmplemented in JNeat as the speciate()  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; method, but its only invoked a=\r\nt the beginning of evolution and  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; never again!  The growth and death =\r\nof species afterwards is  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; determined by some code in the epoch() meth=\r\nod that does not appear  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to resemble NEAT speciation.  I&#39;m concerned =\r\nthat whatever JNeat is  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing, it isn&#39;t what Ken had in mind, and it =\r\nleads to some strange  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; behavior.  Attached is a graph showing how the=\r\n number of species  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; grows during a run of the XOR experiment.  With a=\r\n population size  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of 500, it increases almost monotonically to 400 be=\r\nfore leveling  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; off after 40 generations.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Shouldn&#39;t the spec=\r\niate() method be called after ever generation/ \n&gt; &gt;&gt; epoch?  Isn&#39;t this way=\r\n too many species?  Approximately how many  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; species would you expect =\r\nfor the XOR experiment with 500 individuals?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D=\r\naniel\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
