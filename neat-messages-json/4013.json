And I have \nopenly =\r\nstated as much on more than one occasion. But as I am sure \nthat you are aw=\r\nare, a concept once let loose, is free to become more \nthat what may have b=\r\neen originally envisioned. \n\nI am indeed aware of the work involved in usin=\r\ng NEAT for everyday \nengineering tasks, and making substantial upgrades to =\r\nthe source code \ninfrastructure to unlock its potential (i.e. greater than =\r\na man-year).\n\nI&#39;m confident in the statement that each proposed update sugg=\r\nested to \ndate has already been accomplished (on NEAT, not HyperNEAT). It w=\r\nould \nbe an error to assume otherwise. So I have more than a concept of \nwh=\r\nats involved.\n\nThe problem, if you want to characterize it as such, is that=\r\n my \nefforts are directed towards everyday engineering tasks which are not =\r\n\npublic in nature, and the burden of writing papers is substantially \ngreat=\r\ner than just the writing. The experiments are the everyday jobs \nthat need =\r\nto get done.\n\nYour efforts are not unappreciated. But when you put somethin=\r\ng \nforward with associated claims, its reasonable to assume that you \nhave =\r\ndone your homework and are in a position to answer reasonable \nquestions as=\r\n they relate to your claims.\n\nAsking questions such as:\n\n1) What benchmarks=\r\n against known quantities, have you made \ncomparisons against your claims, =\r\nto help us understand where in the \nAI landscape we should place your claim=\r\ns,\n\n2) What computational cost comparisons have you performed against \nothe=\r\nr known quantities, to help us understand what the costs of your \nclaims ar=\r\ne.\n\nThese are not adversarial questions. They are the normal types of \nques=\r\ntions that are routinely addressed in the body of a technical \npaper or pre=\r\nsentation making various claims.\n\nIf you fail to answer the questions up fr=\r\nont in the technical \npresentation/paper itself, it is reasonable to expect=\r\n follow-on \nquestions in an attempt to nail these issues down. If you negle=\r\nct to \nanswer these questions, it is also a reasonable expectation others \n=\r\nwill wonder why.\n\nIt is my opinion that the concept of NEAT has so much mor=\r\ne potential \nthan you have exercised publically to date. \n\nFor whatever you=\r\nr reasons are, perhaps as simple as alignment with \nresearch interests, you=\r\n have left a lot on the table. And that is \nyour right. It would just be mo=\r\nre helpful to all if you would be more \nforthcoming in regards to the bound=\r\ns of your agenda, and provide \nreasonable answers to questions related to y=\r\nour claims and \npresentations, so that they may be promptly and properly cl=\r\nassified, \nrather than discovering them after the fact in a protracted mann=\r\ner.\n\nNobody said being the big dog was easy!\n\nRespectfully,\nAndy Carl\n\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The lack of sci=\r\nentific/methodical approach in demonstrating \nability \n&gt; &gt; to discover patt=\r\nerns, a priori known patterns, before attempting \nto \n&gt; &gt; demonstrate a &quot;ki=\r\nller-application&quot;, for which there is no known \n&gt; &gt; figure of merit to comp=\r\nare &quot;ability to discover patterns&quot;, is \n&gt; &gt; disturbing, and expecting an in=\r\nordinate level of faith on the \npart of \n&gt; &gt; the reader.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The lack =\r\nof any comparative computational cost data is equally \n&gt; &gt; disturbing, and =\r\nbegs the question, especially since there appears \nto \n&gt; &gt; be a growing bod=\r\ny of user experience that the computational cost \nis \n&gt; &gt; steep. But the in=\r\nformation should be up-front going in rather \nthan \n&gt; &gt; withheld and unansw=\r\nered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy, I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s bothering you.  You expres=\r\ns\n&gt; impatience that every possible question has not been answered within\n&gt; =\r\none year of the debut of a completely new methodology.  It verges on\n&gt; para=\r\nnoia to suggest that we are &quot;withholding&quot; information (the \nsource\n&gt; code i=\r\ns released; anyone can perform any experiment that they \nwish). \n&gt; I suppos=\r\ne you just don&#39;t realize how much effort goes into running\n&gt; experiments an=\r\nd writing papers. \n&gt; \n&gt; Notice that others in this group ask questions that=\r\n are couched as\n&gt; friendly discussion.  Yet you take the attitude that some=\r\none is \nhiding\n&gt; something from you and you are therefore &quot;disturbed.&quot;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; You should change your tone.  Instead of attacking the source for \nnot\n&gt;=\r\n having answered every question that you have and performed every\n&gt; experim=\r\nent that you personally believe we should ever perform, why \nnot\n&gt; put it m=\r\nore like, &quot;It would be interesting to see if...&quot;  or &quot;One\n&gt; experiment I&#39;d =\r\nlike to perform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting question \nis\n&gt; whether...&quot; In ot=\r\nher words, what is accomplished by your aggressive,\n&gt; confrontational demea=\r\nnor?\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember hearing once, though I do not remember the source, an\n=\r\n&gt; interesting quote on scientific research.  To paraphrase: &quot;Good\n&gt; scienti=\r\nfic research answers hard questions.  However, the best\n&gt; scientific resear=\r\nch raises entirely new questions that we never \ncould\n&gt; have even asked bef=\r\nore.&quot;  Think of quantum physics.  The uncertainty\n&gt; principle has led to en=\r\ndless discussion of paradoxes and\n&gt; impossibilities, with no end in sight, =\r\nbut we do not see people\n&gt; accusing Heisenberg of trying to hide the &quot;truth=\r\n.&quot;  Instead, it is a\n&gt; credit to his discovery that we are now asking such =\r\nprofound \nquestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; So let me suggest to you that you change your ton=\r\ne and drop the\n&gt; confrontational demeanor.  That is not an appropriate way =\r\nto speak \nto\n&gt; colleagues, or to anyone else for that matter, and I sincere=\r\nly hope \nto\n&gt; maintain the exceptional positive atmosphere this group has \n=\r\nmaintained\n&gt; throughout 5 years (believe it or not!) of fruitful and intere=\r\nsting\n&gt; discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me also add that I am not the moderator (who i=\r\ns Derek James, who\n&gt; has done an excellent job), and therefore this is just=\r\n my personal\n&gt; suggestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
