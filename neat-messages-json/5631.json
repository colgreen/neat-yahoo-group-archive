It&#39;s actually quite useful in that you can see the broad\nstructure of networks by sight whereas previously the random position\nof nodes largely visually obfuscated the structure.\n\nI&#39;m hoping to improve the layout a bit more by &#39;relaxing&#39; the node X\npositions within each layer such that total connection length is\nminimized (and thus highly connected node sub-nets should be drawn\ncloser together).\n\nSVN URL is:\nhttps://sharpneat.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sharpneat/trunk/SharpNeatV2\n\n - Colin\n\n"}}
