I think *time* might be another dimension of physical\n&gt;neurons.  In other words, there are likely nuances in a physical\n&gt;neuron&#39;s firing and the *timing of the receptivity* of a\n&gt;related/connected neuron that had some level of influence on the\n&gt;evolution of the neurons and organ.  And therefore, likely have a\n&gt;reasonable influence on the emergent effects produced.  Which in turn\n&gt;effected the further evolution of both the neurons and organ.  A strange\n&gt;loop, so to speak.\n&gt;\n&gt;As you mention later, the neurons which are modeled in the ANNs we have\n&gt;been using in NEAT are very simple compared to physical neurons.  The\n&gt;idea that *all* the neurons activate in sequence (activation wave)\n&gt;before another activation wave begins is not very similar to nature at\n&gt;all.  However, the amount of computing capacity required to simulate the\n&gt;highly parallel, massively distributed and mildly chaotic (inherent\n&gt;noise) nature of physical neurons means it is much more difficult to\n&gt;simulate their behavior than the simple approach currently used.\n&gt;\n&gt;Haven&#39;t some experiments been done where they added the time component\n&gt;to the model and then were able to do some very sophisticated learning\n&gt;with very few neurons, compared to the simpler activation wave method?\n\nDo you mean Spiking Neural Nets?\n\nThey&#39;re pretty neat (sic) in some ways, I had a link, just a second...\n\nhttp://amygdala.sourceforge.net/understand_snn.php\n\nor maybe better:\n\nhttp://www.aiathome.com/articles/snnintro.pdf\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
