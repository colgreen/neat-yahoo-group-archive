It seems cute. =\r\nWe don&#39;t care that it&#39;s only 50\npercent humanlike. But when a robot becomes=\r\n 99 percent lifelike=E2=80=94so\nclose that it&#39;s almost real=E2=80=94we focu=\r\ns on the missing 1 percent. We\nnotice the slightly slack skin, the absence =\r\nof a truly human glitter\nin the eyes. The once-cute robot now looks like an=\r\n animated corpse.\nOur warm feelings, which had been rising the more vivid t=\r\nhe robot\nbecame, abruptly plunge downward. Mori called this plunge &quot;the Unc=\r\nanny\nValley,&quot; the paradoxical point at which a simulation of life becomes\ns=\r\no good it&#39;s bad.&quot;\n\nAnyway, I know Tyler is working in a Human/Computer Inte=\r\nraction lab. \nIs anyone else?  This is yet another interesting possible app=\r\nlication\nof ANNs.\n\nThe article suggests going back in the other direction--=\r\nmaking avatars\nless human, more stylized, more cartoonish.  But for those w=\r\nho want to\nforge ahead, and actually try to capture realism, this might be =\r\na very\ninteresting experimental domain.\n\nThere are all the facial muscles t=\r\no emulate, but I think the author\ntouched on one of the main problems with =\r\nhuman characters in games:\ntheir eyes.  Human eyes are constantly in motion=\r\n, their pupils\ndilating and constricting, their lids blinking.  I think jus=\r\nt\nrealistic emulation of eye movement would add a whole level of realism\nto=\r\n avatars, as opposed to the flat, fish-eyed gaze most of them have. \nAnd ne=\r\nural networks seem like a good fit for the control mechanism.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
