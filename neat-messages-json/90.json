Basically on close inspection of \nthe \n&gt; trees I can see a large number of redundant(neutral) nodes. \nAllowing \n&gt; neutral nodes to leak in effectively means that the fitness search \nspace \n&gt; is not closely coupled to the compatibility space. Two genomes \nthat \n&gt; describe the same network can have wildly different tree \nstructures due \n&gt; to large numbers of neutral nodes and are therefore deemed \nincompatible.\n&gt; \n\nCan you explain a little more what a &quot;neutral node&quot; is?  Even a \nnonfunctional node should not cause too much problem if historical \nmarkings are used, since you know which neutral nodes came from \nwhich lineages.  But I am not completely clear on what these nodes \nare and how they came to be.\n\nOne thing to consider about speciation is that it goes hand in hand \nwith complexification.  In other words, speciation facilitates \nstarting the entire population with a very small genome and \ncomplexifying from there.  But if you *don&#39;t* start that way, then \nthe effects of speciation are questionable, since many of the \nspecies will be protected without justification just because they \nhappen to be in the initial population.  Does your system start \nminimally?\n\n&gt; My evaluation function already goes some way to tackle this \nproblem by \n&gt; reducing the fitness scores with a punishment factor. This is \nbasically \n&gt; a weighted combination of genome size, decoded network size \n(complexity \n&gt; actually, since I factor in connections) and CPU decode time. \nHowever it \n&gt; seems the punishment is not strong enough to keep the neutral \nnodes from \n&gt; proliferating.  However if I increase the punishment too much I am \n&gt; afraid of stifling innovation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps one solution is to use a stepped punishment function. E.g. \n&gt; instead of:\n&gt; \n&gt; punishment = numberOfNodes / 3.0;\n&gt;   use\n&gt; punishment = floor(numberOfNodes / 3.0);\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this function allows genomes to more freely explore the \nsearch \n&gt; space in jumps of 3 nodes. When they reach 4, 7, 10 etc. they are \n&gt; suddenly punished and have a big step to overcome (which is bad). \nIn \n&gt; experiments this approach definitely improved search times, but I \nfeel \n&gt; the the stepping may come back to bite me.\n&gt; \n\nThis is a sensible fix, but NEAT for example was designed to avoid \nthe need for this kind of ad hoc fitness tinkering.  If you start \nminimally and speciate, the system should tend towards minimality \nwithout the need for penalities.\n\n&gt; Out of curiousity does anyone know if NEAT has been applied to the \nprey \n&gt; capture problem? This is the only environment I have available to-\ndate \n&gt; for comparison with other systems.\n&gt; \n\nJonothan Vincent did some predator-prey work.  Hopefully he will \nrespond- he&#39;s in this group.  I think Umer also worked with predator-\nprey.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
