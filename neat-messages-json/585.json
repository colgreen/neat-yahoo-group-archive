Its not\n&gt; particularly clean, or well\n&gt; documented, and I don&#39;t have a lot of time to make\n&gt; it so now (I will\n&gt; probably over the summer if there is enough\n&gt; interest). If you need it\n&gt; before then, I can send it to you, and I can go over\n&gt; some of the\n&gt; implementation quirks with you. Otherwise just keep\n&gt; poking me and I&#39;ll\n&gt; make a public release.\n\nThanks for the offer.  But yeah, for now we&#39;re working\non a paper for GECCO as well, hopefully for inclusion\nby the late-breaking paper deadline.  It&#39;s basically a\ncomparative study of complexification (additive\nneuroevolution) and simplification (subtractive\nneuroevolution) and both dynamics combined, all in the\ncontext of NEAT.\n\nBut one of our next experimental goals includes\nindirect encoding.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m also very interested in an indirect encoding\n&gt; using NEAT, so I&#39;d\n&gt; definitely like to see the results of such a\n&gt; comparison.\n\nYes...there are so many different possible approaches\nto indirect encoding, it&#39;s an exciting area to\nexplore.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
