In the multiplayer mode, the evolution of CPPN-control=\r\nled weapons in the game is influenced by all the players online, making it =\r\n(as far as I know) the first example of real online content evolution in a =\r\nmultiplayer game.  The algorithm is called cgNEAT, for content-generating N=\r\nEAT.\n\nBoth game client and online server (for hosting your own galaxy) are =\r\navailable.  We are also hosting an official GAR server with high capacity b=\r\necause of our fast connection at UCF.\n\nThis project was very complex, in ef=\r\nfect involving the implementation of not just a game, but an online service=\r\n and a novel evolutionary algorithm, so there could be a few unanticipated =\r\nhiccups in the first release, but I think you will find it entertaining and=\r\n interesting.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
