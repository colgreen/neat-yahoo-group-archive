This person will at each timestep choose a random direction, wa=\r\nlk a few steps and plant a flag.\nIn the first case you will get a represent=\r\native sample of the landscape. In the second you get a trail with the diffe=\r\nrent flags being at similar heights. He might land on the planes and miss t=\r\nhe hills altogether. The landscape will be poorly represented.\nA more sophi=\r\nsticated search algorithm, will reduce the impact of this problem, as the p=\r\nerson will sometimes jump to faraway locations. The problem however will ne=\r\nver be eliminated, as a kind of a local search is in integral part of any f=\r\nitness directed search algorithm.\n\nAdditionally, I think there should be an=\r\nother subtler problem with random fitness directed search, which will manif=\r\nest itself in representations with variable size genotypes. It will cause t=\r\nhe code size to grow much faster than what is optimally wanted in a random =\r\nsearch and produce overly convoluted solutions, where in reality we we want=\r\n the solutions to be simple.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the best way to quantify the difference woul=\r\nd be to implement the kind of random search that you are interested in and =\r\nthen compare it in the same domain (and other domains, if you want to be th=\r\norough).  Of course, if you found that any type of completely random proces=\r\ns consistently outperforms fitness significantly in reasonable domains (as =\r\nnovelty does) it would be a huge shock.   \n&gt; \n&gt; You suggest that the random=\r\n search that we implemented is worse than the kind of random search that yo=\r\nu describe.  I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think there is an a priori reaso=\r\nn to believe that any given totally uninformed process is better than anoth=\r\ner.  You note that our random search may be more &quot;uneven,&quot; which could be t=\r\nrue, but there is no a priori reason to believe that being &quot;even&quot; is better=\r\n for a given domain.  Generally, even with totally random searches you are =\r\nfacing a kind of no free lunch situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably the most important =\r\nquestion underlying your curiosity is why we would expect novelty to be bet=\r\nter than random.  There are many answers to this question, but perhaps one =\r\nhelpful insight is that novelty is an informative gradient.  That is, quite=\r\n the opposite of random search, novelty is information-rich, which means th=\r\nat the novelty metric tells us a lot about how different points in the sear=\r\nch space relate to each other.  In fact, one way to understand the relation=\r\nship among random, fitness, and novelty, is to realize that fitness actuall=\r\ny provides less information than novelty, putting it between random and nov=\r\nelty on the scale of information-richness.  The reason fitness provides les=\r\ns information is that many behaviors that are different from each other rec=\r\neive the same fitness, whereas novelty search would notice their difference=\r\n.  Thus, in fitness-based search, moving among such conflated behaviors is =\r\nsimilar to a random search, because there is no gradient among them.  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot; &lt;lior_fainshil@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Looks like I missed that part. Sorry about that. If however I u=\r\nnderstand correctly what you did, it is not exactly a random search. You wr=\r\nite that you run NEAT with randomly assigned fitness. In such search there =\r\nshould be significant correlations between the tested individuals, since de=\r\nspite the random selection, much of the genetic material is inherited from =\r\npast individuals. This is not at all what we would want in a random search.=\r\n Additionally you would get genomes becoming larger with time(probably much=\r\n faster than we would want in a random search).\n&gt; &gt; I would expect these de=\r\nviations from a random search to cause an uneven exploration of the genotyp=\r\ne space. Thus the resulting performance should be worse than that of a rand=\r\nom search. I don&#39;t know however if the difference will be significant (It d=\r\nepends on the specifics of the evolutionary algorithm).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree th=\r\nat it seems that novelty search will spend less time on degenerate behavior=\r\ns than a random search. Any ideas on how to quantify this difference?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
