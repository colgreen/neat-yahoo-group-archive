However, there a=\r\nre other options available as well, so it&#39;s really a matter of your prefere=\r\nnce.\n\nHyperNEAT is an extension of NEAT, so it is not the same thing as NEA=\r\nT.  However, HyperNEAT implementations contain NEAT within them, since Hype=\r\nrNEAT extends NEAT.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;parmaia&quot; &lt;parmaia@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I has experimenting with coevolving predator and prey cr=\r\neatures controlled by a neural network, and used NEAT for the evolution, bu=\r\nt when I look for NEAT the first time, I saw that the latest version availa=\r\nble has from 2001 (or 2002, don&#39;t remember now). There is a newer version o=\r\nf the NEAT source code? Is HyperNEAT the &quot;evolution&quot; source code for NEAT? =\r\nWhich of them I should use?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your answers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I made=\r\n some adjustments to the original source code, to use QT instead of GTK, if=\r\n someone is interested on that, let me know and I will share these modifica=\r\ntions.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
