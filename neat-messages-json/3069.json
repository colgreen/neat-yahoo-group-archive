And I agree that it&#39;=\r\ns an interesting question \nwhether implicit vs. explicit matters for this k=\r\nind of &quot;targeting&quot; \nability.  My guess is that explicit is the same or bett=\r\ner because \nmaking such an operation implicit makes it somewhat indirect, w=\r\nhich \nmeans the route to a particular goal state may become more \nconvolute=\r\nd due to an inability to simply say directly what it should \nbe.  \n\nThese a=\r\nre obviously subtle issues that merit more research, since I \nam speaking o=\r\nnly from intuition.  It&#39;s a really interesting topic.  \nWe can talk about t=\r\nhis more in Hawaii in a couple days :)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, J=\r\noseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Joe, I may not be fully understa=\r\nnding your point, so I wanted to \nask\n&gt; &gt; for clarification.\n&gt; &gt; My point w=\r\nas only that CPPNs can abstract away\n&gt; &gt; the temporal unfolding and local i=\r\nnteraction that are usually\n&gt; &gt; associated with development.  You are sayin=\r\ng something that does \nnot\n&gt; &gt; seem in opposition to this point, but I may =\r\nbe \nmisunderstanding.  It\n&gt; &gt; seems you are saying that &quot;pattern recognitio=\r\nn&quot; gives a powerful\n&gt; &gt; capability to traditional developmental systems in =\r\nterms of being\n&gt; &gt; able to target mutations to specific areas.  I would not=\r\n disagree\n&gt; &gt; with that point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, but such pattern matching is ind=\r\nependent of the \ndevelopmental  \n&gt; process, its a representational feature =\r\nthat could be added in to \nany  \n&gt; indirect encoding. Its just a different =\r\nway of specifying locality \nin  \n&gt; a slightly more &quot;unstructured&quot; way than =\r\nis done with CPPNs. In \nfact  \n&gt; it could certainly be used with CPPNs, in =\r\nthe same way we use it \nfor  \n&gt; neural networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to be clear th=\r\nat I believe the idea of &quot;pattern \nrecognition&quot;  \n&gt; in development is compl=\r\netely independent of local interactions  \n&gt; determining &quot;where am i?&quot; Furth=\r\nermore, I believe this idea plays \na  \n&gt; role in determining evolvability.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, what I would say, which may simply be consistent with \n=\r\nwhat\n&gt; &gt; you are saying, is that CPPNs abstract away the need for there \nto=\r\n be\n&gt; &gt; such pattern recognition in order to get either global or local\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n targeted mutations.  I still submit that the targeted mutations \nto\n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nich you are referring ultimately hinge on &quot;where am I?&quot;  \nBecause\n&gt; &gt; how d=\r\nid the liver cell ultimately figure out it was a liver cell?\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s becau=\r\nse of its neighbors, and so forth.  It&#39;s all context-\n&gt; &gt; dependent.\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\nut it doesn&#39;t have to be determined from the neighbors. A cell \ncould  \n&gt; j=\r\nust have a context determined by overlapping regulatory regions \non a  \n&gt; f=\r\nixed substrate (like how CPPNS and implicit NEAT work). These  \n&gt; overlappi=\r\nng regulatory regions are what I&#39;m trying to get at here: \nA  \n&gt; regulatory=\r\n region in a gene does exactly the &quot;pattern \nrecognition&quot;  \n&gt; that we are d=\r\niscussing. For instance, a cell at some fixed \nlocation  \n&gt; could respond t=\r\no some regulatory signals A, B, and C. These \nsignals  \n&gt; exactly determine=\r\n the cell&#39;s context within development, and \nother  \n&gt; cells with the exact=\r\n same signals would be treated the same, even  \n&gt; though they may be locate=\r\nd in spatially diverse areas.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand, in the CPPN, th=\r\ne liver is a local coordinate\n&gt; &gt; frame (i.e. some internal node) that is b=\r\nuilt upon (i.e. a \nfunction\n&gt; &gt; of) other coordinate frames.  So in effect =\r\nthe same thing is \ngoing\n&gt; &gt; on, just in a different way.  But ultimately i=\r\nt &quot;knows&quot; it is a\n&gt; &gt; liver cell in either case.  In the CPPN this knowledg=\r\ne is simply\n&gt; &gt; encapsulated as the node in the CPPN itself where the coord=\r\ninate\n&gt; &gt; frame is represented.  A mutation thereabout will effect only \nth=\r\nose\n&gt; &gt; cells within that coordinate frame.  So you get targeted \nmutations=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; just as well without &quot;pattern recognition.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, this is a good=\r\n example. The hierarchical nesting of \ncoordinate  \n&gt; frames in CPPNs and t=\r\nhe idea of doing pattern recognition for  \n&gt; matching regulatory signals ac=\r\ncomplish the same goal, although \nthey  \n&gt; are wildly different approaches.=\r\n One could almost say that a CPPN  \n&gt; builds definitions of locality &quot;expli=\r\ncitly&quot; while the regulatory  \n&gt; approach builds it &quot;implicitly.&quot; Which of t=\r\nhese representations \nis  \n&gt; better for what problems is an interesting ope=\r\nn problem in  \n&gt; representation design.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think what I&#39;m saying =\r\nis consistent with the results that you \ncite\n&gt; &gt; from your paper since I f=\r\nully believe that IF you are using a\n&gt; &gt; traditional developmental encoding=\r\n, &quot;pattern recognition&quot; indeed\n&gt; &gt; carries the benefits you cite.  So I exp=\r\nect you could \ndemonstrate it\n&gt; &gt; experimentally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again to be clear wh=\r\nere I disagree with you, &quot;pattern \nrecognition&quot;  \n&gt; can be used and is bene=\r\nficial independent of whether a \ntraditional  \n&gt; developmental encoding is =\r\nused.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think this is a great discussion to have.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have one (small) point of clarification to add to =\r\nyour\n&gt; &gt; exposition\n&gt; &gt;&gt; here:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;genes essentially &#39;pattern recog=\r\nnize&#39; certain areas in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; organism&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; That is absolutely c=\r\norrect for biological organisms, and for\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; iterated developmental syste=\r\nms in general.  However, the deep\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; question is *why* should they need =\r\nto &quot;pattern recognize&quot; \ncertain\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; areas?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And the answer is =\r\nbecause they need to know where they are.  In\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; effect, in the physical=\r\n universe, there is no intrinsic\n&gt; &gt; coordinate\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; system that cells can=\r\n query to ask their location.  Thus, they\n&gt; &gt; must\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; develop elaborate =\r\nand ad hoc ways of communicating to each\n&gt; &gt; other, as\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a group, where=\r\n everyone is.  I send my neighbor signals, my\n&gt; &gt; neighbor\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sends me s=\r\nignals back, and we negotiate our roles.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; My undoubtedly controv=\r\nersial contention is that the\n&gt; &gt; question &quot;where\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; am I?&quot; is the ONLY =\r\nreason that such negotation is necessary.  \nIf\n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t have to=\r\n ask that question, then you would not need to\n&gt; &gt; talk to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; your neigh=\r\nbors in order to determine your role.  Rather, you\n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; just com=\r\npute your role as a function of your known\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; coordinate/position in the=\r\n world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Your answer to &quot;why we need to pattern recognize&quot; is a li=\r\nttle\n&gt; &gt;&gt; incomplete. Basically you&#39;ve only answered this from the cell&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; perspective. Lets consider &quot;pattern recognize&quot; from the\n&gt; &gt; perspective=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the developmental program instead of the cell. Then the main\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nquestion is &quot;how do I select a bunch of cells that match some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; property=\r\n?&quot; That is, I want to select some contiguous region,\n&gt; &gt; e.g.,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;toe ce=\r\nlls&quot; or &quot;heart cells&quot; or maybe I want to select something\n&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dev=\r\nelopmentally useful, e.g. &quot;epithelial cells&quot; or &quot;cells in \nsome\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stripe=\r\n pattern along the HOX axis.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is this useful? Because then we=\r\n can make mutations that\n&gt; &gt; affect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; these areas and no others, i.e. mu=\r\ntation selectivity that is\n&gt; &gt; defined\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for some (hopefully) useful phe=\r\nnotypic axes of variation. A lot\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; useful things fall out natural=\r\nly from this idea, like modularity\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evolvability (this is where =\r\nI cite my GECCO 2007 paper, which is\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet on the web). In CPPN =\r\nterms it would be like being able to\n&gt; &gt; select,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; say, all the black st=\r\nripes in a sine grating, but not the white\n&gt; &gt; ones.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If I&#39;m not mistak=\r\nen, CPPNs support this idea of regional\n&gt; &gt; selection\n&gt; &gt;&gt; very nicely, so =\r\nI&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t mention it here.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I totally agr=\r\nee that doing away with the &quot;negotiation&quot;\n&gt; &gt; step\n&gt; &gt;&gt; required for develo=\r\npmental systems using purely local \ninteractions\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a useful optim=\r\nization, but I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to say that\n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt;&gt; able to &quot;pat=\r\ntern recognize&quot; certain areas serves the sole \npurpose\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; localiza=\r\ntion with respect to only the global coordinate system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ll go i=\r\nnto this issue in more detail in my talk at GECCO, but \nI\n&gt; &gt;&gt; think its ve=\r\nry important, and our empirical results seem to back\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; up quite s=\r\ntrongly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -- Joe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
