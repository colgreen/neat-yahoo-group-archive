So I \nam not comple=\r\ntely sure why you can&#39;t get access to the theCart \nobject.  One thing you m=\r\night do is try to remove the object \ndependencies and just stick the necess=\r\nary code into the experiment \ndirectly.  But as you say, there is no need t=\r\no actually run the pole \nbalancing loop in your project except for testing,=\r\n so I wouldn&#39;t put \ntoo much effort into it.\n\nThere is also a realtime game=\r\n loop in one of the other files that \ncomes with rtNEAT that shows how a po=\r\npulation of onscreen agents can \nbe all controlled at the same time by neur=\r\nal networks that evolve \neven as the game loop has master control.\n\nSorry t=\r\nhat I do not have a specific fix that I am aware of.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Jack Stone&quot; &lt;aoa_2012@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m new to this g=\r\nroup. \n&gt; I am an Irish games development student interested in AI, and I am=\r\n \n&gt; currently working on a fairly ambitious project using the Torque \n&gt; Sha=\r\nder Engine. One of the requirments of this project is quite a \n&gt; strong AI =\r\nModule.\n&gt; I had been intending to use a Neural Network for a while, and whe=\r\nn \nI \n&gt; say NEAT had been used in a Torque game already, I thought it \nwoul=\r\nd \n&gt; be fairly straight forward to use it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rtNEAT code itself work=\r\ns fine, and gives me what I&#39;m assuming \nis \n&gt; the correct output. However, =\r\nbecause NEAT doenst process per tick, \nit \n&gt; will freeze torque while it wo=\r\nrks, and then resume torque. This \n&gt; obviously wont work.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have read =\r\nthe help docs, and they say to look at \npole2_realtime_loop\n&gt; (). \n&gt; I am h=\r\naving difficulty however with supplying the arguments for \nthe \n&gt; realtime =\r\nloop: &quot;Population *pop, CartPole *thecart&quot;. They are \ncreated \n&gt; in *pole2_=\r\ntest_realtime(), and passed to the pole2_realtime_loop, \n&gt; which works fine=\r\n in the traditional implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I need to call pole2_test=\r\nrealtime from my game loop, and \nso, \n&gt; need a way to access the *pop and *=\r\nthecart parameters. I have \ntried \n&gt; declaring the Population and CartPole =\r\nobjects at the top of \n&gt; experiments.cpp, as static, extern, trying to use =\r\na get and set \n&gt; method, everything I can think of really, but I still cant=\r\n access \nthe \n&gt; *pop and *theCart objects from my realtime loop, so I cant =\r\ncall \n&gt; pole2_realtimeloop() every tick.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ultimately, I wont be using t=\r\nhe pole2 experiment in my game, but I \n&gt; thought that would be a good place=\r\n to start, instead of jumping in \nat \n&gt; the deep end so to speak. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d=\r\n appreciate any help on this matter, thanks,\n&gt; Jack.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
