One is effectively deconstructionist while the\nother is =\r\nconstructionist and many, many debates have gone round in\ncircles between t=\r\nhese two groups.\n\nI also agree 100% that those of us working in EC are like=\r\nly going to\nmake discoveries that a biological researcher may miss.  The mo=\r\nst\ninteresting part is that the EC researcher is observing an emergent\nproc=\r\ness rather than deconstructing a pre-existing system.  The\nobviously diffic=\r\nult aspect is to establish a hypothesis for what led\nto the emergence.  Fin=\r\nding parallel processes in biology serves as\nvalidation.  The obvious first=\r\n step is to provide a medium from which\nunexpected results can emerge.  NEA=\r\nT goes a long way toward this by\nallowing significant structural innovation=\r\ns.  \n\nA bit of an aside, the ability to establish modularity may be a\nsigni=\r\nficant next step.  Most EC applications are limited in this\ncapacity.  I&#39;m =\r\nnot sure if NEAT is fully compatible with modularity or\nnot - thoughts?\n\nEx=\r\ncellent discussion!

Don&#39;t get me wrong- u=\r\nnderstanding the actual mechanisms \n&gt; does provide clues to the underlying =\r\nexplanation, but they do not in \n&gt; themselves capture it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s easy =\r\nto get into a debate on what an &quot;explanation&quot; actually \n&gt; means.  AI resear=\r\nchers usually hold a really high standard for \n&gt; explanation, which is that=\r\n a good explanation tells you how to \n&gt; implement something yourself.  So f=\r\nor example, if you have an \n&gt; explanation of intelligence, it should tell m=\r\ne how to build it.  If I \n&gt; can&#39;t do that, then it&#39;s not reaching the tresh=\r\nold.  AI is sometimes \n&gt; criticized for having such an absurdly high standa=\r\nrd for theoretical \n&gt; validation.  Nevertheless, I think that I personally =\r\ntend to \n&gt; sympathize with the implementation-centric mentality.  I want to=\r\n know \n&gt; how to do it myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I think that kind of thinking leads =\r\nto higher levels of \n&gt; abstraction.  Sure, there may be in effect more than=\r\n 30,000 genes, \n&gt; for a variety of physical reasons.  Yet there are even on=\r\nly \n&gt; 3,000,000,000 base pairs in the entire human genome.  That is still \n=\r\n&gt; magnitudes below 100 trillion.  Not that such an argument invalidates \n&gt; =\r\nthe idea that information can be combined in different ways- of \n&gt; course t=\r\nhat is exactly what&#39;s going on- but the question is, how \n&gt; exactly?  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n And my thoughts like many in EC gravitate towards ideas in indirect \n&gt; enc=\r\noding, which has grown up mainly in EC.  Of course, for myself and \n&gt; my st=\r\nudents, this line of thought has culminated in the \n&gt; HyperNEAT/CPPN style =\r\nof explanation, which is that in effect \n&gt; regularities are discovered that=\r\n can be expressed as functions of \n&gt; space and thereby encode spatial patte=\r\nrns.  As those regularities \n&gt; evolve, they are elaborated upon, which at a=\r\n high level of \n&gt; abstraction means that they are composed with yet more \n&gt;=\r\n functions.  The nice thing about such a process is that you \n&gt; can easily =\r\ndiscover simple regularities early (thereby addressing the \n&gt; issue of sear=\r\nch, the second part of my question), and they form a \n&gt; scaffold for future=\r\n elaboration.  Furthermore, it creates patterns as \n&gt; a function of Cartesi=\r\nan space, which is what you need to do if you \n&gt; are going to create someth=\r\ning situated in a physical/geometric \n&gt; universe.  The explanatory appeal o=\r\nf this idea, which is \n&gt; substianally more abstract than the nuances of RNA=\r\n-&gt;protein encoding, \n&gt; is that you can actually implement it, so it&#39;s an AI=\r\n-style \n&gt; explanation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if it is a proper abstraction, the e=\r\nxplanation must \n&gt; ultimately reduce down to the mechanisms of biology, whi=\r\nch I believe \n&gt; it does.  In particular in Meinhardt&#39;s &quot;Theoretical aspects=\r\n of \n&gt; pattern formation and neuronal development&quot; \n&gt; (http://www.eb.tuebin=\r\ngen.mpg.de/departments/former-departments/h-\n&gt; meinhardt) you can see how g=\r\nenetic regulatory networks in biology in \n&gt; effect encode chemical gradient=\r\ns into spatial patterns that form the \n&gt; basis of other more complex spatia=\r\nl patterns situated in the \n&gt; coordinate frames of the original gradients. =\r\n The term I like to use \n&gt; is &quot;a plan upon a plan upon a plan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; In any=\r\n case, that is the direction I would go with answering such a \n&gt; question m=\r\nyself, which is influenced by biology but not as physically \n&gt; mechanistic =\r\nas biologists often prefer to be.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; First off, I apologize if th=\r\nis is a double post.

Once \n&gt; DNA\n&gt; &gt; is transcribed to RNA, RNA is processed =\r\nand can result in multiple\n&gt; &gt; variants which can then lead to subtle diffe=\r\nrences in the translated\n&gt; &gt; proteins.  An example is the Retinoid X Recept=\r\nors.  On particular\n&gt; &gt; subset, i.e. RXR-alpha, has one gene but multiple i=\r\nsoforms resulting\n&gt; &gt; from RNA variants.  Each of these has subtly differen=\r\nt activities \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; respect to retinoid binding, DNA specificity, tran=\r\nscriptional \n&gt; control,\n&gt; &gt; etc.  This effectively amplifies the number of =\r\napparent genes we \n&gt; have.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, not all genes are expressed in al=\r\nl cells.  Cells have somewhat\n&gt; &gt; specific controls over what genes are exp=\r\nressed, to what level they\n&gt; &gt; are expressed, and when they are expressed. =\r\n This gives each cell \n&gt; type\n&gt; &gt; a different proteome that specifies that =\r\ncells behavior and \n&gt; function.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just to add to the complexity, p=\r\nroteins will be influenced by the\n&gt; &gt; milieu in which the are present.  For=\r\n example, tamoxifen has been\n&gt; &gt; commonly used as an anti-breast cancer age=\r\nnt due to its ability to\n&gt; &gt; antagonize the estrogen receptor, which is req=\r\nuired for growth of \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; breast cancer tumors.  In cervical cells, h=\r\nowever, tamoxifen acts as\n&gt; &gt; an AGONIST.  Based upon the cellular context =\r\nin which the receptor \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; present, tamoxifen exhibited different role=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fractal analogy used in one of the replies is somewhat \n&gt; a=\r\npplicable\n&gt; &gt; and I would extend this to an analogy with Steering Behaviors=\r\n (as\n&gt; &gt; exemplified by Craig Reynolds).  In both these systems you have a =\r\n\n&gt; very\n&gt; &gt; simple set of rules leading to very complex behaviors.  Given t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; complexity of protein expression and its role in determining cell\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; behavior, the resulting set of highly complex rules provides a \n&gt; medium\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; in which emergence of brain and mind can occur.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Kirk\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Tuohy&quot; &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the answers were indeed lacking.

Two points which I rely on are (1)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generation=\r\ns were occuring much more rapidly for microorganisms \n&gt; (and on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a muc=\r\nh smaller genome), so a billion years is a long time and (2) \n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nearch space isn&#39;t being searched for, say, a human-like solution \n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; at once.

Like you said, they sort of answered \n&gt; accurat=\r\nely, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was no real insight or thoughtfu=\r\nlness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s interesting t=\r\nhat you point out this exchange \n&gt; because I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; highlights a weakness in how biologists have been \n&gt; dealing with\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question of complexity. It&#39;s such a fundament=\r\nal question\n&gt; &gt; yet it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t really received the treatment=\r\n it deserves, even\n&gt; &gt; from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field&#39;s luminaries. I think=\r\n part of the problem is that \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genuine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treatme=\r\nnt requires a kind of algorithmic and \n&gt; representational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theor=\r\ny,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is perhaps better attacked from a computational\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perspective,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; putting evolutionary computation res=\r\nearchers at an \n&gt; advantage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we think ab=\r\nout search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; routinely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I think you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably =\r\ncome\n&gt; &gt; at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem from an angle that might be more prod=\r\nuctive, but \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially disappointed in Wolpert, who wa=\r\ns the main \n&gt; voice for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developmental biology on the panel. Y=\r\nour question gets to \n&gt; issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a development=\r\nal biologist should primarily be interested \n&gt; in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devel=\r\nopment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the human brain, he should have been ab=\r\nle to give other \n&gt; examples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he was mo=\r\nre familiar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko =\r\nRakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A \n&gt; small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of \n&gt; neocortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; expansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?\n&gt; _ob=3DArticleURL&_=\r\nudi=3DB6T0V-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3Y6PFXS-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; 1P&_user=3D1=\r\n0&_rdoc=3D1&_fmt=3D&_orig=3Dsearch&_sort=3Dd&view=3Dc&_acct=3DC000050221\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &_version=3D1&_urlVersion=3D0&_userid=3D10&md5=\r\n=3D4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e43\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The more than 1000-fold =\r\nincrease in the cortical surface\n&gt; &gt; without a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comparable inc=\r\nrease in its thickness during mammalian\n&gt; &gt; evolution is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expl=\r\nained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis of\n&gt; &gt; cortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; development.

Yet I \n&gt; find that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explana=\r\ntion doubtful given that we were after all at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;debate&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and complexity, which is precisely the =\r\n\n&gt; substance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. I also agree that Da=\r\nwkins seemed closest to \n&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about it, so I&#39;d=\r\n guess Dawkins would be very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our area of EC if only there was an opportunity to tell \n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of expe=\r\nrience\n&gt; &gt; with it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess you didn&#39;t have a chance to corner him an=\r\nd talk \n&gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) Dawkins does seem like he=\r\n would be interested in a lot \n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bein=\r\ng presented at GECCO.
