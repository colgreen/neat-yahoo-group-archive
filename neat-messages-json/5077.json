One can then\neither (A) completely replace the set of test cases every N\ngenerations or (B) Use a rolling circular buffer to replace some small\nproportion of cases each generation.\n\nSuch a scheme (B particularly) gives you a more constant fitness\nlandscape such that the fitness of genomes is comparable within a\ngeneration and also to some degree between generations and thus\nmitigates/alleviates some of the problems resulting from what is\neffectively a noisy fitness landscape.\n\nAs for bloat, I take a pragmatic view that it exists to some extent\n(which I think we can all agree on even if we don&#39;t agree by how much)\nand thus some mechanism to contain it is desirable - hence phased\npruning.\n\nBTW SharpNeat 2 development code does now provide HyperNEAT but alas\nno phased pruning just yet.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
