However, the big difference for novel=\r\nty search is that it brings open-endedness to any domain.  For open-ended a=\r\nlife, you have to create a competitive simulated world and see what happens=\r\n within it. With novelty search you can get open-ended dynamics wherever yo=\r\nu want, without needing to define an alife scenario.  So we can run novelty=\r\n search on traditional machine learning domains like biped robots, mazes, p=\r\nole-balancers, etc., and thereby unlock our interest in open-ended discover=\r\ny from the exclusive province of artificial life.  \n\nThe other significant =\r\ndifference is that novelty search explicitly drives evolution towards novel=\r\nty, while the pressure in alife worlds is implicit, which means it is harde=\r\nr to control.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Gene Merdock &lt;genemerdoc=\r\nk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Both environmental complexity and Survive & Reproduce are=\r\n aspects that have for at least a decade been explored and written about (c=\r\nore wars, polyworld...).

This is not really an argument\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; with anything you said, but mainly a commentary on the meaning of &quot;obje=\r\nctive&quot; that I\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; think draws a useful distinction.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not s=\r\nure I agree with the spirit of your argument but it&#39;s just a\n&gt; \n&gt; gut feeli=\r\nng at this point so I&#39;ll have a go at clarifying my thoughts\n&gt; \n&gt; a bit fur=\r\nther and maybe I can home in a bit more on where I&#39;m\n&gt; \n&gt; disagreeing (if a=\r\nt all).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; By &#39;survive&#39; I mean - execute some strategy that results=\r\n in survival.\n&gt; \n&gt; So find food and shelter, avoid danger, etc. Good surviv=\r\nal strategy\n&gt; \n&gt; for the domain =3D&gt; good chance of surviving, bad strategy=\r\n =3D&gt; lower\n&gt; \n&gt; chance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In an EA that survival *strategy* is &#39;d=\r\no well on the fitness metric&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; (aka objective) - because the only way t=\r\no survive is to get selected\n&gt; \n&gt; by the EA&#39;s selection criteria. So I thin=\r\nk we can clarify the argument\n&gt; \n&gt; by drawing a distinction between survivi=\r\nng/reproducing and\n&gt; \n&gt; /strategies/ that lead to surviving and reproducing=\r\n. I think perhaps\n&gt; \n&gt; we (or I) have conflated the two. Survive/reproduce =\r\nis the high level\n&gt; \n&gt; [implicit] objective that is always present, and sur=\r\nvival /strategy/\n&gt; \n&gt; is what we normally refer to as objective or goal in =\r\nEC.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So far there&#39;s no distinction between nature/biology and EC.=\r\n To my\n&gt; \n&gt; mind nature has found complex /strategies/ for survival because=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A) Vastly more computational resource (or equivalent) [per uni=\r\nt time].\n&gt; \n&gt; B) Vastly more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; C) Vastly more complex domain.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s this latter point that I feel has tended to be overlooked. If y=\r\nou\n&gt; \n&gt; consider every living thing alive today and trace back through all =\r\nof\n&gt; \n&gt; their ancestors, then every single one of those zillions of organis=\r\nms\n&gt; \n&gt; executed a successful strategy that lead to survival. Considerably\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; more organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; world does try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one\n&gt; \n&gt; gen=\r\neration at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\n&gt; \n&gt; thos=\r\ne poor strategies in the hope of finding something better. What\n&gt; \n&gt; does h=\r\nappen though is that stragies are so complex (for creatures with\n&gt; \n&gt; large=\r\n brains anyway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find\n&gt; \n&gt; food)=\r\n and yet waste much time on poor sub-strategies (effectively\n&gt; \n&gt; stragey e=\r\nfficiency). Evolution will select for efficiency but unlike\n&gt; \n&gt; survival i=\r\nt&#39;s not a binary yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so\n&gt; \n&gt; more like t=\r\nhe small low scoring species in NEAT (from fitness\n&gt; \n&gt; sharing).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; It&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies that fit your idea of\n&gt; \n&gt; search=\r\ning with no objective, they piggy back on for the ride and very\n&gt; \n&gt; occasi=\r\nonally become useful. Where EC tends to fall short IMO is that\n&gt; \n&gt; the dom=\r\nain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so\n&gt; \n&gt; there&#39;s less =\r\nopportunty for exploring variations in strategy -\n&gt; \n&gt; branching off into m=\r\nultiple successful branches and sub-branches\n&gt; \n&gt; without a major loss in f=\r\nitness on the objective. Put another way, the\n&gt; \n&gt; natural world&#39;s fitness =\r\nlandscape is dominated by smooth undulations\n&gt; \n&gt; in all dimensions, wherea=\r\ns EC objectives tend to have a few\n&gt; \n&gt; sharp/steep local maxima.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Nature also provides a gentle selection pressure towards complex\n&gt; \n&gt; str=\r\nategies by providing resources that require increasingly complex\n&gt; \n&gt; strat=\r\negies to reach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evolve\n&gt; \n&gt; legs=\r\n ang lungs. And you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without evolving\n&gt; \n&gt; good ey=\r\nes and fast/strong muscles, etc. but the plants and meat were\n&gt; \n&gt; there as=\r\n an untapped resource until that first legged creature and\n&gt; \n&gt; first carni=\r\nvore came along. So we can see now that framing the\n&gt; \n&gt; survival as being =\r\nan objective that&#39;s been achieved on day one misses\n&gt; \n&gt; a lot of the key d=\r\nynamics that drive evolution. Surviving is the high\n&gt; \n&gt; level implicit obj=\r\nective, some species have not moved on from floating\n&gt; \n&gt; in the sea eatign=\r\n CO2 and sunlight, but other strategies were evolved\n&gt; \n&gt; to tap into new p=\r\nreviously untapped resources - and that climb from\n&gt; \n&gt; simple to complex r=\r\nesources utilisation continues to this day.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
