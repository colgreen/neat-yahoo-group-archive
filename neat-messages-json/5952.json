I don&#39;t know where the x is coming from.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps it would be good to create such a site (either as wiki or a more\n&gt; structured set-up) for artificial evolution research in general (with\n&gt; tags/categories for sub-fields).\n\nThe main issue with a general website is that it will never be the main\nreference. In my opinion, having a website with many sub-fields means that\nmost people in these sub-fields will not be aware of the website, that\nthey will use their own solutions and, overall, that the site will be\nmostly empty. As a consequence, people will not think about this website\nas _the_ place to check and to submit. Put differently, I think that such\na general website has a high probability of being a &quot;ghost website&quot;\nwithout enough inhabitants to survive. It&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; to program a website,\nit&#39;s much harder to make it alive and successful.\n\nThat&#39;s why we tried to do something for our own, small sub-field: our goal\nis to be one of the reference pages (and even this is hard!).\n\nThe only way I can envision a successful general website is if it is\nmandatory to publish a paper. For instance, GECCO could require the\nsubmision on a specific website of the source code of every accepted\npaper.\n\nBy the way, many journals in biology now require that the authors of\naccepted papers put their data (and potentially their source code) on the\nDryad repository (http://datadryad.org/). I hope the evolutionary\ncomputation field will be able to do the same!\n\n[Dryad could be used by the EC community but it does not accept\nGPL-licensed source code -- only creative commons --, whereas I think that\nmany EC frameworks are distributed with a GPL-like license]\n\nBest regards,\n-- JBM\nhttp://people.isir.upmc.fr/mouret/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
