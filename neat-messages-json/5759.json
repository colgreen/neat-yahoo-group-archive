Is it possible to train the evolved neural networks (as in Lamarckian =\r\nevolution)? Are there any learning mechanisms that exist for recurrent\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnetworks (such as backpropagation through time) implemented for them? How a=\r\nbout CPPNs? Are there any ways to train them in a way\n&gt; &gt; other than evolut=\r\nion?\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s a good question. I&#39;m not 100% sure, all I can say is that of=\r\n the\n&gt; learning methods I know of, generally they aren&#39;t used on recursive\n=\r\n&gt; networks. One of the outstanding tasks I have is to provide support\n&gt; for=\r\n evolving feedforward only nets as they are more useful in soem\n&gt; respects,=\r\n e.g. easier to reverse engineer and to apply further\n&gt; learning methods to=\r\n as you poijt out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Do the evolved networks contain standard fe=\r\ned-forward links implicitly? For example, consider a network with 5 inputs =\r\nand 5 outputs, that\n&gt; &gt; the visualizer shows only one link between one of t=\r\nhe inputs and one of the outputs. Are the other links missing or just not v=\r\nisualized by the\n&gt; &gt; library?\n&gt; \n&gt; What you see is that you get. The initia=\r\nl random populations have just\n&gt; inputs and ouputs and typically have some =\r\nsmall proportion of the\n&gt; inputs and outputs connected up; Evolution works =\r\nfrom there.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Why can&#39;t I define a CPPN with only 1 output? When=\r\n I do so the library throws an instance of IndexOutOfBoundException. But wh=\r\nenever I\n&gt; &gt; set the number of outputs to 2, everything works just fine.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sounds like a bug. As you&#39;re probabyl aware the dimensionality of the\n&gt; =\r\nsubstrate is not restricted in any way, but I may have maed an\n&gt; assumption=\r\n somewhere in the code that there would be at least 2\n&gt; dimensions. Let me =\r\nknow if this is still a problem and I&#39;ll look into\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. As=\r\n far as I know the set of activation functions and their parameters are fix=\r\ned, e.g., in order to create a repeating pattern the library\n&gt; &gt; contains o=\r\nnly Sin(2 * x). But what if the regularities to be modeled in some problem =\r\nrequires a repetition with a higher (or lower) frequency?\n&gt; \n&gt; The set of a=\r\nctivation functions is defined by\n&gt; IActivationFunctionLibrary, there are s=\r\ntandard sets defined by\n&gt; DefaultActivationFunctionLibrary.CreateLibraryNea=\r\nt() and\n&gt; CreateLibraryCppn(), but this can be replaced with a custom set o=\r\nf\n&gt; functions when you instantiate the IGenomeFactory, e.g. see the\n&gt; Creat=\r\neGenomeFactory() method in\n&gt; BoxesVisualDiscriminationExperiment.cs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; In the end, a lot of thanks go to Colin Green for his nice library.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Thanks, hope the above helps. Apologies for the late response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin=\r\n.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
