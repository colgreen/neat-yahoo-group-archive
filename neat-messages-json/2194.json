Since NEAT uses\nthe history to tell what the different species are, you will get more\naccurate speciation (in terms of ancestral relatedness) by keeping\nlinks around that are disabled, because they can be considered in\ncompatibility comparisons. \n\nA separate reason to keep them around is the theory that what was once\nuseful is likely to become useful again.  Many people believe this to\nbe the case for &quot;introns,&quot; which are essentially the biological\nversion of disabled genes in NEAT: introns are biological genes in the\ngenome that are not expressed in the phenotype.  However, scientists\nhave pointed out that introns sometimes come back into play in the\nfuture, and so may be a useful store of &quot;old solutions.&quot;  NEAT has the\nsame capability be reenabling (as occasionally occurs) disabled genes.\n\nThe reason none of this comes to play in XOR is likely because XOR is\nso simple.  There are so many ways to solve it compactly that it\ndoesn&#39;t really matter how you measure compatibility or whether you\nhave to rediscover the same thing again (since there are so few\noptions anyway).\n\nHowever, they may come into play in more complex problems.\n\nStill, that&#39;s not to say that anything is proven.  There has been muc\ndiscussion on this board about the utility of deleting genes, and in\nsome cases it does appear to offer a measurable benefit.  Therefore,\nthis question can be considered to be ultimately empirical, and I\n*think* it is still not settled (i.e. the particular question of\ndisabling vs. deleting when splitting a link).  It is actually quite\npossible neither way offers much advantage.  The larger question of\nwhether deletion of some sort in general is desirable is probably more\nsignifiant.\n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Matt Simmerson&quot; &lt;m.simmerson@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; When an add node mutation occurs, currently (AFAIK) it is best\n&gt; paractice to just disable the mutated link.  Has anyone tried removing\n&gt; it from the genome all together.  Is this a sensible thing to do, I\n&gt; guess the answer is suck it and see.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did test it with the XOR experiment and it worked fine.  Just\n&gt; wondered if there were any advantages/disadvantages with this approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n\n\n\n\n"}}
