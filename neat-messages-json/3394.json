Perhaps I should tweak the NEAT parameters or the set of \n&gt; activation f=\r\nunctions? \n&gt; \n\nPeter, in the experiment you are describing, are you using a=\r\n roving eye \nor just inputting a whole image into the substrate?  With Hype=\r\nrNEAT, it \nshould be possible to do recognition tasks without needing a rov=\r\ning eye.\n\nIn any case, I believe rotational invariance is indeed an activat=\r\nion \nfunction issue.  The problem is that you need to get the same pattern =\r\n\nof connects repeated in a rotating fashion, so that they can recognize \nro=\r\ntated images.  This kind of rotation is not a very natural byproduct \nof th=\r\ne usual set of activation functions.  I believe there is probably \na rotati=\r\nonal activation function that would be quite helpful, but I \nhave not resol=\r\nved what function that should be.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
