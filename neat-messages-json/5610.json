If human brains are a global optimum (or at leas=\r\nt a local one\nmuch higher than we currently have discovered), we are unlike=\r\nly to discover\nit unless there is some gradually increasing path of rewards=\r\n that leads us\nthere. Scientific curiosity aside, one of the most rewarding=\r\n reasons for\npursuing this goal is the power an artificial brain has to bet=\r\nter the world\nby being integrated into large-scale systems. Thus, as modern=\r\n systems\nprogressively grow more complex, it&#39;s important that we understand=\r\n how to\nleverage the increase in information and ability, otherwise we may =\r\nbe\nunnecessarily limiting ourselves to a spikey landscape.\n\nI do agree on t=\r\nhe fundamental insights about interactive evolution being a\nlargely untappe=\r\nd opportunity.

Right now we\nbasically have the situation =\r\nwhere thousands of developers are taking\n&quot;Machine Learning&quot; courses to lear=\r\nn how to use map-reduce to create basic\ncorrelation models and classifiers =\r\non big data.

In fact, novelty search was invented based on=\r\n\n&gt; observations of the process of discovery on Picbreeder. There is more to=\r\n be\n&gt; found there still, and crowd-so! urced evolution remains a wide-open =\r\narea\n&gt; with all kinds of unrealized possibilities\n&gt;\n&gt; GAR also shows that i=\r\nt can be implicit, so users don&#39;t even have to know\n&gt; what&#39;s going on. In a=\r\n few days I&#39;m actually heading off to an invited\n&gt; workshop on &quot;crowd sourc=\r\ning of research&quot; and &quot;scientific discovery games,&quot;\n&gt; where NE is standing a=\r\nlongside the various innovative ideas in crowdsourcing\n&gt; of recent years.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Still, Ghulam makes the point that &quot;big data&quot; perhaps is still a challen=\r\nge\n&gt; when we&#39;re talking about something like having many inputs into a neur=\r\nal\n&gt; network. That&#39;s a different issue for NE, but NE is taking steps in th=\r\nat\n&gt; direction with methods like HyperNEAT that don&#39;t really care how many =\r\ninputs\n&gt; you give them. We still face a challenge in the massive CPU utiliz=\r\nation that\n&gt; evolving populations of multimillion-connection networks requi=\r\nres, but\n&gt; perhaps the networked world offers or will offer novel opportuni=\r\nties for\n&gt; parallelization that can address the voracious need for CPU cycl=\r\nes in NE.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the same time, while it&#39;s true that there has been radical=\r\n progress in\n&gt; e.g. foreign language translation, the promise of big data i=\r\ns sometimes\n&gt; over-hyped. For example, my Amazon recommendations are as uni=\r\nnspiring as\n&gt; they were 10 years ago. And the stuff Netflix suggests that I=\r\n will like is\n&gt; usually somewhere between obvious and hilarious. Data-minin=\r\ng at its most\n&gt; grandiose rests on a kind of faith that there is some secre=\r\nt &quot;truth&quot; hiding\n&gt; deep in the masses of data that will reveal something so=\r\n subtle about me and\n&gt; you (and humanity) that we never even knew it. While=\r\n I&#39;m sure that buying\n&gt; habits are helpful to analyze for companies at the =\r\nmargins, it&#39;s unclear\n&gt; that it is always an AI revolution. It&#39;s true there=\r\n are 700M Facebook users,\n&gt; but you might look at that as a commercial oppo=\r\nrtunity more than an AI\n&gt; opportunity (crowd-sourced evolution and a few ot=\r\nher application excepted).\n&gt;\n&gt; After all, let&#39;s not forget that one of the =\r\ninspirations for NE is the\n&gt; evolution of brains, which predated all these =\r\nbuzzwords by millions of\n&gt; years. To some extent, the promise of NE is thus=\r\n independent of the modern\n&gt; world even as it is realized within it. If we =\r\ncould learn to evolve brains,\n&gt; it won&#39;t be a question of how we fit in wit=\r\nh the technologies of today, but\n&gt; how they fit in with us. Of course, that=\r\n is more at a Holy Grail level, but\n&gt; still important to keep in mind as we=\r\n watch modern technology evolve.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I don&#39;t want to dismiss the i=\r\ndea that all these things can\n&gt; synergize, because they can. Like I said cr=\r\nowd-sourcing is a huge untapped\n&gt; opportunity for NE and the commercial opp=\r\nortunities presented by the modern\n&gt; world (e.g. with millions of users and=\r\n mobile devices) are exciting in their\n&gt; own right, regardless of their cen=\r\ntrality to AI. We are definitely going to\n&gt; see NE exploiting these opportu=\r\nnities. As NE methods improve, the potential\n&gt; for them to be commercially =\r\nrelevant increases. For example, improvements in\n&gt; representation open up w=\r\nhole new applications, like our work in music\n&gt; evolution. NE has the curre=\r\nnt disadvantage of significantly less investment\n&gt; compared to other AI tec=\r\nhnologies, but it has the advantage of the element\n&gt; of surprise.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hi all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to start a discussion on where NE fits into the m=\r\nodern world.\n&gt; We&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; begun entering the age of &quot;Big Data&quot;-- 200M tweets=\r\n/day, 700M Facebook\n&gt; users,\n&gt; &gt; etc. We&#39;re also finding ourselves more imm=\r\nersed in computing technology\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; mobile phones become more ubiquitous=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in your thoughts.

Other areas seem to have\n&gt; flourished\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in the new world: NLP is regularly used to measure consumer sentiment in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; social media, graph analysis algorithms are used heavily at both Google=\r\n\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Facebook to determine which page to show or which friend&#39;s posts=\r\n to\n&gt; display\n&gt; &gt; in your feed.

We still face a challenge in the mass=\r\nive CPU utilization that evolving populations of multimillion-connection ne=\r\ntworks requires, but perhaps the networked world offers or will offer novel=\r\n opportunities for parallelization that can address the voracious need for =\r\nCPU cycles in NE.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the same time, while it&#39;s true that t=\r\nhere has been radical progress in e.g. foreign language translation, the pr=\r\nomise of big data is sometimes over-hyped.  For example, my Amazon recommen=\r\ndations are as uninspiring as they were 10 years ago.  And the stuff Netfli=\r\nx suggests that I will like is usually somewhere between obvious and hilari=\r\nous.  Data-mining at its most grandiose rests on a kind of faith that there=\r\n is some secret &quot;truth&quot; hiding deep in the masses of data that wi=\r\nll reveal something so subtle about me and you (and humanity) that we never=\r\n even knew it.  While I&#39;m sure that buying habits are helpful to analyz=\r\ne for companies at the margins, it&#39;s unclear that it is always an AI re=\r\nvolution.  It&#39;s true there are 700M Facebook users, but you might look =\r\nat that as a commercial opportunity more than an AI opportunity (crowd-sour=\r\nced evolution and a few other application excepted).&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAfter all=\r\n, let&#39;s not forget that one of the inspirations for NE is the evolution=\r\n of brains, which predated all these buzzwords by millions of years.  To so=\r\nme extent, the promise of NE is thus independent of the modern world even a=\r\ns it is realized within it.  If we could learn to evolve brains, it won&#39=\r\n;t be a question of how we fit in with the technologies of today, but how t=\r\nhey fit in with us.  Of course, that is more at a Holy Grail level, but sti=\r\nll important to keep in mind as we watch modern technology evolve.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, I don&#39;t want to dismiss the idea that all these things ca=\r\nn synergize, because they can.  Like I said crowd-sourcing is a huge untapp=\r\ned opportunity for NE and the commercial opportunities presented by the mod=\r\nern world (e.g. with millions of users and mobile devices) are exciting in =\r\ntheir own right, regardless of their centrality to AI.  We are definitely g=\r\noing to see NE exploiting these opportunities.  As NE methods improve, the =\r\npotential for them to be commercially relevant increases.  For example, imp=\r\nrovements in representation open up whole new applications, like our work i=\r\nn music evolution.  NE has the current disadvantage of significantly less i=\r\nnvestment compared to other AI technologies, but it has the advantage of th=\r\ne element of surprise.  &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Hi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like to start a discussion on where NE=\r\n fits into the modern world. We&#39;ve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; begun entering the age of &=\r\nquot;Big Data&quot;-- 200M tweets/day, 700M Facebook users,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; etc. W=\r\ne&#39;re also finding ourselves more immersed in computing technology as&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; mobile phones become more ubiquitous.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m int=\r\nerested in your thoughts. Specifically:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - Where does Neu=\r\nroevolution hold the most potential for internet&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; applications?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - What kind of data will NE be best suited to leverage?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - How does the ubiquity of mobile technology help NE-based =\r\napplications?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - As we now have over a billion people onl=\r\nine, what kind of large-scale&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; human feedback systems may be devise=\r\nd that rely on NE?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - What do you generally see as the fu=\r\nture of NE for consumer apps?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have my own thoughts on =\r\nthese, which I&#39;m happy to share, but I&#39;m really&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; interested=\r\n in what the community thinks. As the world has changed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; drasticall=\r\ny even since the first NEAT paper was published, keeping up with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nhe real world necessitates us periodically re-examining the practical&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; application space for our research area. Other areas seem to have flour=\r\nished&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in the new  world: NLP is regularly used to measure consumer=\r\n sentiment in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; social media, graph analysis algorithms are used hea=\r\nvily at both Google and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Facebook to determine which page to show o=\r\nr which friend&#39;s posts to display&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in your feed. Where does NE =\r\nfit in here?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wesley&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height=\r\n:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--90e6ba6e89ba3d974204a743480a--\r\n\n"}}
