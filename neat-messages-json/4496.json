Out of curiosity, did you do any parameter\nsweeps to see if P-NEAT&#39;s performance did much better, and better approached\nHyperNEAT&#39;s, with different parameter settings?\n\nFor example, since mutations to HyperNEAT have such larger effects on the\nfinal substrate, it could be argued that P-NEAT needs a much higher mutation\nrate to compete.\n\nNote: I don&#39;t think P-NEAT will beat HyperNEAT no matter what the settings,\nbut I do think the question is fair and I would not be surprised if the\nsettings that worked great for HyperNEAT are not the ones that work great\nfor P-NEAT (and vice versa). In short, I am confident that the qualitative\nresults of your paper are still all valid (and represent breakthroughs for\nthe field), but am interested to know whether the quantitative difference\nbetween the encodings might be much less with different settings.\n\nPS. As a side note, there are a ton of settings and sweeping them all is\nnearly impossible, especially when considering interactions. What does\neveryone in the group consider to be the important ones to sweep?\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
