I&#39;ve been working on poker\nAI i=\r\nn my spare time for the last 3 years.  I&#39;ve looked at a lot of the\nAlberta =\r\ngroup&#39;s work and talked to most of them at last year&#39;s AAAI\ncompetition.\n\nM=\r\ny general plan is to use KB-NEAT and a set of controllers + variables\nto ev=\r\nolve a network for rapid player modeling and exploitation in\nlimit (and pos=\r\nsibly no-limit) Hold Em.\n\nA lot of the knowledge in poker is very explicit =\r\nwith little\nexceptions.  For instance, &quot;cap with the nut flush&quot; (i.e. never=\r\n stop\nraising) is a perfect example of a piece of advice that works in 80%\n=\r\nof cases, but certain situations, like the board being paired,\ninvalidate t=\r\nhat advice.  I hope to help kick-start the learning\nprocess by developing a=\r\n fairly in-depth set of advice rules.\n\nMy bot will also deviate from the no=\r\nrmal approach of game_state -&gt;\natomic action (e.g., fold/call/raise).  Inst=\r\nead I&#39;m going to have the\nbot select a &quot;play&quot; at the start of each round.  =\r\nI define a play as a\nset of betting actions that handle any case in the cur=\r\nrent round.  An\nexample post-flop play (from first position) would be\nCheck=\r\n-Raise-Call.  Here, there is no way that the bot could ever reach\na situati=\r\non where it doesn&#39;t know what to do.\n\nI chose to use plays for two reasons.=\r\n  First, they simplify the input\nto the network as you do not have to consi=\r\nder the sequence of bets. \nSecond, I believe that most (non-novice) human p=\r\nlayers actually use a\nsimilar--or even higher level-- model when playing.  =\r\nFor instance,\ngood players no-limit players (and to a lesser extent, limit =\r\nplayers)\nwill often play a single hand in a loose fashion (usually attempti=\r\nng a\nlarge bluff), hoping that the next hand will give them a similar\nsitua=\r\ntion but with a legitimate hand.  In such cases, players are\nactually plann=\r\ning on making the bluffs and subsequent big hands well\nahead of time.  The =\r\nevidence for this should be the speed with which\nmost limit ring games are =\r\nplayed.  As the stakes rise, the speed of\nthe game tends to increase, as pl=\r\nayers create more abstract plays.\n\nThe inputs for my networks will be broke=\r\nn down into three main\ncategories: betting, stats, and history.  Betting wi=\r\nll simply be a\nrepresenation of the previous rounds&#39; bet history.  Stats wi=\r\nll\nencompass things like hand strength vs a random player, flush draw\nproba=\r\nbility, etc.\n\nHistory will be a set of player statistics broken into 3\nsub-=\r\ncategories: total, previous hand, and a variable range.  The\nstatistics for=\r\n each category will all be the same, with only the\nsample size varying.  To=\r\ntal will encompass the entire play history of\nthe opponent.  Previous hand =\r\nwill look only at the previous hand. \nVariable range will use the play over=\r\n the previous N hands (where N &lt;\n30).  This way I hope to be able to model =\r\nplayers that quickly change\ntheir play.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1) Is the=\r\nre a way I can use multiple networks per individual in the\npopulation?  I.e=\r\n., I want to have a separate network for each round,\nsince there are differ=\r\nent inputs (cards, bets) for each successive\nround.  I have considered maki=\r\nng one monolithic network and using\nextra nodes to represent on/off status =\r\nof the round-specific data, but\nI feel like that would add a lot of needles=\r\ns noise to the network.\n\n2) This is related to 1, but is there any way to a=\r\nlso encorporate\nother variables in my evolution parameters?\n\n3) Is there an=\r\ny code available for the KB-NEAT so I can incorporate my\ncustom advice?\n\n\nI=\r\nf anyone is interested in a more detailed description of the inputs,\nlet me=\r\n know.\n\n\nWesley\n\n\n"}}
