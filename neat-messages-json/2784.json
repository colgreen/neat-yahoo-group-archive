It would\nalso be interesting to work with more biologically plausible neural\nnetworks.\n\nSNNs are capable to encode information in the individual frequency of\nspikes and most of the work in the field is concentrated in\ncomputational neuroscience only.\n\nI was wondering how SNN could be used with NEAT in evolving more\n&#39;realistic&#39; neural controllers and how would that be compared to the\ncurrent models?\n\nCesar\n\n"}}
