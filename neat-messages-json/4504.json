It appears to=\r\n me that there is a \nsustained level of activity, but I was wondering if yo=\r\nu guys have looked at the stats lately. \nDo you know about how many people =\r\nactively use the site on a daily basis? Is use of the \nsite growing, steady=\r\n, or did it see and early spike and is now trailing off?\n\nI also recall tha=\r\nt in early discussions of this site, you were curious to see if pictures wo=\r\nuld \nbecome much better as the complexity of the networks grew due to the m=\r\nany increased \ngenerations that would be made possible by an active user ba=\r\nse. Have you found that \nthere is, say, a correlation between genome comple=\r\nxity and some success criteria (e.g. \nrank or num_branches)?\n\nThe ability t=\r\no purchase images on stuff like shirts and mugs is also cool. Have you foun=\r\nd \nthat a lot of people are doing that? Also, I am thinking of doing so mys=\r\nelf. Is the quality \npretty high? For example, does your firefly look good =\r\non a mug?\n\nThe reason I am asking is mostly curiosity. I am interested to k=\r\nnow how much the general \npublic gets...and stays...engaged in these types =\r\nof very cool, social, web 2.0 experiments. \n\n\nCheers,\nJeff\n\n\n"}}
