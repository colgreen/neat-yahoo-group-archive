The common neural networks have no RAM\ncapability and cannot be trained to execute a typical\ncomputational algorithm.  I doubt if there is an\nalgorithm to compute Pi without the use of scratchpad\nmemory.  OTOH, a recurrent ANN is theoretically\ncapable of performing such a computation, although\nthere are very few examples of this. (My 4Play program\nis one such example.)  The problem is how to train\nsuch a network. I don&#39;t think there is any way to use\nbackprop for such a problem.  Neuroevolution might\nwork, which is the method I use.  I will put this on\nmy list of possible projects!\n\nA recurrent ANN is also capable of generating a\nsequence of outputs, which is what is needed in this\ncase.  You want to just start it going, and then it\noutputs 3, then 1, then 4, etc., with no further input.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nGet better spam protection with Yahoo!
