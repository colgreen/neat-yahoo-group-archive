It is possible to add experi=\r\nments or just to play with \nthe current experiment, which is quite interest=\r\ning and has a nice \nGUI.  \n\nThe experiment it comes with is the simple visu=\r\nal discrimination \n(identifying the larger square) in our paper\n\nhttp://epl=\r\nex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\noption=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D=\r\n28#gauci.gecco07\n\nThe package comes with a few actual population files from=\r\n that \nexperiment.  You can load in substrates and play with them in \ninter=\r\nesting ways:  If you right-click on a substrate, you go into a \nmode where =\r\nyou can move the cursor around on top of the substrate in \nreal time and se=\r\ne the outgoing connections from the position of the \ncursor.  This gives yo=\r\nu a real sense of the connectivity motifs that \nit discovered, which are su=\r\nrprisingly diverse.  \n\nYou can also middle-click and see the total activati=\r\non pattern on the \nsubstrate for the currently-displayed trial.\n\nThis inter=\r\nface is really useful for getting intuitions about what \nHyperNEAT is able =\r\nto do.  You can even increase the resolution of the \nsubstrate and see how =\r\nit translates connectivities to higher \nresolutions without further evoluti=\r\non. \n\nOr, you can evolve from scratch.\n\nIf you want to be really adventurou=\r\ns of course you can create your \nown experiments.\n\nWe will update the packa=\r\nge over time as new results are published.\n\nA separate C# package (derived =\r\nfrom Colin Green&#39;s C# NEAT) is also \nworking in our lab on a different task=\r\n, but it still needs some \ncleaning up before release.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
