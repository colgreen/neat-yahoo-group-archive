I&#39;m not saying make randomness available to the network, I&#39;m saying\n&gt;make a network that is inherently (a little) noisy.\n&gt;\n&gt;e.g the activation function becomes something like:\n&gt;\n&gt;val = Sigmoid(total) + RangedRand(-0.001, 0.001)\n\nThat is one way.  The down side is you have hard-coded random number range.  \nNEAT has nothing but excessive topology at its disposal as a way of \nattenuating or amplifying it.\n\nMaking randomness available to it works almost as well.  Suppose that \n&#39;total&#39; includes a random component.  That random component is accomplished \nby recording a connection between the node and a &#39;magic&#39; input.  Every time \nthat input is accessed, it returns a different value.  So if 10 hidden nodes \nall have a connection to the same &#39;random&#39; node, they still all get a \ndifferent value from it.  Now, the random component is in the &#39;total&#39;, and \nthe scale of that random component is able to be controled by manipulating \nthe connection weight, something NEAT already does.\n\nAdd one more &#39;feature&#39;:  When a connection is split forming a new node, an \nadditional connection is immediately formed connecting the node to the \nrandom input.  So EVERY node has a random component, always.  Of course, you \nwould have to code for the special case of splitting the connection to the \nrandom input node... :)\n\n&gt;I suggest this because:\n&gt;\n&gt;(i) the presence of randomness, averaged over many generations, can smooth\n&gt;the fitness landscape\n\nOr over many activations, or over many test samples.\n\n&gt;(ii) a system evolved in the presence of randoness *within* the neurones\n&gt;will have been forced to be robust w.r.t other sorts of randomness\n&gt;(discuss, 10 points, show your working)\n\nThat was my point...discussed previously.  See example of walking on \ngravel...\n\n&gt;(iii) if the network can exploit randomness (e.g. in game playing where\n&gt;being unpredictable -- within constrains -- is an advantage) then it merely\n&gt;needs to amplify up some of it&#39;s own noise.  And, because the noise is\n&gt;available on every neurone, there&#39;s complete choice over what kind of noise\n&gt;it amplifies (e.g. it could apply far more noise to evaluating pawn moves\n&gt;than king moves...)\n\nWhich is much easier if all it has to do is manipulate the weight of a \nconnection to a special input node.  Try and picture what NEAT would have to \ndo in order to make two nodes, one returning a larger random number than the \nother...\n\n&gt;p.s.    there&#39;s a whole other discussion here, about whether the TWEANN\n&gt;community should still use a neurone design which was essentially enforced\n&gt;historically by the mathematical requirements of back-propagation, but it&#39;s\n&gt;a long and complex discussion\n\nAs long as Sigmoids work, I guess there&#39;s no harm or rush to change it.  But \nI&#39;d be open to changing it, too...\n\n\n\n"}}
