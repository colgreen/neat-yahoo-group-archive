Buckland&#39;s code does not allow &quot;=\r\neach disjoint and excess gene&quot; to be &quot;inherited from either parent randomly=\r\n&quot; even when they have equal fitnesses. For equal fitnesses it can only inhe=\r\nrit them from the shorter genome (Parent 1) otherwise it will inherit only =\r\nfrom the fitter genome.  Thus one could never get the child pictured in Fig=\r\nure 3.3.\n\nHas anyone made a similar conclusion or have I perhaps coded Buck=\r\nland&#39;s program incorrectly.  I am making a version of NEAT in Labview using=\r\n Buckland&#39;s code and conventions as a guide. \n\nAlso, why is the Crossover o=\r\nnly applied to members within the same species?  Doesn&#39;t the speciation pro=\r\ncess tend to group members with the same topology?  Would cross-species cro=\r\nssovers allow for new hybrids to arise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
