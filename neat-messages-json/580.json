Ken, in your\nXOR \n&gt; code you seem to be calculating a depth value for a network, you\nthen \n&gt; execute &#39;depth&#39; number of timesteps to allow input signals chance\nto \n&gt; propagate to the output nodes, right? This solves the oscillation \n\nThe depth method of relaxation is really just a hack.  The most\ncorrect way to do it is to check every node from from one time step to\nthe next to see if they *all* stop changing within some epsilon.  \n\nFrom what you are saying above though, I get the sense you just took\nyour old solution and relaxed it; is that true?  Training and testing\nhave to be performed the same way- so in other words the networks must\nbe trained to relax.  That way, you know that when you test later\nyou&#39;ll get the same results.  So if you train networks to relax (i.e.\nif one can&#39;t relax in some given number of activations then penalize\nperhaps) then they will learn to create recurrent structures that\nrelax into the solution of XOR.  I am sure someone in this group once\nshowed me such a network, with a single recurrent connection and no\nhidden nodes...wish I could remember who it was.  \n\nken\n\n&gt; problem, but the depth calculation sounds potentially CPU intensive\n- \n&gt; it&#39;s essentially the same algorithm that is required for\ndetermining \n&gt; node layers which we were discussing on the list just recently.\nI&#39;ll \n&gt; look into how you&#39;re detecting recurrency and have a think about\nthis, I \n&gt; think it&#39;s going to be a case of defining 2 or 3 relaxation\ntechniques \n&gt; and picking the one best suited for a given domain. Right now my\ndomains \n&gt; (all 2 of them) use a fixed number of timesteps that I guess at\nbased \n&gt; upon how big a network is required to solve the task...which partly \n&gt; defeats the purpose of neat!\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n"}}
