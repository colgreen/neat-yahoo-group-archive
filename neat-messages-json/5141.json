For example, I believe Fausti=\r\nno Gomez&#39;s ESP algorithm does something similar.  The idea is to &quot;zoom in&quot; =\r\non the most promising areas of the search space and basically double down o=\r\nur bets that something good is there.  Of course, there is a downside to th=\r\nis idea, which is that it strips diversity out of the population and furthe=\r\nr invests in something that has not been working so far, but on the other h=\r\nand, it&#39;s not like anything has been going well anyway, so a gamble isn&#39;t t=\r\nhat bad at that point.  \n\nIt would also be perfectly reasonable to do somet=\r\nhing else, or not do anything at all, as alternatives.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
