I&#39;d like to think about your\nanswers a bit before responding.\n\nHowever, if you have a second, I would be interested to hear your thoughts\non what I originally intended to be my main question, which is this:\n\n&gt;&gt; The paper seems to further suggest that the reason many of these problems\n&gt;&gt; are deceptive is because (a) it is easier to learn a fixed-heuristic, and\n&gt;&gt; then (b) there is a fitness valley between that fixed-heuristic and the\n&gt;&gt; adaptive strategy.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I agree with (a) (in most cases), but why assume (b)?\n\nMuch of analysis in the paper hinges on the fact that there is actually a\nfitness valley between a fixed-heuristic and learning. But do we know that\nis the case for your experiment? Is it usually the case? Why?\n\nFor me, questions on this front are really intriguing and, before your\npaper, I had not spent much time thinking about them. An understanding of\nthem might really help our field better evolve adaptive agents.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
