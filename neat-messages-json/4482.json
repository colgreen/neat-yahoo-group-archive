Here it comes:\nFirst of all, I&#39;m using the Java version of NE=\r\nAT (JNEAT), maybe the \nfitness variables are named differently in the C+ NE=\r\nAT, but I think \nyou will all understand my question. It&#39;s about the differ=\r\nence \nbetween the two variables &quot;fitness&quot; and &quot;orig_fitness&quot;. \nThe way I un=\r\nderstand this is the following:\n1a. orig_fitness is the organism&#39;s real fit=\r\nness value, which is \ndetermined only once, when the organism is created an=\r\nd evaluated.\n1b. orig_fitness never changes.\n2a. fitness, on the other hand=\r\n, is subject of later adjustments. Two \nprocesses can change the value of f=\r\nitness: \n2b. First, fitness is divided among the subjects of the same speci=\r\nes, \nmeaning the more organisms in one species, the lower the fitness.\n2c. =\r\nSecond, age_significance allows nishing by raising the fitness of \nyoung or=\r\nganisms.\n3. When deciding which organism is better than another, orig_fitne=\r\nss \nis the only logic choice. Fitness is only a internal value for NEAT \nan=\r\nd not important for me, who wants only the one and only best \norganism at t=\r\nhe end.\n\nIf someone could help me out and tell me if all of the above \nassu=\r\nmptions are correct (or in case they are not explain to me how it \nis) I wo=\r\nuld be very happy. \nThanks a lot!\nWith best regards,\nMatthias\n\n\n\n"}}
