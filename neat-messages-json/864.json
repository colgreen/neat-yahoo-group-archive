E.g. [-5, -3] blue, [-3, -1] green and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think I&#39;ll try some different color schemes and see which looks best. \nHaving said that the current red-blue scale I&#39;m using highlights \nexcitatory and inhibitory very well, which may be all you really want to \nsee along with a variable connectin width.\n\n&gt;I also think that it&#39;s better to makke possible to toggle connections lines on and off for each neuron independently. Because in case of complex networks it&#39;s really challenging to understand just the way connections are oriented.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood idea. I&#39;ll see what I can do.\n\nThanks for the feedback,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
