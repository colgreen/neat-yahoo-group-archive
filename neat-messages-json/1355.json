I was\n&gt;thinking about how a human eye recognises characters and it occurs to me\n&gt;that when reading we can actually read not only whole characters but\n&gt;whole words at a time, certainly our eyes don&#39;t &#39;rove&#39; to detect\n&gt;individual characters. Therefore if I was going to try and construct a\n&gt;robust OCR network I think I&#39;d tend towards a roving eye with quite a\n&gt;high resolution(good enough to distinguish all of the characters anyhow)\n&gt;that could see whole characters at a time - but then could rove (move\n&gt;and zoom in/out) in order to frame characters within the eye&#39;s field of\n&gt;view. I wonder if this technique could then be extended to read text\n&gt;from a printed sheet - or even handriting?  I know there are already\n&gt;technqiues for reading printed text, what I don&#39;t know is how good they\n&gt;are and if a roving eye technqiue could perhaps improve on the current\n&gt;best technique.\n\nThe human visual cortex is known to pre-process data for things like edges, \nlines, corners, verticals, horizontals and 45-degree diagonals...\n\nOne could use things like that as the input to the evolving network...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
