The most exciting\nproblem domain in the paper is evolvin=\r\ng gaits for simulated quadruped\nrobots, and the resultant gaits are pretty =\r\nexciting in that they are\nnatural-looking, coordinated, and fast.\n\nWhile ma=\r\nny of you are familiar with some of the results, I&#39;d like to draw\nyour atte=\r\nntion to the new visualizations of HyperNEAT neural networks in\nFigures 15,=\r\n 16, 17, and 24. It is cool to see the geometric patterns\nHyperNEAT paints =\r\nin neural-wiring space, and to contrast to them to the ANNs\nproduced by a d=\r\nirect encoding.\n\nPlease post any questions/comments you have.

IE=\r\nEE Transactions on\nEvolutionary Computation. To appear.\n\nAbstract: This pap=\r\ner investigates how an evolutionary algorithm with an\nindirect encoding exp=\r\nloits the property of phenotypic regularity, an\nimportant design principle =\r\nfound in natural organisms and engineered\ndesigns. We present the first com=\r\nprehensive study showing that such\nphenotypic regularity enables an indirec=\r\nt encoding to outperform direct\nencoding controls as problem regularity inc=\r\nreases. Such an ability to\nproduce regular solutions that can exploit the r=\r\negularity of problems is an\nimportant prerequisite if evolutionary algorith=\r\nms are to scale to\nhigh-dimensional real-world problems, which typically co=\r\nntain many\nregularities, both known and unrecognized. The indirect encoding=\r\n in this\ncase study is HyperNEAT, which evolves artificial neural networks =\r\n(ANNs) in\na manner inspired by concepts from biological development. We dem=\r\nonstrate\nthat, in contrast to two direct encoding controls, HyperNEAT produ=\r\nces both\nregular behaviors and regular ANNs, which enables HyperNEAT to sig=\r\nnificantly\noutperform the direct encodings as regularity increases in three=\r\n problem\ndomains. We also show that the types of regularities HyperNEAT pro=\r\nduces can\nbe biased, allowing domain knowledge and preferences to be inject=\r\ned into the\nsearch. Finally, we examine the downside of a bias toward regul=\r\narity. Even\nwhen a solution is mainly regular, some irregularity may be nee=\r\nded to\nperfect its functionality. This insight is illustrated by a new algo=\r\nrithm\ncalled HybrID that hybridizes indirect and direct encodings, which ma=\r\ntched\nHyperNEAT=B9s performance on regular problems yet outperformed it on =\r\nproblems\nwith some irregularity. HybrID=B9s ability to improve upon the per=\r\nformance of\nHyperNEAT raises the question of whether indirect encodings may=\r\n ultimately\nexcel not as stand-alone algorithms, but by being hybridized wi=\r\nth a further\nprocess of refinement, wherein the indirect encoding produces =\r\npatterns that\nexploit problem regularity and the refining process modifies =\r\nthat pattern to\ncapture irregularities. This paper thus paints a more compl=\r\nete picture of\nindirect encodings than prior studies because it analyzes th=\r\ne impact of the\ncontinuum between irregularity and regularity on the perfor=\r\nmance of such\nencodings, and ultimately suggests a path forward that combin=\r\nes indirect\nencodings with a separate process of refinement.\n\n\n\nBest regard=\r\ns,\nJeff Clune\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Lab=\r\noratory\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n**Cal=\r\nl for papers!
