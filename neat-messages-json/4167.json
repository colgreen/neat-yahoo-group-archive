Well actually, I&#39;m a c=\r\nomplete newbie concerning \nIA ;).\nFew times ago, I started a personnal proj=\r\nect that aims to evolve ANN \nwith genetic programming for a simple food gat=\r\nhering problem. I \ndiscovered NEAT and HyperNeat (and this group) by google=\r\ning the \nsubject.\nI&#39;m still reading the litterature, and I sometimes do hav=\r\ne hard time \nto fully understand the whole picture.\n(Btw, sorry for my poor=\r\n english, I read a lot in english but I almost \nnever write/spoke, and thus=\r\n I&#39;m just loosing my skills over time.)\n\nMy question is quite simple. After=\r\n a quick look on HyperNeat package, \nI saw there is no mutation that shift =\r\nthe activation function of CPNN.\nSo I was wondering if this mutation could =\r\nbe relevant, and if Neat \ncan handle this kind of mutation?\nI think it coul=\r\nd be done by simply disabling the neuron and add a new \nneuron with the sam=\r\ne name but with a different innovation number.\n\nRegards,\nGreg.\n\nPS: My apol=\r\nogies if the question is just stupid ;)\n\n\n"}}
