The problem they have is that some (actually a lot)of =\r\n\nthe images\n&gt; of galaxies are hard to classify, so they explained what to l=\r\nook \nfor and\n&gt; opened the task up to Joe Public, the idea being that by gro=\r\nuping \nmultiple\n&gt; answers they could determine a good answer for each galax=\r\ny. Seems \nthe idea\n&gt; paid off.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I&#39;ve looked at some of these galaxi=\r\nes and there&#39;s a lof of \nvariation and\n&gt; general noise and mess in these im=\r\nages, and apart from that some of \nthem are\n&gt; fairly vague. However, Joe Pu=\r\nblic + professional astronomers have \ntrouble\n&gt; with some of these images a=\r\nlso and now we potentially have a \ndatabase (don&#39;t\n&gt; know if it&#39;s all publi=\r\nc yet) that quantifies which images are hard \nto\n&gt; clasify (by humans). An =\r\ninteresting question would be - How close \ncan the\n&gt; best machine learning =\r\ntechnique come to Joe Public on this task? \nAlmost as\n&gt; good?\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I un=\r\ndertand attempts have been made to automate galaxy \nclassification\n&gt; which =\r\ndidn&#39;t turn out well, hence the web site. But this does mean \nthere\n&gt; will/=\r\nshould be a body of existing research out there detailing how \nwell the\n&gt; c=\r\nurrent best known techniques can do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a thought. There&#39;s certainly=\r\n no shortage of galaxies to \nclassify :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
