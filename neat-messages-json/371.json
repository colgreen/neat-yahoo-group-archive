With each, I could see some potential areas of improvement \nover the original research.  One of which is network topology, for which \nNEAT is a good match.\n\nMy plan is to do some detailed statistical analysis of natural photos and to \ncull out some good, representative training data to use in conjunction with \nNEAT to try and construct a high-quality adaptive image enlargement engine.\n\nNow, being a total newbie to neural nets and NEAT in particular, I may have \nsome questions.  I&#39;ll do my best to figure stuff out on my own, but if I get \nstuck, can I ask for help? :)\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nLet the new MSN Premium Internet Software make the most of your high-speed \nexperience. http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem&ST=1\n\n\n"}}
