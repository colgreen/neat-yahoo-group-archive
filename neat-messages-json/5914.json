I will also look at updating svn =\r\n(if I can remember how) so that the community can use it too.\n\nFeel free to=\r\n email me &#39;mattsimm69&#39; and I use google as my mail provider - sure you can =\r\nwork it out :)\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;roncking2001&quot; &lt;=\r\nroncking@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Group,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve discovered the HyperNeat capab=\r\nle version of Neat4J on sourceforge, in the svn repository.
