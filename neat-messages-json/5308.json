Will endeavour to help.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m managing the evaluations of the genomes outside of Neat entirely, and updating the\n&gt; fitness explicitly after each evaluation cycle, before calling\n&gt; EvolutionAlgorithm::PerformOneGeneration.\n\nThis /might/ be a problem (not 100% sure). Certainly the algorithm as\nit is will call the genome evaluator from within\nPerformOneGeneration(), by doing it before this method you&#39;ve\npotentially produced a subtle bug.  I would advise that you plug-in\nyour external evaluation routine via the IGenomeListEvaulator\ninterface provided - unless there is some particular issue that\nprevents this?\n\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m getting situations where I have species with only one member, and the roulette\n&gt; selection returns no genome to use for asexual reproduction, because the selection value\n&gt; is higher than the fitness of the single member.\n\nTo help identify which bit or bits of code you&#39;re referring to could I\nask that you point me at particular line numbers.\n\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve been backtracking through the code, and I think I&#39;ve found where the problem arises:\n&gt; under EvolutionAlgorithm::PerformOneGeneration, the fitness stats are only updated if\n&gt; species have been removed from the population. If species haven&#39;t been removed, then\n&gt; offspring are created /before/ the fitnesses are updated.\n\nMy hunch would be that you&#39;ve &#39;broken&#39; the later stages of\nPerformOneGeneration() as they rely heavily on the calculated stats.\nThe flow of calculations in PerformOneGeneration() is ordered very\nprecicely as there were many chicken and egg type issues that occured\nwhile writing and testing the code (some fairly subtle ones were\nreported to me by others even after many rethinks and re-writes of\nvarious sections during the initial authoring)\n\nIf you can plug-in an IGenomeListEvaulator that would be a good start\n- if not then I&#39;d be interested what problem is present there and we\ncan take it from there.\n\nHope that helps a bit,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
