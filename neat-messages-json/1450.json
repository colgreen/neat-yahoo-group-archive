So that means that if\n&gt; &gt;the link that was disabled to add a node were to be reenabled, then\n&gt; &gt;split again, it would be interpreted as the other node that did the same\n&gt; &gt;thing. So in that case, it would inhibit horizontal growth, an karl put\n&gt; &gt;it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, you are right, the choice to re-use node ID&#39;s means that it would not\n&gt;be able to grow horizontally without bounds in the way described.\n&gt;\n&gt;Suppose you have one input, and one output.  Split the connection to create\n&gt;a new node.  That causes the connection between them to be severed, in favor\n&gt;of the connection to the new node.  Then, re-connect the input and the\n&gt;output.  Now, split that connection again.  If it gets the same innovation\n&gt;id, then the split failed, and you end up right back where you were before\n&gt;you reconnected.  But if you give it a unique id, then you have a\n&gt;diamond-shaped network, one input, one output, and two hidden nodes.\n&gt;\n&gt;But suppose instead of connecting the input to the output and then\n&gt;re-splitting that connection, suppose you split the connection from the\n&gt;hidden node to the input node.  Then connect that new node to the output\n&gt;node.  Once you re-connect the first hidden node to the input node, you are\n&gt;almost back to the diamond shape...except that there is a connection between\n&gt;the hidden nodes.  You have the same horizontal shape, just more horizontal\n&gt;connections.  And if you support deletion (or disabling), you could end up\n&gt;at the same place by just deleting that middle connection.\n&gt;\n&gt;The first approach gets you there in 3 mutations.  The second approach gets\n&gt;you there in 5.  But you still get there.  There is basically no topological\n&gt;structure you can evolve one way that you can&#39;t evolve the other way.  It\n&gt;*might* slow down the evolution, if the final topology requires something\n&gt;fancy.  But if the same thing is evolved from two or three different\n&gt;directions, all three will be recognized as being the same thing.  Question\n&gt;is, is that a good thing, or a bad thing?  I&#39;d hate to have three of my\n&gt;topologies all trying to optimize a functionally identical network, that&#39;s a\n&gt;waste.  Though, I admit, that&#39;s not overly likely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;But in NEAT as I am understanding it from ken&#39;s paper, the link\n&gt; &gt;could be reenabled, then split again, which would disable it again. So\n&gt; &gt;the pattern of reenabling and splitting could repeat indefinitely to\n&gt; &gt;create a wide topology with a large parallel hidden layer.\n&gt; &gt;Did I get it right?\n&gt; &gt;chad\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;-----Original Message-----&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: blackkm7\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sent: 8/19/2004 11:00:00 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [neat] Re: genotype vs phenotype\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;m still new to NEAT, but from my limited understanding, if you\n&gt; &gt; &gt;prevent certain kinds of (add node) innovations from repeating, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt;there are certain types of net topologies that cannot evolve.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Specifically, how might a hidden layer evolve that was larger than\n&gt; &gt; &gt;the input/sensor layer? Horizontal growth as oposed to vertical?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Now that I think of it, I&#39;ve only seen vertical growth in jNeat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Does NEAT prevent horizontal &quot;bulge&quot; in topologies?
