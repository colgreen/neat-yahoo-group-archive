We have a graphical game engine that is working for us\n&gt;for now, but we are starting to think more long-term about the right\n&gt;engine for the future.  I wonder if anyone here knows any way to \n&gt;license or obtain an RTS-style game engine from any company or\n&gt;organization?  There are several first-person-shooter style engines\n&gt;available, but it&#39;s much harder to find an RTS engine.  Any\n&gt;suggestions would be apprecated!\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
