Regardless, I&#39;ll soon find out.\n&gt;  \n\nMany of the=\r\n more important people there seem to have a penchant for\nsmall, fully conne=\r\ncted, continuous networks, such as CTRNNs and\nspiking models. I myself thin=\r\nk that having a network fully connected\ncan be disastrous to evolvability, =\r\nas a change in any connection will\naffect every neuron in the network. Epis=\r\ntasis is the word. What is\ninteresting about CTRNNs and similar nets is tha=\r\nt every neuron has\nstate and decay properties, which can be used for some i=\r\nnteresting\nintegration of information over time. The tend to be quite\ncompu=\r\ntationally expensive, though, and I go with much simpler neuron\nmodels for =\r\nmy current experiments with very large networks.\n\nHaving said that, several=\r\n of the people there have done forays into\nartificial embryogeny, and Gruau=\r\n (of Cellular Encoding fame) was there\nfor a while. And you are very much f=\r\nree to do whatever you want in the\nEASy programme - they probably wouldn&#39;t =\r\nobject too much if you handed\nin an oil painting or something you built out=\r\n of matchsticks and\ncrumbled bread instead of an essay... (Well, they might=\r\n not be that\nliberal, but almost.)\n\n&gt;  Examining the Universities in Britis=\r\nh Columbia (EA headquarters), I\n&gt;  see a lot of AI possibilities but nothin=\r\ng that mentions anything close\n&gt;  to NE.  Shame.\n\nJ=F6rg Denzinger works wi=\r\nth EA on evolutionary approaches (unintended\nacronym pun there) to finding =\r\n&quot;sweet spots&quot; in games amongst other\nthings - interesting research. I don&#39;t=\r\n know how much he is into neural\nnetworks, though. The work I&#39;ve seen by hi=\r\nm is on evolving action\nsequences.\n\nhttp://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~denzinge=\r\n/\n\nI just read a dissertation by a guy called Pieter Spronck\n(http://www.cs=\r\n.unimaas.nl/p.spronck/) from Maastricht on evolutionary\ngame ai. Interestin=\r\ng, but again no neural nets. It seems people\nbelieve less in neural nets th=\r\nan in evolution for game AI purposes.\n\n"}}
