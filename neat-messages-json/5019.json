JNEAT is indeed out-of-dat=\r\ne and in need of some major updating.  Also, a lot of people want to use JN=\r\nEAT but are frustrated by its disorganization (although to Ugo Vierruci&#39;s c=\r\nredit it was one of the first working alternatives to my C++ NEAT).  So it =\r\nsounds like your project would address some real demand that is out there.\n=\r\n\nI&#39;m also interested in the potential for a web-based interface for running=\r\n experiments.  That would be a great educational tool.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Trevor Burton &lt;worldofpaper@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I recently asked=\r\n about C# and Java versions of NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; I downloaded Ugo Vierucci&#39;s JNEAT=\r\n code, got it working and started having a\n&gt; nose through the source - it&#39;s=\r\n a bit of a mess and difficult to follow or\n&gt; adapt because of that. So i t=\r\nhought i&#39;d take a crack at refactoring it a\n&gt; little and that little has en=\r\nded up being a complete re-write. I&#39;ve given it\n&gt; the rather imaginative ti=\r\ntle of JNEAT2 - but this&#39;ll probably change when\n&gt; the right name suggests =\r\nitself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not finished yet but thought i&#39;d just post as i&#39;ve been re=\r\nally enjoying\n&gt; this project and hopefully others will find it useful once =\r\ni&#39;m done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically i&#39;ve:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    - Seperated the core NEAT classes=\r\n from the UI and the loading mechanism -\n&gt;    There&#39;s a nice easy way of cr=\r\neating new UI&#39;s to view the evolution/winners\n&gt;    etc. etc. now.\n&gt;    - Al=\r\nl the properties are loaded via Spring&#39;s IOC container - so\n&gt;    everything=\r\n is in easy-to-read xml or properties files.\n&gt;    - Experiments are created=\r\n as JAR files - with all the spring context\n&gt;    files defining the experim=\r\nent&#39;s parameters/genomes/training data etc and\n&gt;    compiled .class files i=\r\nnside - these are loaded by JNEAT2 and the experiment\n&gt;    can be executed =\r\n- the settings can be adjusted and the experiment re-run or\n&gt;    saved back=\r\n out as a new JAR file so experiments can easily be transferred.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm a Flash/Flex developer primarily so my interest in abstracting the UI\n&gt; e=\r\nlements is so i can build a Flex client for this Java &#39;back-end&#39; - this way=\r\n\n&gt; i can have a web-based interface for experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is purely a =\r\npersonal project at the moment - so i plan on releasing the\n&gt; finished code=\r\n as an open-source project and developing some experiments with\n&gt; it once i=\r\n&#39;ve got things working.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll keep the list updated with my progress an=\r\nd if anyone has any\n&gt; comments/suggestions/requests feel free to drop me a =\r\nline.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Trevor Burton\n&gt; http://www.flashmonkey.org\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://www.infrared5.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
