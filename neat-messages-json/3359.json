The problem is that it is very \ndif=\r\nficult to describe exactly what should be rewarded early on.  \nRewarding # =\r\nof steps tends to encourage a single flailing step yet \nmisses better oscil=\r\nlatory behavior.  Even if an individual does learn \na leg-based oscillation=\r\n, it will likely fall and therefore never be \nnoticed.\n\nWhen Tyler Streeter=\r\n was working on this problem in his Verve project \n(http://www.vrac.iastate=\r\n.edu/~streeter/verve/gallery.html), which \nused NEAT with leaky-integrator =\r\nneurons, I discussed this problem \nwith him often.  I believe he ended up f=\r\ninding a clever way to reward \noscillatory behavior.  That is the most impo=\r\nrtant thing, since it&#39;s \nreally the key to walking: it&#39;s necessary for the =\r\ncircuit to produce \nan oscillating pattern.  I may be remembering wrong, bu=\r\nt I think he \nmay have started getting it to work by hanging the biped from=\r\n an \ninvisible &quot;string&quot; from the ceiling, so that it could not fall, and \ns=\r\nimply training it to oscillate its legs.

The=\r\n second multiplier rewards \nindividuals \n&gt; that tend to walk around instead=\r\n of staying still. I know it is \nmaybe \n&gt; wrong to assign 0.000 fitness, bu=\r\nt I usually hope that in early \n&gt; generations at least some individuals wil=\r\nl get a score above zero, \n&gt; and therefore survive. Is this a right thing t=\r\no do or I should \n&gt; translate all fitnesses above 0.000 ? Like Total_Fitnes=\r\ns +=3D 1.0; ? \n&gt; The Number_of_FootSteps_Taken is actually an integer and i=\r\nt makes \nthe \n&gt; fitness landscape look like stairs... This is not good, but=\r\n I can&#39;t \n&gt; think of another way to encourage walking around.. Rewarding cy=\r\nclic \n&gt; activity in the output neurons didn&#39;t help me much.. It is the same=\r\n \n&gt; thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am experimenting with a lot of fitness functions every d=\r\nay. The \n&gt; best individual I got for the balancing task was actually the sa=\r\nme \nas \n&gt; the one found using regular NEAT - just standing. A way to preven=\r\nt \n&gt; this is may be to choose random initial positions for the model.. \nOr =\r\n\n&gt; the ground plane can be made moving randomly.. \n&gt; Anyway, it seems that =\r\nthe fitness function is wrong, since this way \n&gt; of achieving the goal is t=\r\noo easy for the evolution to find.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently trying out how good =\r\nare they to walk. I replaced the \n&gt; Average_Head_Height with Total_Distance=\r\n_Travelled in the fitness \n&gt; function. \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that HyperNEAT is ab=\r\nle to handle such complex dynamic \n&gt; control tasks, given the right substra=\r\nte geometry. Results so far \ndo \n&gt; not show a big progress. But there are a=\r\n lot of parameters to tweak \n&gt; and play with.
