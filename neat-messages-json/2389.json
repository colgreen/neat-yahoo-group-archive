So mayeb this is \nactually normal, it depends on the relative fitness of your species.\n\nThe complexity of the population will rise steadily and will therefore \nnormally require the threshold to rise steadily also to keep the number \nof species constant. If the number of species is continually to high \nthen this indicates that the threshold isn;t able to rise fast enough. \nFirst though I would recommend starting your experiment with a higher \ninitial threshold, that way the threshold won&#39;t be playing catch-up \nright from the start. If later on the # of species starts to rise again \nthen you probably need to increase the delta from 0.3.\n\nIn SharpNEAT I use a delta of 0.1, but this then starts to increase if \nthe number of species does not fall within defined limits. Think of this \nas accelerating the change in threshold. This can have the effect of \novershooting the ideal value if the threshold was way out to start with, \nbut this shouldn&#39;t happen if the initial value is set correctly.\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
