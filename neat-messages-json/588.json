That way, when returning the evaluation results, it \ncan return it to a single point of contact that then knows where to put \nthem.  Then, it won&#39;t be necessary for the server to maintain a list of who \ntook what and then run the risk of getting things confused.\n\nIt&#39;s just an idea, though.  :)\n\n\n&gt;From: Derek James &lt;blue5432@...&gt;\n&gt;Reply-To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [neat] Phenotype XML\n&gt;Date: Tue, 30 Mar 2004 13:57:24 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;\n&gt;Colin and all,\n&gt;\n&gt;Okay...here&#39;s my suggested format for network XML.\n&gt;(I&#39;m using Colin&#39;s recent recurrent XOR network as an\n&gt;example):\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;network&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;title&gt;Colin&#39;s XOR Network&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;neuron id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;in&quot; hint-layer=&quot;1&quot;\n&gt;hint-position=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;neuron id=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;in&quot; hint-layer=&quot;1&quot;\n&gt;hint-position=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;in&quot; hint-layer=&quot;1&quot;\n&gt;hint-position=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;out&quot; hint-layer=&quot;2&quot;\n&gt;hint-position=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src-id=&quot;0&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot;\n&gt;recurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;1.64327624043105&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;connection id=&quot;5&quot; src-id=&quot;1&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot;\n&gt;recurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;-3.3017311279049&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;connection id=&quot;6&quot; src-id=&quot;2&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot;\n&gt;recurrent=&quot;false&quot; weight=&quot;-3.3025163810043&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;connection id=&quot;7&quot; src-id=&quot;3&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot;\n&gt;recurrent=&quot;true&quot; weight=&quot;-7.44947553716588&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/network&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Neurons need to have a layer designation, denoted by\n&gt;the &quot;hint-layer&quot; attribute, and a position within that\n&gt;layer, denoted by the &quot;hint-position&quot; attribute.  This\n&gt;way, you can use whatever logic you like to place\n&gt;neurons in any given layer and position, and the XSL\n&gt;style sheet can just handle laying them out and\n&gt;graphing them.\n&gt;\n&gt;Note that connections need to have an id, as well as a\n&gt;&quot;recurrent&quot; attribute.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll write a second XSL style sheet to handle the\n&gt;transformation from this XML into a form that my\n&gt;current style sheet can parse into an SVG image.\n&gt;Again, all you&#39;ll need to do is make sure your XML is\n&gt;in the above format, that all the files are in the\n&gt;same directory, that you have Xalan and an SVG plug-in\n&gt;installed, and then type &quot;draw [xml-filename]&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just wondering...Colin and Ken have expressed an\n&gt;interest in using these tools.
