When I was playing =\r\nwith \nmy model, I noticed that there is a great difference in performance \n=\r\nfor even a slight modification, like longer vs. shorter legs. \nThere is som=\r\nething else that is important in case HyperNEAT is being \nused for this. Th=\r\ne substrate should represent the model&#39;s actual \ngeometry in space. In gene=\r\nral, it is possible that HyperNEAT can find \na solution for the task given =\r\nalmost any substrate, but I think that \nthe best results will be obtained w=\r\nhen a substrate that copies the \nmodel&#39;s geometry is used. After all, it is=\r\n the geometric priori \nknowledge that provides the bias for HyperNEAT. \nLet=\r\n me note another thing, concerning leaky integrators. Cyclic \nactivity in t=\r\nhe neurons has to be encouraged via some kind of fitness \nconstraint. If no=\r\nt, there will be a great deal of computational time \nwasted for evaluating =\r\nstabilizing networks that produce a step or two, \nbut not real walking. Thi=\r\ns is why I like Jeff&#39;s approach with \ninputting the sine wave - in this cas=\r\ne all networks are guaranteed to \noscillate in some way. \nI guess this is n=\r\not anything new to you, but I am definitely \ninterested in seeing how well =\r\nyour experiments performed. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth =\r\nStanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; We have actually been running biped evol=\r\nution experiments recently \nat\n&gt; UCF because we would like to use it as a t=\r\nest domain in the future \nas\n&gt; well.  In our efforts, we have learned a cou=\r\nple things that may \nanswer\n&gt; some questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; First, leaky integrator =\r\nneurons definitely work and work well.  They\n&gt; can produce oscillatory moti=\r\non without a sine wave (or any kind of\n&gt; oscillator) input.  So there is no=\r\n doubt that a sine wave is\n&gt; unnecessary.  However, Jeff, if in your domain=\r\n somehow leaky\n&gt; integrators hurt that is interesting.  I wonder why that w=\r\nould be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, the model morphology is critical.  You cannot simply =\r\nexpect\n&gt; any biped to walk.  Great care is necessary to ensure that \neveryt=\r\nhing\n&gt; about the model makes sense and is proportionate.  \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re still=\r\n in the midst of an extensive study, and we will let\n&gt; everyone know all th=\r\ne details when it&#39;s completed.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very interesting paper! :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It reminds me about the experim=\r\nents I made with HyperNEAT for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controlling biped robots. Did you try =\r\nusing leaky-integrator \nbased\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neurons for the substrate?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I foun=\r\nd them very useful for generating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oscillation patterns. Substrates of=\r\n leaky integrators with \ntanh()\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activation functions produce oscillat=\r\nions much easier than \nothers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hm.. I should really try with robots w=\r\nith 3 legs or more. \nGetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biped walking with HyperNEAT is perhaps =\r\ntoo ambitious right now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have thought a lot about your biped exp=\r\neriment. I&#39;d be really\n&gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; in hearing your opinion, and that o=\r\nf anyone else on this list, as \nto why\n&gt; &gt; your results were so different f=\r\nrom mine. I found that it did not\n&gt; take that\n&gt; &gt; much tuning to get HyperN=\r\nEAT to evolve really good quadruped \ngaits.\n&gt; But, as\n&gt; &gt; you note, it was =\r\nmuch harder to evolve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can suggest a f=\r\new hypotheses as to what explains the difference.\n&gt; These are\n&gt; &gt; not mutua=\r\nlly exclusive, and it might not be the case that any one \nof\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; exp=\r\nlains most of the difference, but instead that they add up to \nthe\n&gt; &gt; diff=\r\nerence. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve periodic\n&gt; ga=\r\nits.\n&gt; &gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt performance for some reason\n&gt; &gt; 4) I use=\r\nd a PID-based setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; neu=\r\nral net (and not the force to be applied)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are other differen=\r\nces of course, such as the inputs and the\n&gt; number of\n&gt; &gt; hidden nodes. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Biped gaits=\r\n are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This would be easy to =\r\ntest by simply trying a biped with my setup.\n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I have some=\r\n other obligations that will prevent me \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; testing this anytime soon=\r\n, but if you (or anyone else) would like \nto\n&gt; give it\n&gt; &gt; a try, that woul=\r\nd be cool. I can send you the code I used. One \nwould\n&gt; just\n&gt; &gt; need to ch=\r\nange the quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could \ntry to\n&gt; &gt; mimic m=\r\ny setup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do have access to a huge co=\r\nmputing cluster. So, if someone makes\n&gt; the code\n&gt; &gt; modifications to my se=\r\ntup (which I know compiles on our cluster) \nand\n&gt; sends\n&gt; &gt; them to me, I c=\r\nan do a batch of runs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really =\r\neasy to evolve periodic \ngaits\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This would be an easy test. You cou=\r\nld just plug a sine as an input\n&gt; into your\n&gt; &gt; biped. Note: I found that t=\r\nhe period of the sine wave made a huge\n&gt; &gt; difference. If I made it too fas=\r\nt or too slow, evolution basically\n&gt; ignored\n&gt; &gt; the signal. Within the ran=\r\nge of periods that worked, I found that \nI got\n&gt; &gt; different types of gaits=\r\n with different period speeds. With slower\n&gt; periods,\n&gt; &gt; I observed cool t=\r\nortoise-like gaits with left-right symmetry. With\n&gt; medium\n&gt; &gt; periods, I g=\r\not the gaits in the paper. With faster periods, I saw\n&gt; slightly\n&gt; &gt; more f=\r\nrantic versions of the gaits in the paper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a side note, I tried=\r\n to evolve the period for a short while and\n&gt; it was a\n&gt; &gt; miserable failur=\r\ne. I&#39;d like to try that again, and would be\n&gt; interested to\n&gt; &gt; hear people=\r\n&#39;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe \nthat\n&gt; attempt\n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n another email. If someone out there is curious, let me know and\n&gt; I&#39;ll sen=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt p=\r\nerformance for some reason.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did not try leaky integrators. Did y=\r\nou ever try your setup \nwithout\n&gt; them?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did not try them because=\r\n the default sigmoid neurons worked so\n&gt; well out of\n&gt; &gt; the box that I did=\r\n not experiment with alternatives. Both Ken \n(during\n&gt; &gt; preliminary conver=\r\nsations about the paper) and one of the papers&#39;\n&gt; reviewers\n&gt; &gt; asked about=\r\n leaky integrators, so there is clearly some interest \nout\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; in s=\r\neeing how leaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt; &gt; we used in the=\r\n paper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better=\r\n? Why? I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; never worked with them, nor do I know that much about th=\r\nem, so I\n&gt; don&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible tha=\r\nt they could have \nmade\n&gt; &gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It woul=\r\nd be cool to test them out in my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be\n&gt; able to get\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to this in the near future so if someone out there wants to swap\n&gt; them in=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; give it a go, that would be interesting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) I used a PID-=\r\nbased setup, where the target angle was the output\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; neural net =\r\n(and not the force to be applied).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could not figure out whether =\r\nyour setup did this as well. What\n&gt; were the\n&gt; &gt; outputs in your system?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ---------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Do you think any/all of these hypotheses explain the d=\r\nifference in\n&gt; results?\n&gt; &gt; What other likely hypothesis am I missing (I am=\r\n sure there are \nlots).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks again for checking out the paper,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Jeff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PS. Tripods would be fun. I also think adding feet and a f=\r\nlexible \ntorso\n&gt; &gt; would be interesting.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT=\r\n I have wanted to see \nhow it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; perform at controlling leg=\r\nged robots.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepte=\r\nd, so I can \nshare it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you now. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A copy of =\r\nthe paper, and videos of the simulated robots, can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obtained\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \nhttp://devolab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCo=\r\nordinatedGaitsWithHyperNE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AT\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you find i=\r\nt interesting.

Tradition=\r\nal evolutionary algorithms can produce \nthese\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; controllers, but requi=\r\nre manual decomposition or other problem\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; simplification because conv=\r\nentionally-used direct encodings \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taking advantag=\r\ne of a problem&#39;s regularities and symmetries. \nSuch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; active\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; int=\r\nervention is time consuming, limits the range of potential\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions,=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; requires the user to possess a deep understanding of the \nprobl=\r\nem&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; structure. This paper demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; promising\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; generative encoding for evolving neural networks, can =\r\nevolve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without manually decomposing the proble=\r\nm. Analyses suggest that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; successful because it em=\r\nploys a generative encoding that can \nmore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easily\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reuse phenot=\r\nypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuroevolutionary\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; al=\r\ngorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetries, \nwhich may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nid its\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NEAT, a direct encodi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to evolve impressi=\r\nve quadruped \ngaits and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vastly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT. Comparativ=\r\ne analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are more holistic=\r\nally affected by genetic operators, resulting \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; coord=\r\nination of the quadruped&#39;s legs.
