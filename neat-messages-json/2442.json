Since \n&gt;the traditional BP networks are constructed with clear layers.\n&gt;\nFirstly I don&#39;t think networks *have* to be arranged in layers for \nback-propagation to work, it&#39;s just traditional and easy to do. In fact \nI&#39;m not sure if they even have to be feedforward. As such it would be \nentirely feasible to use something like NEAT to search topolgies and \nthen use back-prop to find connection weights.\n\n&gt; Now I&#39;m \n&gt;puzzled that it seems more complex for a abnormity topology structure \n&gt;network to workout the output of a input although it has less nodes and \n&gt;connections.It takes more memory and longer time.\n&gt;\nI&#39;m not sure I follow. Do you mean the amount of CPU time requried to \npropagate a signal from the input to an output?\n\n&gt; Although the networks \n&gt;with layers have more &quot;complex&quot; topology, them have regular algorithm \n&gt;and can workout a output more quickly with less memory. What benefit do \n&gt;the abnormity topology structure networks bring to us? Only becaues \n&gt;they are &quot;simpler&quot; only when we see them with our eyes?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe benefit is that they represent the complete set of possible \ntopolgies. Layered feed forward networks are just a sub-set of the \npossible topologies and as such are such are incapable of performing \nsome tasks. I think I see your point though, one argument for using NEAT \nis to find compact topologies, but in searching for a compact topology \nwe actually can end up with a lot of redundant structure. Now if you \nknow approximately the structure required to solve a given problem then \nit will be more efficient to constrain the toplogy search somehow, which \nmight be an intersting research angle. In the general case though we \nhave no idea what topology is required (competetive co-evolution \nexperiments for example) and so the open ended-ness of NEAT makes sense.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
