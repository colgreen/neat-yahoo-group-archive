Given this stipulation what is a perfect player?  A perfect\n&gt; p=\r\nlayer must assume that the opponent is strong, and therefore must play\n&gt; de=\r\nfensively whilst trying to keep winning lines open as a secondary goal\n&gt; on=\r\nly - and only making a winning move if the opportunity arises.\n\nIt&#39;s possib=\r\nle there is no perfect player given no knowledge of the\nopponent.  I haven&#39;=\r\nt done enough analysis of tic-tac-toe to know if\nit&#39;s simple enough that yo=\r\nu can have an absolute perfect strategy, but\nin our experience there is not=\r\n one.  There can be moves that are\nsub-optimal against a good opponent but =\r\noptimal against a weak\nopponent, and vice versa.\n\nLet&#39;s say move A will res=\r\nult in a loss 100% of the time against a\nstrong opponent but, against a wea=\r\nk opponent, results in a win 70%,\nloss 10%, and tie 20%.  Move B results in=\r\n a tie 100% of the time\nagainst any opponent.  Let&#39;s assume wins are worth =\r\n+1, ties 0, losses\n-1.\n\nWhat&#39;s the best move in that case?  What would a &quot;p=\r\nerfect&quot; player do? \nWhat will the fittest player do?  It depends on the opp=\r\nonents it is\nfacing.  You argue it should assume a strong opponent and move=\r\n\naccordingly.  But, in this case, if a player has a 50-50 chance of\nfacing =\r\na strong or weak opponent, move B is the better choice.\n\n- Philip\n\n"}}
