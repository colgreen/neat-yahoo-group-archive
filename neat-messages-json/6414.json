I think that using CPPNs to paint \na temporal pattern that can be used for robot locomotion is a really \ninteresting idea, but am unclear about one point.\n\nIf I understood correctly, in that paper the triggering mechanism was \nhard-coded to be a touch sensor on the corresponding foot of the leg \nbeing actuated.  Is this correct?\n\nHas any work been done on making this trigger evolveable so that it \nmight work in more general settings?\n\nThanks!\nJosh\n\n"}}
