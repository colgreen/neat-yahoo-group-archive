In particular he points \nout that double precision is required in applications involving \nchaotic processes.  Pentiums have dedicated double precision floating \npoint hardware that is extremely efficient while the majority of \nembedded processors implement single precision floating point in \nsoftware and usually don&#39;t support double precision at all.\n\n&gt; Are you able to elaborate on the types of problem you&#39;re \nconsidering?\n&gt; \nWe are investigating the development of a real time, using ANN based, \nin-scene object recognizer/tracker running on an embedded processor \n(Analog Devices Blackfin) possibly augmented with a floating point co-\nprocessor (Analog Devices Shark) .  We&#39;re just getting starting and \nthe threads here have been very helpful.  The show stopper is double \nverse single precision.  \n\nSteve\n\n\n"}}
