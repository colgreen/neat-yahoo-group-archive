ES is a good example and in general I have to go\n&gt;and look these terms up to remind myself what they mean - and often I\n&gt;find that they aren&#39;t that well defined in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;[Search Slowdown]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Generally speaking I can confirm this observation. I think in your case\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the evaluation time is constant and it&#39;s the increasing complexity of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;the solutions that consumes time, yes? which is how I arrived at the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;phased pruning idea.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Not really.  I mean at first that is what it is, the initial\n&gt; &gt;individuals are so simple that they take no time to evaluate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;I should perhaps clarify what I mean here. I&#39;m thinking about the\n&gt;distinction between the time spent by the nuts and bolts of the fitness\n&gt;function rather than the time spent activating the &#39;brain&#39;, whether that\n&gt;be an ANN, SLEAT network or whatever. So e.g. if we&#39;re evolving a\n&gt;bipedal walker then as the fitness improves, the actual fitness function\n&gt;code will take longer to execute because the walkers are walking\n&gt;further, the same is true of many evaluation schemes (game playing, pole\n&gt;balancing, etc).\n&gt;\n&gt;This is seperate to the time spent activating the controller/brain,\n&gt;which also increases as the controller becomes more complex. And then of\n&gt;course the genetic operators take longer because the genomes they\n&gt;operate on are larger, decoding takes longer, etc. A triple whammy of\n&gt;performance degradation if you like.\n&gt;\n&gt;Therefore your fitness scheme that evaluates all board positions takes\n&gt;the same amount of CPU time regardless of the genome geing evaluated,\n&gt;yes? But the fitness function taken as whole gets slower - because it\n&gt;includes activating the brain (for want of a better term).\n\nAll this is correct, but not the cause of my slowdown.  I meant to \nexplain this in the last mail, in fact it was the whole point of what \nI was saying, but I seem to have forgotten to include it...\n\nThe type of slowdown I have is simply that improvements come at \nlonger and longer intervals....\n\ne.g. its clearly a matter of diminishing returns, where the chance of \nfinding additional structure:\n\n1) that solves some boards not previous solved, but,\n2) does not disrupt the workings of the existing systems\n\n         - gets lower and lower and lower...\n\nEven though my SLEAT architecture is explicitly set up to allow the \naddition of new bits (&quot;modules&quot; if you like) with a good chance of \nnot trashing the old stuff (and obviously works in the early stages), \nit does still seem to get progressively more locked in to its \nestablished structures as the fitness increases.\n\nOr actually, maybe &quot;locked in&quot; is a bad phrase, because as I said, it \ndoes not appear to actually jam, just get slower and slower and slower...\n\nI have some ideas that we could call &quot;advance speciation&quot; that I want \nto try on this.  But coding time has been short recently.  I might \nget a chance tomorrow, however...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
