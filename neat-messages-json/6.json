My first experience with NEAT was while I \nwas doing an undergraduate research course at UT and I worked with Ken on \nvariable mutation rates.\n\nNext month, I&#39;m starting graduate school at the University of Birmingham \n(UK), where I&#39;ll be doing an MSc in Natural Computation \n(http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/msc-nc/), which is \nheavily research based. I&#39;m not sure yet what I&#39;ll be working on, but \nI&#39;m hoping to be able to either use NEAT directly or something involving \ncompetitive co-evolution. This stuff is really cool :)\n\nWhats happenin&#39; in the NEAT world these days? You graduate yet Ken? :)\n\nCheers,\n-KB-\n\n\n"}}
