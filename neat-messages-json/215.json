We asked him this question off the list, and\nhe said that in all experiments, N was set to 1.\n\nThe species compatibility threshold value was also set\nat 3.0 for the pole balancing problem, and 4.0 for\ndouble pole balancing.  I can see how this might work\nall right for smaller chromosomes, but it seems much\nless likely to work well with larger ones.\n\nBasically, if N were set to 1 and T were set to 3.0 or\n4.0, then very large chromosomes that may have over\n99% of their topology and weights in common would be\nput into different species.  It seems to me that\nnormalization for chromosome size is a good idea, no\nmatter how large or small the average chromosome size\nof the population, but if you did so, then the value\nfor the species compatiblity threshold should probably\nbe less than 1, more like 0.2.  Because if you\nnormalized for chromosome size, T could never be\ngreater than 3. \n\nSo how have you guys handled these issues?  Have you\nnormalized for chromosome size in your\nimplementations?  If not, do you have an explosion of\nspecies in your populations of large chromosomes?\n\nWe&#39;ve already done some unspeciated experiments with\nTic-Tac-Toe, and the starting chromsomes have 9\ninputs, 9 outputs, and are fully connected (81\nconnections), for a starting chromosome of 99 genes. \nand throughout a run, they&#39;ve mutated to several\nhundred genes.  I&#39;m wary of not normalizing for\nchromosome size when it comes to speciation.  \n\nHow many of you have done so?  And if you have, what\nkinds of values did you use for the compatibility\nthreshold?\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
