You\n&gt;  know, if you look back at some of the papers on neuroevolution at\n&gt;  that time, some would evolve topology and combine it with backprop,\n&gt;  and some would simply evolve everything (weights and topology, which\n&gt;  are sometimes called TWEANNs for topology and weight evolving\n&gt;  artificial neural networks). Probably some of those people evolving\n&gt;  TWEANNs saw themselves as taking the next step you describe. (Xin\n&gt;  Yao&#39;s 1999 review covers a lot of those methods from that time)\n&gt;\n&gt;  The difference is that no one did it with a population of one, but\n&gt;  that probably just did not occur to them because as soon as you go\n&gt;  to a non-gradient type of problem (like evolving topologies)\n&gt;  populations seem natural at first thought. Of course what you&#39;ve\n&gt;  shown is that you can make it work at least in some cases without a\n&gt;  population.\n\nActually, the big difference is that we&#39;re doing it at different\ntimescales. This is really the whole reason it works.\n\nThe simplest extension is to mutate both topology and weights at the\nsame timescale, either in the very same mutation or in different\nmutation types (say, half of the time it mutates topology and half of\nthe it mutates weights). The algorithm we call &quot;simultaneous climber&quot;\nin the paper does just that: it applies both topology and weight\nmutation at the same time. It doesn&#39;t work at all - in fact it&#39;s much\nworse than a simple hillclimber that only searches weight space. The\nreason is that topology mutations are destructive, and needs to be\noffset with local weight search to explore the potential of the\ntopology, otherwise no topology mutations would survive.\n\nTino and me have been trying to work our way through the references in\nYao&#39;s paper, but many of the early TWEANN papers are very hard to get\nhold of (Journal of Parallel Computing from 1990 etc.). What we&#39;ve\nfound are examples of either evolving topologies and using backprop to\nset the weights, or evolving topologies and weights at the same time\n(i.e. topology and weights are treated the same way, and topology\nchanges are not followed by any kind of weight search before the new\ntopology is evaluated). So what puzzles me is why people have not\nsimply tried replacing backprop with evolution, while keeping the idea\nthat topology changes are evaluated only after a period of weight\nsearch.\n\nEither this has been done in one of these papers we haven&#39;t found or\ngotten hold of yet, or the idea wasn&#39;t so obvious after all...\n\nJulian\n\n&gt;  ken\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
