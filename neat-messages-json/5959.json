Like many well-intended rules, I can imag=\r\nine a lot of nasty unintended consequences.  At a cultural level, it would =\r\nfurther enshrine the current benchmark obsession in machine learning at the=\r\n expense of focusing on ideas.  More practically, it will mean that reviewe=\r\nrs will start rejecting papers based on supposed code glitches in required =\r\ncode submissions.  That will give reviewers a whole new justification for c=\r\nompletely ignoring the main of idea of the paper.  \n\nStudents will also bec=\r\nome overwhelmed with code emergencies (since publication will depend now up=\r\non strangers running your code) and code cleanups demanded by random strang=\r\ners who may themselves be at fault or simply ignorant.  Furthermore, in a f=\r\new years we will have massive repositories of junk code (think of the hundr=\r\neds of papers published only at GECCO in one year) that is so out of date t=\r\nhat it requires deprecated compilers and computing platforms even to run.  =\r\nBut we will be required to maintain these repositories, which will become i=\r\nncreasingly ignored, simply to maintain the appearance of rigor.\n\nI&#39;d prefe=\r\nr just to leave it voluntary and concentrate on making it easier to find co=\r\nde from people who actually want to share it and keep it up to date.  \n\nken=\r\n\n \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, you make a=\r\n lot of good points.

I don&#39;t know where the x is coming from.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps it would be good to create such a site (either as wiki or a =\r\nmore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; structured set-up) for artificial evolution research in general =\r\n(with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tags/categories for sub-fields).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The main issue with a =\r\ngeneral website is that it will never be the main\n&gt; &gt; reference. In my opin=\r\nion, having a website with many sub-fields means that\n&gt; &gt; most people in th=\r\nese sub-fields will not be aware of the website, that\n&gt; &gt; they will use the=\r\nir own solutions and, overall, that the site will be\n&gt; &gt; mostly empty. As a=\r\n consequence, people will not think about this website\n&gt; &gt; as _the_ place t=\r\no check and to submit. Put differently, I think that such\n&gt; &gt; a general web=\r\nsite has a high probability of being a &quot;ghost website&quot;\n&gt; &gt; without enough i=\r\nnhabitants to survive. It&#39;s &quot;easy&quot; to program a website,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s much hard=\r\ner to make it alive and successful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why we tried to do somet=\r\nhing for our own, small sub-field: our goal\n&gt; &gt; is to be one of the referen=\r\nce pages (and even this is hard!).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The only way I can envision a su=\r\nccessful general website is if it is\n&gt; &gt; mandatory to publish a paper. For =\r\ninstance, GECCO could require the\n&gt; &gt; submision on a specific website of th=\r\ne source code of every accepted\n&gt; &gt; paper.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By the way, many journal=\r\ns in biology now require that the authors of\n&gt; &gt; accepted papers put their =\r\ndata (and potentially their source code) on the\n&gt; &gt; Dryad repository (http:=\r\n//datadryad.org/). I hope the evolutionary\n&gt; &gt; computation field will be ab=\r\nle to do the same!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; [Dryad could be used by the EC community but it =\r\ndoes not accept\n&gt; &gt; GPL-licensed source code -- only creative commons --, w=\r\nhereas I think that\n&gt; &gt; many EC frameworks are distributed with a GPL-like =\r\nlicense]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; -- JBM\n&gt; &gt; http://people.isir.upmc.fr/mo=\r\nuret/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
