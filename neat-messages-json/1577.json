Consequently, several researchers used Genetic Algorithms to \nevolve\n&gt; partial aspects of neural networks, such as the weights, the \nthresholds, and\n&gt; the network architecture. Indeed, over the last decade many \nsystems have\n&gt; been developed that perform total network induction. In this work \nit is\n&gt; shown how the chromosomes of Gene Expression Programming can be \nmodified so\n&gt; that a complete neural network, including the architecture, the \nweights and\n&gt; thresholds, could be totally encoded in a linear chromosome. It is \nalso\n&gt; shown how this chromosomal organization allows the \ntraining/adaptation of\n&gt; the network using the evolutionary mechanisms of selection and \nmodification,\n&gt; thus providing an approach to the automatic design of neural \nnetworks. The\n&gt; workings and performance of this new algorithm are tested on the\n&gt; 6-multiplexer and on the classical exclusive-or problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \tDoes that sound at all familiar?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n"}}
