Sometimes there are too many species, sometimes there \nare \n&gt; t=\r\noo few. The dropoff age is important, too. The overall slow down \nis \n&gt; bec=\r\nause the networks grow in size and the simpler species reach \ntheir \n&gt; drop=\r\noff age and get killed of by NEAT. This is the explanation why \n&gt; the fitne=\r\nss drops, too. You can have an absolute elitism where the \n&gt; best species n=\r\never get killed, no matter how old it is. It seems \nthat \n&gt; a fitness plate=\r\nau is being reached and NEAT finds it difficult to \n&gt; optimize in a high-di=\r\nmentional space, the smaller species already \n&gt; being dead and the more com=\r\nplex are left.\n&gt; A possible thing to try is to implement a pruning mechanis=\r\nm. The \n&gt; phased pruning techniqe by Colin Green (found in SharpNEAT) is th=\r\ne \n&gt; one I recommend. This will improve the speed as well as the quality \n&gt;=\r\n of the overall search. With phased pruning, the lower dimentional \n&gt; space=\r\n is searched better. This helps finding the best starting \npoint \n&gt; for fut=\r\nure generations. \n\n\nCould you be kind enough to explain how speciation para=\r\nmeters work in \nNEAT? What if I change these parameters? And should there b=\r\ne a \ngeneral rule to determine the parameters, in what manner do they vary =\r\n\nin different problems?\nKen said these paremeters are chosen by experimenta=\r\ntion, but I think \nthere should be a principle to select approximate values=\r\n, I mean \ndifferent problems need different parameter settings, so how woul=\r\nd a \nspecific problem affect the parameters?\nI think my work is very simila=\r\nr to double-pole balancing, both need \nan output which varies in a certain =\r\nrange, though my output nodes are \nmore. But when I used the parameter sett=\r\nings of the DPM, the fitness \njust went to an endless plateau.\nWell, I have=\r\n to admit I have so poor knowledge in NE, please don&#39;t be \ntired of answeri=\r\nng my questions.\n\n\n"}}
