Everything is going well so far.\n\nHowever, I am curious to know everyone&#39;s thoughts about the two mutation \nproperties listed in the subject header.  I notice that Ken has them set at \n0.1 and 0.05 for the DPNV experiment and 0.0 for the rest.  I am using Mat \nBuckland&#39;s WinNEAT and have added these two mutators to the code but am \nunsure at how much to put their probabilities at.  10% seems like a lot for \ndisabling genes and then only 1/20 of the time will we re-enable one.\n\nSo I have two questions:\n\n1) Why so high for DPNV in particular?\n2) What situations would you say that they are beneficial, when would they \nnot be too helpful?\n\nMy networks have 16 inputs and 5 outputs, they will end up being partially \nrecurrent.\n\nMany thanks\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
