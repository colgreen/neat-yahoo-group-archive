So far they seem unreasonably nice :)\n\n\tw.r.t SLEAT, I spent some time putting a ES-style (*) variance \nparameters into it.  They don&#39;t seem to make much difference to the \nsearch, but that mean they are not killing it either.  And they are \ndriven down to low values in old (and hence required) genes...  I put \nthem on all weights and also all FIDs.\n\n\t(*do I mean ES?  I get abbreviation blindness sometimes)\n\n\tGenerally, SLEAT runs fine up to the point where the PPS fitness \n(see my previous discussions) reaches about 90%.  Then it really \nstarts to slow (never quite stopping, but how would I know...) and by \nthe time it gets to around 92% the search is so slow that it becomes \nimpractical to continue...\n\n\tHow does that gel with folk&#39;s experience on similar problems?  e.g. \ndiminishing returns I expect, but it is a _very_ steep slope at this \nend of the problem space...  e.g. typical timings go something like:\n\nto 75% - 5 mins\nto 80% - 2 hours\nto 85% - 10 hours\nto 90% - 20 hours\nto 92% - 50 hours...\n\n\tI don&#39;t have exact timings (and there were other things running at \nthe same time anyway), but I&#39;ll try to get a graph of fitness vs. \ncycles (1 cycle = 1 birth/death) in a day or two...\n\n\tIan\n\np.s. and a happy new year.\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
