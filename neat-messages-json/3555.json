I would not dismiss the idea that there is the \npossibility\n&gt; &gt;  that =\r\na classifier could evolve that detects something surprising\n&gt; &gt;  about aest=\r\nhetic value and thereby filters the search for \ninteresting\n&gt; &gt;  images. It=\r\n is an intoxicating idea and I would love to hear \nabout\n&gt; &gt;  and see the r=\r\nesults of any such attempt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Yet let me give you an idea about the =\r\norigin of my skepticism.\n&gt; [snip]\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to agree, you are right.  The=\r\n tendency to take a short-cut \ncan\n&gt; be a problem.  That is why I was so ex=\r\ncited by the study I saw done\n&gt; where a network was explicitly punished for=\r\n doing so.  The results \nin\n&gt; that case were nothing short of stunning.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; But I wasn&#39;t proposing to evolve the controller using published \nimages\n&gt;=\r\n from PicBreeder.  I was proposing that it be trained to judge \nbetween\n&gt; c=\r\nrops of real images, crops that have aesthetically pleasing\n&gt; qualities, an=\r\nd randomly generated images of various kinds.  That\n&gt; should be a fairly si=\r\nmple, straight forward exercise.  It should \nlearn\n&gt; to detect &#39;signal&#39; vs.=\r\n noise, a simple mathematical function, \nright?\n&gt; As it plateaus at that ta=\r\nsk, start throwing more and more &#39;orderly&#39;\n&gt; noise at it, and/or noise of d=\r\nifferent kinds.  That is, GUIDE the\n&gt; evolution.  As it learns to tell the =\r\ndifference between &#39;normal&#39; \nand\n&gt; &#39;noise&#39; images, start varying the parame=\r\nters of the &#39;noise.&#39;  Over\n&gt; time, if the path that the &#39;noise&#39; images take=\r\ns is controlled, you\n&gt; should be able to lead the network TOWARDS the &#39;deep=\r\ner&#39; function \nthat\n&gt; it is meant to learn.  Maybe something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * First learn to distinguish between image and a uniform field of \none\n&gt; c=\r\nolor.  It&#39;ll probably cheat on this task, but that&#39;s okay.\n&gt; * Then between=\r\n image and nearly uniform, with, say, 1% pixel noise.\n&gt; * As it gets better=\r\n at dealing with the pixel noise, increase the\n&gt; pixel noise levels\n&gt; * Whe=\r\nn it can deal with large pixel noise, start varying the size \nof\n&gt; the pixe=\r\nls.  Add the &#39;noise&#39; by adding &#39;circles&#39; from 1-n pixels in\n&gt; diameter.  As=\r\n the value of n increases, the &#39;orderliness&#39; of the\n&gt; &#39;random&#39; image increa=\r\nses, making it harder and harder to tell the\n&gt; difference based on a &#39;short=\r\n-cut&#39; and forcing a successful network \nto\n&gt; evolve a more intelligent solu=\r\ntion, though not necessarily a \nsolution\n&gt; that gives us what we want, just=\r\n yet.\n&gt; * When it can do that, start mixing circles of various sizes with\n&gt;=\r\n lines of various thicknesses and lengths.\n&gt; * As we do this, we continue t=\r\no include the solid-color and various\n&gt; levels of pixel noise test samples =\r\nin the test, so that the \nnetwork is\n&gt; expected to remember how to do what =\r\nit has done before\n&gt; * When the noise reaches a certain level, we start tak=\r\ning \nthe &#39;nice&#39;\n&gt; pictures, and applying noise to them.  The successful net=\r\nwork will\n&gt; have learned to tell what is noise and what is not, and will be=\r\n \nable\n&gt; to rate the non-noisy version of an image higher than the version =\r\n\nthat\n&gt; has had noise added to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Up to this point, the jumps are all=\r\n pretty easy, and it should be\n&gt; doable.  Making the final jump is harder. =\r\n We don&#39;t KNOW \nnecessarily\n&gt; what makes for an &#39;aesthetically pleasing&#39; im=\r\nage, we just know \nthat it\n&gt; must have some kind of &#39;structure&#39; to it, whic=\r\nh we have been \nteaching\n&gt; the network to find.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it is not just str=\r\nucture, it must have some certain\n&gt; characteristics to that structure in or=\r\nder to be pleasing.  There \nmust\n&gt; be a counter-example to learn to disting=\r\nuish between.  This is \nwhere\n&gt; the process starts to get difficult...\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n And it&#39;s late.  If I come up with an elegant way to make that jump,\n&gt; I&#39;ll=\r\n let you know! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; John Arrowwood\n&gt; John (at) Hanlons Razor (dot)=\r\n com\n&gt; John (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n&gt; --\n&gt; http://arrowwood.bl=\r\nogspot.com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
