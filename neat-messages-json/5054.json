It suggests tha=\r\nt lung cells know to become\n&gt; \n&gt; lung cells based on the air passing back a=\r\nnd forth over them. It is\n&gt; \n&gt; intriguing in the context of HyperNEAT becau=\r\nse it shows that sometimes\n&gt; \n&gt; nature does not use geometric position (pro=\r\nvided by complex protein\n&gt; \n&gt; patterning) to make differentiation decisions=\r\n, but uses environmental cues.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, HyperNEAT could create the s=\r\name end product just with positional\n&gt; \n&gt; information, but it might be easi=\r\ner to accomplish this with simple\n&gt; \n&gt; environmental- based tricks like thi=\r\ns one. Thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; New Scientist\n&gt; \n&gt; Breath of fresh air transfor=\r\nms stem cells\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 14:32 09 November 2009 by Andy Coghlan\n&gt; \n&gt; For si=\r\nmilar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n&gt; \n&gt; Mimicking the environm=\r\nent experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough to\n&gt; \n&gt; transform stem c=\r\nells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physical&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; techniques =\r\ncould be used to create specialised tissues when growth factors\n&gt; \n&gt; alone =\r\naren&#39;t enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Lindsey Van Haute of the Free University of Bruss=\r\nels (VUB) in Belgium and\n&gt; \n&gt; colleagues spread human embryonic stem cells =\r\nonto a porous membrane. The\n&gt; \n&gt; cells were fed from beneath by nutrients a=\r\nnd from above by a fluid that\n&gt; \n&gt; encouraged them to multiply. Removing tw=\r\no chemicals from the growth fluid\n&gt; \n&gt; kickstarted differentiation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Four days later, the team removed the fluid covering the cells, leaving=\r\n them\n&gt; \n&gt; open to the air while still being sustained and supported from b=\r\nelow, as\n&gt; \n&gt; they would be in the trachea. After 24 days the cells had dev=\r\neloped surface\n&gt; \n&gt; proteins that identified them as specific types of lung=\r\n cell, including\n&gt; \n&gt; alveolar cells, which allow the exchange of gases, an=\r\nd cilia, which expel\n&gt; \n&gt; bacteria and dirt.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Physical influence\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our study proves differentiation into lung cells is influenced =\r\nby physical\n&gt; \n&gt; forces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have been =\r\nmade to\n&gt; \n&gt; differentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different gr=\r\nowth factors,\n&gt; \n&gt; but Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Physical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung linin=\r\ng to be\n&gt; \n&gt; fully functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London=\r\n, who has made\n&gt; \n&gt; alveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth facto=\r\nrs alone. &quot;But I find\n&gt; \n&gt; it difficult to believe that raw stem cells woul=\r\nd differentiate through to\n&gt; \n&gt; these uncommon types of cells solely in res=\r\nponse to physical forces.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Haute&#39;s team plans to use the cells t=\r\nhey created to study lung diseases,\n&gt; \n&gt; such as cystic fibrosis. Such cell=\r\ns might one day be used to treat people\n&gt; \n&gt; with damaged lung tissue, but =\r\nonly if the cells can be made from a person&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; own tissue. This could b=\r\ne done by converting the cells first into induced\n&gt; \n&gt; pluripotent stem cel=\r\nls.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Journal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI: 10.1186/1465- =\r\n9921-10-105\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution=\r\n Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; \n&gt; www.msu.edu/ ~jclu=\r\nne\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       \n\n\n\n"}}
