As you all know, the 2D maze world in the \ndemos is =\r\na static one. It doesn&#39;t interact with the agent. Thus it is \npossible for =\r\nNovelty Search to exploit the static environment and \ndevelop behaviors tha=\r\nt are not successful or meaningful on even \nslightly different maze configu=\r\nrations. I don&#39;t say that NS doesn&#39;t \nfind general solutions able to naviga=\r\nte most mazes. I mean that &quot;born \nto solve only this particular maze&quot; solut=\r\nions appear often. \n\nFurther, what if I add more agents, in a realtime inte=\r\nravtive \nenvironment like the one in NERO? While trying to generalize \never=\r\nything I see in terms of behavior characterization, it was \ndifficult to ju=\r\nst say &quot;the agent does this!&quot; and use it as BC. It is \nbecause the real wor=\r\nld environment is not static, it interacts with \nthe agent, so it becomes s=\r\nomething like noisy evaluation when I try \nto evolve one. The same individu=\r\nal could appear more and less novel \nevery time. \n\nSo one day, I was observ=\r\ning my dog.. Let&#39;s think of my dog as a \ncomplex biological agent in a real=\r\n world interactive environment.. If \nyou try to make a summary of its behav=\r\nior, how can you do it? One may \nsuggest to put the dog in various situatio=\r\nns and observe its \nreactions, finally collecting a summary of what it does=\r\n in those \nsituations. While this seems like the solution, it is not. Becau=\r\nse in \norder to compare different dogs, you will have to put all of them \nt=\r\nhrough the same tests in order to avoid the noisy evaluation. And \nthis bri=\r\nngs us to a static environment again, because we know what \nexactly is goin=\r\ng to happen to all agents, in order to see their \nreactions. While realizin=\r\ng that, I arrived on a better idea that I am \ngoing to talk about now. \n\nIn=\r\n a complex interactive world, a little is known what exactly can \nhappen to=\r\n an agent. Further, the agent has a limited set of actions \nthat it can tak=\r\ne. A behavior characterization taking into account the \nactions only is not=\r\n enough, because it is not known what happened to \nthe agent before that ac=\r\ntion. So one solution I came up with is this \none. You have a list of all p=\r\nossible and/or performed actions for the \nBC. For each action, a summary or=\r\n a more detailed list of situations \nmust exist. So basically let&#39;s say tha=\r\nt we have a simple robot that \ncan go forward, fire a rocket and turn left/=\r\nright. With rangefinger \nsensors or whatever. Instead of tracking only *wha=\r\nt* it did during \nits lifetime, the system now has to track also in what ci=\r\nrcumstances \nthe particular action took place, and add that to the summary =\r\nof \nbehavior. This can be the inputs at that particular timestep, for \nexam=\r\nple. Or the relative positions of other agents that it may \ninteract with. =\r\n\n\nDoes it make sense? Suppose you try to characterize a driver in a \ncity t=\r\nraffic conditions. Anything can happen. But if you also track \nwhat the dri=\r\nver *sees* in the particular moments when he acts, in \naddition to what act=\r\nions he takes, it is a lot easier to distinguish \nbetween different driving=\r\n behaviors.\n\nI will be happy to hear your thoughts about this. Perhaps it i=\r\ns \nnothing new, but I didn&#39;t see any discussion about it. Though it is \nan =\r\nimportant issue about how to use Novelty Search for multi-agent, \ncoevoluti=\r\nonary, and some real-world applicatons. \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
