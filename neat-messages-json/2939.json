As I me=\r\nntioned before, by picking an entire play at\nthe start of the round and usi=\r\nng a separate network for each round\n(i.e., keeping the number of cards and=\r\n betting info for the hand fixed\nto a constant size).\n\n&gt; For example, a use=\r\nful data point is probably the\n&gt; probability any given hand will win at any=\r\n given point in the game\n&gt; assuming homogeneous players and homogeneous str=\r\nategy.  This can\neasily be\n&gt; calculated but it is work-intensive.  In fact,=\r\n prohibitively so\ndepending\n&gt; on how you do it.\n\nIndeed this can be very wo=\r\nrk-intensive.  However, the poker-eval\nlibraries are very fast and make use=\r\n of a lot of pre-computed lookup\ntables.  You can normally get around 20 mi=\r\nllion rollout predictions\ndone in a fraction of a second.\n\n&gt; Anything else =\r\nwill result in something\n&gt; that never, ever converges.\n\nI don&#39;t understand =\r\nwhy you think it has to be fast in order to\nconverge?  It doesn&#39;t really ma=\r\nke a huge difference in the long run if\na simulation takes a day or a week.=\r\n\n\nHowever, if things do become excessively long (we can&#39;t run for 6\nmonths =\r\nlike Blondie24 did), we may need to look into a better\nstrategy.  Maybe it&#39;=\r\ns possible to parallelize the NEAT evaluation\nprocess?  We have lots of clu=\r\nsters here at VT that could certainly be\nused, and I think a really cool so=\r\nftware implementation (using mixin\nlayers maybe?) would be a novel contribu=\r\ntion.\n\n&gt; Also, I posted my engine on the\n&gt; NEAT groups but if someone wants=\r\n it, let me know.  It is a great deal\n&gt; faster than the C# implementations =\r\nand could probably be even faster.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;d like to take a look at your engi=\r\nne.\n\n\nWith the strong response I&#39;m getting about this project, maybe should=\r\n\nall try to have an online meeting sometime and form a group?  Since\neveryo=\r\nne clearly has a yahoo account, we could use yahoo messenger. \nThoughts?\n\n\n=\r\nWesley\n\n\n"}}
