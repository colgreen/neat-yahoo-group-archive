I wanted to convert the \n&gt; program to use NEAT and to change a few concepts regarding the \n&gt; _inputs and outputs_. \n&gt; Please let me know what do you think about this technique and if you \n&gt; know a better way:\n&gt; 1. Perform normalizations on the sound and removing the non-relevant \n&gt; parts \n&gt; 2. Perform FFT and focus on the vocal frequency only, separating the \n&gt; data to 16 &quot;channels&quot; (300Hz to 2.8KHz) \n&gt; 3. Calculate the Polynom coefficient for each channel, coefficient \n&gt; level is 6.\n&gt;\n&gt; =&gt; 97 NN inputs, 6 x 16 (+bias).\n&gt; I wanted the output to be 6 &quot;bit&quot;, having the ability to record 64 \n&gt; different words per NN.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want the learning to be relatively fast.. is this the correct way? \n&gt; Any better idea?\n&gt; Maybe I can try to learn the syllables and break the words to that.. \n&gt; but that&#39;s seams to be much more complicated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Ariel.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
