There\n&gt; are many considerations, and although I may not hit all of them, I\n&gt; think in general it can be refuted:\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally, I think HyperNEAT (i.e. NEAT with CPPNs) already\n&gt; approximately follow the scenario that you outline:  It discovers key\n&gt; motifs (whether they be skin or something else) early in evolution and\n&gt; then as the overall body plan is deformed, the original motifs are\n&gt; often preserved (which again includes skin).  The main idea is that\n&gt; skin is like a kind of surrounding motif for the overall shape, and if\n&gt; the pverall shape is warped through some kind of mutation in the\n&gt; internal CPPN, then however the shape is surrounded will naturally\n&gt; warp in the same way.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, you can see this happen consistently in Picbreeder.  It is\n&gt; possible to consider the simple black outline of many of the color\n&gt; figures as a &quot;skin.&quot;  You can notice that it is special by noting that\n&gt; often the outer band is black but everything structure inside is\n&gt; color.  Then, if the shape of the overall image warps, so does the\n&gt; outer membrane.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, you might say that such a &quot;skin&quot; is not complex enough to be\n&gt; convincing.  Perhaps skin should have multiple parts, i.e. its own\n&gt; special structure.  In fact, if you look closely, you can find many\n&gt; such examples.  For example, there are often double-layer outer\n&gt; membranes that form, such as in this image:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=317\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a clear outer structure that surrounds the complex curvature\n&gt; of the object.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, perhaps more interestingly, you can get several layers of color\n&gt; bands, but only on the outer membrane, such as in this image that ends\n&gt; in a light blue that becomes green, then becomes yellow, before\n&gt; sinking into the inner-body color of orange:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=4227\n&gt; \n&gt; To show that the outer membrane warps easily and naturally regardless\n&gt; of shape changes (even complex ones), I further evolved that image to\n&gt; get a new shape, and you can see that the outer membrane has the same\n&gt; motif nevertheless, nicely warped to accommodate the new overall shape:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=5635\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also important to note that outer membranes in nature are not\n&gt; uniform covers and often transition into something else on the\n&gt; surface.  For example, consider lips and eyes.  Or perhaps even more\n&gt; importantly, consider fingernails, where the outer cover actually\n&gt; falls *under* something else (i.e. the nail), violating the covering\n&gt; rule.  I point these exceptions out because in Picbreeder you also\n&gt; often see almost consistent outer motifs that are broken in a couple\n&gt; places.  While these locations often are arbitrary, the point is that\n&gt; such a capability could be exploited if it actually mattered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving from 2-D to 3-D should not matter in the case of skin, just as\n&gt; moving CPPNs from 2-D to 4-D continues to allow all the same\n&gt; regularities.  So when you see examples in 2-D, they are also possible\n&gt; in 3-D for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of these outer skin motifs can arise early when the shape is\n&gt; simple and are then easily preserved.  However, they are not always\n&gt; preserved.  For example, the multicolor skin above evolved into a\n&gt; different multicolor skin in one lineage:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=4228\n&gt; \n&gt; This phenomenon is expected from the analogy with nature, just as\n&gt; scales can evolve into fur, or fur into uncovered skin, all still\n&gt; serving the role of outer membrane.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s important to note that skin or an outer membrane is not\n&gt; really any different from any other CPPN-generated motif, in that it\n&gt; can be preserved, warped, or changed in its internal structure.  So I\n&gt; don&#39;t think there is really anything special going on in the argument\n&gt; compared to the discovery of symmetry or other conventions.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ken has challenged us all many times to think about whether there is any\n&gt;&gt; need for a process of development. The identity of cells in\n&gt; developmental\n&gt;&gt; processes is determined by local contextual information whereas Ken\n&gt;&gt; advocates skipping that by letting cells determine their identity\n&gt; via giving\n&gt;&gt; them their objective coordinates. The question is whether we lose\n&gt; anything\n&gt;&gt; important to the evolution of complexity by skipping this step.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think it is a fascinating question and, unable to come up with a good\n&gt;&gt; reason why development matters myself, but wanting to give the\n&gt; argument a\n&gt;&gt; rigorous evaluation, I have been asking many people in our field whether\n&gt;&gt; they can describe something unique that a developmental process\n&gt; provides. No\n&gt;&gt; one has come up with  a reason that compels me, so I have become a\n&gt; strong\n&gt;&gt; advocate of the lack of a need for an unfolding process.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; However, in the course of watching a keynote on development in natural\n&gt;&gt; systems at this year&#39;s gecco, an argument in favor of development\n&gt; occurred\n&gt;&gt; to me that may have merit. I am interested to hear what y&#39;all think\n&gt; of it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The argument is this: it might be easier to evolve certain large-scale\n&gt;&gt; properties when the organism is simple and small and then scale/grow\n&gt; them\n&gt;&gt; up, rather than incorporating them into an already complex phenotype. I\n&gt;&gt; think an example illustrates the point best. Imagine evolution\n&gt; figuring out\n&gt;&gt; how to put a coat of skin on an organism. It is not that hard to\n&gt; figure out\n&gt;&gt; what the shape of that skin should be when the embryo has only a few\n&gt; cells.\n&gt;&gt; Once that simple and small coat of skin has formed, it can follow\n&gt; the simple\n&gt;&gt; rule of keeping the layer of skin the same thickness, and adding cells\n&gt;&gt; within that layer to grow to cover any arbitrary shape that the\n&gt; phenotype\n&gt;&gt; becomes. This simple rule could produce a skin shell for a bat or a\n&gt; jaguar.\n&gt;&gt; Now consider how hard it would be for 3D hyperneat to create a skin\n&gt; shell\n&gt;&gt; for a bat or a jaguar. The mathematical function to create such\n&gt; outlines is\n&gt;&gt; very complex (although it is less so if it is a composition of other,\n&gt;&gt; already created functions that produced the rest of the body). Still, it\n&gt;&gt; seems that this task might be harder for hyperneat than following\n&gt; the simple\n&gt;&gt; developmental rules outlined above.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; What do you think? I would happily be convinced that this argument is\n&gt;&gt; without merit, so please let me know if you see any problems with it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
