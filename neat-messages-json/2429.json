I need to do some backgroud reading \nbut implementing leaky integrator neurons fits in nicely with my general \nplan of experimenting with different kinds of neurons and activation \nfunctions. I had already made a note to clarify precisely what LSTM is \nand where it should/could be used, but I had forgotten about Tyler&#39;s \nwork and the leaky integreator stuff.\n\nNaturally I&#39;ll be keeping everyone posted.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
