While it is an indirect encodi=\r\nng, the encoding itself is a function of geometry, so it cannot be consider=\r\ned independently of that geometry.  \n\nMy hypothesis, which I&#39;ve discussed w=\r\nith Jeff, is that in some domains almost *any* random layout has some kind =\r\nof exploitable geometric relationship.  It may not be the most convenient o=\r\nne, but it is still better than nothing.  Of course, having a &quot;good&quot; geomet=\r\nry is better than a random one (as Jeff also shows), but I still think a ra=\r\nndom one probably has some useful relationships on average (at least in the=\r\n quadruped domain).\n\nThe question for me is whether HyperNEAT can succeed w=\r\nith random geometries in general, or just in particular domains.  It clearl=\r\ny can do it in the quadruped domain, but I wonder about others.  Perhaps th=\r\ne quadruped has properties that make the geometry more forgiving than in mo=\r\nst domains.  \n\nHowever, you (Peter) note that you also saw the same thing i=\r\nn your own experiments.  So maybe it&#39;s a somewhat widespread phenomenon.\n\nI=\r\n think that what is important is not so much that you can randomize geometr=\r\ny, because there isn&#39;t really much reason you&#39;d want it to be completely ra=\r\nndom, but that it shows that you don&#39;t need to get it perfect to still do w=\r\nell.  That is definitely good news.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pet=\r\nar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for postin=\r\ng this paper, great work!\n&gt; By the way I also noticed that HyperNEAT perfor=\r\nms well even in cases of a substrate that is messed up. My first release of=\r\n the NEVH experiment had a bug, it was not symmetrical and basically it cou=\r\nld be considered randomized. Yet it was still able to evolve good behaviors=\r\n, though. I wonder, is this linked to the geometry at all? Perhaps only the=\r\n fact that this indirect encoding searches trough less dimensions, makes it=\r\n more effective?\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stan=\r\nley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just for the record, I highly recommend thi=\r\ns paper.  It&#39;s the most extensive study published on the effect of varying =\r\ngeometry on HyperNEAT performance.  Some of its results are quite interesti=\r\nng.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, it suggests that HyperNEAT is still significant=\r\nly better than a direct encoding encoding even if its geometry is randomize=\r\nd! (Although it is still worse than an engineered geometry.)  Jeff and I ha=\r\nve discussed how to interpret this result and my own opinion is that most r=\r\nandomized geometries nevertheless still have some useful geometry, and some=\r\nthing is better than nothing.  So it suggests that you don&#39;t have to necess=\r\narily hit on the &quot;perfect&quot; substrate geometry to get traction out of HyperN=\r\nEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet I think a big question that emerges from this result is w=\r\nhether it is somehow tied specifically to the quadruped domain.  It is poss=\r\nible that it has something to with the fact that a quadruped can get along =\r\npretty well if all its legs move in tandem, so you have the opportunity to =\r\nrepresent that repetition regardless of how the legs are organized geometri=\r\ncally.  It is possible that other types of systems are less geometrically f=\r\norgiving, though that remains to be seen.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, in practice, =\r\nif the right geometry is even partially clear, the resultant informed subst=\r\nrate configuration is probably going to be better than a random geometry.  =\r\nThe &quot;engineered&quot; geometries (meaning they are designed by a human to make s=\r\nense) still outperform the random ones in the paper, even as the random one=\r\ns outperform the direct encoding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, in my view, the most imp=\r\nortant implication is that geometry matters.  If you can construct a sensib=\r\nle geometry, HyperNEAT will indeed take advantage of it to learn the task. =\r\n And even if it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s better than having no geometric knowled=\r\nge at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;j=\r\nclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Below is a link to a new=\r\n HyperNEAT paper that I will present at GECCO 2009\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this summer.

This pa=\r\nper provides the first extensive analysis of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitivity of Hyper=\r\nNEAT to different geometric representations of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem. Understandi=\r\nng how geometric representations affect the quality of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolved soluti=\r\nons should improve future designs of such representations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT =\r\nhas been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quadruped=\r\n robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here=\r\n, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rep=\r\nresentations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the quality\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantially affecte=\r\nd by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a direct enc=\r\noding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control even with randomized geometric representations, but per=\r\nforms even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better when a human engineer designs a representation that=\r\n reflects the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even choic=\r\nes in geometric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori can s=\r\nignificantly affect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representation=\r\n can bias the type of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right symm=\r\netry more common than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest that =\r\nHyperNEAT practitioners can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain good results even if they do not k=\r\nnow how to geometrically represent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a problem, and that further improv=\r\nements are possible with a well-chosen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; geometric representation.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As always, I look forward to any questions or commen=\r\nts you may have.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Digital=\r\n Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
