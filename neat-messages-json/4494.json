Issues of general interest to neuroevolution are often\ndiscussed=\r\n here and like you said, there are not many choices for\nforums to discuss t=\r\nhese kinds of issues.  (Note that Derek James is\nthe moderator, but I am gu=\r\nessing he would agree with me.)\n\nLike you, I believe that &quot;development&quot; in =\r\nthe sense of indirect\nencoding is probably an important factor in achieving=\r\n the kind of\ntransferability that you describe.  The particulars of the\ndev=\r\nelopmental abstraction might be fairly high-level, like HyperNEAT,\nso it ma=\r\ny not be literally like biological development, but the\ngeneral idea of an =\r\nindirect encoding of neural structure allowing it\nto be &quot;plugged in&quot; to oth=\r\ner bodies makes sense.\n\nTo elaborate a little, what I think would really he=\r\nlp with such an\nenterprise is if the neural network could be made to be a f=\r\nunction of\nthe properties of the body.  For example, with HyperNEAT, we oft=\r\nen\ntalk about how the neural network can be generated as a function of\nthe =\r\ngeometry of the substrate.  The kind of plug-and-play modularity\nthat you d=\r\nescribe might be a step further, since perhaps some of the\ngeometric proper=\r\nties of the body would need to be input as well, but\nultimately I think it =\r\nis an instance of the same principle.  That way,\na CPPN would generate a ne=\r\nural network for the appropriate context.  \n\nHowever, I think it would be i=\r\nncreasingly difficult  the more\nlow-level the developmental encoding (CPPNs=\r\n are very high-level)\nbecause the lower you go, the more difficult it becom=\r\nes to ensure that\nexplicit information about the body that you want to infl=\r\nuence the\nfinal product is actually detected. \n\nAnother part of your discus=\r\nsion is the de-coupling of different neural\nmodules.  Such mixing and match=\r\ning should be possible to some extent\nbut I am not confident about it.  I a=\r\nm more confident about the idea\nof a single holistic controller that encomp=\r\nasses both high and\nlow-level thinking, but that cannot be easily broken in=\r\nto distinct\npieces.  While you mention that faculties of the brain are gene=\r\nrally\nsplit into distinct modules, I believe that metaphor does not capture=\r\n\nthe full complexity of the dependence of modules upon each other.  For\nexa=\r\nmple, while face processing may exist at one location, there are\nlikely anc=\r\nillary modules in other locations that also play a role in\nface processing =\r\nthat are less obvious yet that tightly coordinate with\nthe main unit.  Ripp=\r\ning out one unit and putting in another could\ndisrupt such distributed proc=\r\nessing.  \n\nOn the other hand, while you might decide to enforce a division =\r\nof\nroles, that means imposing *our* vision of how a task is best broken\ndow=\r\nn, which may ultimately be suboptimal.  Enforcing divisions like\nbetween &quot;h=\r\nigh-level&quot; and &quot;low-level&quot; imposes a kind of strict\nhierarchy that I think =\r\ncould loose some of the important nuance that\nmore transparent and less hie=\r\nrarchical structure exhibit.  Therefore,\nI am inclined to let neuroevolutio=\r\nn decide the division of labor.  \n\nIn any case, the idea of plug-and-play i=\r\nnteroperability among\nsubcomponents of a brain is not impossible, I am just=\r\n not convinced\nit&#39;s going to work that great.  However, being able to regen=\r\nerate an\nentire holistic brain for a new body seems to be a promising idea.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Antoan Bekele&quot; &lt;antoan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; This post is not strictly about NEAT and is general to the field of\n&gt; ne=\r\nuro-evolutionary systems but is relevant nonetheless, and since I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; k=\r\nnow many good community forums on GA&#39;s I thought that this would be the\n&gt; b=\r\nest place to start (please suggest any that you know of). \n&gt; \n&gt; Please forg=\r\nive me if I&#39;ve intruded.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking sometime now=\r\n about how neural network systems\ncould be\n&gt; used and reused as components =\r\nlike in the software engineering\nindustry. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Using a combat dron=\r\ne as an example like the Boeing X-45\n&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAV&gt; =\r\n unmanned combat air vehicle and\n&gt; supposing it is evolved to act as a full=\r\ny autonomous fighter (which\nit isn&#39;t\n&gt; - it is in fact a bomber): \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; .         How could one go about transferring the strategic planning an=\r\nd\n&gt; tactical maneuver skills learned by the drone from experience\n(assuming=\r\n also\n&gt; that a form of online learning is employed) to another drone of a\nr=\r\nelatively\n&gt; similar morphology and locomotion characteristics where those s=\r\nkills be\n&gt; still relevant?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; A level of a separation of\n&gt; &lt;http:/=\r\n/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&gt;  concerns\nexists in\n&gt; the br=\r\nains of both drones in terms of abstract modules for a) low level\n&gt; autonom=\r\nous flight and another b) for higher level planning and maneuver\n&gt; cognitiv=\r\ne functions.  These modular might exist as two separate networks\n&gt; coupled =\r\ntogether living on separate FPGA chips, for example or might\nexist\n&gt; logica=\r\nlly in one giant mess of neurons (due to incremental\ncomplexification\n&gt; dev=\r\nelopment).  It would be very useful to have a process for\ndecoupling a\n&gt; gi=\r\nven autonomous system functionally and be able to reuse its component\n&gt; net=\r\nworks in different types of systems, where it makes sense, by somehow\n&gt; &#39;fu=\r\nsing&#39; the parts together -  a process that could also facilitate the\n&gt; adap=\r\ntation and integration of components. After all our brains have\nevolved\n&gt; i=\r\nnto cognitive faculties, are compartmentalized and have highly\nspecialized\n=\r\n&gt; circuits for recognizing faces and conceptualizing numbers for example. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just a shot in the dark but may be modeling biological cellular=\r\n\ngrowth and\n&gt; development might do this, there are some fascinating example=\r\ns in\nbiological\n&gt; systems where one set of cells becomes integrated with an=\r\nother, for\ninstance\n&gt; in the process of restoring lost function by &#39;injecti=\r\nng&#39; stem cells.\n See\n&gt; &#39;Purified &lt;http://www.physorg.com/news134915195.html=\r\n&gt;  stem cells\nrestore\n&gt; muscle in mice with muscular dystrophy&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; This type of component based development approach would the enable rapid=\r\n\n&gt; development of autonomous intelligent systems, not just in the field of\n=\r\n&gt; robotics, and spawn growth in the field as seen in the software\nindustry =\r\nin\n&gt; the early 80&#39;s.  A market could emerge built around reusable\ncomponent=\r\ns in\n&gt; which they could be traded and shared amongst developers. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on this, any pointers or links to research=\r\n\n&gt; aligned with this kind of thinking? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments wou=\r\nld be welcome. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Antoan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
