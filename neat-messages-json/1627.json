In nature, not all parts of a chromosome exhibit \n&gt; equal\n&gt; mutation rates.\n\nNot only that, in a larger sense, different phenotypic modules exhibit \ndifferent mutation rates based on their connectivity. For example, take \nsome regulatory pathway &#39;A&#39; that is very short but highly conserved \nacross several different modules. A mutation on &#39;A&#39; will then affect \nall of those modules. Whereas a mutation in as less-conserved process, \nsay &#39;B,&#39; would have a smaller phenotypic effect.\n\nThus not only the mechanism of crossover and DNA transcription, but \nalso development itself affects what we think of as phenotypic \nmutation.\n\n-- Joe\n\n\n"}}
