But the idea of a lot of neutral or slightly maladaptive\n&gt; &gt;structure expressed in the phenotype, that is just waiting around to\n&gt; &gt;become useful?  I&#39;m *highly* skeptical that this is a good idea.\n\nSorry, lost track of who said this but:\n\nIn cells, one advantage of junk DNA is the way the indirect encoding operates.\n\nDNA codes proteins... and proteins are simply dropped into the cytoplasm \n(or the membrane, or one of a small number of other places).\n\nSo, a non-functional mutated copy of a gene in the junk DNA can be \nactivated, and then very easily plugs into the existing systems.  e.g. the \nprotein is created, dropped into the cytoplasm, and is then immediately \nplaying a role in the cells control systems.  It can bind any small \nmolecule present (and optionally catalyse a reaction).  Bind any other \nprotein, or class of proteins, bind any DNA sequence it likes, etc etc.\n\nThus any newly duplicated and mutated protein requires no additional \n&quot;wiring&quot; to attach it to the cell&#39;s machinery.  It&#39;s own nature is all that \nis required to plug it in, and since it&#39;s a variant of a previous protein, \nit very probably starts with some functional &quot;plugs&quot;.\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
