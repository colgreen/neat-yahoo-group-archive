By the way, if you\n&gt; download either \n&gt; Mattias Fagerlund&#39;s demos or Ugo Vierruci&#39;s JNEAT,\n&gt; you can watch XOR \n&gt; in action and see how solutions should look.\n\nThanks, Ken.  We&#39;re having a look at Ugo&#39;s\nimplementation now for comparison.\n\nJNEAT does find very efficient solutions in a\nrelatively small number of generations...seems to be\nworking quite well.\n\nHowever, I&#39;ve noticed some strange topologies\ndisplaying via the gui.  I don&#39;t know if this is a\nproblem with the gui or with the algorithm itself.\n\nI&#39;ve uploaded pics of these in the Photos section of\nour Yahoo Group.\n\nFor example, here the First Winner Genome as a node\n(9), which appears to have to incoming connections,\nbut no outgoing connections.  How would such a\nstructure even be allowed to evolve with NEAT?\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=example1.gif&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nHere&#39;s another, where the Current Genome has a node\n(12) without any outgoing connections:\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=example2.gif&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nAnd another:\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=example3.gif&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nIs this an error, or am I not understanding how either\nNEAT or JNEAT works?\n\n&gt; How many generations are your runs going?  How many\n&gt; species are you \n&gt; seeing form?  What does your fitness graph look\n&gt; like?  When does it \n&gt; typically lift off the plateau (where it still\n&gt; hasn&#39;t made the \n&gt; crucial connection that allows the problem to be\n&gt; solved)?\n\nDon&#39;t know yet.  We&#39;ve only been looking at textual\noutput so far.  But within the next day or two we&#39;ll\ngenerate some graphics and upload them to the Photos\nsection.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
