What I realised was, that without\n&gt;&gt;something to compare against I couldn&#39;t determine if the technique was\n&gt;&gt;better than the more simple direct encodings out there.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It may not be better for simple problems.  I believe the judgement \n&gt;criterion for indirect coding will be addressing harder problems, not \n&gt;working better on the current ones.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes I agree. That&#39;s why I&#39;m keen on finding some sufficiently \ndifficult/taxing problem domains, but domains that take up as little CPU \ntime as possible. The problem with most domains is that the better a \npopulation gets the longer it takes to evaluate, this includes domains \nsuch as pole balancing, board games and predator/prey. At least  with \nsomething like OCR (effectively a classification problem) the evaluation \ntime remains constant throughout. I think this area is important because \na lot of the work of finding good genome representations is likely to \ninvolve a large amount of tweaking of paramerters and the underlying \nmodel, so when you&#39;re running multiple experiments if you have to sit \nwatching a slow run then the cycles of tweaking and re-experimenting \nwill quickly become very tedious!\n\n&gt;&gt;Actually, I don&#39;t know how others feel about this but I&#39;m sometimes\n&gt;&gt;slightly baffled at just how underdevelped this areas of AI research is\n&gt;&gt;and that some of this work wasn&#39;t done years ago!\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s not just this area.  I think the problem is that to publish you have \n&gt;to implement and test, and implementation is far more time concerning than \n&gt;design, and testing is slower still.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBut isn&#39;t this the case in most areas of research? Perhaps it&#39;s just not \npercieved to be as &#39;cool&#39; as biological genetics and other &#39;real world&#39; \nsciences.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
