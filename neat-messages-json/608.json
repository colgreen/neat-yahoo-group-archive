In Mat Buckland&#39;s book chapter on NEAT he describes a much\nbetter method than I used for determining both the layer of various\nnodes, and whether connections are recurrent:\n\nThe idea is that you have a &quot;splitlevel&quot; for each node, which is a\nnumber between 0 and 1.  Inputs are 0 and outputs are 1 by definition.\n Whenever a link is split by an add-link mutation, the new node\nreceives a split level halfway between the splitlevels of the innode\nand outnode of the connection.  Then, if a connection is added, if the\nsplitlevel of its innode is greater than that of its outnode, you know\nto consider it recurrent!  Quite simple and computationally cheap! \nAnd of course to know what layer the node should be in in a graph, you\njust check its splitlevel.\n\nThe one thing I haven&#39;t reasoned through for myself is whether\ncrossover can screw up the appropriate splitlevels in any special\ncases.  It doesn&#39;t seem so at first thought, but I haven&#39;t verified\nthis for myself so if anyone knows better that would be interesting. \nOtherwise, I think this is the most convenient and efficient way to do\nthis.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
