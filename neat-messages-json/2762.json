I basically wrap rtNEAT with python and split it into  \na single server farming out jobs over RPC to some number of clients.  \nThe code isn&#39;t particularly elegant (i.e. it requires that the  \nclients and server have a shared disk space), but I can probably  \nclean it up enough for it to be usable if you&#39;re interested.\n\nPS: One other caveat: the code was designed to be run over a fairly  \nlarge number of nodes (200+), so for the case where you&#39;re  \nparallelizing over, e.g., multiple cores on a single computer, you  \nmight be better off taking up Colin&#39;s offer instead.\n\n-- Joe\n\nOn Sep 20, 2006, at 6:43 PM, Colin Green wrote:\n\n&gt; There was a discussion around the new year I think regarding the\n&gt; different parallel computing models, e.g. I prefer the island model\n&gt; where each node runs NEAT pretty much independently of the other nodes\n&gt; but with an occasional passing around of the best genomes between\n&gt; nodes/islands. I haven&#39;t got around to doing anythin gliek this yet  \n&gt; though.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I will be doing fairly soon is creating a multi-threaded  \n&gt; version of\n&gt; SharpNEAT to utilize multi-core CPU&#39;s. I thought about it and I  \n&gt; think it\n&gt; will be easy to do - an evening or two say. Anyway I just put an order\n&gt; in for a new dual core PC so that should be an incentive :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
