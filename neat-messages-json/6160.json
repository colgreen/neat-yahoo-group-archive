We are still accepting s=\r\nubmissions of abstracts!\n\n* Evolution of Physical Systems Workshop *\n\nat th=\r\ne 2013 European Conference on Artificial Life (ECAL)\nSeptember 2, 2013\nTaor=\r\nmina, Italy\n\n\nWe use the term Evolution of Physical Systems (EPS) to refer =\r\nto evolutionary algorithms which occur entirely in real-world physical subs=\r\ntrates rather than in simulation. The term encompasses both parallel Embodi=\r\ned Evolution (Watson et al., 2002), in which evolution is distributed acros=\r\ns a population of robots, as well as Evolutionary Robotics (Floreano and Mo=\r\nndada, 1994) where evaluation is serialized on a single robot. Notable exam=\r\nples of EPS occur across a wide variety of systems, ranging from Robotics (=\r\nZykov et al., 2004)] to FPGAs (Thompson, 1996) to 3D printers (Rieffel and =\r\nSayles, 2010). Although EPS comes at a cost (the speed of the real world, u=\r\nnlike CPUs, does not follow Moore&#39;s Law), by definition it avoids the &quot;real=\r\nity gap&quot; imposed by simulation, and has produced novel and tangeable real-w=\r\norld results. Regardless of application or method, all implementations of E=\r\nPS are bound by many of the same constraints and technical challenges. The =\r\naim of this full-day single-track workshop is to bring together researchers=\r\n who are currently involved in the Evolution of Physical Systems, as well a=\r\ns those interested in the technique, in order to share ideas and innovation=\r\ns. As the frontiers of artificial life move from the computer to the petri =\r\ndish, the Evolution of Physical Systems offers to provide inroads into doma=\r\nins which are otherwise impossible to simulate.\n\nThe first EPS Workshop, at=\r\n ALIFE `13 in East Lansing Michigan, was a tremendous success. Spread over =\r\nan entire day, we had time for eight speakers to give presentations, as wel=\r\nl as an extended panel session on the promises and pitfalls of the Evolutio=\r\nn of Physical Systems. The room was packed for both morning and afternoon s=\r\nession, with more than 60 attendees.\n\nImportant Dates\nSubmission Deadline: =\r\nJuly 14th, 2013\nWorkshop: September 2, 2013\n\nNote: Workshop-only registrati=\r\non is available\n\nOrganizers:\n- John Rieffel (Union College, New York, USA)\n=\r\n- Jean-Baptiste Mouret (Universit=E9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France)\n=\r\n- Nicolas Bredeche (Universit=E9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France)\n- Ev=\r\nert Haasdijk (VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands)\n\nWorkshop=92s website: =\r\nhttp://cs.union.edu/~rieffelj/EPS-Workshop-13/\nConference=92s website: http=\r\n://www.dmi.unict.it/ecal2013/\n\nSubmission\nWe invite both extended abstracts=\r\n and full &quot;concept&quot; papers. We invite and encourage participation by those =\r\nwho already have an EPS-themed paper accepted at ECAL. We will also accept =\r\nabstracts of recently published EPS-related journal papers.\n\nPapers should =\r\nbe submitted in PDF format only via email to rieffelj(at)union(dot)edu. Be =\r\nsure to place the text &quot;EPS Workshop&quot; in the subject line of your message.\n=\r\n-- \nJean-Baptiste Mouret\nhttp://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret\n"}}
