Yeh, I was aware that there is an AI group there (Natural \n&gt; Computation is a much nicer term), though I&#39;ve never had any\ncontact \n&gt; with anyone in the group -  it does seem to have developed quite a\nbit \n&gt; since I last checked it out. Xin Yao&#39;s 1999 paper &quot;Evolving\nArtificial \n&gt; Neural Networks&quot; was really the catalyst for me to have a go at an\nEANN \n&gt; project instead of just thinking about it. Currently that means \n&gt; developing my own version of NEAT in C# which I&#39;m keen to try\nagainst a \n&gt; range of domains to get a feel for myself  just what NEAT (and\nsimilar \n&gt; techniques) are capable of and what their limits are.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway it&#39;s interesting you guys are on this list. Are you or are\nany of \n&gt; your colleagues actually working with NEAT? or are you just\nlurking? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;ll catch you off list since this is potentially straying \n&gt; off-topic somewhat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\nHi Colin,\n\nNo need to go off-list on this topic..I&#39;d be interested too.  One\nconnection you also may not know of is that Kennon was an undergrad\nhere at UT and did an independent study with me working on NEAT a\ncouple years ago. \n\nIt&#39;s definitely interesting to know what the biggest researchers in\nneuroevolution are up to, since there really aren&#39;t that many major\nplaces to study this topic (yet).  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
