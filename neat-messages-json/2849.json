I have to congratulate \n&gt; you on making SharpNEAT such a great system.  It&#39;s incredibly fast, \n&gt; has a nice GUI, and implements an efficient version of NEAT.\n\nThanks!\n\n&gt;   Some \n&gt; of my students are now choosing to use it inside their projects.\n&gt;   \n\nThat&#39;s great news. It&#39;s really nice to know that people are using the \ncode in an educational setting and learning from using and reading the code.\n\n\n&gt; The next version sounds exciting and I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.\n&gt;   \n\n\nDon&#39;t hold your breath on that one but maybe in the new year or early \nnext year. It&#39;s mostly there but I&#39;ve been taking the opportunity to \nrethink some areas of the code. E.g. I&#39;ve code in the default NEAT \nevolution algorithm to try and keep the number of species far more \ntightly controlled than the current method of adjusting the speciation \nthreshold does. I don;t think you can ever absolutely clamp the number \nof species to a specific number because the population may not have \nenough (or any) variation to give the precise number of species you \nwant, so I came up with a halfway solution that I think makes sense. \nThere are a few other little tweaks I&#39;ve made, unfortunately this is all \ntons of code I&#39;ve written that hasn&#39;t actually been tested or even \nexecuted yet which is a /bit/ of a worry.\n\nWhile I&#39;m here, have you (or anyone else on the list) had any thoughts \nor made any further developments on your &quot;Patterns without development&quot; \npaper/idea? It certainly seems like a really powerful approach/concept \nbut formulating a method that utilises it could be tricky, e.g. a method \nof converting the generated patterns into neural nets.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
