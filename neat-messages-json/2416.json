This way the speciation reacts to \nchanges in th threshold immediately rather than having the effect \ndelayed by having to wait for genomes to die.\n\nI also now redetermine speciation if the populations&#39;s average \ncomplexity has changed by some fixed proportion (2% I think) since the \nlast time it was done. Doing this prevent the threshold getting out of \nstep with the actual population, which can cause a large jumps in the \nnumber of species when the speciation routine was next run. It&#39;s perhaps \nnot as efficient or elegant as Ian&#39;s scheme but I don&#39;t think the CPU \noverhead is too bad with the typical population sizes and complexities \nwe currently deal with.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
