One suggestion is to try pruning the networks with the addition =\r\nof subtractive mutations (remove link & remove node). Or better try phased =\r\nsearching, complexification followed by simplification stages. This will im=\r\nprove things for sure. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jc=\r\nlune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been noticing in many of my Hyp=\r\nerNEAT runs recently that the number\n&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a st=\r\neep linear function of time\n&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected b=\r\ny the fitness trajectory of the\n&gt; run. \n&gt; \n&gt; See here, for example\n&gt; \n&gt; htt=\r\nps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes it gets=\r\n really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt; every 100 gen=\r\nerations, such as here:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bl=\r\noat-2.png\n&gt; \n&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second figure whe=\r\nre the CPPN node\n&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing environment a=\r\nnd those runs where\n&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) ar=\r\ne in a constant\n&gt; environment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOne problem is that it makes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt; po=\r\npulations with 200-node genomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt; evoluti=\r\non can make too much progress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt; seen =\r\nfitness continue to increase even with such large genomes).\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tri=\r\ned dropping the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt; that defi=\r\nnitely changes the slope of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt; increases. Th=\r\ne good news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts? =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan St=\r\nate University\n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
