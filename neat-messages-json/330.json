You might want to try this with\nyour\n&gt; &gt; high-input domain as well.  He generally found it beneficial to\nstart\n&gt; &gt; out with very few inputs attached and let NEAT attach inputs\nrandomly\n&gt; &gt; through a special mutation that connects a disconnected input to\nall\n&gt; &gt; the outputs.  The rate of that mutation is somewhere between 0.05\nand\n&gt; &gt; 0.2 in his experiments but it&#39;s still an empirical question what&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; best.  It would be interesting to see if it helps in OCR.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s very clever indeed! How does the pick the initial inputs?\nJust \n&gt; randomly over the set of possible inputs?\n&gt; \n\nHere&#39;s how he picks the initial inputs:  In the initial population,\nfor each member of the population, each input has a 1/(number of\ninputs) chance of being connected.  Also the bias is always connected\nto the outputs.  So on average each network has the bias and one other\ninput connected.  Any network with only the bias connected is forced\nto have one other connection connected.  So the initial population is\nminimal but diverse.\n\nHere&#39;s another thing Shimon suggested:  Instead of training one big\nOCR network, train a separate network for each letter.  And do the\ntraining separately, i.e. an &quot;is it a &#39;b&#39;?&quot; network and a separate &quot;is\nit an &#39;a&#39;?&quot; network.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
