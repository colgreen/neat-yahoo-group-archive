I think it might make more sense for\n&gt;you to use the scheme you describe except instead of trying to make\n&gt;specific decisions about what &quot;type&quot; something is, try to assign them\n&gt;a meaninful fitness number, so NEAT can then take those and do things\n&gt;the way it likes.\n\nRight, what I mean is to be able to utilize NEAT&#39;s decision-making process \nto help determine when further evaluations will no longer contribute to the \noutcome of the next generation, at which point further calculations are just \nwasted energy.\n\nHere&#39;s an idea.  Suppose the Epoch code of NEAT were broken up into parts \n(if it isn&#39;t already).\n\n// pseudo-code...\nEpoch()\n{\n    IdentifyBreedingSpecimens();\n    NextGeneration();\n}\n\nThen, existing experiments that call Epoch() still work the same as they \ncurrently do.  But other experiments could call the \nIdentifyBreedingSpecimens() code directly.  Suppose that code just sets a \nflag to true for all those that will be reproducing, and false for those \nthat will not.  Then, it returns the number of specimens whose flag changed \nduring the course of evaluation.  Thus, it is a non-zero value any time the \nlist of who is selected for reproduction changes.  Then the experiment can \nuse that value to help it know when it has performed &#39;enough&#39; evaluations to \nhave &#39;adequate&#39; fitness values and is ready to move on to the next \ngeneration.\n\nExample:\n\nsteady = 0;\ndo {\n    GetNextSample();\n    EvaluateNetworks();\n    if ( IdentifyBreedingSpecimens() )\n        steady = 0;  // something changed...keep evaluating\n    else\n        steady++;\n} while ( steady &lt; 10 )\nNextGeneration();\n\nMy guess is that mine is not the only domain where this kind of thing might \nbe handy.  Any sufficiently large domain would probably benefit.  What do \nyou think?\n\n&gt;Second, as much as possible, I would try to give the same random\n&gt;sample to different networks in the same generation.  The problem is\n&gt;that you are going to come up against considerable noise if you start\n&gt;taking different random samples.  Of course, in the limit evolution\n&gt;can theoretically sort through that noise, but in practice a great\n&gt;deal of noise can be insurmountable.\n\nThat&#39;s what I figured too.  But I wanted to hear if there was a dissenting \nopinion on the matter.\n\n&gt;You have a huge pool of examples so it will be interesting to see\n&gt;how this experiment turns out.\n\nYes.  I&#39;m pretty confident that it can do it.  As long as I don&#39;t make any \nserious blunders along the way. :)\n\n-- John\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWatch high-quality video with fast playback at MSN Video.
