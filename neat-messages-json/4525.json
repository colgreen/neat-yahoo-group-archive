I have to\nadmit that =\r\nI did not reason through this issue to the extent people\nhave in this threa=\r\nd when I first created NEAT.  For what it&#39;s worth,\nbecause my original moti=\r\nvation was the problem of topologies that are\nnot the same, my thinking was=\r\n most focused on identifying and counting\nthe excess/disjoint genes.  There=\r\nfore, I think I agree with the view\nthat we should not assume dimensions to=\r\n exist that do not really exist\nin a certain lineage (a view that you and P=\r\neter seem to be leaning\ntowards).  So that suggests keeping the current dis=\r\ntance metric.\n\nYet what if we only computed Euclidean distance on the match=\r\ning genes?\n The disjoint/excess genes could still be counted separately.  S=\r\no the\nmeasure would be kind of hybridized between two different kinds of\ndi=\r\nstance.  But I&#39;m not sure of the implication- what are the\nadvantages of th=\r\ne Euclidean view of matching genes?  It would be\ninteresting to see experim=\r\nental results.\n\nOn the other hand, like many issues in NEAT, I am guessing =\r\nthe effect\nwould not be dramatic.  But it is still a good question.\n\nken \n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey I am thinking about this stuff a bit and.. I wonder if this is \n=\r\n&gt; similar to Novelty Search, where you can choose to have L1 or L2 or \n&gt; wh=\r\natever distance between phenotype behavior data. \n&gt; \n&gt; But in NS usually th=\r\ne behavior data is a fixed space. At the genetic \n&gt; level, the genotype spa=\r\nce is unconstrained. Calculating distance \n&gt; between points that lie in dif=\r\nferent spaces is a challenge. I even \n&gt; wonder if this is possible at all..=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; Take 2 random individuals from the first generation of a typical NEA=\r\nT \n&gt; evolution and they are all in the same space. Easy to compare. But \n&gt; =\r\ntake 2 from the same population 1000 generations later and you will \n&gt; find=\r\n out they are in completely different spaces. They may all branch \n&gt; from t=\r\nhe initial minimal space, but the virtual coordinate frame that \n&gt; should b=\r\ne able to describe all possible individuals does not really \n&gt; exist. Or do=\r\nes it? \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact I guess it does. I can have a 100000+ neurons fully \n&gt;=\r\n interconnected network and pretend it is the one ultimate space that \n&gt; NE=\r\nAT can search. Then I can assign coordinates to genomes based on \n&gt; that sp=\r\nace. But this is misleading because NEAT effectively discovers \n&gt; new space=\r\ns during evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; So it is a process guided by discovery. Then I gue=\r\nss that genotypic \n&gt; distance cannot be calculated more effectively than co=\r\nmparing the \n&gt; counts of excess/disjoint genes with respect of genomes. Ass=\r\nigning \n&gt; zeroes to missing links (assuming they exist with 0 weight) means=\r\n that \n&gt; these individuals also share genetic history, but they don&#39;t. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Peter \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t address this point:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2008/12/22 petar_cherven=\r\nski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose that 2 genomes have many disjoint ge=\r\nnes with respect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to each other, if they are both represented as zeroe=\r\ns, this would \n&gt; mean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they are closer in space?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes that&#39;s r=\r\night. And this is effectively why I backtracked and\n&gt; &gt; hypothesised that t=\r\nhe L1/manhattan distance (which is what we are\n&gt; &gt; effectively using curren=\r\ntly) is better than the L2/Euclidean \n&gt; distance.\n&gt; &gt; I think it would be a=\r\nn interesting experiment to try out thse\n&gt; &gt; different distance metrics and=\r\n see some experimental data to back up\n&gt; &gt; the hypothesis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
