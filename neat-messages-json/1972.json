Me,\n&gt;and every PhD student I know, got registered for a three-year PhD\n&gt;straight away, after having completed a one-year MSc, possibly in some\n&gt;other university.\n\nSorry, didn&#39;t mean to imply MScs were failed PhDs.  Obviously a lot of \npeople do MScs quite deliberately.\n\nIf what you say about most PhDs generally needing an MSc as a prerequisite \nis correct (and obviously, I&#39;ve got no reason to call you a liar :), then \nthat is a change I didn&#39;t pick up on (although, I suppose in retrospect I \ndid see a lot more MSc students that I might have expected, back when I was \nco-supervising student projects)...\n\n&gt;(4) The postgraduate tuition fee for an EU national, or EU resident,\n&gt;is about 3 000 pounds/year. For non-EU people it is about 10 000, a\n&gt;hefty amount. But after having studied in Scotland for four years, you\n&gt;might be considered an EU resident. The rules are tricky - an MA\n&gt;student I know, being a Canadian citizen, managed to get the lower fee\n&gt;after showing that she was registered with the Spanish authorities as\n&gt;resident in Spain for the last few years, which she had in fact spent\n&gt;in Indonesia. But she sure knew how to argue those things. Another\n&gt;friend of mine got both tuition and living expenses funded by the\n&gt;University of West of England, even though he&#39;s from Norway, which is\n&gt;oddly enough not part of the EU.\n&gt;\n&gt;I completely agree with what Ian says about supervisors.\n&gt;\n&gt;(By the way, Ian, you mentioned a position paper about modularity some\n&gt;time - is that available?)\n\n         It&#39;s not a paper in the appearing in a Journal sense (because (i) \nI&#39;m not in a university and (ii) I don&#39;t have time to write a &quot;proper&quot; paper).\n\n         I&#39;m still writing it up as a wed-document but Hofstadter&#39;s law \ndefinitely applies.  I&#39;ve got, say, 75% of the text in place, but what&#39;s \nleft is a bit diagram intensive... and then I need to fill in some \nreferences and a glossary.  And then just review the whole thing to be sure \nthat my terminology hasn&#39;t changed as I was going through (which I know for \na fact some of it did).\n\n         To help you tell whether you want to wait for this, here is the \nsummary page.  This will get rewritten a bit for the final draft, but the \ngeneral drift will be the same:\n\n\n1.2 summary\n\n\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nA position-document for the definition of evolving agents and research \noutline for this under-explored area of artificial intelligence. This \nproposal concerns embedding existing evolving software techniques (such as \nGenetic Programming and Neural Nets) inside co-evolving support frameworks \nwith the intention of increased evolvability, robustness, scalability and \nmodularity.\n\n----------\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis document proposes a new area of &lt;http://www.aaai.org/&gt;Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) research. It does not propose any huge and improbable \nbreakthrough, but documents an area where useful progress can be made.\n\nMany evolving software techniques already exist, such as:\n    * &lt;http://www.genetic-programming.org/&gt;Genetic Programming (GP)\n    * &lt;http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/neural-nets/&gt;Artificial Neural Nets \n(ANN) Although traditionally &quot;trained&quot;, more recent techniques started to \nevolve them with considerable success)\n    * Genetic algorithms (GA)\n    * Evolutionary Programming (EP)\n    * Evolution Strategies (ES)\n    * Classifier Systems.\nSee &lt;http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/faqs/ai/genetic/top.html&gt;here \nfor help distinguishing between evolutionary techniques.\n\nAlthough initially set up for the first two of these -- GP and ANN -- the \nideas outlined here are applicable to any of them, and potentially to any \n&quot;adaptive&quot; or &quot;learning&quot; algorithm.\n\nThe idea behind this document is that these techniques have the potential \nto evolve, and under &quot;hothouse&quot; conditions they do. They do not, however, \nexhibit the robustness or versatility of natural evolving systems. This is \nbecause the techniques are &quot;naked&quot;. In the same sense that DNA in a test \ntube is naked. Pour in the right chemicals and the naked DNA will replicate \n-- but it is hardly a viable organism.\n\nIn nature, the cell which surrounds a strand of DNA provides &quot;services&quot; to \nthe DNA. Services which not only support the day-to-day life of the \norganism, but also support evolution -- sometimes through action (e.g. \nintron splicing) but often just by their nature. Later I will devote an \nappendix to how protein chemistry is a perfect system to support the \nevolution of DNA.\n\nThis support for evolution is called &quot;evolvability&quot;. and the fundamental \npremise of this document is that there is a lot more that can be done to \nsupply evolvability in evolving computer systems. This document therefore \nproposes:\n    * A definition for an Evolving Agent (EA) in terms of principles it \nshould satisfy.\n    * Tests for those principles.\n    * A broad approach to achieving an EA by wrapping existing evolving \ntechnologies in a co-evolving support framework (CSF).\n    * Properties that the CSF will need to exhibit.\n    * A preliminary design for a CSF.\nIan\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
