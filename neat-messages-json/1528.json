I started with just wanting to use genetic\n&gt; algorithms to evolve the topology of neural networks rather than just\n&gt; the weights (the only application I had seen previously).  From there,\n&gt; I&#39;ve gradually gotten more specific in what I&#39;ve wanted to address as I\n&gt; read more papers.\n\nAre you referring to this paper:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?RECORD_KEY(Pubs)=PubID&PubID(Pubs)=131\n\nThe one with the food foraging domain?  As Ken points out in the\npaper, an interesting result is that networks without adaptive\nsynapsese are able to evolve built-in adaptive behaviors so that they\ncan react &#39;on the fly&#39; to changing conditions in the domain.\n\nI think this is a pretty interesting avenue to pursue.  As far as\ndomains go, I&#39;m hard pressed to think of domains where it *wouldn&#39;t*\nbe interesting to try to exploit plasticity during the lifetime of the\nnetwork.\n\nI&#39;d disagree with Colin that game domains would be out.  You&#39;d\ncertainly want to be able to detect and rapidly adapt to various\nstrategies...even in very simple games such as Tic-Tac-Toe there is a\nsignificant advantage to tailoring your strategy to your specific\nopponent, rather than playing solid, generic gameplay.\n\nSo rather than trying to find a domain to which adaptive synapses are\napplicable, I&#39;d probably take the approach of choosing a domain that\nparticularly interests me, then just see how adaptive synapses\nfunction in that domain.\n\nWhat are you interested in?  Games?  Imaging?  Robotics?  Speech\nrecognition?  Data mining?\n \nDerek\n\n"}}
