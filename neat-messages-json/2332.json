A good journal is a loooong \nprocess that can tak=\r\ne more than a year or even  years before the \npaper ever sees print.  For c=\r\nonferences you need to check the \ndeadlines for submission and prepare acco=\r\nrdingly.  For journals \nthere is no deadline.\n\nConferences like GECCO are d=\r\nouble-blind, which means reviewers don&#39;t \nget to see the author&#39;s name or a=\r\nffiliation, and the author doesn&#39;t \nget to know who the reviewer was.  So y=\r\nour lack of affiliation \nshould have no impact.  However, you may want to g=\r\nive yourself some \nkind of &quot;made up&quot; affiliation, like a company or laborat=\r\nory name, \nfor when it goes into print.  Derek and Philip on this group bot=\r\nh \ndid that and have published late breaking papers at GECCO.  They \nhave e=\r\nxperience in trying to publish without academic affiliation, \nso they may b=\r\ne able to give you some perspective.  \n\nNote that the main barrier to indep=\r\nendent publishing in research is \nnot lack of affiliation.  In my opinion, =\r\nit is style.  It took me \nyears to learn the acceptable manner of speech, s=\r\nectional divisions, \norder of exposition, etc., for this community.  And I =\r\nhad the \nbenefit of a veteran (Risto) constantly correcting and rewording \n=\r\neverything I wrote.  Without that, you may end up sounding like you \nare an=\r\n outsider.\n\nAnd that&#39;s a subtle problem, because being able to write good p=\r\nrose \nis not the same as knowing the customs and conventions of a \nparticul=\r\nar research community.  Researchers can tell when non-\nresearchers submit p=\r\napers because they break all the conventions \nunwittingly.  \n\nSo the conclu=\r\nsion is that you need to be really careful about \nfollowing the conventions=\r\n of your predecessors.  It is not \nimpossible to do, but it is a point most=\r\n people outside academic \ncommunities don&#39;t appreciate since they don&#39;t nec=\r\nessarily realize \nthat there is such a strong set of conventions.  \n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; At 15:1=\r\n1 11/10/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Hi Ian,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Many game developers do publish =\r\npapers nowadays.

And I was wondering wha=\r\nt \npeople\n&gt; &gt;thought the prospects are.  I mean, do journals generally have=\r\n a \nrule\n&gt; &gt;that says you have to be a member of a university before they&#39;l=\r\nl \nlook\n&gt; &gt;at your work?  I&#39;m guessing not because, of course, many corpora=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt;R&D depts also regularly publish.  But what are the prospects for \nan=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;unknown individual?  Would your submission get the same treatment \nas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;anybody&#39;s?  Or would they throw it on a &quot;possible loonies&quot; pile \nand\n&gt; &gt;f=\r\norget about it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Would I need somebody in a university to &quot;f=\r\nront&quot; it for \nme --\n&gt; &gt;e.g.\n&gt; &gt;list themselves as the corresponding author =\r\nand me as the co-\nauthor\n&gt; &gt;of the work?  If that&#39;s the case, I would be qu=\r\nite open to the \nidea,\n&gt; &gt;I mean it even seems reasonably honest, not reall=\r\ny different from\n&gt; &gt;putting your laboratory head on your papers because he =\r\nprovided \nthe\n&gt; &gt;environment in which the work happened (even if he actuall=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt;understand nothing of your work -- this used to happen in\n&gt; &gt;biochemis=\r\ntry, mentioning no names...).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Opinions?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;         Ian=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;___________________________________________________________\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;How much free photo storage do you get?
