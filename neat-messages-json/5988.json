Maybe, =\r\nthis ratio could help to provide an analytical solution for the question ho=\r\nw likely it is that modularity emerges in larger networks. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Wha=\r\nt would that number tell you? How close you are to mutating to a modular ne=\r\ntwork at any given generation?\n\nMay first thought was, that in bigger netwo=\r\nrks it becames unprobable that connection costs leads to modularity. Howeve=\r\nr, I could imagine that in large networks connection costs leads to a hiera=\r\nrchical structure with massive parallelism at the beginning of the processi=\r\nng stream and more abstract operations at its end (in a some kind of feed-f=\r\norward network). Would be interesting to observe that in a simulation :)\n\nT=\r\nhanks for your time and your comments,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
