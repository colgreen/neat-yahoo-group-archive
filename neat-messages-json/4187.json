Maybe the mutation rate could just be\nlowered.  However, if i=\r\nt&#39;s the champion itself that&#39;s bloating, you\nneed to be careful because the=\r\nre are two possible cases.  \n\nOne is that adding a node actually made fitne=\r\nss increase.  In that\ncase, it is not &quot;bloat&quot; at all because it actually is=\r\n helping.  Then\nthere is no problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are getting=\r\n neutral additions to structure\nto the champion itself, one question I have=\r\n is what happened to the\nprevious champion who didn&#39;t have the structure?  =\r\nIf you have elitism,\nthere should be a clone of the prior champion in the c=\r\nurrent\ngeneration, and that clone would not have any additional structure.\n=\r\n\nSo the question is how is the champion getting bigger?\n\nIf a champion has =\r\nan offspring that has the same fitness as the\nchampion but also a new node,=\r\n then you do have bloat.  And if this\nhappens every 2.5 generations, I&#39;d te=\r\nnd to suggest lowering the node\naddition rate.\n\n&gt; &gt; In general, there is go=\r\nod reason to grow networks if fitness is not\n&gt; &gt; going up because the algor=\r\nithm has no way of knowing what is necessary\n&gt; &gt; to improve.  It might need=\r\n more structure, or it might simply need to\n&gt; &gt; find a better set of weight=\r\ns.  Therefore, it is sensible for it to try\n&gt; &gt; both: If you are stagnating=\r\n, keep growing at one end of the spectrum,\n&gt; &gt; but also don&#39;t lose your lit=\r\ntle guys in case they turn out sufficient.\n&gt; &gt;  In other words, a stagnant =\r\npopulation should gradually grow in its\n&gt; &gt; range of sizes, not putting all=\r\n its eggs in one basket.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting point. I guess I should be lookin=\r\ng at min number of\nnodes in the\n&gt; population, and see if that is growing fa=\r\nst as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For populations that are not stagnant, it makes sense fo=\r\nr them to\n&gt; &gt; display less growth in general, because they are succeeding i=\r\nn their\n&gt; &gt; current weight space.  I&#39;d guess your more recent experiment is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; undergoing periods of stagnation, which would explain why you see more=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you saying that NEAT has a built-in mechanism such th=\r\nat the node\nnumber\n&gt; will increase during times of fitness stagnation, and =\r\nthat the rate of\n&gt; hidden node growth is less when fitness is improving? Wh=\r\nat\nmechanisms bring\n&gt; this about?\n&gt;  \n\nI don&#39;t mean to suggest that it has =\r\na special built-in mechanism to\nknow if it is stagnating or not.  But I am =\r\nclaiming that it is a kind\nof emergent phenomenon that happens because of s=\r\ntagnation.  If you are\nstagnating, then adding structure tends to produce i=\r\nndividuals that\nare as fit (before fitness sharing) as any other (because n=\r\nothing is\nimproving).  Therefore, there is a more condusive environment to =\r\nmany\ndifferent structures surviving (since the fitness competition is less\n=\r\nfierce).  On the other hand, if a particular species is charging ahead\nsimp=\r\nly by optimizing weights, then new species that add new structure\nwill not =\r\ntake up as much of the population because they won&#39;t be\noptimizing as fast.=\r\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
