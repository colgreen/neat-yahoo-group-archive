There was some work to\n&gt;&gt;break the experiment code into seperate binaries and to attach them at\n&gt;&gt;run time with a config file - which in itself may not be that\n&gt;&gt;interesting to you, but there is also a mechanism for specifying\n&gt;&gt;experimnent prameters such as data file paths within teh config file.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ve uploaded that one to SourceForge (or made it\n&gt;available or whatever the process is). It&#39;s a logical next step, though,\n&gt;and I&#39;d definitely find it useful, but don&#39;t bust a gut - I&#39;ve already\n&gt;hacked my experiment to take some degree of external configuration, it\n&gt;was a logical refactoring.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThere&#39;s a new release (two actually) on sourceforge containing the \nchanges. Like you say you probably don&#39;t need this now, but it might be \nan idea to cast an eye over the release logs as there are some \nchanges/fixes you might be interested in. I&#39;ve also migrated the project \nfiles over to .Net 2.0.\n\nI haven&#39; included the zedgraph stuff yet, I&#39;m still not sure about the \nperformance and memory footprint. BTW do you know if you can set the \ngraphs to roll when the number of data points hits a certain number? \nThis was one of the things I managed to do in RudyGraph by using a \ncircular buffer based plot set.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On a more forward looking note, I also started completely revising the\n&gt;&gt;whole code base and re-writing it to make it far more flexible to code\n&gt;&gt;against \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Oooh. I am slightly less terrified by templates/generics than I was,\n&gt;having made my first Dictionary, but only slightly. I had to look at\n&gt;some template-heavy C++ earlier this week and I&#39;m still feeling the\n&gt;effects. I&#39;d be interested in having a look when you&#39;ve got something\n&gt;you&#39;re happy with.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nIt&#39;s nothing to be scared of. I get the impression that C++ template \nsyntax could get a bit cryptic at times, the work I&#39;ve done so far seems \npretty straightforward. Anyway more on all that soon I hope.\n\n\n&gt;[snipped stock model intro]\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;My initial plan is to use both price and trade volume data.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;re almost certainly going to need to use derived data rather than\n&gt;raw prices: percentage change from day to day is a good start. z-scores\n&gt;are good but I&#39;m always slightly concerned that they assume that the\n&gt;bounds of the range of source values is known. There are a number of\n&gt;other derived values that can be calculated from the technical analysis\n&gt;(TA) domain, from the simple (moving averages, relative strength,\n&gt;momentum) though trickier (volatility) to the downright exotic\n&gt;(Bollinger bands, oscillators, fratal coefficients).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI&#39;ll probably use percentage change pushed through a sigmoid curve - \nthis means I can avoid normalising the range which will of course \ncontain some extreme spikes which would cause a problem for a linear \nmapping (normalisation) to the neuron input signal range. I&#39;m going to \navoid anything too clever and let the network&#39;s calculate averages and \nthe like for themselves, at least at first.\n\n\n\n&gt;In (efficient market) theory, everything that is known about the company\n&gt;is encapsulated in the current price. In practice, that turns out not to\n&gt;be the case, even if it&#39;s just a latency effect. I would think that by\n&gt;submitting several days&#39; (months?) worth of basic data you could get a\n&gt;model to effectively do its own TA, at the expense of longer compute\n&gt;time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nLatency is definitely noticeable sometimes, also I&#39;ve noticed that when \na price changes very quickly on some piece of news, that the price will \novershoot the new &#39;fair&#39; value and bounce around a bit. If you can \nquickly determine (or make an educated guess) what that fair value is \nthen you can make money. Drifting off topic here...\n\n\n&gt;I think that a Neat solution might get some mileage out of the &quot;memory&quot;\n&gt;idea I&#39;ve been playing with: each stock gets a set of values for input\n&gt;to the next evaluation that were captured from the previous one.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nNot sure about this. e.g. it&#39;s not like football where your network&#39;s \ncompete against each other and use memory (potentially) as a sort of \ninitial relative rating of two teams. Actually I was wondering if your \npre-processing is actually providing your networks with information \nabout the future, e.g. relative strength of a team determined from \nfuture results. Or have I misunderstood?\n\nCheers,\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
