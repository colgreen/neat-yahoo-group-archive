But for larger mazes (and mazes with more\ndimensions), you&#39;ll eventually wind up with a lot of novelty memory. The\nmain problem with this is that each solution is tested against the entire\nnovelty memory and the population, which brings you towards O(n^2) which\nisn&#39;t good, unless you use some kind of spacial partitioning (which\nrequires domain knowledge)/hashing method (which doesn&#39;t require domain\nknowledge, but is potentially less efficient), that could bring you down\nto O(n*ln(n)). A vast improvement, but slow compared to what we&#39;re used to\nin GA which typically is O(N). \n\nYour solution to problem 2 is indeed elegant, I hadn&#39;t thought of that. \n\nLastly, I&#39;m indeed looking forward to be proved wrong, it would be very\ninteresting to see the novelty method used on another problem domain. I\nrealize the maze problem is very graphic, understandable and easy to\nimplement, but the novelty method has a strength that the fitness method\ncannot compete with at all; problems that have no fitness function at all\ncan still be solved. That&#39;s interesting to me. Problems that are either\nsolved or not solved but have no gradient between solved and not solved\ncan&#39;t be sovled with regular GA, but they can with the novelty search\nmethod. If such a problem could be found, then that would be very\ninteresting indeed. \n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
