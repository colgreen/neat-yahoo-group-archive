So I have uploaded the \nwork-in-progress version of it to the group&#39;s file area.\n\n\tAll you do is, you unzip it into some folder and then you open \nframe.htm in your favourite browser (actually I only tested it in IE, \nthere&#39;s some simple javascipt for navigation so it might not work so \nwell in other ones but I think it should be OK).  Chapters are \nselected along the top, sections within chapters down the side.\n\n\tNote that this is far from finished.  In particular &quot;@@&quot; is my code \nfor places where I was going to add more, often only glossary entries \nbut sometimes whole paragraphs.  Some sections are completely \nmissing.  These are left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n\tThe references to a MEA discussion group do point to a real mailing \nlist, but it has no members because I didn&#39;t tell anyone about \nit.  It is more appropriate to have any discussions here.\n\n\tWhat you have in this document, is a detailed analysis of several of \nthe mechanisms that make organisms evolvable, along with ideas on how \nto do similar things in software.\n\n\tI thought I&#39;d dig this up now, because Ken&#39;s recent mails have been \nstraying quite strongly into these sorts of areas, and I am hoping \nthis is an part of an idea whose time has come.\n\n\tPlease have a look and post your reactions.\n\n\tIan\t\n\n\n"}}
