I am currently using kmedoid clustering for some work I am doing, and\n&gt; your writeup of your approach so far was very informative.\n\n\nNo problem. Like I say in the writeup I think there&#39;s probably not\nmuch of a distinction between k-means and k-medoids for this problem.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; My similarity is based on behaviour, not on\n&gt; chromosome similarity, so I can&#39;t have an artifiical centroid - there is no way for me to measure it&#39;s\n&gt; behaviour.\n\n\nIt really depends on how you calculate behavioural similarity. In some\ncases we know we have a very simple proxy for overall behaviour such\nas the single end coordinate in a maze used in the novelty search\npapers. In the more general case we know we can record the output\nneuron signals at each timestep and that can potentially be used to\ncompare behavioural similarity, although quite how you compare the\noutput perhaps isn&#39;t always obvious. And as you say you could first\ntry to reduce dimensionality of the problem and then cluster based on\nthe location in the reduced space, this would be necessary where the\nrecorded output data is very large in size - but how you go about\nreducing it&#39;s dimensionaility is unclear to me at this time.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
