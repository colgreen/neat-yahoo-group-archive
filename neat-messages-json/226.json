We generate a random bit string of length N\n2. We feed it to the ANN one bit at a time, so there\nare N steps here.\n3. The ANN now repeats the sequence back to you.\n4. The fitness function is the fraction of correct\nbits.\n\nHow about someone using NEAT for this?  We would like\nto see how the resulting topology varies with N, and\nalso how large a value of N can be comfortably handled.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
