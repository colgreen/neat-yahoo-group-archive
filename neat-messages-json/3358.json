The second multiplier rewards individuals \nthat=\r\n tend to walk around instead of staying still. I know it is maybe \nwrong to=\r\n assign 0.000 fitness, but I usually hope that in early \ngenerations at lea=\r\nst some individuals will get a score above zero, \nand therefore survive. Is=\r\n this a right thing to do or I should \ntranslate all fitnesses above 0.000 =\r\n? Like Total_Fitness +=3D 1.0; ? \nThe Number_of_FootSteps_Taken is actually=\r\n an integer and it makes the \nfitness landscape look like stairs... This is=\r\n not good, but I can&#39;t \nthink of another way to encourage walking around.. =\r\nRewarding cyclic \nactivity in the output neurons didn&#39;t help me much.. It i=\r\ns the same \nthing. \n\nI am experimenting with a lot of fitness functions eve=\r\nry day. The \nbest individual I got for the balancing task was actually the =\r\nsame as \nthe one found using regular NEAT - just standing. A way to prevent=\r\n \nthis is may be to choose random initial positions for the model.. Or \nthe=\r\n ground plane can be made moving randomly.. \nAnyway, it seems that the fitn=\r\ness function is wrong, since this way \nof achieving the goal is too easy fo=\r\nr the evolution to find.\n\nI am currently trying out how good are they to wa=\r\nlk. I replaced the \nAverage_Head_Height with Total_Distance_Travelled in th=\r\ne fitness \nfunction. \n\nI believe that HyperNEAT is able to handle such comp=\r\nlex dynamic \ncontrol tasks, given the right substrate geometry. Results so =\r\nfar do \nnot show a big progress. But there are a lot of parameters to tweak=\r\n \nand play with. Substrate configurations also. \n\nKen, what about the sourc=\r\ne code, can you compile it?  \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth=\r\n Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; What is your fitness functi=\r\non in this domain?  Sometimes it looks \n&gt; like individuals are assigned a f=\r\nitness of 0.00000 yet when I look \nat \n&gt; them it looked like they were bala=\r\nnced for a while.  What is \ncausing \n&gt; them to get zero fitness?\n&gt; \n&gt; Of co=\r\nurse the fitness function in this domain can be tricky since \n&gt; what you wa=\r\nnt to encourage is balance, which is not necesarily \nalways \n&gt; correlated t=\r\no duration standing (e.g. when someone is flailing \n&gt; around).\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Attachment(not stored)&quot; :(\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is beginning to piss=\r\n me off.
