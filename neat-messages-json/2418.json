Mutation rates are set\n&gt; such that I get neural netw=\r\norks with a complexity of 100 to 200 after\n&gt; 500 generations (starting with=\r\n 22 inputs, 3 outputs and one connection).\n\nI just wanted to point out, sin=\r\nce Bas is using ANJI, that the mutation\nrates in ANJI work quite differentl=\r\ny than they do in the original NEAT\nimplementation.  There&#39;s a previous dis=\r\ncussion of this in the archives\nI believe, so I won&#39;t go into it, but the b=\r\nasic result is that ANJI&#39;s\nmutation rates add a lot more topology per gener=\r\nation than Ken&#39;s.\n\nIf you want to implement the mutation rates the way Ken =\r\ndid, just set\nthe parameter:\n\ntopology.mutation.classic\n\nto TRUE.  This may=\r\n have been part of the difficulty in tuning\nspeciation as well.  Don&#39;t know=\r\n, but I thought I&#39;d mention\nit...although now it sounds like you&#39;ve got mos=\r\nt of your issues with\nspeciation worked out.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
