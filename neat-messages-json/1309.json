Is there any way you could post a couple of the compressed and\n&gt;target images in the photos section?\n\nDone.  Photo album IEX has two images.  Ignore the thumbnails, look at the \nactual images.  The first image is a 9x9 input image, what is being input \ninto the network.  The other is the target image, what the network wants to \nbe able to reproduce.\n\nEvery activation returns ONE pixel.  Which pixel, and how big that pixel is \nis determined by the top,left,right,bottom inputs.  a top,left of 0,0 and \nbottom,right of 1,1 means return one pixel that corresponds to the average \nintensity of the whole target image.  With a bottom,right of 0.5,0.5 it \nmeans return the average intensity of the region that is the upper left \nquadrant of the target image.  Make sense?\n\n\n\n"}}
