Probably I&#39;ll be working on a few\n&gt;odds and ends for a while like the compat threshold idea, but also just\n&gt;updating the web site and thinking about which direction to go in. E.g.\n&gt;your approach of evaluating all board states got me thinking that NEAT\n&gt;in its current guise is rarely going to be able to do well at problems\n&gt;where we can only evaluate a small sub-set of test cases at each\n&gt;evaluation. The fitness functions cause the population to chase very\n&gt;specific points in the fitness space, like how kids chase a football\n&gt;around a playground, all clumped around the ball.\n\n\nThis is where co-evolution can come in.  When there&#39;s no specific \nfitness function, then the individuals are free to exploit any and \nevery aspect of the problem.  Of course they might still get stuck in \nsome tiny little area of strategy, but in theory the fact that the \nfitness function is implicit means it _can_ cover anything...\n\n\nIan\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
