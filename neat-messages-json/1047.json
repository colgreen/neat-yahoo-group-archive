I really can&#39;t do it in Windows\n&gt; &gt; XP.  It&#39;s no doubt Windows&#39; fault, but still, if I have this\nproblem\n&gt; &gt; others probably will as well.  Who knows why.  But because of\nthis I\n&gt; &gt; would suggest using a different zipper to package it up.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re using Ant, which has a .zip component that&#39;s using the\n&gt; &quot;Info-zip&quot; implementation.  Not really sure why it&#39;s not working in\n&gt; your Windows environment.  We&#39;re both using WinXP&#39;s built-in\nzip/unzip\n&gt; utility and aren&#39;t having that problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nice job!  I&#39;ll add the links.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
