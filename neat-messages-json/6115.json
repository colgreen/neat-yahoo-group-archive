But (as we mention in the\npap=\r\ner) the error in our method can be tuned toward zero by increasing\nthe reso=\r\nlution of the workspace, so the error for the Seeded-CPPN\ntechnique effecti=\r\nvely is zero. Thus, we know ahead of time that our\nmethod won&#39;t produce err=\r\nor. The only uncertainty is how bad target based\nevolution would be, but th=\r\nat is not the focus of this paper, so the\nexperiment would be off-topic. In=\r\n other words, we introduce a technique\nthat eliminates the issue of error, =\r\nsince it skips right to the correct\nshape=85to compare it against an obviou=\r\nsly bad technique that we know\nproduces error would only be to satisfy revi=\r\newers that insist on\nquantification; it does not address a broader hypothes=\r\nis, no?\n\nSure, but those statements are a bit &quot;cowboy science-y.&quot; Let me sh=\r\now you\nhow those statements can (and likely will) be translated:\n&quot;A single =\r\n(non-reproduced?) study has suggested that targeted evolution\ndoes not work=\r\n very well (with Picbreeder?).

There is always a tension bet=\r\nween doing\nthe future work, or just mentioning that it can be done.
