Annie Wu, a former student of John Holland, \nis also a prof there, so there will be two people there now in \nevolutionary computation.  There is also one of the biggest\nsimulation and training labs in the country (meaning opportunities \nfor applications).  \n\nObviously I only just accepted this job so I can&#39;t tell people a lot \nof details about getting into the program, etc., but a lot of people \nhave noted that in America there are almost no places to go to study \nneuroevolution aside from UT Austin.  Therefore, I am hoping this \nwill be a good development for the future of our field and give \npeople another choice for studying and pursuing funded research in \nneuroevolution and artificial embryogeny.  \n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
