For examples pinwheels in the visua=\r\nl cortex seem to emerge even without environmental input but represent a co=\r\nmplex structure which is probably hard to model with CPPNs. But should it b=\r\ne modeled at all? Maybe an adequate solution can be found in another way.\n\n=\r\nWith regard to environment-dependent self-organization: I think the hippoca=\r\nmpus is one of those regions that has a similar architecture across species=\r\n but shows differing properties (e.g. place cells, mechanisms for orientati=\r\non/navigation, episodic memory) depending on the type of information this s=\r\ntructure has to process. Maybe this is an interesting structure to delineat=\r\ne the phenotypic function of a network (formed by environment-dependent sel=\r\nf-organization) from its general function determined by its genes. \n\nBest,\n=\r\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Martin,\n&gt; \n&gt; Apologies for not including references to the r=\r\nelevant papers in the first\n&gt; place. :) The two most relevant journal artic=\r\nles (which describe the same\n&gt; EA and NN model but include some different t=\r\nasks) are:\n&gt; \n&gt;    - Evolution of Cartesian Genetic Programs for Developmen=\r\nt of Learning\n&gt;    Neural Architecture (\n&gt;    http://www.mitpressjournals.o=\r\nrg/doi/abs/10.1162/EVCO_a_00043 )\n&gt;    - Where is the brain inside the brai=\r\nn? (\n&gt;    http://www.springerlink.com/content/v0925407k57v4115/abstract/ )\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Through communication with Khan I learnt that the initial network stru=\r\ncture\n&gt; (placement of neurons in geometric space, etc) is the same througho=\r\nut an\n&gt; evolutionary run (but I think differs between runs), so the evolved=\r\n genetic\n&gt; programs that control the development of the network probably re=\r\nly on this\n&gt; specific initial structure. However the development of the net=\r\nwork\n&gt; throughout its operational life is also influenced by environmental =\r\ninput,\n&gt; so it could be said to self-organise with respect to this. As disc=\r\nussed\n&gt; previously on this list it&#39;s hard to draw many strong conclusions f=\r\nrom this\n&gt; work as it represents a radical departure from anything that has=\r\n gone\n&gt; before and very little analysis was performed of the networks that =\r\nwere\n&gt; evolved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the links to the various papers on self-org=\r\nanisation in natural\n&gt; neural networks. This is probably nothing new, but i=\r\nt seems that\n&gt; self-organisation is used in two ways (which I guess represe=\r\nnt extremes of\n&gt; a continuum):\n&gt; \n&gt;    - environment-independent, where a s=\r\ntructure (or the overall structure)\n&gt;    forms largely due to interactions =\r\nbetween the neural components alone, and\n&gt;    is thus effectively specified=\r\n by the genome, albeit very indirectly; and\n&gt;    - environment-dependent, w=\r\nhere the structures that form are heavily\n&gt;    influenced by environmental =\r\nsignals as well as the interactions between\n&gt;    neural components (ie self=\r\n-organising around the input).\n&gt; \n&gt; So to answer the question &quot;is there is =\r\nan interpretation of CPPNs in\n&gt; HyperNEAT that allows to conclude that self=\r\n-organization must not be\n&gt; explicitly modeled in these kinds of networks&quot; =\r\n(in your post that you\n&gt; linked to), my guess is that indirect encodings li=\r\nke HyperNEAT can replace\n&gt; the environment-independent type of self-organis=\r\nation, but that as you move\n&gt; towards environment-dependent self-organisati=\r\non then abstractions of\n&gt; development like HyperNEAT can&#39;t play as much of =\r\na role (but perhaps could\n&gt; still boost the process by providing some initi=\r\nal structure that is\n&gt; fine-tuned by life-time self-organisation). So, my g=\r\nuess is that\n&gt; abstractions of development like HyperNEAT are useful, but c=\r\nan only take us\n&gt; so far, and that we will need to allow for life-time self=\r\n-organisation\n&gt; processes, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; On 17 September 201=\r\n2 18:58, martin_pyka &lt;martin.pyka@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perha=\r\nps we could benefit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from explicitly studying it more in the context o=\r\nf neuroevolution (eg how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can we evolve neural networks that (must) us=\r\ne self-organisation\n&gt; &gt; mechanisms\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to form the required network struc=\r\nture or weight pattern; perhaps it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; represents a deceptive fitness lan=\r\ndscape like (online) learning).

I also think that self-organizing\n&gt; &gt; mec=\r\nhanisms that are influenced by input from the environment are an\n&gt; &gt; import=\r\nant ingredient for the emergence of functions.

So the behavioral function of\n&gt; &gt; a ma=\r\ntured neural network should be distinguished from the properties of the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n network independent from its environment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; Martin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
