A recent science program on TV showed \nthis same approach being used with face recognition in Vegas casinos, in \norder to identify known card counters - a manual operator guides the \nwhole process, measuring relative distance between the eyes, etc. So \nyeh, I guess automatic categorisation is still a problem that is out \nthere - which is interesting in itself.\n\n&gt;We&#39;re in the early stages of experimenting in this domain, but we&#39;ve\n&gt;already evolved a network that can distinguish two distinct left loop\n&gt;prints from two of each of the other classes, so we&#39;re pretty\n&gt;optimistic.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWatching the animation you posted I found it surprising how successful \nthe networks are at zooming in on the critical area of the images - \nwhere the most distinct identifying features are. Very promising indeed. \nI presume this is using almost the same setup as the shape recognition, \nbut with a different set of images? Are you using the same resolution \nfor the eye?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
