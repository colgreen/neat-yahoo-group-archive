I will keep it in mind.  You know, \n&gt;ultimately what we are up against is just the fact that no sample \n&gt;can be guaranteed to perfectly represent its generating distribution.\n&gt;It&#39;s likely there will always be extraordinary situations that were \n&gt;not encountered in whatever training set was experienced during \n&gt;evolution.  At the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t do better, \n&gt;it just means reaching exactly 100% of all possible test cases is \n&gt;unlikely for complicated problems or domains.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhat has been surprising to me is how this problem has come up while \nevolving for relatively simple problems, e.g. with prey capture the \ndifficulty level is increased by allowing the prey more &#39;head start&#39; \nmoves before the agent can move. At below 4 moves the prey should always \nremain within the agent&#39;s sensor range, thus a very simple solution is \npossible whereby sensors are directly connected to motor outputs. And \nyet the pass rate is still not 100% in all but the easiest problem, take \na look at these success rates for champs at each difficultly level:\n\nInitial moves   100 tests   1000 tests\n-------------------------------------\n0                     100%         100%\n1                     96.48%      99.9%\n2                     94.56%      99.9%\n3                     95.10%      99.9%\n\n\nHopefully that table didn&#39;t get too mangled in transmission.\n\nSo there is a balance between the sample size (and therefore search \nspeed) and solution quality, and for all but the most trivial problems \nthis balance seems to follow the law of dimishing returns. Hopefuly by \nusing a buffer of failed tests I can tip the balance more in our favour \n- better solutions without all of the cost of performing 1000 tests.\n\nBut yes I&#39;m beginning to see that obtaining 100% perfect solutions for \nmost problems is perhaps unrealistic, but a 99.9% sucess is a lot more \nuseful that 95% - that could be the difference between a commercially \nviable technique (say fingerprint ID&#39;ing) and one that isn&#39;t.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
