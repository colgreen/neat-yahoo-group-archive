The =\r\nleaky integrators are better for precise timing.\n However, they may not be =\r\nnecessary if joint angles are being provided\nas input.  But when joint angl=\r\nes are not provided, I do not think I\nhave ever seen a regular recurrent AN=\r\nN (i.e. non-leaky or not some\nother special type of neuron) be able to make=\r\n something walk.  In\nfact, the &quot;flailing&quot; motions are often reduced signifi=\r\ncantly by leaky\nintegrator neurons.  Tyler Streeter saw this when he worked=\r\n on his\nbiped with NEAT, which actually stopped flailing after switching to=\r\n\nleaky integrators.  However, in his project the network had no inputs\nand =\r\nworked entirely through internal pattern generation.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot add more to what Ken said, this is an entirely new field and=\r\n \n&gt; a cutting edge of research but I suggest you take a look at my NEVH \n&gt; =\r\nproject as well (it is located in the files section in this group). \n&gt; It i=\r\ns written in C++ and utilizes HyperNEAT for constructing the \n&gt; phenotypes.=\r\n It also uses leaky integrators for the phenotype neuron \n&gt; model.

I only wrote the =\r\ntoribash-esque \n&gt; experiment\n&gt; &gt; and a few changes and features added to py=\r\nthon-neat. The actual\n&gt; &gt; python-neat backend is written by Cesar Gomez and=\r\n is really \n&gt; terrific,\n&gt; &gt; as python has a certain elegance about it that =\r\nmakes it seem easier \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; grasp. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In order to get it to work =\r\nyou need to download the linux version of\n&gt; &gt; Command Line Breve:\n&gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//www.spiderland.org/download.php\n&gt; &gt; Then unzip this in the breve_2.7.2/ d=\r\nirectory:\n&gt; &gt; http://peter.berrington.googlepages.com/tori.7z\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To e=\r\nvolve, open a shell and navigate to the breve directory, then \n&gt; call\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe ToriExp with python, like this:\n&gt; &gt; python tori/toriExp.py\n&gt; &gt; To view t=\r\nhe last best individual, instead type this:\n&gt; &gt; ./bin/breve tori/viewlastbe=\r\nst.py\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Theres a HUGE amount of parameters for which I have no idea =\r\nwhat the\n&gt; &gt; good values are. The creator of Toribash is giving me a descri=\r\nption \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; how his game works but is not at all forthcoming with the s=\r\npecific\n&gt; &gt; implementation details; I suppose he is reluctant to give away =\r\ncode\n&gt; &gt; for something he makes money on, but it&#39;s frustrating as his game =\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; actually very well balanced, allowing some very nimble and natural\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; looking acrobatics. Trial and error is probably the only solution at\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n this stage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I encourage people to fool around with this; I&#39;m a co=\r\nmplete beginner\n&gt; &gt; to programming this kind of stuff and I&#39;ve got a lot of=\r\n really\n&gt; &gt; terrible code I&#39;m sure, so please submit any changes that you t=\r\nhink\n&gt; &gt; would make sense.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Peter, that&#39;s a good questio=\r\nn and of course learning to \n&gt; control a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; virtual creature with novel=\r\nty search is a complicated issue (and \n&gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; appealing idea as well).=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, you have to deal with all the representational and \n&gt;=\r\n physical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; issues outside of novelty search, like how many inputs, ho=\r\nw many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outputs, and whether the body itself is not physically flawed=\r\n in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some way (which is possible).  As you are experiencing, the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; inputs/outputs issue can be prohibitive even with feature \n&gt; &gt; &gt; selecti=\r\non.  It is also possible that HyperNEAT could be useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it d=\r\noes not care about the # inputs or outputs (and can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; potentially expl=\r\noit geometric regularities), but configuring the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate then beco=\r\nmes the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming all of that stuff is set up well w=\r\nith whatever system, \n&gt; then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty search is a potentially winning=\r\n approach.  Yet as you \n&gt; point \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out there are some big questions the=\r\nre as well.  In fact, we are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best an=\r\nswers to these questions \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but some general pr=\r\ninciples might help for now: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty se=\r\narch does not not need to contain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; every point ever visited.  Therefo=\r\nre, it tends to grow much \n&gt; slower \n&gt; &gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations.  Howev=\r\ner, if it is indeed getting too \n&gt; big  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreasonable =\r\nto collapse some of the archive \n&gt; points, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; although there is no stan=\r\ndard method yet for how that should be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; done.  But we have reason to =\r\nbelieve there will be effective and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; simple ways to do that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Second, the issue of one individual looking different just \n&gt; because =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same behavior is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; com=\r\nplicated.  For certain phase disaparities, the two individuals \n&gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t=\r\n look all that different, but it is true that at some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; disparity, the=\r\ny may look very different.  Yet it is not clear \n&gt; &gt; &gt; whether that fact is=\r\n actually problematic to the novelty search \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it wo=\r\nuld simply reward both types of behavior.  It \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible that th=\r\ne phase difference is a result of some useful \n&gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, whic=\r\nh could make it a stepping stone to \n&gt; something \n&gt; &gt; &gt; better.  Or, it is =\r\npossible that it is superfluous information \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; simply takes some=\r\n extra time exploring the area around the phase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shifted individual. =\r\n So it is hard to say a priori whether it is \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; major concern.  We=\r\n will have better answers to such questions as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; technique is f=\r\nurther explored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I agree that it would be nice to be =\r\nable to say the two \n&gt; &gt; &gt; phase-shifted individuals are largely the same i=\r\nf that is indeed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; what you want to say.  And for that, you would need=\r\n a pattern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; matching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e. some=\r\nthing \n&gt; more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance.  There =\r\nare \n&gt; certainly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available.  However, it&#39;s important to=\r\n recognize \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident at this point that ignoring the=\r\n phase shift is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than taking it into consideration, b=\r\necause taking \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means adding more inform=\r\nation to the \n&gt; novelty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So overall I think n=\r\novelty search is a very promising direction \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; go for such proble=\r\nms, but it is still in the realm of research \n&gt; (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no ex=\r\nisting precedent), so it will involve considerable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error t=\r\no get it right until all these issues are \n&gt; fleshed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out more clearl=\r\ny.  Ultimately, though, if our hypothesis about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; novelty vs. fitness =\r\nis correct, novelty search may turn out to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way to get =\r\ncertain highly complex types of behavior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in some domains, =\r\nwhich is a sobering thought.  But if it \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; true, then there is no=\r\nt much to do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fas=\r\ncinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new approach.

As there is 20 \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; joints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this rig, I am providing joint position and velocit=\r\ny \n&gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for each joint, as well as a bias, a sine-wave, th=\r\ne x, y, and z\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; components linear velocity in the reference frame of =\r\nthe Tori&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; head,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and finally 3 variables which correspond to=\r\n the vertical, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; horizontal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and forward orientation of the tor=\r\ni&#39;s head with respect to world\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current e=\r\nxperimental configuration I am started out as \n&gt; a &quot;pure&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll c=\r\nontrol where neural net outputs correspond directly \n&gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; veloci=\r\nty; a tanh activation function is used to allow positive \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neg=\r\native joint movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I then remodeled the experiment to perform as=\r\n in the Toribash \n&gt; game;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the net will receive inputs (and effect j=\r\noint movements) only \n&gt; &gt; &gt; every 10\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time steps. More importantly, =\r\nI increased the amount of outputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20 (1 per joint) to 4=\r\n0, in order to accomodate the 4 possible \n&gt; joint\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions which can=\r\n occur on a turn: holding, relaxing, \n&gt; extending, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flexi=\r\nng. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Starting with a fully connected net, that gives a sta=\r\nggeringly \n&gt; huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search space with over 1000 connections. Due to t=\r\nhe \n&gt; implementation,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its prohibitively slow to evolve large nets a=\r\ns the starting net \n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take up over 600mb of ram on the heap. Re=\r\nalizing this was a bit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ridiculous, I implemented feature selection =\r\nand phased pruning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, even with this, deception seems to pre=\r\nvent any useful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviour; the Tori will always get stuck in ruts.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am using a python implementation of neat develo=\r\nped by Cesar \n&gt; Gomez\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the GPL, which is available at \n&gt; http:=\r\n//code.google.com/p/neat-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; python/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This implementatio=\r\nn is a WIP and I&#39;ve already done a lot of \n&gt; tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to incorp=\r\norate the linear genome encoding taken from the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; EANT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method.=\r\n I&#39;ve also been trying to incorporate CMA-ES in order to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optimize w=\r\neights but I haven&#39;t had much success meshing this \n&gt; with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; rest of the code yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later today when I am home I will=\r\n post my source files for \n&gt; anyone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishes to experiment=\r\n with virtual creature neuroevolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nINALLY, my question. The behaviour of a Tori is currently \n&gt; &gt; &gt; represente=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the amount of \n&gt; t=\r\nime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated for. The novelty search method \n&gt; p=\r\nroposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2d maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a ne=\r\nw \n&gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of disc=\r\novered behaviours. This \n&gt; works \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I imagine) because a =\r\npoint isn&#39;t a lot of information to hold.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to k=\r\nnow is how I can compare the behaviour of 2 \n&gt; ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers =\r\nfor novelty; is there any compact encoding that \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work? Sinc=\r\ne it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluations to get \n&gt; any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful b=\r\nehaviour out of this right now, theres going to have to \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some =\r\nway to store 20k seperate behaviours in some way that is \n&gt; fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has identical behaviour to \n&gt; anot=\r\nher \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps later instead? Ju=\r\nst \n&gt; comparing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two behaviours it would appear that they=\r\n were 100% unique, yet \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; human\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer would instantly n=\r\notice the similarity in how they act.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
