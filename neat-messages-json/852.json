My \nlogic being\n&gt; &gt; that I thought matching like innovations is beneficial but \ncostly in\n&gt; &gt; terms of CPU time. So I figured this gives a good balance. \nHowever I\n&gt; &gt; just traced a bug whereby evolved networks where seen - by Ken - \nto have\n&gt; &gt; multiple recurrent connections on a single node. I realise now \nthat this\n&gt; &gt; is a result of crossover between two genomes that contained the \nsame\n&gt; &gt; connection, but with a different innovation ID. To fix this I \nshould\n&gt; &gt; check for duplicate connections within genomes created by \ncrossover,\n&gt; &gt; which erodes some of the performance gain obtained from using \ntechnique\n&gt; &gt; (2).\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good point.  How did you handle that case in your\n&gt; implementation, Ken?  If 2 chromosomes crossover where each has a\n&gt; connection between nodes 1 and 2, btu where the connections have\n&gt; different innovation IDs, do you sum the genotype weights to create\n&gt; the phenotype connection weight?  Or average them?  Or discard one?\n\nI discarded one.  Only one gene that connects two nodes was allowed \nto make it into the offspring.\n\nBy the way, performance gains in crossover will have almost no \neffect on performance in general, so it&#39;s not really worth too much \neffort trying to optimize crossover.  In every experiment I&#39;ve seen \nexcept the very simplest, NEAT takes up a tiny fraction of \ncomputation time.  It&#39;s the evaluations that are expensive.  \n\nI&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t optimize your code.  I&#39;m just saying \nmaking design decisions based on code efficiency in NEAT methods may \nnot be the very helpful in the end.  Generally we can afford a \nlittle more expense if it leads to more meaningful operators or \nfewer evaluations in the long run.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
