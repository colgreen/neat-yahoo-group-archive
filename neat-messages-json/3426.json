The networks are flushed at every p=\r\noint, of course, but during \n&gt; the network&#39;s stabilization, what is the dif=\r\nference? Is it possible \nto \n&gt; achieve the mirror effect, you know, when yo=\r\nu look at yourself in the \n&gt; mirror, holding another mirror in your hands..=\r\n It looks like a \ntunnel, \n&gt; you know.. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
