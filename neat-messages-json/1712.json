The only comment I had is the same one I had before,\n&gt; &gt; that you do not define the &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; algorithm used in zooming\n&gt; &gt; the images and the picture you show does not look like what I think of as\n&gt; &gt; nearest neighbour.  But I doubt that many in your audience will pick up on\n&gt; &gt; that and I don&#39;t know whether it matters anyway...\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for the feedback, Ian.\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, we could have spent a bit more space discussing interpolation\n&gt;algorithms, but thought it might be a distraction.  We might possibly\n&gt;be asked to add something in by reviewers, if it makes it that far.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;          In what sense is the image processing the bottleneck?  Is is\n&gt; &gt; because you have to zoom, translate and rotate the viewed portion of the\n&gt; &gt; image in every evaluation frame?\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, basically.  Each individual gets about 100 steps to move across\n&gt;the canvass and view portions of the image.  On a given step, the\n&gt;image can be moved up/down, left/right, zoomed in/out, and rotated, so\n&gt;there&#39;s an affine transform for every step, and this is\n&gt;computationally expensive.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Writing your own (simple) image manipulation in\n&gt; &gt; C will cut the run-time hugely.  If you are already doing that then your\n&gt; &gt; problem is more severe...\n&gt;\n&gt;No, right now we&#39;re using Java&#39;s image processing package.  We&#39;re\n&gt;looking at using a package called ImageMagick, and exploiting native\n&gt;methods to speed up the processing.\n&gt;\n&gt;But we also hope to use Jim&#39;s SEMIANN neural net framework to gain\n&gt;some speed there.\n\nHi,\n         Just one small thought on this.  That since what you want is a \nfairly simple zoom/rotate facility, it may be than these packages are over \nthe top for your needs.  In which case some simple hand coding might out \nperform them...\n\n                 Ian\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
