My original instincts were to go with\na monolithic controller, such as the one Ken suggested, but you may be right\nthat you could get a really cool and scalable solution the way you proposed.\nI look forward to hearing how it turns out!\n\nGood luck with the investigation.\n-Jeff  \n\n&gt; As to developing a controller modularly or monolithically,  I hadn&#39;t\n&gt; considered the monolithic approach yet, and it bears thinking about. My\n&gt; intuition (I have liottle more to go on right now) is that  keeping them\n&gt; separate may promote a CPPN for scaleable morphologies (e.g., spiders with\n&gt; legs of varying length) - that would be very nice to have. Also, a modular\n&gt; approach might adapt controllers more easily when body shapes change. On the\n&gt; other hand, it&#39;s just intuition and the same may be true for the monolithic\n&gt; approach. Hmmm....sounds like a little project right there. See if I can find\n&gt; a Masters student somewhere ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Evert, sounds like a great project.  I think there is enough precedent for\n&gt;&gt; step 1 that it could be realistically achieved.  Of course, step 2 is more\n&gt;&gt; speculative.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; For step 1, my question is whether it is necessary to regard the individual\n&gt;&gt; robots that make up the full organism as being separate for the purposes of\n&gt;&gt; evolving the controller?  That is, would it not work to simply regard it as a\n&gt;&gt; single whole and ignore the individual separations?  That way you could just\n&gt;&gt; evolve one monolithic controller for the assembly.\n&gt; However, I can imagine that it might not be possible to do that depending on\n&gt; your communication constraints.  In any case, HyperNEAT can represent it\n&gt; either way.  If the identity of each robot matters, you can certainly input\n&gt; the location along the organism to the CPPN as additional information, and\n&gt; that could indeed be helpful.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Step 2 (evolving the morphology) sounds very interesting butis a much more\n&gt;&gt; open problem.  I think interleaving might be more effective than simply doing\n&gt;&gt; a meta-search in which every potential morphology is evaluated through an\n&gt;&gt; entire evolution run to find a controller for it.  That sounds very\n&gt;&gt; expensive.  After all, in nature both brain and body evolve together so\n&gt;&gt; presumably it can happen here too.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, the representation of the morphology (i.e. how it is translated from\n&gt;&gt; the CPPN output) will be very critical and deserves careful thought.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;evertwh2004&quot; &lt;evert@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am involved in a modular robotics project (www.symbrion.eu), where we are\n&gt;&gt;&gt; developing robots that can hook onto each other to create &#39;organisms&#39; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; consist of linked robots. The robots can manipulate the link(s), e.g., to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lift each other. Recently, Jeff Clune (hi Jeff) introduced me to hyperNEAT,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and it looks like just the ticket to address two issues that we have to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tackle. So here I am, excited newbie and all.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; First, I want to try and use hyperNEAT to evolve gaits for organisms with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-defined shapes (e.g., spiders, snakes). The idea is to develop a single\n&gt;&gt;&gt; genome that determines the weights for neural nets in each of the individual\n&gt;&gt;&gt; robots that make up the organism, so I would expect to pass the coordinates\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of nodes within the individual NN, but also about the location of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; individual in the organism (possibly related to some central node or\n&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; The next step will be to use hyperNEAT&#39;s CPPNs to evolve morphologies for\n&gt;&gt;&gt; organisms. I&#39;m thinking of a 3D grid where the CPPN assigns some value to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; each cell which defines, according to some threshold, whether a robot goes\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in that spot or not. The fitness of the CPPN would be the level of success\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in evolving a gait for the resulting shape as described above. Another\n&gt;&gt;&gt; method of combining morphology and gait development would be to interleave\n&gt;&gt;&gt; them in some way (waves hands).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So...does that sound like a good plan, are there any pointers to related\n&gt;&gt;&gt; work? Do&#39;s and don&#39;ts?
