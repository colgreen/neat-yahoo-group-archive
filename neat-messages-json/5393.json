For this just regular NEAT is apr=\r\nopriate and in my opinion it should work fine. Another possibility is to us=\r\ne real-time NEAT like in the NERO game. You can still try HyperNEAT, but th=\r\ne CPPN to substrate mapping should be designed such that every individual h=\r\nas his own coordinate frame, and if you want your agents to be learning in =\r\nreal-time, you can also have the CPPN output your learning coefficients jus=\r\nt like the weights.  \n\nPeter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Sina Iravanian =\r\n&lt;sina_iravanian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to use NEAT for learnin=\r\ng coordination in a multi-agent system.\n&gt; But the agents in the system must=\r\n be learning independently, i.e., they cannot communicate and a centralized=\r\n controller cannot be used. \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be grateful if anyone could intro=\r\nduce some previous work, or publications which use NEAT (or any of its vari=\r\nants) in the same settings. \n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks in advance,\n&gt; Sina\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
