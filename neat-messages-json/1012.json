If your add connection\nmutation rate is 0.02 and you&#39;ve got 100 individuals, and there are\n100,000 possible places for a new connection to be added, there should\nbe a total of 2,000 new connections added.  Are you saying that only\n100 should be added, one for each individual?  And that if an\nindividual has already had a connection added, then no add node\nmutations are allowed to act upon it (or vice versa if your add node\nmutation operators are carried out first)?\n\nThis is not my understanding of how NEAT works.  Ken?\n\n&gt; As Ken already pointed out, in the gene&#39;s new context it may as well be\n&gt; a &#39;glob&#39; of junk. \n\nWell, okay.  Then I&#39;m still trying to figure out how it&#39;s logically\ndifferent from a mutation, or series of mutations, at that point.\n\n&gt; Now I realise that some may think that I&#39;ve argued myself into a corner\n&gt; here, since this could be interpreted to be the opposite of my above\n&gt; argument about multiple mutations being very unlikely to be good. \n\nWell, yes.  I don&#39;t see how you can argue that inserting a gene into\nan entirely new context is really any different than a large-scale\nmutation.  They essentially have the same chance of adding to fitness,\nright?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
