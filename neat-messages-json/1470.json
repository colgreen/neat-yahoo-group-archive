That in turn lead me to \nthink that it depended what other connections had been made to the node in \nquestion (this does only apply to node-introducing mutations?  e.g. we&#39;re \nnot (yet) talking about inserting the same connection twice, are we?).\n\nAll of that lead me full circle to the idea that the equivalence of \ninnovation number &quot;defines&quot; the equivalence of genes across individuals, \nrather than &quot;measuring&quot; it.  Once the genes are defined as equivalent then \nthe process of crossover and selection will force them into playing the \nsame role in the phenotype.\n\nIndividuals where two genes have the same innovation number but are not \ntruly &quot;equivalent&quot; will be infertile with each other -- in biology, this is \nwhat defines a new species -- it cannot breed with the old species -- and \nthe reverse also applies, once it no longer breeds with the old species, \nthen its genes are free to drift away from the roles they played in the old \nspecies...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n"}}
