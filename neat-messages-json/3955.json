I=\r\nn this way, \nHyperNEAT can learn an expression that encodes how policies va=\r\nry \nover the team geometry.  For example, in a soccer team agents vary \nfro=\r\nm defensive to offensive as you move away from the goal.  Part of \nthe powe=\r\nr of this approach is that it means basic skills can be \nlearned and shared=\r\n among the whole team, since the CPPN encodes how \nthose skills vary across=\r\n the field.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
