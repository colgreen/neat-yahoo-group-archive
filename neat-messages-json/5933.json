I want to find out why.\nHere are=\r\n some possilbility I am thinking of. Can anyone give me any hints and comme=\r\nnts.\nThe first possibility I thought is the weak ability of the initial pop=\r\nulation, since there are no hidden nodes, the neural network can not approx=\r\nimate the value function well. In my experiment, it can not achieve the top=\r\n after 10000 steps. \nAnother reason I considered is the initial weights of =\r\nthe neural network, learning rate and so on, these parameters should be set=\r\n carefully, but it takes me a long time, and I haven&#39;t found a better setti=\r\nng.\nI also think the mutation rate is an important factor.If I set a small =\r\nmutation rate, it may take a longer time to envolve. If I set a bigger valu=\r\ne, does this lead to divergence?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.\n\n\n"}}
