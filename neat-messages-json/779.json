In fact, I really think it needs more. My understanding of\nthe word &#39;inteligence&#39; is tied to an ability to make decisions. A lemur\nthat selects a series of pictures in historical order is interesting in\nmore ways than a display of memory. It was intelligent enough to decide\nto select the pictures in some particular order, which it happened to be\nable to remember. I&#39;m more interested in why the lemur decided to select\nthe pictures in order. Can we evolve an ANN that could make that\ndecision? Normally a programmer assumes &#39;of course we can&#39; and we code\nit to make sure that happens. If we do that, are we developing something\nintelligent, or putting our intelligence into a program, like a\nconventional decision making method? \n\n\nYes, that&#39;s exaclty my line of thought. I have been \npushing this notion for about six months now. You \nmight like to look at my 4Play project, on my website. \nIt uses neuroevolution (but not NEAT) to evolve an \nANN that makes active use of short term memory. Also, \nif you look in the archive at yahoo groups for this \ngroup you can find several posts by me about the \ngeneral subject of short term memory. \n\nI hope you make a NEAT ANN that can remember stuff and \nrepeat it back. \n\n===== \nMitchell Timin \nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net \n\n\n\n\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
