So \nfo=\r\nr me an obvious question now would be - are there any well defined \nand wel=\r\nl known problem domains in the realm of machine learning that \nare currentl=\r\ny unsolved (or not satisfactorily solved) that CPPN would \nbe ideally suite=\r\nd to? Sort of low hanging fruit type problems if you \nlike that would furth=\r\ner demonstrate the effectiveness of CPPN&#39;s.\n\nI&#39;ll be scanning the internet =\r\nfor ideas on this but no doubt some of \nyou have already discussed this and=\r\n/or have some ideas on the matter. \nHaving just read Jason Gauci&#39;s + Ken&#39;s =\r\npaper regarding the \ndistinguishing of large and small objects in a visual =\r\nfield it seems \nto me that CPPNs are ideally suited to such visual tasks an=\r\nd that \nmaybe there are some visual problem domains that would be \nappropri=\r\nate. E.g. There&#39;s that old chestnut of detecting cancer cells \nin slide cro=\r\nss sections - so improving accuracy on a well known \nproblem domain.\n\nColin=\r\n.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
