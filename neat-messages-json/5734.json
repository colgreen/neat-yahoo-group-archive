If you&#39;re particular abo=\r\nut sticking with his implementation and C++ (his is a relatively simple imp=\r\nlementation of NEAT from what I understand) I can send you my code if you w=\r\nant (buggy work in progress).&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not a simple exa=\r\nmple at all (competitive coevolution), but it would give you some code exam=\r\nples and bug fixes to Mat Buckland&#39;s original implementation (mine is a=\r\n Linux port). Probably only useful to you for looking at the changes I made=\r\n to Mr. Buckland&#39;s code, but that would be easy as most of the code is =\r\nthe same, and the classes retained their names from those described in his =\r\nbook.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You might want to start with getting his mineswee=\r\nper (was that it?) example application running, and try putting in some of =\r\nthe bug fixes folks have recommended in his implementation (I think I can h=\r\nelp find those). Once you have that working, you might want to try the XOR =\r\ntest, and perhaps pole balancing. I believe those are common tasks to under=\r\ntake.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Let me know if you want any code, or have any que=\r\nstions I might be able to help with. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m far from a NEAT=\r\n guru, but I don&#39;t think too many folks are working with Mat Buckland&#=\r\n39;s implementation now. I think that&#39;s a great book, and that chapter =\r\nhelped me considerably in getting started working with NEAT.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Drew&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Dec 6, 2011 at 2:01 AM, adel=\r\neh ebrahimi &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:adlh_ebrahimi@...&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adlh_ebrahimi@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi everybody&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am new in learning NEAT.
