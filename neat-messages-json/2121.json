Our fitness is measured by the Bankroll of each player\n&gt; after 600 hands in Texas Hold&#39;em (Limit).\n&gt; \n&gt; The players begin with 10.000$. We don&#39;t want to punish players \nthat\n&gt; haven&#39;t lost money, but those that have should be assigned some \nsort\n&gt; of error. Our own idea is to make it 10.000$ - Bankroll. Is that \nan OK\n&gt; error measure?\n&gt; \n\nI think it depends on the other components of fitness.  Is the lost \nmoney the only fitness measure?  If so, it&#39;s most useful to make \nsure that the fitness of ones that lose the worst are significantly \nless than those that lose the least.  Sometimes squaring or \nsomething like that can help emphasize the disparity.  Keep in mind \nthat the size of a species is proportional to it&#39;s average fitness.  \nTherefore, if fitnesses do not cover a good relative range, the \nspecies will all end up about the same size.  \n\n&gt; 2) What effect does the &quot;champion&quot; setting (set to true) have on an\n&gt; organism during epoch ?\n&gt; \n\nThe champion is duplicated into the next for any species above (I \nthink) size 4.  It is a form of elitism.  It helps a lot, in general.\n\n&gt; 3)Some times the NEAT engine writes &quot;performing delta coding&quot;. Is \nthis\n&gt; a bad thing?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nIt&#39;s not bad necessarily; it just means that your best species has \nnot improved in the last dropoff_age+5 generations, where \ndropoff_age is defined in the parameters (.ne) file.\n\nI suggest making dropoff_age really high, like 500, for your initial \nexperiments.  That way it won&#39;t ever delta code.  And that&#39;s fine \nfor a really long run, since it isn&#39;t really necessary after only a \nfew generations of stagnation.\n\nWhat delta-coding does is focus in on only the top 2 species and \nkill the rest off.  It&#39;s a focusing measure when things aren&#39;t \nworking out.  But I suspect you setting is doing it way too soon.\nYou don&#39;t usually need it as much as you might think if you are \nwilling to go for hundreds of generations.\n\n&gt; Our initial test results currently shows that the best individual \nhave\n&gt; picked up that it is important for them to play aggressively when \nthey\n&gt; have one hole card that is a part of the current best hand. This is\n&gt; not at all a good player but it doesn&#39;t take the players more than\n&gt; about 10 generations to pick up on this feature. Our hope is that\n&gt; after a couple of hundred generations we will have a players that \nis a\n&gt; little bit stronger.\n&gt; \n\nCertainly you should play at least a few hundred generations to get \nan idea if your experiment is working or not.\n\n&gt; The players are playing against a fixed opponent that always call.\n&gt; This way they should be forced only to play the good hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; Out goal is to continue training but switch the opponent once the\n&gt; players show signs that they can play convincingly better than this\n&gt; opponent.\n&gt; \n\nGood luck, please continue to post on your progress.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
