Would it not be more effective \n&gt;to have a second XML document detailing &quot;presentation&quot; details, and \n&gt;have that document &quot;point&quot; to the &quot;structure&quot; XML document?  \n\nWell, the only two attributes of the XML that deal with presentation \nare the two &quot;hint&quot; attributes in the neuron tags, and as Colin \nsuggested, those could simply be optional.  Include them if you want \nto graphically represent the networks...leave them out otherwise.\n\nAll other information in XML is relevant to its actual structure and \nfunction.\n\n&gt;That way, those who want to work strictly with data structure and \n&gt;have not care for the presentation, are not burdened with the \n&gt;presentation data.  \n\nJust leave out the &quot;hint&quot; tags.\n\n&gt;Additionally, there will be other types of presentation that will \n&gt;likely be created later.  I am assuming you would not want to add \n&gt;this presentation data to this XML, right?\n\nNot as an integral part of the XML...but if someone else wanted to \ninclude optional attributes to assist with graphical representation, \nthat could easily be ignored when parsing...that&#39;d be fine.\n\nPersonally, I&#39;d prefer one basic format for network XML, with \noptional attributes, rather than keep track of two forms of XML. \n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
