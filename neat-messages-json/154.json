I have checked this carefully and have\n&gt; confidence in the result.  The evolution seemed to\n&gt; stop at about 95%.  I&#39;m not sure why this is, but it\n&gt; may be that more neurons are required.  The 95% result\n&gt; was with 40 neurons.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Since this proves that the ANN can remember a series\n&gt; of patterns and then act correctly using that data, it\n&gt; would seem that the six card game could be mastered. \n&gt; My hypothesis is that many more neurons are required. \n&gt; Perhaps one or two hundred are necessary.  OTOH, my\n&gt; computational resources and patience probably limit me\n&gt; to 50 neurons max.  I wonder if there are any\n&gt; theortical results that would apply to this problem?\n&gt; \n\nHey Mitchell, this is a very nice result.  It does make you wonder why\nit needs 40 neurons?  (I assume you mean 40 hidden neurons.)\nWhat is going on that such a small amount of information is being\nencoded by so many variables?  I also wonder about the theoretical\naspects...what is the theoretical minimum # of neurons needed?\n\nYou may want to try ablating neurons, or cutting them out of the\nnetwork one by one, and seeing if it still performs alright.  It may\nturn out some of them don&#39;t matter.  Note that you can ablate a neuron\neither by literally removing it, or by turning it&#39;s output into random\nnoise.  I&#39;ve heard arguments for doing it both ways.\n\nIt also makes you wonder how NEAT would do, since it\ncomplexifies..perhaps it can find a smaller solution?  Maybe you could\nupload the code for this smaller game as well.\n\nAnyway, very interesting work!\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
