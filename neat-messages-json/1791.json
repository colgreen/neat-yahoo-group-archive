Tell me you&#39;re also into evolving physically simulated critters\n&gt; and I&#39;ll start getting nervous...\n\nNah. I can sit and watch someone else&#39;s code evolving for a while, but\nthat&#39;s as far as it goes. No money in it... :)\n\n&gt; and related indicators. One problem is that I don&#39;t have league positions\n&gt; in my dataset, so a goal conceded to the top team counts as much as a\n&gt; goal conceded to the bottom team. I could calculate my own &quot;league score&quot;\n&gt; from the last 10 games per team or some such, but I never got to that.\n\nI don&#39;t think league position is as good a measure as average points\nper game. I&#39;d take it from the start of the season and also for a\nrecent (5? 6?) number of games. A linear regression on season\npts-per-game against bookie&#39;s odds (expressed as a probability) will\ngive a surprisingly good fit on its own.\n\nI developed a couple of rating systems, loosely based on the chess Elo\nrating system, the idea being to take account of the strength of the\nopposition: a home draw is generally considered slightly negative, but\nif the team at the bottom of the league manages to draw with the top\nteam then that probably ought to be considered a positive. Using the\ndifference or ratio of the two teams&#39; current ratings also gave a good\nfit to bookie odds and allowed the addition of rating derivatives:\ntrend, for example, that I hoped might help the model to spot teams \nwhose improvement was not factored into their price. I think I have\nsome Delphi code that calculated inputs (to my GEP implementation)\nthat may cast some light (if you promise not to laugh at my somewhat\nconfused OO, not to mention my inexperience with Object Pascal...)\n\nI don&#39;t have them to hand at the moment but I&#39;ll dig out my notes on\nmy latest (100% virtual) ideas, inspired by the combination of part\nfailures (!) and the innovations available in NEAT.\n\n&gt; Well, as long as you don&#39;t actually talk about football, I&#39;m very\n&gt; interested. If sweden made it to a combined Olympics and world games\n&gt; final, I _might_ watch parts of the game, but I&#39;d surely not enjoy it much ;)\n\nWhile I do actually attend matches, my conversation about the game\nitself is mostly limited to my own club, which makes it a minority\ninterest!\n\nMike\n\n"}}
