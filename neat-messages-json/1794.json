The question is if that makes them more or less predictable. \n\nReminds me of a funny fact, most people assume that straight men have more\nsexual partners, on average, than straight women. This is patently not\ntrue (possibly slightly true because there are more women than men). Why\nMUST it be untrue? Because for each man that has a partner, there&#39;s a\nwoman that has one too.\n\nThe reason I mention this is that while your quote is true, the opposite\nis surely also true, since as money is lost, it&#39;s mostly gained by someone\nelse. On average, day traders come out about even - commission + the\ngeneral trend. But it&#39;s probably safe to bet that there&#39;s a great herd of\nlosing day traders and a few winning ones. \n\nMost importantly, there&#39;s more movement in the day market than in the\nintra day.\n\n&gt; So I definitely think it would \n&gt; be worth investigating. I hope that last comment didn&#39;t come across as \n&gt; too predatory :)\n\nDeliciously so.\n\n&gt; It depends how you are interpreting your output. You say &gt;0.5 indicates\n&gt; buy and &lt;0.5 indicates sell. So presumbaly you consider anything within\n&gt; magnitude 0.5 to be a hold signal? \n\nSorry, I meant &gt;=0.5, but _exactly_ 0.5 (with double precision) is a very\nrare occurance indeed. I don&#39;t have a hold signal, though I might add a\nband for that. On the other hand, if the system wants to signal hold, it\nhas a parameter for &quot;Currently Owning&quot;, which it can use to hold (strong\ninfluence from &quot;Currently Owning&quot; tends to reinforce the current\nowning/not owning position).\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
