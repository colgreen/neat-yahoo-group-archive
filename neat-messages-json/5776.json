In my f=\r\neverish excitement I thought it would be a good idea to start a blog on que=\r\nstions and issues I come across, in the hope that other active researchers =\r\nwill want to comment on and perhaps even start a bit of dialogue about them=\r\n (like this mailing list but more public). I know another Ph.D. candidate w=\r\nho keeps a similar blog (totally different research area, though) and it&#39;s =\r\nworking out great for her, so it didn&#39;t seem like a completely hopeless ide=\r\na...\n\nI know some of you are interested in the evolution of adaptive NNs, I=\r\n read your articles as soon as they were posted to this group! :) I also en=\r\nvisage using NEAT and variants in the research (I did a study of some of th=\r\ne properties of HyperNEAT for my Honours year a year or so ago). It&#39;s at ht=\r\ntp://ojcoleman.com. The first post is mostly background info (I hope I didn=\r\n&#39;t get anything too wrong, let me know if you think I did!) and what the re=\r\nsearch is about, but it also explains why I think the proposed approach is =\r\na good idea which might provide some good controversy points (maybe not so =\r\nmuch among this crowd, however).\n\nI googled around and couldn&#39;t find all th=\r\nat many relevant blogs. Do any of you keep a similar blog or know of any? I=\r\n could mostly only find generic newsy AI ones.\n\nCheers,\nOliver\n\n\n"}}
