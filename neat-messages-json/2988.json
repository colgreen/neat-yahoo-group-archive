I am on the mutation operators and had a question\nab=\r\nout  Genome::mutate_toggle_enable(int times).  When the method finds\na gene=\r\n to disable (if the gene is enabled), it does a check to see if\nit can do t=\r\nhis without fragmenting the network.  The comment says:\n\n&gt; We need to make =\r\nsure that another gene connects out of the in-node\n&gt; Because if not a secti=\r\non of network will break off and become isolated\n\nMy question is does it on=\r\nly check the in_nodes and not the out_nodes?\n If we don&#39;t check out_nodes, =\r\nwouldn&#39;t it be possible for the outputs\nto become disconnected from the net=\r\nwork?  If you have a network of 1\ninput and 2 output nodes, where the input=\r\n is connected to both\noutputs, wouldn&#39;t this method consider it valid to di=\r\nsable one of the\nconnections?\n\n\n"}}
