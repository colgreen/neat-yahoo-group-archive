It&#39;s just because of kind of disproportion in ANN. I mean we can weaken any signal in 100, 1000 and more times (setting small weights as 0.01 and less) but we doesn&#39;t allow to strengthen signals much. Thus having large weight for connection from some hidden neruon can act as compensation of excessive weakness of input signals for this neuron.\n\nAbout saturation of sigmoid function. Yes, there is such a problem but if we trained network and it DO function properly then maybe it is not actually undesirable. Because ANN is often treated as black box, so its inner structure doesn&#39;t make much sense. The main point is input and output parameters interrelationship that we have after network training.\n\n\n"}}
