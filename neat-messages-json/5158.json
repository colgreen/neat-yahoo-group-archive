It would be interesting to hear if there are better insight=\r\ns about the idea now.\nIn particular I want to understand how is the novelty=\r\n search better than a systematic or a random search of the genotype space. =\r\nA brute force search of the genotype will certainly run on many occasions i=\r\nnto the same phenotypes. The question is to what extent can novelty search =\r\navoid this and does it have other benefits?\n\nps.\nI attended Ken&#39;s tutorial =\r\non developmental systems on GECCO2008, and in my opinion, it was by far the=\r\n best presentation I saw on that conference. That&#39;s how I got introduced to=\r\n NEAT. Now I decided to take a look at it again and I am finding many inter=\r\nesting ideas.\n\n\n"}}
