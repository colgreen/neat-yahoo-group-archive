There are\nsome reproduction errors that result in sequences getting repeated\nover and over - which result in the accumulation of &#39;junk&#39; over time.\nThat said there is some evidence that some of the the &#39;junk&#39; DNA in\nthe human genome does have a functional purpose - that is, although it\ndoesn&#39;t code for a protein it may have other roles roles, e.g.\ninteracting with protein synthesis to expand the range of proteins a\ngiven gene sequence codes for.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
