The formula\ncreates a &#39;curve surface&#39; that roughly approximates the original\nsurface of which the pixel inputs are a representation of.  The\noutputs then are calculated by taking the average height of the\nsurface within an area.\n\nA neural network is a classifier more than a calculator.  But what\nabout using the NEAT methodology to build a formula?  Use it to evolve\nwhat in compiler terminology (if I&#39;m not mistaken) is a &#39;parse tree&#39;\nof the formula in a manner that is similar to a network.  Each node is\neither a value or an operator.  Values have no connections, they are\nalways the leaf nodes.  Operator nodes have connections to either\nvalue nodes or other operator nodes.  The connection has a weight\nwhich is a multiplier.  So if &#39;+&#39; is connected to &#39;a&#39; with a weight of\n0.5 and to &#39;b&#39; with a weight of 0.75, then it is the same thing as\n0.5a + 0.75b.  A constant input of 1 serves like a bias, so you can\n(by means of the weight) build any constant value you need.  And\noperators can be any mathematical function.\n\nSo, you start with a minimal function.  It just adds all the inputs\ntogether or something.  Then you evolve the parse tree for the\nfunction.  To evaluate the function, you simply take the average of\nthe values within an (x1,y1,x2,y2) region and see if it corresponds to\nthe expected pixel value.\n\nAdmittedly, the search space for such a thing would be enormous.  And\nI doubt that there is a smooth ramp-up that it could follow to help it\nevolve.  But I don&#39;t know...has anybody read anything useful regarding\nevolution of formulas?\n\n"}}
