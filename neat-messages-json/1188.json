I feel like I have more of an idea on what to expect if \nI decide to attend one of these types of conference in the future. \nSounds like the Evolutionary Robotics tutorial was good, I always like \ngood summaries of the state of research, it gives you a good grounding \nand sense of perspective to work from. Too often you can get lost in \nlectures that jump right into a complex subject.\n\nDid you discover any new NEAT or NEAT like research going on or any \ninteresting commercial connections?\n\nActualy I was wondering about commercial applications of EANNs/TWEANNs \nand I came a cross this company on the web recently:\n\nhttp://www.biocompsystems.com/\n\nThey do a product called IModel:\n\nhttp://www.biocompsystems.com/products/imodel/index.htm\n\nWhich I understand to use EANNs of some kind. At least that&#39;s what I was \nlead to believe by a post by a someone from the company on \ncomp.ai.neural-nets. I also thought this page was interesting though vague:\n\nhttp://www.biocompsystems.com/pages/meshes.htm\n\nI suspect the &#39;trade-secret&#39; &#39;meshes&#39; they are describe are in fact \nTWEANNs :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n\nDerek James wrote:\n\n&gt;I said I&#39;d give an update of GECCO and how our Late-Breaking Paper\n&gt;presentation went, so here goes...\n&gt;\n&gt;The first couple of days were all workshops and tutorials.  The best\n&gt;of these included a workshop on modularity and reuse, in which Ken was\n&gt;a speaker.  Some of the speakers were virtually incoherent, but\n&gt;nevertheless the session sparked a lot of ideas and included some good\n&gt;discussion.  I especially liked Ken&#39;s suggestion that the best\n&gt;approach is to allow for overall designs or body plans which are able\n&gt;to exploit modularity, rather than the approach of haphazardly\n&gt;evolving individuals and then trying to find &quot;useful&quot; modules (if I&#39;m\n&gt;understanding what he said correctly).\n&gt;\n&gt;Another highlight, for me at least, was the tutorial on Evolutionary\n&gt;Robotics by Dario Floreano.  He covered nearly a decade of research in\n&gt;the area, included lots of examples, with videos, and sparked a lot of\n&gt;interesting ideas.  Unfortunately, he ran over time and didn&#39;t leave\n&gt;room for questions (though I was able to corner him later at a\n&gt;reception and discuss a few things).\n&gt;\n&gt;My presentation was on Monday.  I made a wise choice in using overhead\n&gt;slides instead of a Powerpoint.  I attended several presentations in\n&gt;which time was eaten trying to change the resolution of the laptop\n&gt;monitors to fit the projection.  Anyway, there were more people than\n&gt;I&#39;d expected (I pretty much thought only the presenters would be\n&gt;there).  It was a tiny room, but it was nearly full.  A couple of\n&gt;presenters didn&#39;t show up, but the moderator just left gaps instead of\n&gt;forging ahead with the next in line.  When it was my turn, I gave a\n&gt;general overview of what we meant by &quot;simplification&quot; and\n&gt;&quot;complexification&quot;, briefly explained how NEAT works, then ANJI.  I\n&gt;talked about the domain and how we set up the experiments, and then I\n&gt;showed our results.  The audience didn&#39;t exactly look riveted, but I\n&gt;got four questions at the end, which at least shows that some people\n&gt;were actually paying attention.  If I were to try to present next\n&gt;year, I think I&#39;d try for the regular paper deadline, and hopefully\n&gt;shoot for some slightly meatier material.\n&gt;\n&gt;The rest of the conference was mostly paper presentations, many of\n&gt;which didn&#39;t really relate to what we&#39;re interested in on this list,\n&gt;but still interesting.  I met several interesting people from other\n&gt;schools, and from industries and non-profits.  I tagged along to a few\n&gt;meals with Ken and Joseph, and we had some interesting discussions.\n&gt;\n&gt;The only touristy thing we did in Seattle was check out the new\n&gt;Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, which was pretty cool.\n&gt;\n&gt;All in all it was a good experience...not a bad way to spend my vacation.\n&gt;\n&gt;Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
