Let \nme explain=\r\n the details behind it. As you are probably familiar with \nthe other NEVH s=\r\nhit this code does the same but uses another NEAT \nimplememtation and novel=\r\nty search. (steady state evolution). \nI&#39;ve seen some dolls actually walking=\r\n, but backwards. Kind of weird. \nI guess it is the easier way, though :) \nT=\r\nhe behavior characterization is (as Peter B proposed) the final XYZ \nlocati=\r\non of the head. The distance is simply the eucldian distance \nbetween those=\r\n points. I agree that there are many options and I am \ntrying out many diff=\r\nerent BCs (behavior characterizations). But this \none works well. \nThe node=\r\ns in the substrate are arranged in a geometric way to reflect \nthe body&#39;s g=\r\neometry in space. Each output corresponds to a joint \nangle. Arms and legs =\r\nare placed symmetrically in the left and right \nsides. The head (neck joint=\r\n) is placed above them in the center. \nOutputs are drawn in green. Inputs (=\r\nhead velocity) are drawn in red. \nHidden nodes are drawn in yellow. Ergh I =\r\nsee it is upside-down but \nHyperNEAT doesn&#39;t care about this anyway :) \nThe=\r\n 5th input to the CPPN is the distance from 0, 0 in node-specific \ndata and=\r\n the distance between the 2 points when computing the weight \nof the connec=\r\ntion between 2 nodes. Just like in your paper, the same \nbias. \n\nPeter\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Wow=\r\n, this looks really cool Petar.  I thought it would be awhile\n&gt; before we s=\r\naw HyperNEAT and novelty search combined.  I ran it \nwhile I\n&gt; was working =\r\non other stuff for a bit over 50,000 evaluations, \nchecking\n&gt; in on it peri=\r\nodically.  The behavioral diversity was really\n&gt; impressive: I got guys tha=\r\nt were taking baby steps and guys that \nwere\n&gt; doing yoga poses (I swear on=\r\ne of them did &quot;the chair&quot;), although \nthere\n&gt; were still a good number of r=\r\nepeats, especially near the end \n(falling\n&gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty=\r\n common).  No one that I saw had a \ngood\n&gt; walking gait, but I guess it&#39;s p=\r\nossible that one could have when I\n&gt; wasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an op=\r\ntion to browse the archive. \nI&#39;m\n&gt; curious about a few things, if you would=\r\nn&#39;t mind sharing:\n&gt; \n&gt; -What did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems l=\r\nike there are a\n&gt; number of viable options here.\n&gt; \n&gt; -What do the nodes on=\r\n the substrate mean, and are they just on a \nflat\n&gt; plane?  I used your old=\r\ner version when it was first released, and \nif I\n&gt; remember right the two o=\r\nn the left are inputs and the stuff on the\n&gt; right is various joints, but I=\r\n wanted to make sure.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Similarly, what do you use as the 5th input on =\r\nthe CPPN?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This =\r\nemail message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt; &gt; a file has been up=\r\nloaded to the Files area of the neat \n&gt; &gt; group.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   File        : /=\r\nnovelty_nevh.rar \n&gt; &gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   Description : Novelty Search applied to evolving HyperNEAT\n&gt; leaky-i=\r\nntegrator substrates controlling a 3D humanoid model.
