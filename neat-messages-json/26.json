Possibly then,\nstrategies that worked well with 5x5 would not work\nwell with 19x19.  So what about 100x100 Go?  If you\nconsidered the domain of Go the class of all games\nwith the same ruleset, but with scalable board sizes,\nthe domain would technically be open-ended, would it\nnot?\n\nI&#39;m guessing that someone (or some thing) that is good\nat 19x19 Go might not necessarily be good at 100x100\nGo, or 1000x1000 Go...\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
