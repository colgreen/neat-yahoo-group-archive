Now I know that ther=\r\ne exists a neural net\nwhich  \n&gt; can do this to a high degree of accuracy ( =\r\n&gt; 95% ) but cannot\nreproduce  \n&gt; the results using rtNeat ( the C++ version=\r\n) and wondered if I was\ndoing  \n&gt; something silly or if it simply cannot ev=\r\nolve a net to learn it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is more information on my scenario:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nInputs : {i1,i2,i3,...,iN}, all of which are real numbers\n&gt; Target Output :=\r\n T, which is a real number value between 0 and 1\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the start gen=\r\nome:\n&gt; \n&gt; genomestart 1\n&gt; trait 1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n&gt; trait 2 0.2 0 0 0 0 0=\r\n 0 0\n&gt; trait 3 0.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n&gt; node 1 0 1 1\n&gt; node 2 0 1 1\n&gt; node 3 0 0=\r\n 2\n&gt; gene 1 1 3 0.0 0 1 0 1\n&gt; gene 2 2 3 0.0 0 2 0 1\n&gt; gene 3 3 3 0.0 0 2 0=\r\n 1\n&gt; genomeend 1\n&gt; \n&gt; and here are my parameters:\n&gt; \n&gt; trait_param_mut_prob=\r\n 0.5\n&gt; trait_mutation_power 1.0\n&gt; linktrait_mut_sig 1.0\n&gt; nodetrait_mut_sig=\r\n 0.5\n&gt; weigh_mut_power 2.5\n&gt; recur_prob 0.00\n&gt; disjoint_coeff 1.0\n&gt; excess_=\r\ncoeff 1.0\n&gt; mutdiff_coeff 0.4\n&gt; compat_thresh 3.0\n&gt; age_significance 1.0\n&gt; =\r\nsurvival_thresh 0.20\n&gt; mutate_only_prob 0.25\n&gt; mutate_random_trait_prob 0.1=\r\n\n&gt; mutate_link_trait_prob 0.1\n&gt; mutate_node_trait_prob 0.1\n&gt; mutate_link_we=\r\nights_prob 0.9\n&gt; mutate_toggle_enable_prob 0.00\n&gt; mutate_gene_reenable_prob=\r\n 0.000\n&gt; mutate_add_node_prob 0.03\n&gt; mutate_add_link_prob 0.05\n&gt; interspeci=\r\nes_mate_rate 0.001\n&gt; mate_multipoint_prob 0.6\n&gt; mate_multipoint_avg_prob 0.=\r\n4\n&gt; mate_singlepoint_prob 0.0\n&gt; mate_only_prob 0.2\n&gt; recur_only_prob 0.0\n&gt; =\r\npop_size 100\n&gt; dropoff_age 15\n&gt; newlink_tries 20\n&gt; print_every 30\n&gt; babies_=\r\nstolen 0\n&gt; num_runs 15\n&gt; \n&gt; The fitness function is simply to minimise the =\r\ndifference between the  \n&gt; output and target values.

Could it be that the best networks are\nbeing  \n&gt; destroyed through=\r\n too higher mutation / crossover?  Is it that I\nneed a  \n&gt; diferent fitness=\r\n function, if so what kind should i be using (i.e.\nshould  \n&gt; I be separati=\r\nng the outputs into wider ranges rather than approximate  \n&gt; values) ?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Can anyone make any suggestions as to how to make it find better\nnetworks?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks in advance for any advice,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
