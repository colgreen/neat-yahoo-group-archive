As I\nsaid, I&#39;ve heard that 5x5 Go is *qualitatively*\ndifferent from 19x19 Go, but I could easily believe,\nif it were true, that this would be due to the use of\nedges and corners in forming eyes.  \n\nYou might be right, that 101x101 Go is not\nqualitatively different from 19x19 Go, since the\nlarger the board grows, the less the edges and corner\nprobably play in strategy.  I don&#39;t know how\nsignificantly the strategy would change as the board\nsize grows.\n\n&gt; This is the kind of problem I want to address with\n&gt; modular NE. Some\n&gt; domains are solvable by NE for small sizes, but they\n&gt; are scalable, which\n&gt; makes traditional NE infeasible after a certain\n&gt; point. If we could analyze\n&gt; the basic patterns that make up the solution, we\n&gt; could figure out how to\n&gt; replicate them correctly so that the NE solution is\n&gt; scalable.\n\nRight.  It&#39;s definitely a problem that&#39;s going to need\nworking out to solve larger, more complicated domains.\n Talking with Ken, he seems well aware that the\ncurrent implementation of NEAT just isn&#39;t going to be\nadequate when dealing with high input/output domains.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
