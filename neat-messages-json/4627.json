It studies how sensitive HyperNEAT is to different geometric\nrepresentations of the same problem.\n\nI am especially excited about this paper because it was nominated for the\nBest Paper Award in the Generative and Developmental Systems track. If you\nare going to GECCO this year, and enjoyed the paper, please keep it in mind\nwhen casting your ballot.\n\nThe paper can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HyperNEATSensitivity\nToGeometry.pdf\n\nAbstract:\n\nHyperNEAT, a generative encoding for evolving artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), has the unique and powerful ability to exploit the geometry of a\nproblem (e.g., symmetries) by encoding ANNs as a function of a problem&#39;s\ngeometry. This paper provides the first extensive analysis of the\nsensitivity of HyperNEAT to different geometric representations of a\nproblem. Understanding how geometric representations affect the quality of\nevolved solutions should improve future designs of such representations.\nHyperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\nquadruped robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representation.\nHere, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometric\nrepresentations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the quality\nand kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantially affected by\nthe geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a direct encoding\ncontrol even with randomized geometric representations, but performs even\nbetter when a human engineer designs a representation that reflects the\nactual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even choices in geometric\nlayout that seem to be inconsequential a priori can significantly affect\nfitness. Additionally, a geometric representation can bias the type of\nsolutions generated (e.g., make left-right symmetry more common than\nfront-back symmetry). The results suggest that HyperNEAT practitioners can\nobtain good results even if they do not know how to geometrically represent\na problem, and that further improvements are possible with a well-chosen\ngeometric representation.\n\n\n\nAs always, I look forward to any questions or comments you may have.\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
