The nature of the data is a network \nor mesh of associations.  It is far more complicated than the networks that \nNEAT generates.  Thus, the solution for visualizing this data might be a \ngood way of visualizing a complex NEAT network, too.  So I thought perhaps \nthe people on this list might have some interest in a contributing to a \nsolution to this problem.\n\nThe origins of the data is the dictionary.  Specifically \ndictionary.reference.com and thesaurus.reference.com.\n\nI started with a word.  It really doesn&#39;t matter which word, but I started \nwith &#39;intelligence&#39;.  I query the dictionary and thesaurus entries for that \nword and parse the results.  I get a list of words that appear in those two \npages.  I save that list as the list of &#39;associations&#39; for that word.  Now \nfor each of those words (which I have not already processed), I repeat the \nprocess.  Virtually no matter what word I start with, I end up with \nbasically the whole dictionary.  Then I prune those associations to include \nonly those that are reciprocal.  That is, word A references B, and B also \nreferences A.  An example would be Tree and Bark.  This pruning makes the \ndata SIGNIFICANTLY smaller, but still pretty large.\n\nNow I would like to present the data as a visual &#39;mesh&#39; or network.  It \nwould help me to &#39;see&#39; the connections.  I want to minimize the lengths of \nthe connections so that related words appear close to one another.\n\nHere&#39;s what I had in mind.  Load the data into memory.  Randomly assign x,y \npositions to each node.  Then treat every direct connection as an attractive \nforce, and treat physical proximity as a repulsive force that falls off with \nthe square of the distance.  For each time step, calculate the net force.  \nThen reposition the nodes based on that net force.  Repeat until the net \nmovement approaches zero.  Then save the positions of everything and \ngenerate a visualization of it.\n\nFor NEAT, I thought that you could add an additional &#39;force&#39; that is an \nextra repulsive force between input and output nodes.  Then, the input nodes \nwould tend to cluster towards one side, and the output nodes on the other, \nwith a delicate balance forming in the nodes in between.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data is a list of words (the whole dictionary), and what words are \nreferenced by the lookup of that word.  That is, if you look up a word, you \nwill get a return page.  On that page will be a number of words.  For each \nword on that page, I create an association or link between them.\n\nI then pruned the list of links to only those that are reciprocal.  If I \nlook up Tree, I might find Bark.  If I look up Bark, I will find Tree.  \nSince the words that you get when you look up Tree includes Bark and vice \nversa, I save that &#39;connection&#39; as an association.\n\nNow I *know* that there are &#39;clusters&#39; of words that are all interrelated.  \nThat is, groups of words that link to one another, even every member of the \ngroup.  What I would like to do is position the nodes such that the average \ndistance between connections is minimized.\n\nWhat I thought about doing was creating a model where the connections are \ntreated like an attractive force, and where phisical proximity is a \nrepulsive force, and then let the system relax itself, re-organizing the \nphysical location according to the net force vectors and then repeating \nuntil the nodes settle down and the average net force is minimized.  By \nplacing the nodes initially in a random dispersion, they should \nself-organize.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts?\n\nNow, I want to graph the result.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet rid of annoying pop-up ads with the new MSN Toolbar ï¿½ FREE! \nhttp://toolbar.msn.com/go/onm00200414ave/direct/01/\n\n\n"}}
