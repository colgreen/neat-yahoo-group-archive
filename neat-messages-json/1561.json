However,\n&gt; your project is really cutting edge and I am looking forward to\n&gt; hearing what you accomplish.  What made your decision to first\n&gt; submit to a journal as opposed to a conference?  I think it would\n&gt; probably be a lot of fun to present this kind of exciting work at a\n&gt; conference where you can see people&#39;s reactions.\n\nWell, we plan on experimenting with this approach using progressively\nmore difficult recognition tasks, so hopefully we&#39;d had something even\nmore impressive to demo at a conference next year.\n\nBut I came across this call for papers:\n\nhttp://cienciascomp.cicese.mx/CallxPapersPRL.htm\n\nAnd it seemed to fit perfectly with what we&#39;re working on.  Plus,\nsince we don&#39;t have advisors standing over our shoulders, we like to\nhave deadlines to keep us motivated, and this seemed like a good one.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
