If a\n&gt; node has already been computed that is then called again, it simply returns the result of that prior computation.\n\n\nYes I see. It&#39;s like evaluating an expression tree but with an extra\nrule for handling the fact it&#39;s not a tree (it&#39;s a directed acyclic\ngraph). With the timestep approach nodes are being activated even when\nthe signal &#39;wave&#39; hasn&#39;t reached them yet, hence there is some\ninefficiency.\n\n\n&gt; Note that the two different ways of activating do not always yield equivalent results because of some subtle implications.\n\n\nNoted. Thanks.\n\n"}}
