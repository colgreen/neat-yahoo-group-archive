I&#39;ve alluded to\nit in a couple of messages already.\n\nBasically, we&#39;re applying the active vision approach similiar to\nDarren Izzard&#39;s OCR experiments and Ken&#39;s roving eye approach to Go.\n\nOur active vision system includes movement along the x and y axes,\nzoom, rotation, and mirror flip capabilities.  The resolution of the\neye is parameterized.\n\nWe started by simply testing whether or not our networks could\ndiscriminate between all-black canvasses and all-white ones.  That\ndone, we moved on to basic shapes, solid black circles and solid black\nsquares on white backgrounds.  All images are 50x50 pixel tifs. \nBetween each generation we add both positional and rotational variance\nto the images, so that they are repositioned +/- 10 pixels along the\nx/y axes based on randomly generated values, and are rotated about +/-\n20 degrees.  With 10 circle images and 10 squares, we were able to\nevolve networks that could discriminate between the two sets with 100%\naccuracy.\n\nNow we&#39;re working with character recognition, specifically capital\nletters in san-serif font, again on a 50x50 canvas.  I&#39;ve uploaded our\nbase images as .jpgs in the Photos section:\n\nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst?.dir=/Derek+and+Philip%27s+OCR+Test+Cases&.src=gr&.order=&.view=t&.done=http%3a//briefcase.yahoo.com/\n\nSo far we&#39;ve just worked with discriminating sets of two letters: A\nand B.  And we&#39;ve also done some experiments trying to discriminate A\nfrom all other letters.  So far, we&#39;ve acheived about 95% accuracy\nrates in these types of tasks.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
