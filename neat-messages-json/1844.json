He then goes on to\n&gt;suggest that neuron mitochondria may be somehow describing a much finer\n&gt;(than relatively large neurons) information processing network that\n&gt;operates at the quantum physical level, perhaps tapping into some\n&gt;unknown physical dimension.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now, while it&#39;s an interesting idea it was my interpretation that the\n&gt;book was effectively saying that conciousness is something which is\n&gt;supernatural and mysterious and it just feels like passing the buck to me.\n\nIn &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Mind&quot; he tries to link consciousness with quantum \nwave function collapse.\n\nI get the impression he&#39;s against materialism and prepared to try any \nexplanation to support his preconception.\n\n&gt; &gt;We know that almost all known chemical and physicial processes proceed in a\n&gt; &gt;predetermined direction.  (i.e.  If you were to rewind time and start it\n&gt; &gt;playing again - the chemical/physical processes would proceed almost\n&gt; &gt;*exactly* the same.  I say almost - because new quantum theory suggests\n&gt; &gt;there is a level of inherent unpredictability which might suggest different\n&gt; &gt;outcomes.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Having recently done some reading on pseudo random number generators it\n&gt;makes me wonder if the universe may be using such a generator ;)  And if\n&gt;we could perhaps work out the algorithm, hmm :)\n\nI believe this is a variation of the &quot;hidden variables&quot; explanation for \nquantum indeterminacy, but I think there is a proof that it is not the \ncase.  Something to do with the EPR paradox I think...\nNow consider that crocs have been around for millions of years without\n\n&gt;hardly changing from an evolutionary point of view. Perhaps they have\n&gt;reached the pinacle of what they can achieve without something\n&gt;equivalent to the frontal cortex of our brain, which is something which\n&gt;evolved after the limibic system but communicates very closely with it.\n&gt;This new brain system takes in the same information but is able to\n&gt;provide a new level of processing that the limbic system was incapable\n&gt;of, like make memories and associations between them.\n\nOr perhaps they have reached a pinnacle, period.  It is a mistake to equate \n&quot;higher organism&quot; with &quot;fitter organism&quot;, or even &quot;better \norganism&quot;.  Bacteria are just as highly evolved as we are, only for a \ndifferent game.  Crocs also...\n\n&gt;It might sound silly but I don&#39;t think conciousness is an on/off thing\n&gt;that is generated by some specific part of the brain, I think it&#39;s a\n&gt;consequence of more and more information about our surroundings being\n&gt;processed in an ordered manner to drive our behaviour/survival - the\n&gt;more deep and abstract the information, the deeper the level of\n&gt;conciousness.\n\nI used to have a friend (may still, but haven&#39;t seen him for years) who \nthought everything was conscious but to different degrees.  ISRT we had a \nvery long (and drunken) argument over whether there was any consciousness \nin the bar stool he was sitting on.\n\nI completely rejected that approach at first, but the more I think about \nit, the more I come down to a choice between two approaches:\n\n1) consciousness will be a very specific process that the brain performs\n2) everything _is_ conscious, but a coherent data processing system gets a \n_lot_ more out of it than a piece of furniture\n\nI still tend towards (1), however.\n\n&gt;Taking the idea a step further, yes it is emergent but you can&#39;t just\n&gt;put a load of unordered complex systems together  and hope for\n&gt;emergence. The interface between the systems has to be ordered, and\n&gt;survival of the fittest just happens to have come up with just such an\n&gt;ordered system of info processing.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n&gt; &gt;This observation suggests that a large enough and complex enough network\n&gt; &gt;could experience this emergent property.  The Internet itself could *think*\n&gt; &gt;it is sentient - despite the fact that, like us, its thoughts are\n&gt; &gt;predetermined.  This approach has interesting and dour predictions for\n&gt; &gt;communication between species.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;The internet is an intersting case to ponder. Think I&#39;ll leave that for\n&gt;another day :)\n\nI have Jan 3rd, 3048 put aside for this question, shall we meet somewhere?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
