But because of this I\n&gt; would suggest using a different zipper to package it up.\n\nWe&#39;re using Ant, which has a .zip component that&#39;s using the\n&quot;Info-zip&quot; implementation.  Not really sure why it&#39;s not working in\nyour Windows environment.  We&#39;re both using WinXP&#39;s built-in zip/unzip\nutility and aren&#39;t having that problem.\n\n&gt; Nice job!  I&#39;ll add the links.\n\nThanks!\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
