Please see below. \n\n&gt; thank you for your answer Jeff=\r\n. I think the discussion here is very fruitful. Indeed I did forgot that yo=\r\nu made a control experiment where geometry could not be exploited. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThis discussion raises the larger question of whether you could have truly =\r\ntemporal problems that did not require spatially distinct processing stream=\r\ns\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe I misunderstand here something, but a truly temporal problem w=\r\nould be any kind of sequence learning (e.g. navigation, episodic memories, =\r\nmotor skills)?! Learning of information that have a temporal order, compari=\r\nng sequences, recognizing sequences. The area that has been associated with=\r\n these kinds of tasks is the hippocampus with its areas dental gyrus, ca3 a=\r\nnd ca1. Information are processed along those three areas but each area ret=\r\nurns also feedback to the entorhinal cortex (which in turn connects to the =\r\ncortex). The hippocampus has been implicated in many different functions (d=\r\nepending on the species in which it is observed) but maybe common to all pr=\r\noblem domains of the species that have a hippocampus is the fact that it ha=\r\ns something to do with sequence learning. \n&gt; \n&gt; \nI&#39;m not denying there is a=\r\n lot of sequence/temporal learning out there. I&#39;m just saying that most suc=\r\nh problems are complex enough that they also have a lot of spatial parallel=\r\nism (such as the splitting of the information stream out to the different m=\r\nodules you mention). I just have a hard time imagining a single-stream, com=\r\nplex, processing machine that learns to do different tasks. But at this poi=\r\nnt I&#39;m just wildly speculating. If such a mental structure existed, would m=\r\nodularity help? By definition, we&#39;ve eliminated parallel modules. So modula=\r\nrity would have to pay off in terms of a serial sequence of modules. It is =\r\ninteresting to think about whether/why modularity pays off in that case (an=\r\nd if it pays off for that specific organism, or across evolutionary time). =\r\n\n\n&gt; Given the fact that the anatomy of the hippocampus is very well conserv=\r\ned across evolution it seems to me that the hippocampus is an excellent exa=\r\nmple, that spatial properties of biological neural networks can also be exp=\r\nloited to solve temporal problems. Its modular structure seems to play cruc=\r\nial role here.\n&gt; \n&gt; For more see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/168810=\r\n79\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As such, even if our technique did not encourage modularity for s=\r\nimple problems where no separate processing streams are required, it probab=\r\nly is still important for most (all?) complex problems. \n&gt; \n&gt; In this conte=\r\nxt I was wondering whether it could be helpful to measure the ratio between=\r\n the current number of edges in a network and the number of edges that have=\r\n to be removed in order to have a modular network. Maybe, this ratio could =\r\nhelp to provide an analytical solution for the question how likely it is th=\r\nat modularity emerges in larger networks. \n&gt; \n&gt; \nWhat would that number tel=\r\nl you?
