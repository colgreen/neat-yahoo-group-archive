Also the speciation in standard\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t see how crossover can contribute to bloat, though.  A child\n&gt;is, structurally, a clone of the dominant parent (i.e., the parent\n&gt;with highest fitness).  \n&gt;\nOk but consider these points:\n\n1) If you clone a genome and the offspring replaces an existing genome \nthat had less structure, then you have increased overall complexity \nwithin the population.\n2) Now if we consider that some additive mutations are neutral then we \ncan assume that these will get cloned and propagated through a \npopulation over time.\n3) Overall, mutation is more likely to find neutral additions than \nneutral deletions - assuming equal amount of both types.\n\nPut the three together and hopefully you can see that any reproduction \nmechanism that copies structure will (or can) assist bloat - so long as \nthere is some other mechanism adding new structure somewhere. How strong \nthis effect is will vary, but any effect at all will snowball in time. \nSo if your asexual repro / mutation routine does 50/50 adds/deletes then \nyou might expect complexity to remain constant, but throw in the \nadditional cloning reproduction mechanism and it may just be enough to \ntip the system into bloat.\n\nI think that makes sense anyway. This also highlights two different \nkinds of bloat:\n\ni) The adding in of new structrure that never existed before (has a new \ninnovation ID within the population).\nii) The propogation of existing structure through a popualtion.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
