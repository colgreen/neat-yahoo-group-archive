I =\r\nonly get A.\n&gt; \n&gt; I figured maybe elitism only applied to mutation and not c=\r\nrossover, so I set\n&gt; MutateOnlyProbability to 1.0, but that did not solve t=\r\nhe problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nostdoctoral Fellow\n&gt; Hod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Laboratory\n&gt; Corn=\r\nell University\n&gt; jeffclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt; \n&gt; **Call for papers=\r\n!
