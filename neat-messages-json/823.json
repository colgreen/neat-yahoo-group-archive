The program is written in Python; the\nPython interpreter is a free download from\nhttp://www.python.org.  It runs on all the Windows and\nLinux variants.\n\nThe weights for the ANN were found using neuro-\nevolution.  Several different sets of weights are\nincluded in VizANN, but they all accomplish the same\nresult.  I expect to release the neuroevolution\nprogram, written in C, within a couple of weeks.\n\nThis program is short, clearly documented, and easy to\nuse.  (At least I think it is!)\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
