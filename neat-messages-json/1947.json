I have \n&gt; finally accepted a tenure-track faculty position at\n&gt; the University \n&gt; of Central Florida in Orlando in the Dept. of\n&gt; Computer Science: \n&gt; www.cs.ucf.edu\n&gt; I am set to start in the Spring 2006 term, which\n&gt; begins in January.\n&gt; This will be a research-intensive position and I do\n&gt; plan on starting\n&gt; a research group there.  Annie Wu, a former student\n&gt; of John Holland, \n&gt; is also a prof there, so there will be two people\n&gt; there now in \n&gt; evolutionary computation.  There is also one of the\n&gt; biggest\n&gt; simulation and training labs in the country (meaning\n&gt; opportunities \n&gt; for applications).  \n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously I only just accepted this job so I can&#39;t\n&gt; tell people a lot \n&gt; of details about getting into the program, etc., but\n&gt; a lot of people \n&gt; have noted that in America there are almost no\n&gt; places to go to study \n&gt; neuroevolution aside from UT Austin.  Therefore, I\n&gt; am hoping this \n&gt; will be a good development for the future of our\n&gt; field and give \n&gt; people another choice for studying and pursuing\n&gt; funded research in \n&gt; neuroevolution and artificial embryogeny.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
