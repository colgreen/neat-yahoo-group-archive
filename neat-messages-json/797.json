I just looked up\n&gt; Gomoku here... http://www.thaistudents.com/fun/gomoku/ where it states\n&gt; &quot;it has been proven that the player who moves second can always win, if\n&gt; he or she plays perfectly. At the Expert level, the TacTix program will\n&gt; indeed play a perfect game&quot;. \n\nActually, Victor Allis solved Gomoku in 1993, and wrote a program,\nVictoria, which plays optimally.  However, it is the player that moves\nfirst, not second, that can always force a win.\n\n&gt; To be honest though I think\n&gt; it would be more fun to find a game for which there exist no good\n&gt; algorithmic players, you then have the possibility of finding a\n&gt; best-ever player :)\n\nWell, the reason for choosing Gomoku is to demonstrate the viable\napplication of evolved neural networks to a large input/output domain,\nand Gomoku is a nice level of complexity, not nearly as daunting as\n15x15 or 19x19 Go, but not trivial either.\n\n&gt; I have thought a little about board games. I was thinking about the\n&gt; &#39;roving eye&#39; technique which overcomes the problem of a large input\n&gt; space and board size scalability. I wonder if it could be improved by\n&gt; providing a further set of inputs that provide a sort of density map of\n&gt; pieces (and their type, e.g. black or white) on the board. \n\nYes.  We plan on using this very technique.  In other words, the eye\nwill have a zoom factor.  There are other innovations on the idea of a\nmobile eye that we&#39;d like to explore.\n\n&gt; Another less well formed idea is to think of how nature deals with the\n&gt; high input space from our own eyes. A large amount of image processing\n&gt; occurs which reduces the high input space information down to the\n&gt; position and size of lines, boundaries and objects. Perhaps we could\n&gt; convert the normal x by y grid state into a more digestable form using a\n&gt; similar technique. E.g. in Go lines of pieces are quite important, so\n&gt; perhaps we could provide the network with data describing where lines are.\n\nThat&#39;s an interesting idea.  But it&#39;s not just lines that are\nimportant in Go, but *life*, stable structures that are incapable of\nbeing completely surrounded and captured.  The problem is, recognizing\nlive groups of stones, and distinguishing them from dead groups is an\nextremely difficult problem.  To follow your idea, one type of network\ncould analyze life/death, and feed that analysis into another network\nthat makes game play decisions.\n\n&gt; Is this the paper investigating node/connection deletion mutations? \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; Is it available yet?\n\nNo. :)  We&#39;ve finished it and submitted it to GECCO, but haven&#39;t heard\nback from them yet.  When we do, we&#39;ll post it to the group.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
