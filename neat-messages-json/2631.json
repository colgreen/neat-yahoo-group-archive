So if you get a novel game and right \n&gt;away need to play it with no prior experience, how can an \n&gt;evolutionary system be prepared for that?  Are you trying to evolve \n&gt;a single neural network that can play any game?  I&#39;m still unclear \n&gt;how this can be accomplished.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nKen,\n\nI suppose one answer to this is to use rtNEAT to evolve players \nalongside the main player/game. It should/might be possible to do this \nbecause I undertstand you are handed a file that defines how to play the \ngame. Sounds like some serious (e.g. parallel) CPU would be required to \nevolve good enough players in the time frame of a game, you are also \nmore likely to make stupid moves early on in a game, and this t could \nscupper your chances of doing well.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
