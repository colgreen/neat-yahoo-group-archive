E.g. the net is \ninherently able to average between input values, which is not part of the \nproblem domain (in this exact case, I know you want it elsewhere).  This \nmay mean that in each generation, there are quite a lot of coincidentally \ngood values (e.g. where an average drawn from irrelevant input cells \nhappens to match a desired result).  How about testing in this way:\n\nFor each coordinate:\n         Set that input to Rand1\n         Set all other inputs to Rand2\n\n         Test...\n\n         Set that input to Rand3\n         Set all other inputs to Rand4\n\n         Test...\nNext\n\nThat way it&#39;s _only_ way to get the correct answer is to go looking in the \ncorrect cell...\n\nJust a thought.\n\nOTOH, maybe you have a subtle bug, or may you just need to wait longer (and \nlonger, and longer...).\n\nDon&#39;t get disheartened, you&#39;ll get there eventually!\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\nAt 16:05 09/09/2004, you wrote:\n&gt;Well, I&#39;m still trying to evolve a solution to that 3x3 multiplexer.\n&gt;Almost 236,000 generations, but only 1735 distinct topological\n&gt;variations tried and optimized so far.
