In other words, if it asks to zoom, make it zoom a little\n&gt;&gt; more or a little less than it asked (i.e. add some noise).  If it\n&gt;&gt; asks to rotate, have a probability of slight over or under\n&gt;&gt; rotation.  Faustino Gomez from our group has shown that model noise\n&gt;&gt; (noise added to actions) is more effective than noise added to\n&gt;&gt; sensors.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s interesting, but counterintuitive.  Wouldn&#39;t that be like\n&gt; purposely degrading the motor skills of a baby that&#39;s trying to learn\n&gt; to walk?\n\nIn a sense yes, but the benefit then is a more robust walking pattern. \nOne way to think about it is that by adding noise, you&#39;re forcing the \nnetwork to learn a more general function instead of allowing it to get \naway with the  &quot;simplest possible controller for the test patterns&quot; \nstrategy. It is somewhat counterintuitive, however its precisely the \nsame thing as, e.g. the mutation operator in genetic search.\n\nKen: by the way that experiment sounds really interesting. Has Tino \npublished a paper on it yet?\n\nJoe\n\n\n"}}
