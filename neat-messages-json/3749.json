So it&#39;s not unreasonable\n&gt;  to conclude they don&#39;t have a lot to say on the subject that is\n&gt;  particularly groundbreaking.\n[...]\n&gt;  Most people at GECCO who I spoke to after the debate echoed the\n&gt;  sentiment that they hadn&#39;t really learned much, and in fact, had\n&gt;  heard deeper insights on evolution and complexity during GDS-track\n&gt;  (Generative and Developmental Systems, a track at GECCO) paper talks\n&gt;  than during the keynote event.\n\nI&#39;d agree with that. It seemed like they thought they were addressing\nthe general public - the way they were explaining some fairly basic\nconcepts, stuff that anyone at GECCO would already know inside out.\n\nNow I know these guys do field questions from Joe Public (JP) from\ntime to time (Dawkins expecially) and have to explain and argue for\nevolution over and over, and I imagine it gets a bit tiring (I\npersonally always avoid any such discussion with JP because I know\nthat most often I&#39;ll just get annoyed), and it must be easy to slip\ninto default &#39;defensive&#39; mode when in fact that wasn&#39;t necessary.\n\nAnyway it seemed to me that some of these questions were being asked\nto get a deeper response (as might be expected from such a crowd) but\nthat they were interpreted as coming from JP and that the panel got\nthe wrong end of the stick and a little defensive at times. E.g. When\nWolpert curtly dismissed Lamarckism - well no-one there was actually\nsuggesting Lamarckism as an alternative to Darwinian evolution. I am\nglad they were aware of recent work on epigenetics though - I was\nbeginning to wonder if they had read any recent works.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
