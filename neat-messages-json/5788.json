The one thing that&#39;s a little trickier is gettin=\r\ng\nhidden nodes directly at the boundaries (e.g. x=3D-1), because the locati=\r\non\nof a new hidden node is determined by the center of quadtree square. The=\r\n\ninitial square used for the quadtree extraction\nnormally spans the space f=\r\nrom (-1, -1) to (1, 1), so similarly to what you\nsuggested you could have a=\r\nn initial square that e.g. spans the space from\n(-1.2, -1.2)  to (1.2, 1.2)=\r\n. This way you could have hidden nodes expressed\ncloser to e.g. x=3D-1. How=\r\never, I&#39;m not sure how important it is to be able\nto express hidden nodes a=\r\nt exactly those locations and I believe it\nprobably doesn&#39;t hurt the algori=\r\nthm that the hidden node might be expressed\nat a slightly different locatio=\r\nn (e.g. -0.9).\n\nOne thing that would be different from previously published=\r\n ES-HyperNEAT\nexperiments with a domain like Go is that you have a grid-lik=\r\ne setup of\ninput nodes instead of having inputs in a horizontal line (e.g. =\r\nat y=3D-1). A\ntypical setup for HyperNEAT for these kind of domains uses mu=\r\nltiple\ndifferent two-dimensional layers of neurons. An example can be found=\r\n in\nthis paper: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/gauci_ppsn10.pdf (figure 1)\n=\r\n\nFor ES-HyperNEAT it would probably make sense to give the CPPN an\naddition=\r\nal input (instead of an additional output as in the HyperNEAT\npaper), which=\r\n would determine if you query connections from the input to\nthe hidden laye=\r\nr or from the hidden layer to the output layer. This way the\nES-HyperNEAT a=\r\nlgorithm could just be applied to the one weight output\npattern, as in the =\r\npreviously published experiments.\n\nPlease let me know if this helps or if y=\r\nou have any other questions about\nES-HyperNEAT. We will also release an upd=\r\nated version of ES-HyperNEAT\nimplemented in C# soon.\n\nSebastian\n\nOn Wed, Ap=\r\nr 11, 2012 at 12:29 AM, wilsontg80 &lt;wilsontg@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; On second thought, if I&#39;m evolving a 5x5 board evaluator and treat it as\n=\r\n&gt; if it is 7x7, then band pruning will remove the excess edge nodes without=\r\n\n&gt; automatically clobbering the 5x5 edge nodes.
