From your explanation I would say that this same effect\n&gt;could be achieved with a recursive connection from a neuron&#39;s output\n&gt;back into its input. So from that perspective you could say that NEAT as\n&gt;it stands can represent this type of functionality through its topology\n&gt;searching propoperties. However, relying on topology searching to find\n&gt;solutions might not be as effective as actually defining a leaky\n&gt;integrater neuron directly. This comes back to our previous [brief]\n&gt;discussion regarding implementing different types of neuron and\n&gt;activation function - which I hope to look into soon.\n\nExcept after I suggest this, it occurred to me that completely standard \nneurones would put unwanted sigmoids onto the definition.  e.g. taking your \nidea of a single feedback connection within a single node we would have:\n\n\n          var&#39; = sigmoid(var * f + weighted_sum(input));\n\nRather than:\n\n          var&#39; = var * f + weighted_sum(input);\n\n[[var * f is the effect of the feedback connection, obviously one would \nnormally just regard this as part of the weighted sum over inputs but I&#39;m \nwritting it separately so we can see it :) ]]\n\nWhich brings us back to the point we had briefly some months ago, where \nsome equations fit reasonably nicely into an ANN framework, but because \nthey depend so heavily on the linear portion of of the sigmoids, their \nweights are constrained so much that it is almost impossible to evolve \nthem.  Remember when we discusses whether one could evolve networks for A + \nB or A * B using sigmoidal neurones?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/ - evolution for the desktop\n\n\n\n"}}
