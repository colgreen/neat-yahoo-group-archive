Yet trade-offs always seem to emerge when =\r\nwe try to bestow such capabilities explicitly.  For example, if we added mu=\r\nltiplication, it may theoretically allow certain key computations to be rep=\r\nresented easily, yet it also gives evolution a new power to more easily des=\r\ntroy what it has built through trivial mutations (because multiplication is=\r\n more powerful than summation).  \n\nI am sure that CPPNs as a representation=\r\nal formalism can be improved, yet the presence of these nagging trade-offs =\r\nmakes me think that the idea of a super-powerful representation is a false =\r\nideal.  It seems to me at this point that evolution in nature succeeds desp=\r\nite the limited nature of its representation rather than because DNA is som=\r\nehow near perfect.  I doubt that any set of operators or basis functions ca=\r\nn ever really be selected perfectly to best describe some of the complexiti=\r\nes of high-level cognition.   Rather, evolution seems to rely on a kind of =\r\nunrelenting persistence to drag itself higher despite the obstacle of a lim=\r\nited basis.  \n\nOf course, these thoughts don&#39;t contradict anything you said=\r\n.  The length input trick also shows that to some extent we can provide dra=\r\nmatic bias through a priori knowledge, which is a good thing (e.g. if it me=\r\nans skipping 10,000 years of evolution).\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Heh. Just playing with this as a=\r\nn inital test of sharpneat 2&#39;s\n&gt; hyperneat support. It takes a while to sol=\r\nve, and so, I provided a\n&gt; substrate connection length input to the CPPN as=\r\n explained in the\n&gt; relevant paper. Result? Problem solved perfectly by one=\r\n of the initial\n&gt; genomes!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have to say that this isn&#39;t entirely unex=\r\npected, I figured it was\n&gt; going to be a much simpler task.\n&gt; \n&gt; This leads=\r\n me back to a thought that&#39;s been rattling around my head\n&gt; for some years =\r\nnow, which is that although traditional ANNs with\n&gt; sigmoid activation func=\r\ntion /can/ approximate any function, in reality\n&gt; they&#39;re pretty bad at com=\r\nparison and multiplication - the two major\n&gt; operations required to calcula=\r\nte length (euclidean distance between\n&gt; two points).\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course none of=\r\n this invalidates the observation that hyperneat\n&gt; handles large arrays of =\r\ngeometrically arranged input and output nodes\n&gt; far better than NEAT. On th=\r\ne contrary, it very much reinforces that\n&gt; notion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
