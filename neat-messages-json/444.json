The inputs are current\nand last\n&gt; ball position (cartesian coordinates), robot position an rotation\n(for\n&gt; opponents too) and of course team players current wheel power. You\nmay also\n&gt; query field bounds to the simulator (and you may set a predicted\nball\n&gt; variable if you do the calculation yourself).\n&gt; \n\nOne thing to keep in mind about robots and robot simulators is that\ntheir inputs and outputs are not necessarily in a format that is\nnatural or useful to an NN.  In many cases, it is worth converting\nfrom the coordinate system of the robot to an alternative coordinate\nsystem that is better for an NN.\n\nFor example, we have found that having two outputs for two wheel\npowers is not the best format for a neural network to express\nmovements.  Rather, the best seems to be a single outputs for\nforward/back, and another for left/right.  So like this:\n\nOutput 1:\n-1            0                1\nBackward   Don&#39;t Move          Forward\n\nOutput 2:\n-1            0                1\nLeft          Forward          Right\n\nSo the move is a combination of the 2: move forward or backward\nand turn the requested angle.\n\nThis coordinate frame can easily be converted into the left\nmotor/right motor frame, so the right signals can be given to the\nrobot.\n\nSimilarly, cartesian coordinates are not necessarily the best.\n(Although you should try them to see if they do work)  But an\nalernative is to set up several radar sensors surrounding the\nrobot and let the radars light up if e.g. the ball is within\ntheir arc of sensitivity (the closer the higher the activation).  \nThis may be more natural for the NN than cartesian coordinates.  If\nthe simulator gives you cartesian coordinates, they can easily be\nconverted in the more natural radar sensor format.\n\nThese suggestions are not guaranteed to work best, but my main point\nis that you should try a variety of sensor/motor configurations and\nnot assume that just because the simulator offers a particular\nconfiguration that that is necessarily the best for the NN.\n\nken\n\n&gt; One of the main disadvantages for applying a neuroevolution\ntechnique with\n&gt; this simulator is that you can only run the simulator in real time\n(no\n&gt; offline fast non-graphic simulation available) so it should take a\nlong time\n&gt; and patience.\n&gt; \n\nThis limitation could be a serious problem, for example if you need to\nrun for hundreds or thousands of generations.  You may want to see if\nthere is some way to hack the system to turn off the graphics.\n\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
