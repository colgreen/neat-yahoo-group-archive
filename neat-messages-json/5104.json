Another top-tier AI \npublication for neuroevolution. You guys had better slow down. :)\n\nI&#39;m glad to see the results confirm the intuition that I think most \npeople had. The videos are also impressive (though the wmv&#39;s crashed my \nFirefox, maybe YouTube videos would be better?).\n\nAs a follow-up question, I wonder if additional dimensions would be \nuseful for evolving sensors that have to deal with multiple, distinct \ncategories of objects. A simple example would be a first-person shooter, \nwhere you have walls, enemies, teammates, and projectiles all at once. \nYou could separate these values via input activation levels, but would \nit make more sense to separate each class of object into a separate \nlocation in a new dimesion?\n\nCongrats again, and enjoy Toronto!\n\nWesley\n\nKen wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Our 2008 GECCO paper by David D&#39;Ambrosio and myself introduced the \n&gt; idea that a single HyperNEAT CPPN can encode a set of neural networks \n&gt; (instead of just one) that represent a pattern of policies for an \n&gt; entire team. Since then a few people have asked about the way we laid \n&gt; out the team on the substrate and whether alternatives might be better.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am happy to announce, with my co-authors David D&#39;Ambrosio, Joel \n&gt; Lehman, and Sebastian Risi, that we have extensively tested such an \n&gt; alternative z-axis-based encoding and published the results to appear \n&gt; in AAMAS 2010, available here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html \n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/dambrosio.aamas10.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Direct Link: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf \n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_aamas10.pdf&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We believe this z-based substrate layout is superior to the previous \n&gt; one, particularly for scaling the size of the team, and should open up \n&gt; the field of multiagent learning further to HyperNEAT. The paper also \n&gt; includes the first published results on scaling the size of the team \n&gt; without further training, which works because HyperNEAT can \n&gt; interpolate new policies for ANNs inserted along the z axis of the \n&gt; substrate.\n&gt;\n&gt; Videos that accompany the paper are here:\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/mahnaamas2010.html \n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/mahnaamas2010.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
