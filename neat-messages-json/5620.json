You raise several good suggestions and the broad=\r\ner idea of some kind of neuroevolution web service is also intriguing.  It =\r\ndoes seem that the field will gradually move towards greater public accessi=\r\nbility.  I agree that we cannot measure all our pursuits directly by whethe=\r\nr they will lead to a human brain and hence that some intermediate mileston=\r\nes are important.  On the other hand, as in novelty search, the impetus for=\r\n some advances will be from how they diverge from past conventions as oppos=\r\ned to how they facilitate future goals.   So to really smooth out this spac=\r\ne will require appreciating interesting ideas in their own right rather tha=\r\nn only for what they clearly facilitate in the here and now.  Nevertheless,=\r\n achieving some killer applications is always good for the field, if for no=\r\n other reason than diverting resources and support our way.\n\nRegarding inno=\r\nvative representation, there is clearly room for playing with representatio=\r\nns in body-brain evolution, such as in the work of Bongard and Auerbach:\n\nh=\r\nttp://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jauerbac/publications/auerbach_bongard_gecco_2011.pdf=\r\n\n\nThe field of evolutionary robotics in general also can benefit from innov=\r\nations in representation, both in morphology and in neural networks alone. =\r\n Natural brains control bodies and robots today move with nothing like the =\r\nelegance of natural organisms, hinting at a big near-term opportunity.\n\nken=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the detailed response.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I may summarize your point=\r\ns, it seems in essence you see a few areas ripe\n&gt; for exploration:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. =\r\nCrowd-sourced evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Games, either for opponent AI or some othe=\r\nr component such as weapons in\n&gt; GAR.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. New representational enhancem=\r\nents.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe these insights touch on a lot of the potential for NE =\r\nin the next\n&gt; decade.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll note two caveats to your points. First, I w=\r\nould certainly not limit the\n&gt; modern applications of AI in the big-data/ma=\r\nny-users internet to simply\n&gt; translation and recommender systems. In fact,=\r\n I would contend that a main\n&gt; area of application is in sentiment analysis=\r\n on social networks like\n&gt; Facebook and Twitter. For instance, the guys at =\r\nDataminr gave an interesting\n&gt; talk at the Twitter developer conference whe=\r\nre they showed how their system\n&gt; knew (and was able to alert oil traders) =\r\nthat Osama bin Laden had been\n&gt; killed 20 minutes before any news organizat=\r\nion had reported it or the market\n&gt; had absorbed it. Understanding what peo=\r\nple are saying collectively in order\n&gt; to make inferences about changes in =\r\nthe state of the world is quite powerful\n&gt; and revolutionary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, =\r\nwhile I do appreciate the ultimate goal of evolving brains, I think\n&gt; it&#39;s =\r\ncrucial to ensure the smoothness of the landscape that NE research is\n&gt; exp=\r\nloring. If human brains are a global optimum (or at least a local one\n&gt; muc=\r\nh higher than we currently have discovered), we are unlikely to discover\n&gt; =\r\nit unless there is some gradually increasing path of rewards that leads us\n=\r\n&gt; there. Scientific curiosity aside, one of the most rewarding reasons for\n=\r\n&gt; pursuing this goal is the power an artificial brain has to better the wor=\r\nld\n&gt; by being integrated into large-scale systems. Thus, as modern systems\n=\r\n&gt; progressively grow more complex, it&#39;s important that we understand how to=\r\n\n&gt; leverage the increase in information and ability, otherwise we may be\n&gt; =\r\nunnecessarily limiting ourselves to a spikey landscape.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do agree on =\r\nthe fundamental insights about interactive evolution being a\n&gt; largely unta=\r\npped opportunity. Here are a few ideas I came up with this\n&gt; morning that m=\r\nay be interesting and relevant:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Instagram meets Picbreeder: Interac=\r\ntive evolution of image filters.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Turntable.fm meets FSMC: Bringing =\r\ninteractive music evolution to a social\n&gt; setting. Enabling people to DJ th=\r\neir custom music or create it with a group.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Readability/Diffbot via=\r\n HyperNEAT: Looking at a webpage and identifying\n&gt; the article text (as opp=\r\nosed to ads, menus, etc.) seems very similar to the\n&gt; box discrimination ta=\r\nsk.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a more grandiose application: a commodity-style web service lay=\r\ner,\n&gt; similar to Amazon&#39;s AWS (EC2 hosting, S3 storage, etc), could be crea=\r\nted\n&gt; around the algorithms to foster more wide-scale adoption. Right now w=\r\ne\n&gt; basically have the situation where thousands of developers are taking\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Machine Learning&quot; courses to learn how to use map-reduce to create basic\n=\r\n&gt; correlation models and classifiers on big data. There is no real API\n&gt; so=\r\nlution for reinforcement learning without requiring the user to understand\n=\r\n&gt; the difference between two esoteric algorithms. Google has started enteri=\r\nng\n&gt; this area with the Prediction API, but it focuses mostly on recommenda=\r\ntions\n&gt; and translation. A big advantage for NE as a service may be in area=\r\ns such as\n&gt; mobile development, where battery life and computing power cons=\r\ntraints make\n&gt; simulated evolution impractical, but evaluating a candidate =\r\nmodel is\n&gt; feasible. Separately, if we are to reach millions of connections=\r\n then a\n&gt; large-scale infrastructure will likely be required.\n&gt; \n&gt; New repr=\r\nesentations are interesting and it&#39;s an area I hadn&#39;t considered.\n&gt; Are the=\r\nre any specific kinds of representation improvements you had in mind?\n&gt; Wha=\r\nt kind of applications do you see as currently out of reach for NE that\n&gt; m=\r\nay be opened by an innovative representation?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun=\r\n, Jul 3, 2011 at 7:13 AM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Wesley, that&#39;s an interesting discussion topic. My take is that N=\r\nE can\n&gt; &gt; play a constructive role in this big-data/many-users type of worl=\r\nd. Or\n&gt; &gt; perhaps it might be more accurate to say that big-data/many-users=\r\n can play a\n&gt; &gt; constructive role in NE. In any case, I think we&#39;re already=\r\n seeing examples\n&gt; &gt; of this potential synergy in the form of crowd-sourced=\r\n evolution. These\n&gt; &gt; examples include Picbreeder, Galactic Arms Race, and =\r\nEndlessForms. While\n&gt; &gt; these examples do not rival the impact of something=\r\n like big data in\n&gt; &gt; language translation, when you consider the resources=\r\n/funding invested in\n&gt; &gt; something like Google, Picbreeder gets a lot of ba=\r\nng for its buck and really\n&gt; &gt; does leverage crowds in a unique way. The 8,=\r\n000+ image phylogeny on\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder is a great collection of evolutionar=\r\ny data whose study can lead\n&gt; &gt; to further innovations. In fact, novelty se=\r\narch was invented based on\n&gt; &gt; observations of the process of discovery on =\r\nPicbreeder. There is more to be\n&gt; &gt; found there still, and crowd-so! urced =\r\nevolution remains a wide-open area\n&gt; &gt; with all kinds of unrealized possibi=\r\nlities\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; GAR also shows that it can be implicit, so users don&#39;t even =\r\nhave to know\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s going on. In a few days I&#39;m actually heading off to=\r\n an invited\n&gt; &gt; workshop on &quot;crowd sourcing of research&quot; and &quot;scientific di=\r\nscovery games,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; where NE is standing alongside the various innovative i=\r\ndeas in crowdsourcing\n&gt; &gt; of recent years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still, Ghulam makes the =\r\npoint that &quot;big data&quot; perhaps is still a challenge\n&gt; &gt; when we&#39;re talking a=\r\nbout something like having many inputs into a neural\n&gt; &gt; network. That&#39;s a =\r\ndifferent issue for NE, but NE is taking steps in that\n&gt; &gt; direction with m=\r\nethods like HyperNEAT that don&#39;t really care how many inputs\n&gt; &gt; you give t=\r\nhem. We still face a challenge in the massive CPU utilization that\n&gt; &gt; evol=\r\nving populations of multimillion-connection networks requires, but\n&gt; &gt; perh=\r\naps the networked world offers or will offer novel opportunities for\n&gt; &gt; pa=\r\nrallelization that can address the voracious need for CPU cycles in NE.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; At the same time, while it&#39;s true that there has been radical progress=\r\n in\n&gt; &gt; e.g. foreign language translation, the promise of big data is somet=\r\nimes\n&gt; &gt; over-hyped. For example, my Amazon recommendations are as uninspir=\r\ning as\n&gt; &gt; they were 10 years ago. And the stuff Netflix suggests that I wi=\r\nll like is\n&gt; &gt; usually somewhere between obvious and hilarious. Data-mining=\r\n at its most\n&gt; &gt; grandiose rests on a kind of faith that there is some secr=\r\net &quot;truth&quot; hiding\n&gt; &gt; deep in the masses of data that will reveal something=\r\n so subtle about me and\n&gt; &gt; you (and humanity) that we never even knew it. =\r\nWhile I&#39;m sure that buying\n&gt; &gt; habits are helpful to analyze for companies =\r\nat the margins, it&#39;s unclear\n&gt; &gt; that it is always an AI revolution. It&#39;s t=\r\nrue there are 700M Facebook users,\n&gt; &gt; but you might look at that as a comm=\r\nercial opportunity more than an AI\n&gt; &gt; opportunity (crowd-sourced evolution=\r\n and a few other application excepted).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, let&#39;s not forget=\r\n that one of the inspirations for NE is the\n&gt; &gt; evolution of brains, which =\r\npredated all these buzzwords by millions of\n&gt; &gt; years. To some extent, the =\r\npromise of NE is thus independent of the modern\n&gt; &gt; world even as it is rea=\r\nlized within it. If we could learn to evolve brains,\n&gt; &gt; it won&#39;t be a ques=\r\ntion of how we fit in with the technologies of today, but\n&gt; &gt; how they fit =\r\nin with us. Of course, that is more at a Holy Grail level, but\n&gt; &gt; still im=\r\nportant to keep in mind as we watch modern technology evolve.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, I don&#39;t want to dismiss the idea that all these things can\n&gt; &gt; synergiz=\r\ne, because they can. Like I said crowd-sourcing is a huge untapped\n&gt; &gt; oppo=\r\nrtunity for NE and the commercial opportunities presented by the modern\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n world (e.g. with millions of users and mobile devices) are exciting in the=\r\nir\n&gt; &gt; own right, regardless of their centrality to AI. We are definitely g=\r\noing to\n&gt; &gt; see NE exploiting these opportunities. As NE methods improve, t=\r\nhe potential\n&gt; &gt; for them to be commercially relevant increases. For exampl=\r\ne, improvements in\n&gt; &gt; representation open up whole new applications, like =\r\nour work in music\n&gt; &gt; evolution. NE has the current disadvantage of signifi=\r\ncantly less investment\n&gt; &gt; compared to other AI technologies, but it has th=\r\ne advantage of the element\n&gt; &gt; of surprise.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to start a discussion on where NE fits into the modern w=\r\norld.\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; begun entering the age of &quot;Big Data&quot;-- 200M tweets/da=\r\ny, 700M Facebook\n&gt; &gt; users,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. We&#39;re also finding ourselves more im=\r\nmersed in computing technology\n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mobile phones become more ubiqu=\r\nitous.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in your thoughts.
