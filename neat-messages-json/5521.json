Considerably\n\nmore organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive=\r\n - so the natural\n\nworld does try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for=\r\n one\n\ngeneration at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring with variations on\n=\r\n\nthose poor strategies in the hope of finding something better. What\n\ndoes =\r\nhappen though is that stragies are so complex (for creatures with\n\nlarge br=\r\nains anyway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find\n\nfood) and ye=\r\nt waste much time on poor sub-strategies (effectively\n\nstragey efficiency).=\r\n Evolution will select for efficiency but unlike\n\nsurvival it&#39;s not a binar=\r\ny yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so\n\nmore like the small low scorin=\r\ng species in NEAT (from fitness\n\nsharing).\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s perhaps those poor side =\r\nstrategies that fit your idea of\n\nsearching with no objective, they piggy b=\r\nack on for the ride and very\n\noccasionally become useful. Where EC tends to=\r\n fall short IMO is that\n\nthe domain complexity is vastly lower than the nat=\r\nural world so\n\nthere&#39;s less opportunty for exploring variations in strategy=\r\n -\n\nbranching off into multiple successful branches and sub-branches\n\nwitho=\r\nut a major loss in fitness on the objective. Put another way, the\n\nnatural =\r\nworld&#39;s fitness landscape is dominated by smooth undulations\n\nin all dimens=\r\nions, whereas EC objectives tend to have a few\n\nsharp/steep local maxima.\n\n=\r\n\n\nNature also provides a gentle selection pressure towards complex\n\nstrateg=\r\nies by providing resources that require increasingly complex\n\nstrategies to=\r\n reach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evolve\n\nlegs ang lungs. =\r\nAnd you can&#39;t eat those omnivores without evolving\n\ngood eyes and fast/stro=\r\nng muscles, etc. but the plants and meat were\n\nthere as an untapped resourc=\r\ne until that first legged creature and\n\nfirst carnivore came along.
