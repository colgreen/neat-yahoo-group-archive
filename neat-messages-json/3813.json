I am \nnot sure =\r\nthough where publications on it are freely available.  \nHopefully he will p=\r\nrovide his publication to Derek.\n\nNEON is a fairly complicated indirect enc=\r\noding that collapses into \nsomething very similar to regular NEAT if some p=\r\narts of it are \nremoved.  Many of the experiments are in fact in effect exp=\r\neriments \nwith NEAT, and some are interesting because they extensively stud=\r\ny \nthe effects of specific aspects of NEAT like speciation.  \n\nHowever, the=\r\n indirect encoding part is more difficult to understand \nor interpret, and =\r\nI am guessing that Benjamin Inden will continue to \nmodify his ideas for in=\r\ndirect encoding in NEON over time.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Col=\r\nin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, Does anyone know anything about th=\r\nis:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Stepwise Transition from Direct Encoding to Artificial Ontogeny i=\r\nn\n&gt; Neuroevolution&quot;\n&gt; http://www.springerlink.com/content/52272p730177r470/=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------\n&gt; Benjamin Inden\n&gt; (1)  \tMax Planck Institute for =\r\nMathematics in the Sciences,\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract\n&gt; There is a gap between neuroev=\r\nolution systems employing artificial\n&gt; ontogeny and those being able to sol=\r\nve difficult control tasks.
