Right now though I&#39;m  \nwriting-up my experiments with phased searching, which should be ready \nany day now. I plan to publish it (on the web sthat is) along with a new \nrelease of SharpNEAT with the Tic-Tac-Toe, OCR, Cross Prodct and \nMultiplication experiments and of course phased searching support, \nphew!  Although I need to re-do the experimental runs I did for phased \nsearching before publishing, so it might be towards the end of the week.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
