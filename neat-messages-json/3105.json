I tried to develop th=\r\ne code as \nflexibly as possible and the result allows control over the maze=\r\ns, \ncharacter positions, graphics, etc.  I think it is reasonably \nflexible=\r\n enough for some interesting experiments.  These details as \nwell as NEAT p=\r\narameters are controlled through a parameter file.\n\nCurrently, the inputs t=\r\no the net are defined as a window centered on \nPacMan and extending 6 tiles=\r\n in each direction.  The result is a \n13x13 window within which there are i=\r\nndependent inputs for walls, \ndots, empty space, and ghosts of various flav=\r\nors.  There&#39;s also an \nexample (WMV) of the best run I&#39;ve seen thus far usi=\r\nng this scheme.\n\nPlease head over to SourceForge and give it a run.  If you=\r\n have any \nproblems, post in the Forums at SourceForge.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n\n"}}
