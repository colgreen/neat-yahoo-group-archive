Thanks for the explanation.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo problem.\n\n&gt;Your changes sound pretty sensible, too.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I think we&#39;re all agreed then :)\n\n&gt;I was just surprised at the extremely large difference in the\n&gt;progression of fitness in the different complexifying/blended/phased\n&gt;runs.  From our experience so far, NEAT has proven to be fairly robust\n&gt;and consistent given changes in parameters and implementation\n&gt;specifics.\n&gt;\n&gt;That is, from day one of working with NEAT, we&#39;ve only ever seen\n&gt;upward-moving fitness graphs.  Some are flatter than others, but we&#39;ve\n&gt;never seen the fitness spike and then plunge.  That seemed like an\n&gt;extremely odd dynamic for any kind of NEAT run.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think John Arrowwood&#39;s experiments tended to produce this sort of \nfitness drop-off, but I think I&#39;m right in saying that he is using a \nhighly customised implementation of NEAT.\n\n&gt;Part of your explanation of the dynamics centered on whether or not\n&gt;the fitness evaluation was deterministic or not.  Per some of the\n&gt;\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s determinism per se. If you have very few discrete \nfitness values then you&#39;re more likely to see two genomes with the same \nfitness during crossover. In contrast consider some like a \nmultiplication experiment where the fitness is deterministic, but has a \ncontinuous range of values, so two values are unlikely to be exactly the \nsame, very similar perhaps, but not equal.\n\n&gt;discussions about adding randomness or noise to the evaluation, this\n&gt;seems like an important thing to do in almost any domain.  In pattern\n&gt;recognition, if the fitness evaluation is deterministic, it seems to\n&gt;me that the networks are much more prone to overfitting to the\n&gt;training set and are going to be extremely brittle (this aside from\n&gt;the fact that your crossover function is based on whether or not the\n&gt;networks have equal fitnesses).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIts a balance. Too few test cases and you get overfitting, the ideal \nsolution to this problem is a very large set of test cases, which would \nstill be deterministic. Unfortunately this makes for a very slow search, \nso [the way I see it] we can still use a very large set of test cases \nbut just use a small proportion of them in each evaluation - at which \npoint the fitness becomes non-determinstic.\n\nBut yes I agree with what you&#39;re saying, which is why I tried to \nemphasise in my write-up that the experiment was a pattern \nclassification experiment, and not really proper OCR.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
