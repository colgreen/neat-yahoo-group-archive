Ken, in your XOR \ncode you seem to be calculating a depth value for a network, you then \nexecute &#39;depth&#39; number of timesteps to allow input signals chance to \npropagate to the output nodes, right? This solves the oscillation \nproblem, but the depth calculation sounds potentially CPU intensive - \nit&#39;s essentially the same algorithm that is required for determining \nnode layers which we were discussing on the list just recently. I&#39;ll \nlook into how you&#39;re detecting recurrency and have a think about this, I \nthink it&#39;s going to be a case of defining 2 or 3 relaxation techniques \nand picking the one best suited for a given domain. Right now my domains \n(all 2 of them) use a fixed number of timesteps that I guess at based \nupon how big a network is required to solve the task...which partly \ndefeats the purpose of neat!\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
