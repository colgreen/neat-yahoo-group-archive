That would certainly answer some questions.  I am\ngoing to see =\r\nif we can get that working soon.  \n\nIn any case, part of the theory behind =\r\nCPPNs is that they should end\nup being more compact representations than ce=\r\nllular growth models. \nOne reason is that growth models must deal with role=\r\n differentiation\nwithout explicit coordinates.  Therefore, they need to est=\r\nablish a\nsystem of signaling that fills the same purpose, which would then\n=\r\nrequire more information to encode than simply encoding the shape\nitself.  =\r\nAlong these lines, I have rarely seen a cellular growth model\nproduce anyth=\r\ning more than a blob or an amorphous shape without clear\nparts.  However, o=\r\nf course, more rigorous comparisons would certainly\nbe interesting.  \n\nAbou=\r\nt the skin issue, in what sense do you think first motifs of skin\nwould &quot;fa=\r\nil?&quot;  It seems that the main problem is really to design a\nworld in which s=\r\nkin is useful.  If it was anything like the real\nworld, it would allow for =\r\na large diversity of body covers that could\nrange from simple cell walls to=\r\n full-fledged human skin, which would\nallow a gradual complexification of t=\r\nhe skin motif.  But barring a\nsimulation of all of physics, what would skin=\r\n be for?\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_che=\r\nrvenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with Ken that regularities ar=\r\ne preserved and elaborated \n&gt; during evolution (actually in the case of com=\r\nplexification). But \n&gt; there is another question. Can we compare the genoty=\r\npe complexity for \n&gt; both models, what if the CPPN encodes a very complex f=\r\nunction with \n&gt; many dimentions and the other method that produces the same=\r\n results \n&gt; has less genes? I don&#39;t see any info about genotype complexity =\r\non \n&gt; Picbreeder. And because most of the interesting pictures have very \n&gt;=\r\n long lineages, probably the mutation rates are high too, it is \n&gt; possible=\r\n that these examples have very complex genomes. More complex \n&gt; than it cou=\r\nld be done with another method, cellurar growth for \n&gt; example. Consider th=\r\ne square shape that Robert evolved. For a human&#39;s \n&gt; perception it is very =\r\nsimple but there may be about hundreds of \n&gt; connections in the CPPN. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n By the way we should make difference between CPPN output images, when \n&gt; w=\r\ne concern *bodies*. Because in the physics sense, a CPPN can easily \n&gt; crea=\r\nte hundreds of separate objects in one snapshot. There is a \n&gt; difference b=\r\netween the raw CPPN snapshot and a physical body in the \n&gt; sense we want it=\r\n to be. If I say &quot;here is an apple&quot; I usually mean \n&gt; one object. But a CPP=\r\nN with structure capturing a repetition \n&gt; regularity can make infinite num=\r\nber of apples. \n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing I&#39;d like to discuss is how does it fit i=\r\nnto the fitness \n&gt; search. Suppose we need to evolve a &quot;creature&quot; with a sk=\r\nin preserving \n&gt; the inner body intact. I really believe that all first mot=\r\nifs of skin \n&gt; will fail. But on the other hand, Novelty Search would searc=\r\nh too \n&gt; vast space before it ever finds the right motif. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; J=\r\neff, that&#39;s a good thought experiment for testing my claim.  There\n&gt; &gt; are =\r\nmany considerations, and although I may not hit all of them, I\n&gt; &gt; think in=\r\n general it can be refuted:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Generally, I think HyperNEAT (i.e. NEA=\r\nT with CPPNs) already\n&gt; &gt; approximately follow the scenario that you outlin=\r\ne:  It discovers \n&gt; key\n&gt; &gt; motifs (whether they be skin or something else)=\r\n early in evolution \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; then as the overall body plan is deformed, t=\r\nhe original motifs are\n&gt; &gt; often preserved (which again includes skin).  Th=\r\ne main idea is that\n&gt; &gt; skin is like a kind of surrounding motif for the ov=\r\nerall shape, and \n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; the pverall shape is warped through some kind of=\r\n mutation in the\n&gt; &gt; internal CPPN, then however the shape is surrounded wi=\r\nll naturally\n&gt; &gt; warp in the same way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, you can see this h=\r\nappen consistently in Picbreeder.  It is\n&gt; &gt; possible to consider the simpl=\r\ne black outline of many of the color\n&gt; &gt; figures as a &quot;skin.&quot;  You can noti=\r\nce that it is special by noting \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; often the outer band is black b=\r\nut everything structure inside is\n&gt; &gt; color.  Then, if the shape of the ove=\r\nrall image warps, so does the\n&gt; &gt; outer membrane.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, you mig=\r\nht say that such a &quot;skin&quot; is not complex enough to \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; convincing.  P=\r\nerhaps skin should have multiple parts, i.e. its own\n&gt; &gt; special structure.=\r\n  In fact, if you look closely, you can find many\n&gt; &gt; such examples.  For e=\r\nxample, there are often double-layer outer\n&gt; &gt; membranes that form, such as=\r\n in this image:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D=\r\n317\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a clear outer structure that surrounds the complex \n&gt;=\r\n curvature\n&gt; &gt; of the object.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or, perhaps more interestingly, you =\r\ncan get several layers of color\n&gt; &gt; bands, but only on the outer membrane, =\r\nsuch as in this image that \n&gt; ends\n&gt; &gt; in a light blue that becomes green, =\r\nthen becomes yellow, before\n&gt; &gt; sinking into the inner-body color of orange=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4227\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTo show that the outer membrane warps easily and naturally \n&gt; regardless\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of shape changes (even complex ones), I further evolved that image \n&gt; to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; get a new shape, and you can see that the outer membrane has the \n&gt; sam=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; motif nevertheless, nicely warped to accommodate the new overall \n&gt; s=\r\nhape:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D5635\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; It is also important to note that outer membranes in nature are not\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n uniform covers and often transition into something else on the\n&gt; &gt; surface=\r\n.  For example, consider lips and eyes.  Or perhaps even more\n&gt; &gt; important=\r\nly, consider fingernails, where the outer cover actually\n&gt; &gt; falls *under* =\r\nsomething else (i.e. the nail), violating the covering\n&gt; &gt; rule.  I point t=\r\nhese exceptions out because in Picbreeder you also\n&gt; &gt; often see almost con=\r\nsistent outer motifs that are broken in a couple\n&gt; &gt; places.  While these l=\r\nocations often are arbitrary, the point is \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; such a capability co=\r\nuld be exploited if it actually mattered.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moving from 2-D to 3-D s=\r\nhould not matter in the case of skin, just \n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; moving CPPNs from 2-D =\r\nto 4-D continues to allow all the same\n&gt; &gt; regularities.  So when you see e=\r\nxamples in 2-D, they are also \n&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; in 3-D for the same reasons.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of these outer skin motifs can arise early when the shape is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; simple and are then easily preserved.  However, they are not always\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n preserved.  For example, the multicolor skin above evolved into a\n&gt; &gt; diff=\r\nerent multicolor skin in one lineage:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.org/search=\r\n/showgenome.php?sid=3D4228\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This phenomenon is expected from the an=\r\nalogy with nature, just as\n&gt; &gt; scales can evolve into fur, or fur into unco=\r\nvered skin, all still\n&gt; &gt; serving the role of outer membrane.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I th=\r\nink it&#39;s important to note that skin or an outer membrane is not\n&gt; &gt; really=\r\n any different from any other CPPN-generated motif, in that it\n&gt; &gt; can be p=\r\nreserved, warped, or changed in its internal structure.  So \n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t =\r\nthink there is really anything special going on in the \n&gt; argument\n&gt; &gt; comp=\r\nared to the discovery of symmetry or other conventions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He=\r\nllo all-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ken has challenged us all many times to think about w=\r\nhether there \n&gt; is any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need for a process of development. The identit=\r\ny of cells in\n&gt; &gt; developmental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; processes is determined by local cont=\r\nextual information whereas \n&gt; Ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocates skipping that by letting =\r\ncells determine their identity\n&gt; &gt; via giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them their objective co=\r\nordinates. The question is whether we lose\n&gt; &gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important to =\r\nthe evolution of complexity by skipping this step.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it =\r\nis a fascinating question and, unable to come up with \n&gt; a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaso=\r\nn why development matters myself, but wanting to give the\n&gt; &gt; argument a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; rigorous evaluation, I have been asking many people in our field \n&gt; whe=\r\nther\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they can describe something unique that a developmental process\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; provides. No\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one has come up with  a reason that compels me, so I=\r\n have become a\n&gt; &gt; strong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocate of the lack of a need for an unfol=\r\nding process.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, in the course of watching a keynote on =\r\ndevelopment in \n&gt; natural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; systems at this year&#39;s gecco, an argument i=\r\nn favor of development\n&gt; &gt; occurred\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me that may have merit. I am i=\r\nnterested to hear what y&#39;all \n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The argument =\r\nis this: it might be easier to evolve certain large-\n&gt; scale\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properti=\r\nes when the organism is simple and small and then \n&gt; scale/grow\n&gt; &gt; them\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; up, rather than incorporating them into an already complex \n&gt; phenotype=\r\n. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think an example illustrates the point best. Imagine evolution\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; figuring out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how to put a coat of skin on an organism. It is not th=\r\nat hard to\n&gt; &gt; figure out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what the shape of that skin should be when =\r\nthe embryo has only a \n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; cells.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once that simple and small co=\r\nat of skin has formed, it can follow\n&gt; &gt; the simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule of keeping t=\r\nhe layer of skin the same thickness, and adding \n&gt; cells\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within that =\r\nlayer to grow to cover any arbitrary shape that the\n&gt; &gt; phenotype\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bec=\r\nomes. This simple rule could produce a skin shell for a bat or \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; jag=\r\nuar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now consider how hard it would be for 3D hyperneat to create a \n=\r\n&gt; skin\n&gt; &gt; shell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for a bat or a jaguar. The mathematical function to =\r\ncreate such\n&gt; &gt; outlines is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very complex (although it is less so if i=\r\nt is a composition of \n&gt; other,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already created functions that produc=\r\ned the rest of the body). \n&gt; Still, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems that this task might be =\r\nharder for hyperneat than following\n&gt; &gt; the simple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developmental rule=\r\ns outlined above.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think? I would happily be convin=\r\nced that this \n&gt; argument is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without merit, so please let me know if =\r\nyou see any problems with \n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeff Clu=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
