Thanks a lot :)\n\nOn another note, on the advice of Julian I visited the University of\nSussex (in Brighton) and applied to their MSc Evolutionary and\nAdaptive Systems programme.  I was very impressed with the staff,\nfacilities and the programme itself.  It seems like the logical next\nstep for someone who&#39;s interested in pursuing all the topics that Ken\nintends to focus on at UCF.  I was accepted several weeks ago and if\nno fantabulous job opportunities present themselves in the next two\nmonths then I&#39;ll probably end up heading off to Brighton in October. \nThis, of course, will all be in preparation for applying to UCF to do\na PhD under Ken and his newly formed crew of intellectual giants ;)\n\nAnyway, just wanted to say thanks and let everyone know that their\nadvice has helped me significantly in identifying the directions that\nI want my academic/professional career to go in.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n"}}
