In=\r\n this way, a CPPN can build \na pattern directly off the environment, and th=\r\nere is still no need \nfor actual development to take place.  The bridge is =\r\na function of \nthe environmental coordinate frame, and will thus shape itse=\r\nlf \nperfectly to fit the environmental context.\n\nIf the environment is chan=\r\nging, then CPPN(x,y,E) can be be applied \niteratively over time, either eve=\r\nry time step, or every time there \nis a change.  \n\nThus, all the advantages=\r\n of environmental interaction in \ndevelopmental systems are still potential=\r\nly subsumed by a functional \nperspective.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Alex&quot; &lt;marmakoide@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all\n&gt; \n&gt;   They are some good remar=\r\nks about developmental approaches. I&#39;am\n&gt; working on this approaches, I wil=\r\nl be also at Gecco in the\n&gt; developmental approaches track :D  Using develo=\r\npmental encodings to\n&gt; evolve flags is not the best ways to do flags : simp=\r\nly evolving f\n(x,\n&gt; y) =3D z is enougth, far simplier and have a much bette=\r\nr algorithmic\n&gt; complexity. \n&gt; \n&gt; But those developmental encodings are not=\r\n meant to be used to make\n&gt; flags and only flags. They can use environmenta=\r\nl information to\n&gt; provide a solution to a problem for differents contexts.=\r\n A\n&gt; developmental encoding could encode the building process of bridge,\n&gt; =\r\nand such an encoding could works for any river length and depth... \nOr\n&gt; we=\r\n can imagine that each &#39;cells&#39; of the embryo could have and\n&gt; information a=\r\n physical information, and then the embryo would \nconverge\n&gt; to an optimal =\r\nstructure. With a single evolution we could solve\n&gt; severals problems. That=\r\n&#39;s the real power of the embryogenic\n&gt; approaches. I spoke about &quot;convergen=\r\nce&quot; : that means that with an\n&gt; embryogenic approache, we simply defines th=\r\ne solution of problem \nthe\n&gt; fixed point of cells interaction. This converg=\r\nence, if the \nevolution\n&gt; worked well, could be achieved for a range of env=\r\nironmental\n&gt; conditions. Flags are only a benchmark. I&#39;am currently working=\r\n on a\n&gt; new problem to show a practical example of what I call &quot;the real \np=\r\nower\n&gt; of developmental encodings&quot;.

These are indeed critical and \n=\r\ndeep \n&gt; &gt; issues at the core of indirect encoding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to caref=\r\nully address them because I have been thinking \nabout \n&gt; &gt; these issues for=\r\n a long time and they are tied into the theory \n&gt; &gt; behind CPPNs.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; First, note that our new journal paper that I just \n&gt; &gt; announced, &quot;Compo=\r\nsitional Pattern Producing Networks: A Novel \n&gt; &gt; Abstraction of Developmen=\r\nt,&quot; gives an extensive treatment of the \n&gt; &gt; issues you raise in a better w=\r\nay than the old &quot;Patterns Without \n&gt; &gt; Development.&quot;  (The journal paper ha=\r\ns replaced &quot;Patterns Without \n&gt; &gt; Development,&quot; which is no longer availabl=\r\ne)  So you may find a \n&gt; &gt; better motivation in that paper.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any=\r\n case, I will give my thoughts here in short.  I have come \nto \n&gt; &gt; the con=\r\nclusion after thinking about this issue for a couple \nyears \n&gt; &gt; that there=\r\n may be no representational or even computational \n&gt; &gt; advantage to iterate=\r\nd developmental systems over CPPN-like \n&gt; &gt; functional representation.  I s=\r\nay &quot;may&quot; because I am not yet \n100% \n&gt; &gt; certain, but I am nearing it.  If =\r\nI am right, this is a very \ndeep \n&gt; &gt; and significant fact that should chan=\r\nge the way we are looking \nat \n&gt; &gt; representation through development.  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are a few reasons for this view.  One is the simple \n&gt; &gt; theor=\r\netical fact that a single hidden layer neural network can \n&gt; &gt; represent an=\r\ny function with arbitrary accuracy (a theorem by \n&gt; &gt; Cybenko).  From the p=\r\nerspective of patterns, this theorem means \nthat \n&gt; &gt; *theoretically*, ther=\r\ne is no pattern that iterative development \ncan \n&gt; &gt; produce that a functio=\r\nnal description cannot describe with \n&gt; &gt; arbitrarily close precision.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Of course, that is only theory, and theory and practice are \noften \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; opposed:  It still leaves open the possibility that somehow \n&gt; &gt; represen=\r\ntations of certain patterns are for some reason more \n&gt; &gt; *compact* if they=\r\n are described and mapped through an iterative \n&gt; &gt; process.  Thus one can =\r\nstill argue they are more powerful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet I also have come to believ=\r\ne that that is not the case \neither.  \n&gt; &gt; The reason hinges on an interest=\r\ning insight that you put like \nthis:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;genes essentially &#39;pattern r=\r\necognize&#39; certain areas in the  \n&gt; &gt; organism&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is absolutely =\r\ncorrect for biological organisms, and for \n&gt; &gt; iterated developmental syste=\r\nms in general.  However, the deep \n&gt; &gt; question is *why* should they need t=\r\no &quot;pattern recognize&quot; \ncertain \n&gt; &gt; areas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And the answer is becau=\r\nse they need to know where they are.  In \n&gt; &gt; effect, in the physical unive=\r\nrse, there is no intrinsic \ncoordinate \n&gt; &gt; system that cells can query to =\r\nask their location.  Thus, they \nmust \n&gt; &gt; develop elaborate and ad hoc way=\r\ns of communicating to each \nother, as \n&gt; &gt; a group, where everyone is.  I s=\r\nend my neighbor signals, my \nneighbor \n&gt; &gt; sends me signals back, and we ne=\r\ngotiate our roles. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My undoubtedly controversial contention is tha=\r\nt the \nquestion &quot;where \n&gt; &gt; am I?&quot; is the ONLY reason that such negotation =\r\nis necessary.  If \nyou \n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t have to ask that question, then you woul=\r\nd not need to \ntalk to \n&gt; &gt; your neighbors in order to determine your role.=\r\n  Rather, you \ncould \n&gt; &gt; just compute your role as a function of your know=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; coordinate/position in the world.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is exactly what CP=\r\nPNs do.  Because inside a computer the \n&gt; &gt; coordinates of every &quot;cell&quot; in =\r\n(2D or 4D or 6D or whatever) \nspace is \n&gt; &gt; known, they do not need to comm=\r\nunicate with each other.  Rather, \n&gt; &gt; they simply compute a function of th=\r\neir position.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That function in effect encompasses all the unfoldin=\r\ng events \nthat \n&gt; &gt; would happen in a normal iterative process, as the CPPN=\r\n theory \n&gt; &gt; says.  So if there was a symmetric gradient laid from one side=\r\n \nto \n&gt; &gt; another in a growing organism through some complex process of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; communication, a CPPN simply instantiates a symmetric function \n&gt; &gt; inste=\r\nad as an analogue of the same process.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, I would argue that =\r\nthe CPPN likely completely subsumes \n&gt; &gt; iterative development, and that al=\r\nl the fancy stuff that is so \nmind-\n&gt; &gt; blowing that looks so important in =\r\ndevleopmental biology is \nsimply a \n&gt; &gt; big complicated quest to answer the=\r\n question &quot;where am I?&quot; (and \n&gt; &gt; hence &quot;who am I?&quot;).  In a computer, since=\r\n we know the &quot;where&quot; \nanswer \n&gt; &gt; a priori by definition, we can wipe out a=\r\nll of this unnecessary \n&gt; &gt; complexity, in effect massively simplifying the=\r\n problem of \n&gt; &gt; represnetation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My hunch is that this principle i=\r\ns why CPPNs are producing such \n&gt; &gt; intricate and complex structures compar=\r\ned to every artificial \n&gt; &gt; developmental encoding that has come before.  H=\r\nave you ever seen \na \n&gt; &gt; pattern as nuanced and intricate as the spaceship=\r\n produced by \nCPPNs \n&gt; &gt; produced by another developmental encoding?  In fa=\r\nct, evolving a \n&gt; &gt; blob or a flag-like pattern is currently considered cut=\r\nting edge \n&gt; &gt; with such systems today.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I&#39;d actually argue that=\r\n CPPNs are a more powerful \nrepresentation \n&gt; &gt; than an iterative system be=\r\ncause they wipe out all kinds of \n&gt; &gt; unnecessary complexity that results a=\r\nt the core from simply \nneeding \n&gt; &gt; to know where one is in the body plan.=\r\n  And they also wipe out \nthe \n&gt; &gt; iterations themselves.  So it&#39;s a radica=\r\nl contrast.  In effect, \nthis \n&gt; &gt; radical shift away from iteration and lo=\r\ncal interaction is \npossible \n&gt; &gt; because CPPNs are cheating: They can know=\r\n the coordinate frame \n&gt; &gt; within which they operate a priori- something th=\r\nat is not \navailable \n&gt; &gt; in biology.  So it is not a surprise that when we=\r\n cheat we can \ndo \n&gt; &gt; better.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, I am arguing an admittedly =\r\nradical position that classic \n&gt; &gt; iterated devbelopment is best abandoned =\r\nas a form of indirect \n&gt; &gt; encoding for evolutionary algorithms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nlease note however, having said that, that iteration IS \nnecessary \n&gt; &gt; for=\r\n developmental systems that interact with the environment \nover \n&gt; &gt; their =\r\nlifetime (such as brains).  However, CPPNs can iterate in \nsuch \n&gt; &gt; a way =\r\njust as any other system.  It only means re-querying the \nCPPN \n&gt; &gt; at each=\r\n iteration.  Thus, CPPNs do not miss this capability even \n&gt; &gt; when it is n=\r\necessary (and it will be in the long run).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, my hunch is =\r\nthat CPPNs (or something quite similar) \nare \n&gt; &gt; the best type of abstract=\r\nion we will get.  The enchantment with \na \n&gt; &gt; process of unfolding over ti=\r\nme and local interaction may turn \nout to \n&gt; &gt; be an intuitive mistake.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_b=\r\nadcoe@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tCan I add my opinion to the other&#39;s s=\r\naying that from what I \n&gt; &gt; read so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; far, the idea of HyperNEAT is br=\r\nilliant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tHaving said that (always got to balance the praise a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; criticism) I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do feel that there is a little something that h=\r\nas been missed \nin \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular approach.  I really meant to=\r\n say something before, \nway \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back when you posted the &quot;Patterns witho=\r\nut development&quot; work \nthat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; preceded this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tWhat I am ge=\r\ntting at, is the difference between a function \n&gt; &gt; mapping, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; however=\r\n complex, and an iterative system.  This difference \nseems \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\ne to be a fairly crucial factor in the nature of \ndevelopmental \n&gt; &gt; biolog=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tThe reason this difference matters is something I touched =\r\non \n&gt; &gt; before:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/messag=\r\ne/1818\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \talbeit only &quot;touched&quot; on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tI am having=\r\n some difficulty justifying this position, partly \n&gt; &gt; because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hav=\r\nen&#39;t been near the literature on any of this for over a \nyear, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; partl=\r\ny because it is quite a deep point about evolvability, \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; partly b=\r\necause it is by no means proven, intuitive and a \n&gt; &gt; quantitative \n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\nifference rather than a qualitative one, however:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tFIRST let m=\r\ne illustrate the sort of iterative system that I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean.  What I am re=\r\nferring to is (say) something like your 4D \n&gt; &gt; &gt; connection density functi=\r\non (substrate configuration, I think \nyou \n&gt; &gt; &gt; called it).  Some sort of =\r\nfield, probably discretised into \ncells \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; convenience of comp=\r\nutation, with some value(s) stored on each \ncell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tNOW, the di=\r\nfference in the two approaches is that using \n&gt; &gt; CPPNs, all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we will=\r\n do is evaluate one function (possibly very complex) \nonce, \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n each cell in the field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tBUT for an iterative approach, we wi=\r\nll probably fill the \n&gt; &gt; field in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that manner as a start state, but=\r\n after that we will then \niterate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; over it N times applying some sort=\r\n of rule to update the field \non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; each pass.  It is the fact that the=\r\n rules act on the output of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous stages that gives the system it=\r\ns power.  Rules could \nbe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; targeted in various ways and have various =\r\neffects, but we can \n&gt; &gt; imagine \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the general case of recognizing som=\r\ne pattern (either of values \nin \n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; single cell, or else relative=\r\n values in a locality of cells) \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changing some values in a cell =\r\nas a result.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tIn BIOLOGY, this equates to real cells.  Every c=\r\nell contains \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; same genes but not all genes are activated.  T=\r\nhe embryo starts \n&gt; &gt; with a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; simple polarity (up-down) defined by a =\r\nchemical gradient.  \nGenes \n&gt; &gt; are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; activated at certain places base=\r\nd on the amount of chemical \nand \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gene-products produce othe=\r\nr chemicals.  Some chemicals also \nleak \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cell to cell.  Thu=\r\ns simple patterns of chemicals become more \n&gt; &gt; complex \n&gt; &gt; &gt; because gene=\r\ns essentially &quot;pattern recognize&quot; certain areas in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; organism, an=\r\nd start producing other chemicals in response.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \tThe power of a=\r\n system like this is, if (say) the number of \n&gt; &gt; legs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changes (by c=\r\nhanging the number of repeats of a pattern at an \n&gt; &gt; early \n&gt; &gt; &gt; stage in=\r\n the process), then the later stages still have a \n&gt; &gt; reasonable \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ch=\r\nance of doing something sane even though the basic plan has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; changed.=\r\n  The process that would wire nerves and blood to N \nlegs, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; works (al=\r\nmost) as happily with N+2 legs.  This is why two \nheaded \n&gt; &gt; &gt; snakes are =\r\nalive (if unfit) but two nosed Boeing 747&#39;s are \nscrap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \t[[I h=\r\nave spoken about this before, and in fact I wrote (most \n&gt; &gt; of) a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nomplex philosophical web-page (called &quot;the Manifesto for \nEvolving \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\ngents&quot;) which went into this in some depth.
