This\npaper is similar to your suggestion because it is a visual problem, and we\nneeded to represent the pixels in a 2D plane. The problem is simpler than\nwhat you probably envision, but the principle is the same:\n\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-ModularityInHyperNEA\nT-Gecco2010.pdf\n\nThere have also been a number of papers that have inputs, hidden layers, and\noutputs in their own 2D plane. All of my HyperNEAT papers take this\napproach, although I usually have a separate output from the CPPN network\nfor each layer, instead of inputting a Z dimension (but you could do that\ninstead). You can find my papers at the link below, and Jason&#39;s checkers\npapers also take this approach (available on the eplex page):\n\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications.html\n\nI also think the most recent multi-agent HyperNEAT paper has a Z dimension,\nif I am remembering things correctly.\n\nFinally, Ken has a discussion of the implications of different setups on the\nHyperNEAT User&#39;s page FAQ, in the section titled &quot; What is the right way to\nset up a CPPN to encode a substrate with hidden nodes?&quot;. I think you&#39;ll find\nthat interesting. \n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n\nHope that helps.  \n\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Colin &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sat, 17 Apr 2010 22:31:43 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] 3D HyperNEAT Substrates\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure if this has been discussed but I was thinking of implementing 3D\n&gt; substrates. The canonical HyperNEAT substrate I think is nodes arranged in\n&gt; layers of lines on the cartesian plane, with each row having a distinct\n&gt; position on the y-axis and the nodes within that row arranged along the\n&gt; x-axis. Hence the strength of a connection is a function of all four coords,\n&gt; weight = f(x1,y1,x2,y2).\n&gt; \n&gt; Seems to me that many common tasks (such as processing image data) require\n&gt; each layer to be a plane, so we could have nodes in a plane occupying x/y axes\n&gt; and the planes/layers being distinguished by the z axis. weight =\n&gt; f(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) and the original &#39;flat&#39; substrate can still be\n&gt; represented if necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m intending to implement it like this - has anyone else implemented CPPNs\n&gt; this way? Are there any problems with this approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
