However, this paper highli=\r\nghts the kinds of cognitive tasks that researchers in evolved AI should be =\r\nworking on.\n\n\nLonger answer:\n\nRegarding their approach, it sounds similar-i=\r\nsh to deep learning. They&#39;re training an ANN that compresses sensory inform=\r\nation into something that the ANN can handle, then training ANNs to perform=\r\n various tasks based on that compressed information. From what I can tell, =\r\nthey&#39;re training a different ANN for each task. However, each task isn&#39;t &quot;p=\r\nlay this video game&quot; or &quot;control this robot,&quot; but rather the tasks based on=\r\n areas of the brain: reward evaluation (orbitofrontal cortex), routing (tha=\r\nlamus), motor processing (premotor cortex), etc.\n\nUnfortunately the details=\r\n of the training algorithm seem to be locked up inside of a book that they =\r\nconveniently just published. If someone has $100 to fork out to explore fur=\r\nther: http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0=\r\n199794545\n\n\nWill this technique be the path to AGI? It&#39;s possible, but I&#39;m =\r\nskeptical. (Rightfully so, the technique is still new.) Their brain archite=\r\ncture is wisely designed since no area is dedicated to one specific task (e=\r\n.g., there&#39;s no &quot;play a video game&quot; region). However, one thing they don&#39;t =\r\ntalk about here is how much retraining of all the brain regions is necessar=\r\ny to add new functionality.\n\nFor example, what if we want Spaun to start re=\r\ncognizing and working with images of animals and people as well? Will we on=\r\nly need to retrain the compression/decompression region, or will we have to=\r\n retrain everything to work with this new sensory input? Or what if we want=\r\n Spaun to start walking as well? Do we just need to retrain the motor proce=\r\nssing region to add functionality, or will we again need to retrain everyth=\r\ning? I think the answer to this question will be the deciding factor of how=\r\n effective this technique will be for building an AGI.\n\n\nMore importantly f=\r\nor us, I was excited when I saw this paper because it highlighted the kinds=\r\n of cognitive tasks that AI researchers should be working on. We should aim=\r\n to evolve neural architectures that perform cognitive tasks much like Spau=\r\nn. Receive visual input, process visual input, perform cognitive task based=\r\n on processed visual input, perform some physical action based off of resul=\r\nt of cognitive task. AFAIK there hasn&#39;t been much neuroevolution work that =\r\ndoes that, so it&#39;s hard to say whether neuroevolution will succeed or fail =\r\nat it. Please link me to the literature if you know of any.\n\nWe&#39;ve recently=\r\n published a paper on using neuroevolution for optical character recognitio=\r\nn (http://adamilab.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Chapman-Evolution-of-an-artif=\r\nicial-visual-cortex-for-image-recognition-2013.pdf), just as Spaun did. So =\r\nthat at least shows some promise of neuroevolution creating artificial brai=\r\nn structures that can perform basic cognitive tasks.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; At GECCO there =\r\nwere a few different conversations about whether neuroevolution remains a p=\r\nromising path to AI given the progress being made in other AI/neural networ=\r\nk areas relative to the progress in neuroevolution. One issue mentioned a f=\r\new times was this recent paper that shows surprisingly impressive AI in a n=\r\non-evolved neural network. \t\n&gt; \n&gt; http://clm.utexas.edu/compjclub/papers/El=\r\niasmith2012.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Many people on this list expressed an interest in read=\r\ning this paper and discussing its techniques and implications on the NEAT l=\r\nist. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t understand their learning mechanisms (because I have not=\r\n taken the time to read the papers they reference), but if someone does get=\r\n a good grasp on how the magic happens, please share your take. More genera=\r\nlly, I&#39;d be interested in any of your reactions regarding whether you agree=\r\n that this  is a very impressive level of intelligence (and well beyond wha=\r\nt we can currently evolve) and whether that means we should question our de=\r\nvotion to neuroevolution as one of the quickest paths to AGI. I want to not=\r\ne that I&#39;m not (yet!) taking a position, but am just curious to hear what y=\r\nou think. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let the discussion begin!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clun=\r\ne\n&gt; \n&gt; Assistant Professor\n&gt; Computer Science\n&gt; University of Wyoming\n&gt; jef=\r\nfclune@...\n&gt; jeffclune.com\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
