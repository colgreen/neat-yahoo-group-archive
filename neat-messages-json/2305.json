This \nis very like Colin&#39;s &quot;phased search who&#39;se exact name escapes me right now&quot; \nand he even suggests the idea in his write up.\n\n\tThe way the works is simple, ever 5 or 10-thousand cycles, I iterate \nthrough every individual employing the hi-fi design principle.  (I call it \nthis because of a story I read in some book, where the engineer says: &quot;I \ndesign the perfect hi-fi, management take components out until it stops \nworking, then they put the last component back and sell it&quot;).\n\n\tBasically each deletable feature (chromosome, rule or gene) of a genome is \nnumbered and I run through them all, temporarily deleting them, \nrecalculating the fitness, and then only putting them back if the fitness \nwas reduced.\n\n\tTo make this run in reasonable time, I have had to employ some heuristics.\n\n- firstly, in my original plan I I iterated over the features twice, the \nfirst time keeping only any deletions that )increased_ the fitness, the \nsecond taking everything that didn&#39;t reduce it (this is particularly \nrelevant to me where my fitness is one of a relatively small number of \nvalues, so fitness1 == fitness2 is not improbable).  This was too slow for \nwords and I dropped it.\n\n- secondly, I had to reduce the number of features considered (this is \nbecause I need a complete fitness recalculation for to assess each feature, \nand when the loop is tests * features * individuals it soon multiplies up \ninto a significant number of half-hours).  So to cover this I have \nintroduced a birth-date (in terms of the cycle it appeared in) parameter on \nevery deletable feature.  When trimming dead wood, I try trimming each \nfeature the first two times it comes up (using its birth-date, the current \ncycle and the known frequency of trimming phases) and if it survives both \nof those, I assume it is important and I do not try to trim it again until \nthe 10th trim-cycle after its birth.\n\n\tAnyway, this seems to keep the bload right down and also, I often seem to \nget fitness bursts just after trimming, which I attribute to cross-over \nbecome far more effective between individuals with no wasted genes...\n\n\tIan\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
