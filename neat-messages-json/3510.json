Individuals may reproduce with some\nprobability when they &quot;meet&quot; and have enough energy to do so. Also,\nthe population can increase/decrease arbitrarily. Individuals die when\ntheir energy is below a certain threshold so there&#39;s not &quot;direct&quot;\nselection mechanism.\n\nI&#39;ve been thinking how that would work with a population of\nANN-controlled organisms living in a 2D environment and borrowing some\nideas from NEAT, like the genetic encoding method and the crossover\nand mutation operators.\n\nThere were some approaches like these in the past (before NEAT) but\nmost of them don&#39;t highlight the differences between the standard GA\nand such complex system simulation.\n\nI know this message has little to do with picbreeder, but Petar&#39;s\npoints motivated to write :-)\n\nCesar\n\nOn 8/13/07, petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As I wrote that answer, I started thinking on how to create unguided\n&gt;  evolution in computers based on the principles of NEAT. This is a\n&gt;  very complex problem. The problem is not that every GA is evolving to\n&gt;  a predefined target and easily skips promising genomes. The problem\n&gt;  is the difference between the GAs and nature. In nature, there is no\n&gt;  somebody like God who says &quot;You&#39;re good and you deserve to mate, and\n&gt;  you will die&quot;. The organisms are choosing their mates. So, a very\n&gt;  good genome will not survive just because its phenotype can eat a lot\n&gt;  or live longer.. In fact, the phenotypes themselves tell which is\n&gt;  good, very indirectly. This kind of indirection need to be\n&gt;  abstracted. If we want to achieve a lot of complexity that was never\n&gt;  discovered by humans, we have to give the individuals the power of...\n&gt;  Say, it&#39;s like democracy in human society.\n&gt;  What I see in Picbreeder and IEC at all, is that the human takes the\n&gt;  role of each indivudual, when he sees one. As I run my view through\n&gt;  these 15 images, for each one I am thinking of the image as it was\n&gt;  me. I say &quot;I&#39;m looking fine!&quot;, or &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so ugly!&quot;.\n&gt;  So, the way to automate this kind of process is to find a way to let\n&gt;  the individuals express themselves. The human designer sets up the\n&gt;  environment, of course, but everything else should happen\n&gt;  automatically. The selection method must be very very different than\n&gt;  the usual, I guess.\n&gt;  How we can put this into something practical? I have some\n&gt;  suggestions, but it turns out to be a kind of Alife stuff. Well, I\n&gt;  cannot even express myself! :)\n&gt;  Does somebody have any ideas?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Peter\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
