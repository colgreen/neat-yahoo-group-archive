Let me know if you do any work with this.\n\n&gt; As I said, I look forward to it. :)  Any idea of which\n&gt; domains you would possibly apply modular NEAT to?\n\nI have a simple scalable board game domain that I plan on doing the majority\n of the testing on.  I have some preliminary data for 10x10 and 20x20. If\n all goes well, I&#39;d like to apply it to Go at some point in the future.\n\n"}}
