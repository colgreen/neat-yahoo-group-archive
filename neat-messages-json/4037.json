Imagine 2D creatures, whose bodies are \ndire=\r\nctly derived from spatial CPPN&#39;s output and converted to mass-\nspring model=\r\ns. Now let&#39;s extend this and let that CPPN output types \nof tissue as well.=\r\n There can be 3 types of tissue - sensor tissue \nthat excites on touch/coll=\r\nision, muscle tissue that contracts and \nanother tissue used to connect bot=\r\nh and just fill the gaps. So these \ncreatures will have brains. Well since =\r\nwe have the body and we know \nits tissue structure, we can build a HyperNEA=\r\nT substrate pretty easy. \nWe can assign positions of input nodes where sens=\r\nor tissue is \nlocated, output nodes where muscle tissue is located, and hid=\r\nden \nnodes for the rest. If the model is a mass-spring system, then this \nc=\r\nan be directly related. For example colliding with an object would \nexcite =\r\nthe sensor tissue, thus inputting 1.0 into the HyperNEAT \nsubstrate. And wh=\r\nen the outputs in the substrate excite above a \ncertain treshold, the sprin=\r\ngs in the physics system will contract. \nEvolution can pick up the best par=\r\nents capable of doing something, \nfor example, tasks like swimming. Or runn=\r\ning away from objects. \nI think this will be pretty interesting thing to se=\r\ne. It can show how \nHyperNEAT/CPPN-NEAT can utilize a simulated physical en=\r\nvironment. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanle=\r\ny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff, I think the issue of the right domain for evolving =\r\nthe \n&gt; substrate is very tricky.   The risk is that in some domains there \n=\r\n&gt; is little to gain by evolving the substrate.  Also, it depends on \n&gt; what=\r\n aspect of the substrate is being evolved.  For example, the \n&gt; configurati=\r\non of sensors has a different implication than the \n&gt; configuration of hidd=\r\nen nodes, or both together.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, I think the important thing is=\r\n to guide the choice of \n&gt; domain based on the principle you hope to demons=\r\ntrate.  If it is \n&gt; that e.g. an algorithm that can increase the density of=\r\n the \n&gt; substrate can evolve a very complex network wherein that complexity=\r\n \n&gt; is leveraged effectively, then it is important to choose a domain \n&gt; wh=\r\nere such complexity is needed.  That is not a trivial task, \n&gt; because in s=\r\nome domains, the problem might simply be too hard to \nget \n&gt; started.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis is an exhilarating conversation.

When I think ab=\r\nout evolving the substrate, I usually \n&gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a distribution of v=\r\narying densities rather than strict \nlayers \n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; preconceived archit=\r\nectures, which is closest to Jeff&#39;s option \n&gt; (c).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One reference for =\r\nme is the human brain:  It has dense masses \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look different fr=\r\nom each other architecturally and do not exist \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; layers with resp=\r\nect to each other (e.g. the cerebellum vs. the \n&gt; basal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ganglia).  Ho=\r\nwever, *within* particular masses there is some \n&gt; layering,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as =\r\nin the neocortex, which is perhaps the most important \nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; high-level=\r\n intelligence.  It would be nice if all that could \njust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arise on its=\r\n own to suit the task.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What you said about CPPN complexity and=\r\n substrate complexity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing together is something I never though=\r\nt of.  It&#39;s an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting idea to correlate the two.  You are right =\r\nthat in \n&gt; general\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a problem with letting the nodes evolve i=\r\nn the \nsubstrate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it is so easy to express a massive number of=\r\n nodes, \nwhich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would not always be needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One problem I=\r\n see is that we are talking about astronomical \n&gt; ranges, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rang=\r\ne in density may not really make sense to vary on a \n&gt; continuum.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Fo=\r\nr example, if you have a number between 0 and 1 that \n&gt; represents a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndensity somehow, then that density may range from several dozen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuro=\r\nns to several billion (if we are talking about natural \n&gt; scales).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do=\r\nes this range really make sense on a continuum between 0 and \n1?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mayb=\r\ne we need to scale it exponentially or something like that, \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; st=\r\nill, then you end up with a tiny mutation potentially \n&gt; increasing the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; number of neurons by billions.  That seems odd.  In a way, we&#39;d \n&gt; like\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to not even be in a circumscribed range and just let increases \n&gt; kee=\r\np\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happening indefinitely, but not too much at a time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fi=\r\nnally, the inputs and outputs may be a special case.  We may \n&gt; want to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; preserve the current human control of the geometry there and \n&gt; only let=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution increase density or something like that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyw=\r\nay, this is a great topic and a completely untouched area of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; research=\r\n with plenty of things left to try.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hello Jeff, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think that=\r\n such assumptions about layered topology are \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to achieve t=\r\nhis. There are two fundamental things \n&gt; associated with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; any substra=\r\nte in 2D/3D. These are node presence and node \n&gt; density. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fact, s=\r\nkip the first, it just.. it can be thought of as \nspatial \n&gt; CPPN\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ou=\r\ntput where the output means the overall node density at that \n&gt; place.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; And if the output there is less than 0.2, there are no nodes \n&gt; (sounds\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; familiar? :)). \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So the same connective CPPN is actual=\r\nly capable of \nrepresenting \n&gt; its\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; own substrate. But this approach =\r\nwould generate too big \n&gt; substrates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even the most simple CPPNs are=\r\n able to generate a substrate \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1000s of nodes and now imagine h=\r\now many connections there \ncould \n&gt; be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; And this is for the simplest=\r\n (!) CPPN. That sounds like a huge \n&gt; waste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of computational effort,=\r\n doesn&#39;t it? ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what is needed is a way to restrict the s=\r\nubstrate \ncomplexity \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; small CPPNs. Of course more complex CPPN=\r\ns can be allowed to \n&gt; generate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more complex/dense substrates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This is actually just like complexification. First the major \n&gt; c=\r\noncepts\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are established on a substrate with very low resolution and =\r\nas \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; CPPNs complexify, the substrate becomes more complex. In f=\r\nact \n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; CPPN will generate a substrate based on its complexity (=\r\nsay,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; num_nodes+num_links). Oh I think I mentioned that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; What I am thinking is, if we actually allow substrates to \n&gt; evolve,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; does this mean that humans cannot inject that priory geometric\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; k=\r\nnowledge any more?
