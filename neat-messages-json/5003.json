Making the whole things running on CUDA won&#39;t speed up, and it is\n&gt; not my target.\n\nHi,\n\nSo your saying that we:\n\n1) Load all of the networks in a population into the GPU\n2) Activate them in parallel.\n3) Read the outputs.\n\nFor larger networks (e.g. from HyperNEAT) we may only get one or two\nnetworks into the GPU, so it would seem we need to put as many\nnetworks as we can into the GPU at a time. I think this should be\nfairly easy to do and this touches on previous comments from Ken Lloyd\nwho I believe has gone into this in far more detail - e.g. by also\nloading problem domain code into the GPU and trying to determine how\nbest to divide GPU and CPU resources in the general case (for a wide\nrange of scenarios).\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
