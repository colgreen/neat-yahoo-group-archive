The goal\nis to \n&gt; steer an articial ant (red and black) over a mostly empty (white) \n&gt; toroidal world where there is a trail of food (green). If the ant\nfinds \n&gt; a piece of food (a red square above), it&#39;s given a point. If it\nsteps \n&gt; without finding any food (black), it simply wastes one of it&#39;s\nturns. \n&gt; When it&#39;s been allowed to run for a number of steps, it&#39;s killed\noff. \n&gt; The fitness is the number of food pieces it has found.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It uses two inputs bias and &quot;food ahead&quot; - an indicator that\ndetarmines \n&gt; if there is food ahead of the ant or not. It uses four outputs, \n&gt; MoveForward, TurnLeft, TurnRight and EatUnderneath. It picks the\none \n&gt; that firest &quot;hardest&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The successrate isn&#39;t quite there yet, but it does find perfect \n&gt; solutions. GP solves this one quite easily, but in GP, it&#39;s much\neasier \n&gt; to solve the problem of an order list of instructions. As in &quot;under \n&gt; these conditions, perform these instructions &quot;x,y,z&quot;. In GP, this\nis \n&gt; inherent in the system. NEAT has to evolve it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I kinda feel that the inputs/outputs aren&#39;t exactly fair to NEAT.\nCould \n&gt; anyone suggest some inputs/outputs that would suit NEAT better, but \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t violate the Artificial Ant premise?\n&gt; \n\nIt doesn&#39;t sound terribly unfair to me.  So if I understand correctly,\nfor NEAT this is a memory-intensive problem, since its context\nincludes where it&#39;s recently been, so it has to use recurrency to keep\nthe current state up to date.  Would you agree with this?\n\nSome comments on outputs:  Can you let it fire both turn and move at\nthe same time?  That may make more sense from the network&#39;s\nperspective, for example if something is to its left, so it doesn&#39;t\nhave to take two steps to get there.  Also, what is the purpose of the\nEatUnderneath output?  It seems like it doesn&#39;t add anything to the\nproblem...why not just have it automatically &quot;eat&quot; if it has food\nunder it?  It seems that having to call EatUnderneath adds a lot of\ncomplexity to the problem for NEAT since its context doesn&#39;t change at\nall when it does this, but it has to do different things in a row,\ni.e. eat, and then move.\n\nken\n\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a perfect solution (not that NEAT solves the problem with\nONE \n&gt; hidden node)\n&gt; \n&gt; N 0 : Input (Value=1,00)\n&gt; N 1 : Input (Value=0,00)\n&gt; N 2 : Input (Value=0,00)\n&gt; N 3 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\n&gt; N 4 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-0,89)\n&gt; N 5 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\n&gt; N 6 : Output (Sigmoid, Value=-1,00)\n&gt; N 8 : Hidden (Sigmoid, Value=1,00)\n&gt; \n&gt; C 0 : 0 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-1,22)\n&gt; C 1 : 1 -&gt; 3 (Weight=0,62)\n&gt; C 2 : 2 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-3,62)\n&gt; C 3 : 0 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-1,12)\n&gt; C 4 : 1 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-6,15)\n&gt; C 5 : 2 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-0,08)\n&gt; C 6 : 0 -&gt; 5 (Weight=-3,47)\n&gt; C 7 : 1 -&gt; 5 (Weight=-7,94)\n&gt; C 8 : 2 -&gt; 5 (Weight=4,90)\n&gt; C 9 : 0 -&gt; 6 (Weight=-2,25)\n&gt; C 10 : 1 -&gt; 6 (Weight=0,01)\n&gt; C 11 : 2 -&gt; 6 (Weight=-1,40)\n&gt; C 17 : 0 -&gt; 8 (Weight=2,06)\n&gt; C 18 : 8 -&gt; 3 (Weight=2,05)\n&gt; C 60 : 5 -&gt; 4 (Weight=-3,87)\n&gt; C 586 : 4 -&gt; 3 (Weight=-1,71)\n&gt; C 619 : 3 -&gt; 4 (Weight=3,32)\n&gt; C 692 : 4 -&gt; 8 (Weight=-4,74)\n\n\n"}}
