I don&#39;t take a lot of money there, but I like my current=\r\n \n&gt; job because I have enough free time for working on my own stuff :)\n&gt; I&#39;=\r\nm a hobbyist in programming since the age of 10. My interest on \nAI \n&gt; is s=\r\nignificant. I don&#39;t make money with this whole thing, it is \njust \n&gt; the pa=\r\nssion.. you know :) \n&gt; \n&gt; When I first learned about NEAT, I already had do=\r\nne many \nexperiments \n&gt; with NNs, (never GAs). But, as I realized what in f=\r\nact is NEAT, I \n&gt; started to love it, seriosly. I&#39;ve read every paper you p=\r\nut out in \n&gt; the Internet (and many times), even the PowerPoint slides from=\r\n your \n&gt; website. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; So, what I wanted to say is, during the last year=\r\n, I did a lot of \n&gt; NEAT research on my own, like &quot;can it do this? can it d=\r\no that?&quot;.. \n&gt; That were days that I was only thinking of some new stuff to =\r\nput \nNEAT \n&gt; evolving NNs into :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I was tweaking the code a lot, too..=\r\n Damn, I know every piece of \nit.. \n&gt; It&#39;s just that I&#39;m lazy so I didn&#39;t w=\r\nrite my own version of NEAT \nbut \n&gt; use your release :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The last paper=\r\ns, explaining the concept of CPPNs, opened my \n&gt; imagination even more. I w=\r\nas even planing to make some Alife \n&gt; applications involving CPPNs, but the=\r\n papers for HyperNEAT were \n&gt; released, so I decided to replace NEAT with H=\r\nyperNEAT on most of my \n&gt; projects, to see what happens :) I love experimen=\r\nting with this \n&gt; stuff. It is in fact taking me away from work sometimes, =\r\nmy boss \n&gt; tells me &quot;Check out and fix this code&quot;, but I run an evolution \n=\r\n&gt; instead :D\n&gt; \n&gt; I implemented HyperNEAT for a couple of hours, I didn&#39;t w=\r\nrite it \nfrom \n&gt; scratch, but added it to the existing NEAT code I am curre=\r\nntly \n&gt; maintaining.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to know that this had impressed you :)=\r\n It was not a lot \nof \n&gt; work, really :) There is so much more to do ;)\n&gt; A=\r\nnd let me tell you that I am.. like a fan. :) I am losing patience \n&gt; to se=\r\ne your next paper and future directions of research :) And I \n&gt; will keep y=\r\nou and the whole community informed about everything new \n&gt; and/or cool, th=\r\nat I manage to discover and/or adopt in \n&gt; applications :) \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers, \n&gt;=\r\n Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Peter, if you don&#39;t mind my asking, what kind of work do you =\r\ndo \nfor \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; living?  Is your work with NEAT/HyperNEAT in your spare t=\r\nime or \n&gt; does \n&gt; &gt; it have a relation to your job?

I took a CPPN that produces a CTRNN =\r\n\nexhibiting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;mexican wave&quot; behaviour. I scaled up the substrate to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; approximately 200 hidden nodes. The &quot;mexican wave&quot; pattern was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; preserved! And more, even the direction of the wave was the \nsame! \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;petar_cher=\r\nvenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was just thinkin=\r\ng about NERO. I suddenly made the \nconnection \n&gt; &gt; &gt; between \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the s=\r\nensor placements and the substrates for the robot \n&gt; experiment \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s paper. It is so similar. So I begin to think.. \n&gt; What=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NERO, but using HyperNEAT? The substrates can be mad=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; geometrically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similar to the.. enivonment, you know what I =\r\nmean. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will try to implement a 2D version of something similar to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; NERO, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with leaky integrator neurons, because ther=\r\ne every node has a \n&gt; &gt; bias \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to care about=\r\n where to place the bias unit in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides,=\r\n I have the following idea. During evolution, in the \n&gt; &gt; first \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ge=\r\nnerations (in the rtNEAT case, the first N minutes of \n&gt; &gt; evolution), \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; substrates will be simple, with low node counts. Then, give=\r\nn \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; threshold (num. of generations/time), the program will \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n automatically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scale up the substrate to a higher density. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions/ideas about that? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
