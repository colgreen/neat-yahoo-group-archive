I very much enjoyed readin=\r\ng through all the experiments and because of that found myself finishing th=\r\ne paper quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThanks. We are really glad you liked it.  \n\n&gt; The re=\r\nsults in this paper rebut a viewpoint that naturally I do not agree with, s=\r\no of course overall the paper confirms my own intuitions.  In effect I thin=\r\nk it makes a strong case that the information accumulated over novelty sear=\r\nch is arguably useful for something, so it is not random.  That is a nice p=\r\niece of evidence to have available and I imagine it will be cited often in =\r\nthe future for that reason.\n&gt; \nThat would be great. We did think that it wo=\r\nuld be useful for us as a community to have a paper documenting that Novelt=\r\ny Search is not random, and that it does accumulate information about how t=\r\no explore its environment. Being able to cite such a paper might prevent fu=\r\nture Novelty Search papers from getting rejected due to skepticism about th=\r\ne technique. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper also raises some interesting further question=\r\ns.  I can see one potential confounding question.  Of course it is not in m=\r\ny interest to suggest confounding factors when I agree with the conclusions=\r\n, but it&#39;s still an interesting question:  Is the information accumulated w=\r\nithin a network really evidence that the search itself that led to the netw=\r\nork is not random?  Or would any network that solves a task in effect conta=\r\nin useful information, even if it was solved randomly?  That is, in short, =\r\nwhat would happen if you collected networks that solve the maze that were d=\r\niscovered by purely random search?  Of course, you&#39;ve have to do a lot of l=\r\nong runs of random search (because it&#39;s a poor algorithm), but still, would=\r\n such networks be any different in this regard from novelty and fitness?\n&gt; =\r\n\n\nThat is an excellent, interesting question. JBM raised the same point in =\r\nreaction to this paper. I do think that any network that solved the problem=\r\n would probably show similar levels of exploratory skills, but I don=92t th=\r\nink it=92s a guarantee a priori because of the spectrum of possibilities I =\r\noutline below. A related, but also fascinating question is this: why didn=\r\n=92t Novelty Search produce more skills than the traditional EA? My guess i=\r\ns that most people would have guessed that it would have. \n\nI can imagine a=\r\n continuum of ways to solve the hard maze. On the least-general end you hav=\r\ne a open-loop, memorized trajectory that happens to solve that specific maz=\r\ne: this sort of solution will not have any general exploratory skills that =\r\nwill transfer to other domains. On the most-general end you have a general =\r\nsolution to mazes (either explore everywhere or, even better on any maze wh=\r\nere you don=92t start out near the wall of an island within the maze, go to=\r\n the nearest wall and follow it). \n\nThe solutions we found are somewhere in=\r\n the middle, but the fact that there is a continuum opens up the question o=\r\nf whether different search algorithms produce solutions at various points o=\r\nn the continuum. I predicted that NS would be further toward the general en=\r\nd than EAs, but that=92s not what we found. Why not? I=92d be interested to=\r\n hear your opinion, Joel=92s, and that of the rest of the community. \n\nEven=\r\n more interesting is to think of whether other algorithms (or behavior metr=\r\nics, or fitness metrics) would produce organisms more toward the general en=\r\nd. Can you think of any?\n\nRegarding your question of whether or not random =\r\nsearch could produce organisms equally as far toward the general end as NS =\r\nand objective-driven EAs: as I said above, I think that random search could=\r\n do that, but only if you waited long enough until you happened to generate=\r\n an organism that did have such general exploratory skills. I think that is=\r\n exceedingly unlikely, but theoretically random search will eventually find=\r\n everything. But the same is true for evolution vs. random search: We think=\r\n there are interesting principles that caused evolution to produce complexi=\r\nty (e.g. hawks and humans), but random search would also ultimately produce=\r\n hawks and humans given enough time: but that fact does not cause me to thi=\r\nnk that evolution is no better than random search at accumulating informati=\r\non.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Another interesting issue that you do touch on in the paper is th=\r\ne difference between solutions from novelty and from fitness.  Of course, i=\r\nt is not good news for fitness that it takes more effort to get similar res=\r\nults, but there is evidence in other works that solutions from fitness have=\r\n liabilities beyond simply whether they solve the problem or not.  For exam=\r\nple, there is evidence that they are more complex than necessary and eviden=\r\nce that they are less evolvable (e.g. http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/=\r\n2011/lehman-cec11 ).  My work with Brian Woolley also hints that fitness-ba=\r\nsed search can yield dramatically bad representations even when a problem i=\r\ns solved.  We&#39;ve also seen a lot of evidence of that informally in our lab.=\r\n  Yet here in this paper whatever negative effect fitness has isn&#39;t showing=\r\n up very strongly.  I&#39;m not sure why, but I suspect there are variants of t=\r\nhis kind of work that could tease out this issue more explicitly, though it=\r\n was not the focus of this paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nI agree with you.There is some nice=\r\n evidence that you and your collaborators have produced showing that object=\r\nive driven search can have detrimental effects on genomic representations. =\r\nHowever, as you point out, those issues should affect evolvability, and we =\r\ndid not see any differences in evolvability in this study. I think that you=\r\n rightly point out that additional studies might be able to find cases in w=\r\nhich novelty search genomes evolve faster than genomes generated via object=\r\nive-driven search, and I hope that we as a community conduct those experime=\r\nnts. I think it would be a fascinating thing to show over multiple problems=\r\n.\n\n&gt; But one thing even now that we could potentially check is how large th=\r\ne networks from the objective runs are versus the size of the ones from nov=\r\nelty.  If that difference is like what I observed with Joel (which we would=\r\n expect since it&#39;s the same experiment) then that at least hints that troub=\r\nle is looming for fitness even if it didn&#39;t show up here.  Also, we should =\r\nkeep in mind that the continuations you ran were with novelty (even if it s=\r\ntarted with fitness).  Perhaps novelty is powerful enough to overcome the c=\r\norruption of fitness if fitness has not held sway for too long - this issue=\r\n is still not well understood or researched.  I have begun thinking of obje=\r\nctive fitness as a kind of corruption or poison that can be tolerated in lo=\r\nw doses, but that becomes increasingly toxic to representation the more of =\r\nthe search it consumes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nWe did not check on the size of the genomes, =\r\nbecause you and you and Joel have already done that for this experiment. I =\r\nagree with you that having an overly large, complex genome is likely to dec=\r\nrease evolvability. To some extent that is what I was arguing in the other =\r\nthread: that the parsimony/regularization pressure that you get via the con=\r\nnection cost technique is likely to improve evolvability. So I have hope th=\r\nat novelty search genomes may be more evolvable (much more research is need=\r\ned), even though I now believe, as a result of this study and the thinking =\r\nI have done about it, that they don&#39;t have increased exploratory skills pri=\r\nor to further evolution.\n\n&gt; Anyway, overall thank you for doing this study =\r\nand making a useful point.  Even if the potential confound above turned out=\r\n the wrong way, these extensive experiments still show convincingly that no=\r\nvelty search is not producing random junk, which is a message that is usefu=\r\nl those who are perhaps the most extreme critics of the idea and its potent=\r\nial implications.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThank you for your careful consideration of this pa=\r\nper. It really makes it worthwhile to spend all the long hours on these pap=\r\ners when we know that people in our community will deeply engage with the f=\r\nindings.\n\nBest, \nJeff & Roby\n\n&gt; Best,\n&gt;

Fir=\r\nst, once again congratulations on publishing a systematic and comprehensive=\r\n study on a delicate and tricky question.&nbsp; I very much enjoyed reading=\r\n through all the experiments and because of that found myself finishing the=\r\n paper quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks=\r\n. We are really glad you liked it. &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote t=\r\nype=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position: =\r\nstatic; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re=\r\nsults in this paper rebut a viewpoint that naturally I do not agree with, s=\r\no of course overall the paper confirms my own intuitions.&nbsp; In effect I=\r\n think it makes a strong case that the information accumulated over novelty=\r\n search is arguably useful for something, so it is not random.&nbsp; That i=\r\ns a nice piece of evidence to have available and I imagine it will be cited=\r\n often in the future for that reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bloc=\r\nkquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;That would be great. We did think that it would be useful for u=\r\ns as a community to have a paper documenting that Novelty Search is not ran=\r\ndom, and that it does accumulate information about how to explore its envir=\r\nonment. Being able to cite such a paper might prevent future Novelty Search=\r\n papers from getting rejected due to skepticism about the technique.&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255,=\r\n 255, 255); position: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The paper also raises some interesting further questi=\r\nons.&nbsp; I can see one potential confounding question.&nbsp; Of course it=\r\n is not in my interest to suggest confounding factors when I agree with the=\r\n conclusions, but it&#39;s still an interesting question:&nbsp; Is the informat=\r\nion accumulated within a network really evidence that the search itself tha=\r\nt led to the network is not random?&nbsp; Or would any network that solves =\r\na task in effect contain useful information, even if it was solved randomly=\r\n?&nbsp; That is, in short, what would happen if you collected networks that=\r\n solve the maze that were discovered by purely random search?&nbsp; Of cour=\r\nse, you&#39;ve have to do a lot of long runs of random search (because it&#39;s a p=\r\noor algorithm), but still, would such networks be any different in this reg=\r\nard from novelty and fitness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is an excellent, interesting question. JBM raised t=\r\nhe same point in reaction to this paper. I do think that any network that s=\r\nolved the problem would probably show similar levels of exploratory skills,=\r\n but I don=92t think it=92s a guarantee a priori because of the spectrum of=\r\n possibilities I outline below. A related, but also fascinating question is=\r\n this: why didn=92t Novelty Search produce more skills than the traditional=\r\n EA? My guess is that most people would have guessed that it would have.&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can imagine a continuum of ways to solve the=\r\n hard maze. On the least-general end you have a open-loop, memorized trajec=\r\ntory that happens to solve that specific maze: this sort of solution will n=\r\not have any general exploratory skills that will transfer to other domains.=\r\n On the most-general end you have a general solution to mazes (either explo=\r\nre everywhere or, even better on any maze where you don=92t start out near =\r\nthe wall of an island within the maze, go to the nearest wall and follow it=\r\n).&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The solutions we found are somewhere in t=\r\nhe middle, but the fact that there is a continuum opens up the question of =\r\nwhether different search algorithms produce solutions at various points on =\r\nthe continuum. I predicted that NS would be further toward the general end =\r\nthan EAs, but that=92s not what we found. Why not? I=92d be interested to h=\r\near your opinion, Joel=92s, and that of the rest of the community.&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even more interesting is to think of whether other a=\r\nlgorithms (or behavior metrics, or fitness metrics) would produce organisms=\r\n more toward the general end. Can you think of any?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;Regarding your question of whether or not random search could produce org=\r\nanisms equally as far toward the general end as NS and objective-driven EAs=\r\n: as I said above, I think that random search could do that, but only if yo=\r\nu waited long enough until you happened to generate an organism that did ha=\r\nve such general exploratory skills. I think that is exceedingly unlikely, b=\r\nut theoretically random search will eventually find everything. But the sam=\r\ne is true for evolution vs. random search: We think there are interesting p=\r\nrinciples that caused evolution to produce complexity (e.g. hawks and human=\r\ns), but random search would also ultimately produce hawks and humans given =\r\nenough time: but that fact does not cause me to think that evolution is no =\r\nbetter than random search at accumulating information.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255=\r\n); position: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;positi=\r\non:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-te=\r\nxt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another interesting issue that you do touch on in the paper is t=\r\nhe difference between solutions from novelty and from fitness.&nbsp; Of cou=\r\nrse, it is not good news for fitness that it takes more effort to get simil=\r\nar results, but there is evidence in other works that solutions from fitnes=\r\ns have liabilities beyond simply whether they solve the problem or not.&nbs=\r\np; For example, there is evidence that they are more complex than necessary=\r\n and evidence that they are less evolvable (e.g. &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2011/lehman-cec11&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2011/lehman-cec11&lt;/a&gt; ).&nbsp; My wor=\r\nk with Brian Woolley also hints that fitness-based search can yield dramati=\r\ncally bad representations even when a problem is solved.&nbsp; We&#39;ve also s=\r\neen a lot of evidence of that informally in our lab.&nbsp; Yet here in this=\r\n paper whatever negative effect fitness has isn&#39;t showing up very strongly.=\r\n&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure why, but I suspect there are variants of this kind of w=\r\nork that could tease out this issue more explicitly, though it was not the =\r\nfocus of this paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;I=\r\n agree with you.There is some nice evidence that you and your collaborators=\r\n have produced showing that objective driven search can have detrimental ef=\r\nfects on genomic representations. However, as you point out, those issues s=\r\nhould affect evolvability, and we did not see any differences in evolvabili=\r\nty in this study. I think that you rightly point out that additional studie=\r\ns might be able to find cases in which novelty search genomes evolve faster=\r\n than genomes generated via objective-driven search, and I hope that we as =\r\na community conduct those experiments. I think it would be a fascinating th=\r\ning to show over multiple problems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position: static; z-index: =\r\nauto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-=\r\nmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one thing even now =\r\nthat we could potentially check is how large the networks from the objectiv=\r\ne runs are versus the size of the ones from novelty.&nbsp; If that differen=\r\nce is like what I observed with Joel (which we would expect since it&#39;s the =\r\nsame experiment) then that at least hints that trouble is looming for fitne=\r\nss even if it didn&#39;t show up here.&nbsp; Also, we should keep in mind that =\r\nthe continuations you ran were with novelty (even if it started with fitnes=\r\ns).&nbsp; Perhaps novelty is powerful enough to overcome the corruption of =\r\nfitness if fitness has not held sway for too long - this issue is still not=\r\n well understood or researched.&nbsp; I have begun thinking of objective fi=\r\ntness as a kind of corruption or poison that can be tolerated in low doses,=\r\n but that becomes increasingly toxic to representation the more of the sear=\r\nch it consumes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;We did=\r\n not check on the size of the genomes, because you and you and Joel have al=\r\nready done that for this experiment. I agree with you that having an overly=\r\n large, complex genome is likely to decrease evolvability. To some extent t=\r\nhat is what I was arguing in the other thread: that the parsimony/regulariz=\r\nation pressure that you get via the connection cost technique is likely to =\r\nimprove evolvability. So I have hope that novelty search genomes may be mor=\r\ne evolvable (much more research is needed), even though I now believe, as a=\r\n result of this study and the thinking I have done about it, that they don&#39;=\r\nt have increased exploratory skills prior to further evolution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nlockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);=\r\n position: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position=\r\n:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, overall thank you for doing this study and making a useful poi=\r\nnt.&nbsp; Even if the potential confound above turned out the wrong way, th=\r\nese extensive experiments still show convincingly that novelty search is no=\r\nt producing random junk, which is a message that is useful those who are pe=\r\nrhaps the most extreme critics of the idea and its potential implications.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you for your car=\r\neful consideration of this paper.
