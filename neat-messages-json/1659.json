From your explanation I would say that this same effect \ncould be achieved with a recursive connection from a neuron&#39;s output \nback into its input. So from that perspective you could say that NEAT as \nit stands can represent this type of functionality through its topology \nsearching propoperties. However, relying on topology searching to find \nsolutions might not be as effective as actually defining a leaky \nintegrater neuron directly. This comes back to our previous [brief] \ndiscussion regarding implementing different types of neuron and \nactivation function - which I hope to look into soon.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
