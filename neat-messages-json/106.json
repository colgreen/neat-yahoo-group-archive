After all, the author is\n&gt; essentially \n&gt; advocating a multi-pronged, modular approach, in\n&gt; which lots \n&gt; of &quot;tools&quot; are used together to produce the final\n&gt; product.  \n\nYeah, I thought the same thing.  Of course, it is\neasier to criticize a given approach then to put forth\na comprehensive one of your own.  And much of the\ncriticism of approaches to AI research is justified.\n\nBut I don&#39;t think he was really being fair to the GA\napproach.  \n\n&gt; But the funny thing is, you may notice, I never\n&gt; mentioned NN&#39;s or \n&gt; GA&#39;s, but if you like my plan, you can&#39;t help but\n&gt; think, hmm NN&#39;s \n&gt; and GA&#39;s sound like what I&#39;m talking about.  Now the\n&gt; question is, \n&gt; whose plan is actually new?\n\nWe&#39;re on the same page, of course.  There are very few\ncritics who won&#39;t admit the Byzantine complexity of\neven rudimentary nervous systems.  Trying to\nforward-engineer that level of complexity seems highly\nunlikely, but you&#39;re right...this is the traditional\napproach to AI.\n\nI think we mostly agree that if very good AI is going\nto be created, it will most likely be from the bottom\nup, exploiting some key features of natural biological\nprocesses and systems.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
