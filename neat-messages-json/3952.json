Direct connections are often\nusef=\r\nul as well and without z there would need to be perhaps another\noutput for =\r\nthose.  In any case, one of our aims was to make this\nimplementation simple=\r\n in part so that it would be easy to understand\nfor the broader AAAI commun=\r\nity.  That is also why we did not use\nbiases, even though we can do that as=\r\n well with an additional CPPN\noutput (and we have had success doing it that=\r\n way).  So we are hoping\nwith this paper to really motivate the concept to =\r\npeople who would\notherwise find it too far outside their area.\n\nAll of the =\r\nmany ways a CPPN can be used to represent a network\nstructure are certainly=\r\n worth exploring.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for this double-post, but if you don&#39;t=\r\n allow direct input-\n&gt; &gt;output connections and probably recurrent connectio=\r\nns (such that go \n&gt; from one hidden node to another one in the same layer),=\r\n then you have \n&gt; made assumptions for a layered network topology. I guess =\r\nthat such a \n&gt; topology (space) is enough to solve the problem, but it rest=\r\nricts the \n&gt; real power of the CPPN, to describe any possible topology. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason Gauci&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the number of connections, there are two things to not=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, HyperNEAT uses all 64 input nodes, even the ones which c=\r\nannot\n&gt; &gt; legally contain a piece.  The reason why is because we wanted to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; compare HyperNEAT&#39;s approach to discovering geometric regularities\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwith NEAT-EI&#39;s approach of using a priori engineered regularities.  \n&gt; If\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; we disabled the connections that would never be activated, we would \n&gt; b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; cheating, in a sense, by providing a priori domain-specific \n&gt; knowle=\r\ndge\n&gt; &gt; to the algorithm.  The only a priori knowledge needed involves the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; size of the layers in the substrate and the hidden layer\n&gt; &gt; configurat=\r\nion.  In this case, the extra connections have no impact \n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; the netw=\r\nork, but I left them in ti keep with the spirit of the \n&gt; experiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Second, all 64*64 + 64*1 (4160) connections in the substrate are not\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; always expressed.  If the CPPN outputs a value with a magnitude less\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthan 0.2, the connection weight is forced to absolute 0, disabling \n&gt; the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; connection.  Connections which are disabled are considered to not\n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nist, so the 3979 number implies that some of the connections were\n&gt; &gt; not e=\r\nxpressed in that substrate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen W=\r\naits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kennet=\r\nh Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with you ne=\r\nw results with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twenty-=\r\nThird AAAI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case St=\r\nudy on \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Lear=\r\nning.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN =\r\narbitrarily chosen?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seem=\r\ns more natural \n&gt; to me?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Was more than one CPPN configuration tried=\r\n?
