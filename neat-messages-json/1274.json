Then he studied the degrading behaviour of the net as its weights \nwere damaged in some way (zeroed or randomised...?)\n\n\tTo his surprise, some of the outputs from the &quot;dying&quot; network were good \nphases representing &quot;improvisation&quot; on the training set.  But only some of \nthem.\n\n\tSo his general approach is to take the output from a damaged network and \nfeed it through another (healthy) network.  The damaged section produces \nvariations on the basic data, and the healthy section screens them for quality.\n\n\tObviously this is very vague, I&#39;ll try to find the original article, but \nsince he&#39;s exploiting it commercially, the details there are not complete \neither...\n\n\tI don&#39;t think he uses a TWEANN approach, just the weights...\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
