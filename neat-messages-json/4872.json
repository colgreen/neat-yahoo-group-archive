Because GAR is written i=\r\nn XNA, it should be feasible.  There are some tricky issues between PC and =\r\nXbox, but we are aware of them and have plans to address them.  We do actua=\r\nlly have a prototype that plays to some extent with an Xbox controller alre=\r\nady, although it can&#39;t really be played yet in this way because some of the=\r\n interface is not usable with the joystick.  We will first complete version=\r\n 1.2, and then our plan is to concentrate on Xbox.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;spoonsx21&quot; &lt;spoonsx21@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering if there =\r\nwas every any discussion of releasing GAR on the Xbox 360? I recently stumb=\r\nled upon some information regarding submitting games to the XNA creator com=\r\nmunity, which (if it passed peer review) could allow it to be added to the =\r\nXbox marketplace. I think the controls would be well suited for an Xbox 360=\r\n controller (they could be a lot like Geometry wars), and it could help rea=\r\nch wider audiences (if that&#39;s at all desired). \n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t a clue how h=\r\nard it would be to port it to the Xbox, but was curious if you guys thought=\r\n about it at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Paul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
