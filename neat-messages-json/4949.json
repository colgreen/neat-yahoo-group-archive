I apologize for that.\n\nAs for getting di=\r\nfferent results when reloading genomes, the most common reason for this err=\r\nor have been conflicting or missing params.txt files, as Colin suggested.  =\r\nThe only other situations I&#39;ve run into have been accidentally using differ=\r\nent substrates and recently when someone created their visualizer project t=\r\nhe references to SharpNeatLib got messed up.  That last one seemed like a s=\r\npecial case, but you can test for it by using this code outline to load and=\r\n test a genome in your main class.  You can also use MessageBox.show() in y=\r\nour visualization project with this code to see if that produces the correc=\r\nt fitness value.\n\nNeatGenome testGenome;\t\t\ntry\n{\n\tXmlDocument XML =3D new X=\r\nmlDocument();\n\tXML.Load(testGenomeFilename);\n\ttestGenome =3D XmlNeatGenomeR=\r\neaderStatic.Read(XML);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n\tSystem.Console.WriteLine(&quot;P=\r\nroblem loading genome: &#92;n&quot; + e.Message);\n\tSystem.Environment.Exit(1);\n}\nYou=\r\nrNetworkEvaluator eval =3D new YourNetworkEvaluator();\ndouble fitness =3D e=\r\nval.networkEvaluate(testGenome.Decode());\nSystem.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Fitness=\r\n:  &quot; + fitness);\n\nFailing that, your method #3 was correct.  The process fo=\r\nr loading a genome is:\n\n1. Setup experimental parameters.\n2. Load the XML i=\r\nnto a genome.\n3. Decode the genome into a CPPN (as an INetwork)\n4. Use your=\r\n Substrate to query the CPPN, producing a NeatGenome or INetwork that will =\r\nbe used in the domain.\n\nSo that seems OK.  You can try dumping the INetwork=\r\ns produced by the substrate (i.e. the actual ANNs being evaluated) of the b=\r\nest genomes to XML and compare those to the networks you get from loading t=\r\nhe genomes back in during visualization and putting them through the substr=\r\nate.  If they are the same, perhaps some of the domain parameters are diffe=\r\nrent?  If they are different, check that the substrates and related paramet=\r\ners are the same (using YourNetworkEvalutor.substrate can help with this is=\r\nsue).\n\nLet me know how things go,\nDavid D&#39;Ambrosio\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel_kuppitz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; No, I use the same params.tx=\r\nt in each project. But what I found out now is that I&#39;ve mixed up the const=\r\nructor parameters; instead of passing the 9 as the output neuron parameter =\r\nI passed it as the hidden neuron parameter. After changing that I got one O=\r\nutOfMemoryException after another. There&#39;s a bug in Substrate.cs in line 13=\r\n3:\n&gt; \n&gt; for (uint outputs =3D 0; outputs &lt; outputCount; output++, coordinat=\r\nes[2] +=3D outputDelta)\n&gt; \n&gt; should be\n&gt; \n&gt; for (uint outputs =3D 0; output=\r\ns &lt; outputCount; outputs++, coordinates[2] +=3D outputDelta)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m quite=\r\n sure that I never touched this line of code. Unfortunately my initial prob=\r\nlem is back - the visualizer produces different outputs. I surely overlook =\r\nsomething, I have just no idea what it is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2009/11/=\r\n29 Daniel &lt;daniel_kuppitz@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The confusion deepens.
