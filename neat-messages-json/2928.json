There&#39;s no point i=\r\nn having more \nthan one.\n\n&gt; 2) Would there be any advantage in adding a fea=\r\nture where NEAT\n&gt; could mutate node types from hidden to bias - i.e. to inc=\r\nrease the\n&gt;  overall chances of more links from bias nodes being created ?\n=\r\n\nI don&#39;t know, but I doubt, you&#39;d find any advantage in evolving node \ntype=\r\ns in that manner.  It seems destructive to the network.\n\nIf you&#39;d like to i=\r\nncrease the chance of more links from the bias \nnode, then you can simply d=\r\no that in your mutation code.\n\n&gt; 3)Lastly, (there may be no right answer to=\r\n this one, but if there \nis a\n&gt; convention in NEAT I would like to follow i=\r\nt) If I start with an\n&gt; initial  population of genomes, each fully connecte=\r\nd to the outputs,\n&gt; then perturb the weights, before dong any crosssover/mu=\r\ntations - is\n&gt; that population at that stage referred to as generation zero=\r\n or\n&gt; generation one?\n\nNah..  I wouldn&#39;t worry about this in your implement=\r\nation.  There are \nconsiderably more difficult problems to solve.  For exam=\r\nple, I&#39;m \nfinding that Ken&#39;s papers leave out quite a few implementation \nd=\r\netails, and that ultimately you&#39;ll have to look at his code to \nderive the =\r\nentire algorithm.\n\nNEAT is a wonderful invention - it&#39;s just not completely=\r\n documented.  \nI&#39;m working toward that documentation goal myself.\n\n--Steve\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
