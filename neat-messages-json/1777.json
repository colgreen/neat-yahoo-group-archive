I&#39;m still a little confused about why the\n&gt;mean structure suddenly plummets at the start of each pruning phase? \n&gt;Wouldn&#39;t you expect it to go down gradually as structure is removed\n&gt;bit by bit?  How could everything instantaneously become less complex\n&gt;(the way it looks in the graph)?  I&#39;m probably misunderstanding\n&gt;something..\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThere are a few factors to consider here. Firstly the drop isn&#39;t \ninstantaneous in the strictest sense, the graph represents 32000 \ngenerations performed over 90 minutes. Looking at the raw data I can \ntell you that the apparently near-instant drop in complexity typically \ntakes about 200 generations. On the other hand it is very fast relative \nto the rate at which complexity is accumulated during complexification, \nthis could be due to a couple fo factors. During pruning phase the \ngenome selection routine changes slightly, so instead of sorting the \npopulation (actually each species) by fitness alone, I sort by fitness \nand then secondary sort on complexity, this therefore increases the \nselection pressure for smaller genomes. In addition the Simple-OCR \nproblem domain is a very simple type of problem that relies almost \nentirely on making connections directly from inputs to outputs, and this \n(I would suggest) means that there are very few interdependencies \nbetween neurons and connections and this in turn means that it is far \neasier to remove accumulated redundant structure without having a \ndetrimental effect. This idea ties in with some observations on other \ntypes of problem where the pruning phase is a lot less effective at \nremoving structure.\n\nTo get a better feel for what is going on I would encourage you to do a \nquick run with the Simple-OCR domain and watch the &#39;best genome&#39; window \nas the search passes through a pruning phase. You can literally watch \nthe structure being stripped away within a matter of seconds.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
