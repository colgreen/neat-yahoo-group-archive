I think it is also quite fast and I have some plans that I will\n&gt; elucidate on in my next message that could significantly speed it up.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve also built a little tool to run the saved result network and\n&gt; generate a CSV file. So you can load the times series as a graph in\n&gt; excel and visualize the results of your networks prediction compared\n&gt; to the original time series.\n&gt;\n&gt; It has plenty of work that needs done on it. But I figured I might\n&gt; create a Sourceforge page and post it if anyone is interested?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shane\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
