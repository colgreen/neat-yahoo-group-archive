Maybe I&#39;m just lucky that way :)\n\nOkay, so here are some more untested thoughts on the subject...\n\n&gt; then the network may not process the item at the same cardinal position in the list in the same\n&gt; way, ...  in which precise positions are not important or only relative relationships matter...\n\nAh, and I think you&#39;ve hit on something we can do safely assume, I\nthink. If we have a variable sized list as input then absolute\nposition should not matter. If absolute position did matter, then we\ncould either:\n - take all the absolute positions that did matter and create a fixed\nwidth input\n - transform it into a variable length input made up of data and position tuples\n\nSo... I would suggest that cardinal position is irrelevant in this\ncase since if it was important, we could transform the input into a\nfixed width input, or a variable input where cardinal position doesn&#39;t\nmatter.\n\nWhat I&#39;m trying to do then is have something that is capable of\nsummarizing the data in every possible way and find the ways that are\nmost important. So it should be able to:\n\n - find any linear combination of all the data\n - find how many transitions across a set of thresholds\n - find the percentage of inputs that are greater than/less than/in\nbetween a set of thresholds\n - find patterns across thresholds\n - find patterns of change\netc.\n\nSo, is there a way to have the above accomplished with variable sized\ninput... ie. would the network generalize between 0.25 and 0.2 and\n0.33 in a desirable way?\n\nAnother thing to consider is adding additional &quot;coordinates&quot;. If I\nremember right, it seems that the checkers example mentioned including\nx, y, and distance from the center as inputs to the CPPN. Similarly,\nlet&#39;s say for example the first and last items in a variable sized\nlist are particularly important. We could add another coordinate that\nwas -1 for the first item in the list, 1 for the last, and 0 for all\nin between.\n\n"}}
