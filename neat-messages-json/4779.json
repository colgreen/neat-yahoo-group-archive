That means starting in a very high-dimensional search s=\r\npace for no principled reason, which means search gets off to a very slow s=\r\ntart.  However, the idea that you start small and go through phases of addi=\r\nng genes and deleting them is reasonable and has been shown effective by so=\r\nme on this group, like Colin Green and Derek James. \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; just watched th=\r\nis video about human genes:\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dyr428fhp64I\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; it says that:\n&gt; an amoeba has 4,000,000 genes\n&gt; a grain of rice has ar=\r\nound 40,000 - 50,000 genes\n&gt; and a human genome has around 25,000 genes.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; also i have found (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_DNA/) that 95% of g=\r\nenes in human genome are junk (like disabled genes in NEAT?) \n&gt; So, a worth=\r\nful ammount of gene in a genome would be around 1,250 genes?\n&gt; \n&gt; How it is=\r\n possible, that a complex specie like human being has so little genes and a=\r\n prehistoric amoeba has so many genes? \n&gt; The only conclusion i can make fr=\r\nom here, is that instead of starting from a null genome and increase the nu=\r\nmber of genes we should start with a lot of random genes and work on method=\r\ns to reduce the number of genes while conserving the same(or increasing) fi=\r\ntness.\n&gt; Or, we should start with null genome and grow the genome until the=\r\n fitness stops improving, and then work on optimization of the genome until=\r\n genome is reduced in size, when genome is not reduced anymore, we should s=\r\ntart adding genes again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just an idea.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
