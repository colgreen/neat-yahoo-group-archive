We have a few\nregulars who tend to =\r\nproduce a number of pictures in bursts and then\nreturn a few days or weeks =\r\nlater, and we also have a steady stream of\nnew people who tend to come in, =\r\npublish a few pictures, and then never\npublish anything again.  In terms of=\r\n actual numbers, maybe about 10-25\npictures are published each day.  There =\r\nare almost 6,000 total\npublished images after 1.5 years, so that gives you =\r\na sense of\nactivity overall.  Daily activity has increased over that time, =\r\nbut\nnot by that much.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that many more people v=\r\nisit and browse\nthe site than actually publish something.  Another chunk of=\r\n visitors\nsave images privately but never publish them publicly (we can see=\r\n how\nmany images are saved that are not published).  It seems many people\nt=\r\nake public publishing seriously.\n\nBranching does seem to lead to better ima=\r\nges in people&#39;s opinion. \nOnly 1.87% of the 482 top-rated images were evolv=\r\ned within 20\ngenerations.  So that would suggest that some level of complex=\r\nity is\ncorrelated to quality.  However, it is also evident that some\nrelati=\r\nvely simple pictures are quite appealing.  You can now look at\ncomplexity l=\r\nevels (in terms of nodes and connections) in the detailed\nview.  It is clea=\r\nr that some of the top-rated images are relatively\nthe most complex.  For e=\r\nxample this &quot;planet&quot; has almost 500\nconnections: http://picbreeder.org/sear=\r\nch/showgenome.php?sid=3D5776\n\nI think what people appreciate is (1) being a=\r\nble to recognize the\nimage as something familiar, (2) complexity, (3) regul=\r\narity. \nInterestingly, 2 and 3 are in conflict, which means you don&#39;t want =\r\ntoo\nmuch of either (e.g. total irregularity means high complexity).  So I\nw=\r\nould say that there is some minimum level of complexity when things\nbecome =\r\ncompelling, and that beyond that other factors come into play.\n Still, we m=\r\nay see a new order of complexity evolve if we wait long\nenough that is even=\r\n more impressive.\n\nAbout the custom products: This option is not popular at=\r\n all.  People\nare simply not buying products based on these images.  That&#39;s=\r\n okay to\nme because I like to show people the custom products option more\nb=\r\necause of the *ideas* it generates rather than to make money: People\nstart =\r\nto see the commercial potential of interactive evolution.  But\nthe use of t=\r\nhe option itself has been disappointing so far.  We do not\nknow why that is=\r\n.  Perhaps people don&#39;t realize it&#39;s available, or\nperhaps they are concern=\r\ned with quality like you.  Or maybe they are\nwaiting for the holidays :)  B=\r\nut I do think it&#39;s important to think\nabout what it would take to get peopl=\r\ne to buy evolved products.\n\nI did buy a shirt and a mug myself with Picbree=\r\nder images on them\nbefore we made the custom products option available to s=\r\nee what it\nwould be like.  The quality was good in my opinion.  Zazzle gets=\r\n\nultra-high-resolution versions of the images (because CPPNs are in\neffect =\r\ninfinite resolution we can send them to Zazzle at any\nresolution) so they c=\r\nome out nice.  The images were properly\nintegrated with the materials and h=\r\naven&#39;t faded.  I am thinking of\nbuying other stuff too.\n\nken\n\n \n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jeffreyclune&quot; &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken-\n&gt; \n&gt; Out =\r\nof curiosity, how is the picbreeder site coming? It appears to\nme that ther=\r\ne is a \n&gt; sustained level of activity, but I was wondering if you guys have=\r\n\nlooked at the stats lately. \n&gt; Do you know about how many people actively =\r\nuse the site on a daily\nbasis? Is use of the \n&gt; site growing, steady, or di=\r\nd it see and early spike and is now\ntrailing off?\n&gt; \n&gt; I also recall that i=\r\nn early discussions of this site, you were\ncurious to see if pictures would=\r\n \n&gt; become much better as the complexity of the networks grew due to the\nma=\r\nny increased \n&gt; generations that would be made possible by an active user b=\r\nase. Have\nyou found that \n&gt; there is, say, a correlation between genome com=\r\nplexity and some\nsuccess criteria (e.g. \n&gt; rank or num_branches)?\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nability to purchase images on stuff like shirts and mugs is also\ncool. Have=\r\n you found \n&gt; that a lot of people are doing that? Also, I am thinking of d=\r\noing so\nmyself. Is the quality \n&gt; pretty high? For example, does your firef=\r\nly look good on a mug?\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I am asking is mostly curiosity. I a=\r\nm interested to know\nhow much the general \n&gt; public gets...and stays...enga=\r\nged in these types of very cool,\nsocial, web 2.0 experiments. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Chee=\r\nrs,\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
