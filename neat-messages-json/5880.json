Do you mean evolving a network to perform a sequence of acti=\r\nons, or perhaps evolving a network that learns a sequence during its lifeti=\r\nme, or something else (such as learning the predict the next value in a seq=\r\nuence)?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;martin_pyka&quot; &lt;martin.pyka@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would ask the community for good sequence learning problems th=\r\nat can be used to train neural networks. I think, a maze-navigation problem=\r\n is probably a good starting point to study sequence learning. But what oth=\r\ner problems have been used in the literature to study sequence learning?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Martin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
