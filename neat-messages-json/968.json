NEAT\nmitigates the impact of adding a neuron by making the incoming weight\n1 and the outgoing weight the same as the previous connection...but a\nnonlinearity has been added where there was none before.\n\n&gt; Yes I see your point. Expressing all of the junk in the phenotype may\n&gt; work to some extent but it wouldn&#39;t be very efficient. \n\nI don&#39;t think it would work very well at all.  You mentioned birds\ncarrying around dinosaur DNA.  Obviously, they don&#39;t actually express\nall of that DNA.  To do so would not only be inefficient, it would\nmost likely be fatal.\n\n&gt; Well my code includes disabled genes in determining compatibility, and\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure I based this on Ken&#39;s NEAT code/papers. Perhaps what we\n&gt; need then is some library of structures external to the population of\n&gt; genomes. A new mutation could be to randomly insert pieces of structure\n&gt; from this library into a genome. That way you get the as-yet-unproven\n&gt; benefit of &#39;junk DNA&#39; without the baggage of having to carry it around\n&gt; in the genomes. If a useful &#39;chunk&#39; is found then it then becomes part\n&gt; of a genome and subject to propogation through the population through\n&gt; the normal means of crossover and asexual reproduction.\n\nYes, that&#39;s a possibility.  Some other neuroevolutionary techniques\nalready sort of work this way.  SANE actually builds genomes (I think\nit calls them &quot;blueprints&quot;) from pools of genetic material.  Joseph&#39;s\nmodular NEAT also keeps a seperate pool of subnets that can mutate\ninto new offspring.\n\nBut in each of these, the stuff kept in the pool is continually\nevaluated to weed out the junk.  I think the general principle holds\nthat the more untested junk you have, the larger its going to make\nyour search.\n\n&gt; &gt;Right...but the useless structures are not generally kept around.  You\n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t see organisms with lots of useless organs or appendages just\n&gt; &gt;waiting to become useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Well that&#39;s not entirely true. If the useless appendages hinder the\n&gt; organism or require a significant resources to grow and/or maintain then\n&gt; individuals with these characteristics will be selected against over\n&gt; time. But if the appendages aren&#39;t too expensive and aren&#39;t getting in\n&gt; the way then they can indeed stick around. One that comes to mind is the\n&gt; human appendix, and I&#39;ve never found my little toe to be all that\n&gt; useful. Well Ok you did say &#39;generally&#39; - these &#39;extras&#39; are mostly\n&gt; special cases. I agree with the general priniciple that organisms don&#39;t\n&gt; carry around loads of  appendages in the hope that one might become\n&gt; useful, like some biological equivalent of a swiss army knife :)\n\nWell, I said &quot;generally&quot;, but I also said &quot;lots&quot;.  Of course there are\ninstances of vestigial organs, but they are often small, withered, and\nnegligible.  They are not doing enough harm to the organism to be\nstrongly selected against, and the likelihood they they will become\nadaptive again at some later stage of evolution is remote.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
