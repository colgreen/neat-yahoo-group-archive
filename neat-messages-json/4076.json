Using novelty search with a g=\r\nenerational GA may \ncause\n&gt; the dynamics of novelty search to be hurt. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The reason a generational GA may not work as well is that novelty\n&gt; searc=\r\nh uses an archive of past behaviors plus the behaviors of the\n&gt; current pop=\r\nulation to calculate the novelty scores. In a \ngenerational\n&gt; GA, this will=\r\n lead to large discrete changes in the novelty \nlandscape\n&gt; (as the entire =\r\npopulation changes at once), and will complicate the\n&gt; search process. The =\r\ngradients of novelty may completely change with\n&gt; each passing generation, =\r\nand lead to little global progress in the\n&gt; search for novelty. A possible =\r\nsolution would be simply *not* to\n&gt; include the current generation in the n=\r\novelty scores with a\n&gt; generational GA.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, this also has a downs=\r\nide: without the population being\n&gt; included in the novelty scores, there w=\r\nould then be no impetus for\n&gt; novelty search to maintain a behaviorally div=\r\nerse population \n(although\n&gt; NEAT&#39;s speciation functions may cause this to =\r\nnot be disastrous).\n&gt; Without a behaviorally diverse population, there may =\r\nbe \na &quot;forgetting&quot;\n&gt; problem where the novelty search population converges =\r\non a \nparticular\n&gt; area of the behavioral space, and other previous areas o=\r\nf novelty\n&gt; space no longer have representation in the population (potentia=\r\nl\n&gt; stepping stones have been lost). To combat this problem, you could\n&gt; in=\r\ntroduce an operator that will clone individuals from the archive \nof\n&gt; past=\r\n behaviors, and place them back into the population.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may be easier/=\r\nmore effective to extend whatever NEAT distribution\n&gt; you are using to be s=\r\nteady state, or switch to the rtNEAT \ndistribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I am about to implement my first novelty search experiment but I \n&gt; &gt; enc=\r\nountered a problem I need to ask you about.

So in effect, even if nothing is ne=\r\nw \n&gt; &gt; historically,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the population is still repelling itself away fr=\r\nom where it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; currently.  That means that over time the population w=\r\nill kind \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dance around the behavior space until it hits a stepping=\r\n stone \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something different.  It could take a long time, but at le=\r\nast \nit \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never just sit still and &quot;give up&quot; the way fitness-=\r\nbased \nevolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tends to do when it converges prematurely.  Novelty =\r\nsearch never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;feels&quot; like it has found an optimum because it is effec=\r\ntively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coevolutionary and always looking to break free.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThere also may be something more active we can do to push it out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beyo=\r\nnd this inherent dynamic.  Maybe there is a method of \ndetecting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n things are not diversifying well anymore and then pushing \n&gt; &gt; things\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; out.  Yet we would need to be careful because simply e.g. \nupping the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mutation rate might make things worse by knocking our \npopulation off\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the current set of behaviors back to something more primitive.  \n&gt; &gt; St=\r\nill,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since this research direction is in its infancy, I&#39;d guess \nther=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; end up many creative ideas for dealing with various bad \n=\r\nsituations,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just as people have come up with all kinds of tricks to d=\r\neal \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pathologies in fitness-based search. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than=\r\nks for this great post again, it answered many questions \nand \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; helped me get more insight in the philosophy behind NS. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One qu=\r\nestion I have, how we could deal with stagnation even \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty =\r\nsearch, i.e. when every new genome happens to be a \nknown \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behavior=\r\n?

I&#39;m going to start with a technical \nresponse \n&gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move to=\r\n philosophical.  It&#39;s a bit of an essay but \nhopefully \n&gt; &gt; worth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your first set of questions regard=\r\ns the relationship \nbetween \n&gt; &gt; novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search (NS) and exhausti=\r\nve search of behavioral space.  Do \nwe \n&gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are effec=\r\ntively the same thing?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s a tricky subject b=\r\nut in the end I would not \nequate \n&gt; &gt; NS \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exhaustive =\r\nsearch.  While NS indeed does attempt to \nessentially \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; visit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; every behavior in behavioral space, the way it does it is \nnot \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as what is usually meant by exhaustive search.  We=\r\n usually \n&gt; &gt; think of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exhaustive search as a purpose=\r\nful enumeration, where if I \njust \n&gt; &gt; try\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every combination of s=\r\nomething, one will be the answer.  A \nkey \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feature\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of thi=\r\ns type of search is that it does not require or \nutilize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; informat=\r\nion or feedback of any kind as a guide.  Rather, it \n&gt; &gt; simply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nakes sure it does not visit the same point twice.  (It is \n&gt; &gt; similar \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; random search except that random search might indeed visi=\r\nt \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point twice.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One clear dif=\r\nference between such a search and NS is that \nwe \n&gt; &gt; cannot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purp=\r\nosefully enumerate all possible behaviors because our \n&gt; &gt; search \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nspace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the genotype space, which maps indirectly to the \nbehavi=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; space. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Therefore, there is actually no way to simply say=\r\n &quot;list all \n&gt; &gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors&quot; and try each one in successio=\r\nn.  We must seek \nthem \n&gt; &gt; out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, in novel=\r\nty search there is *information* \nguiding \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order of point=\r\ns we visit (the information is the novelty \n&gt; &gt; measure). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The po=\r\nints also have an inherent order (perhaps quite \nuseful) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; induced\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the genetic encoding (hence the promise of combining it \nwith\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT). In other words, we are not simply enumerating \nin an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrary non-overlapping order.  Rather, we follow the \nmost \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; promising\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trails that seem to be leading to something new.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One significant consequence of this fact is that the ac=\r\ntual \n&gt; &gt; search\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space (which is the genotype space) will almost =\r\ncertainly \nnever \n&gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be exhaustively searched.  So we ef=\r\nfectively avoided \nwasting \n&gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time examining all kinds of g=\r\nenetic combinations that would \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produced redundant behaviors=\r\n.  In its usual meaning, \nexhaustive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be jus=\r\nt such a search through genotype space.  So \n&gt; &gt; certainly it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is =\r\nnot normal exhaustive search.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet if you still want to=\r\n talk about exhaustively searching \n&gt; &gt; behavior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space, it is sti=\r\nll not a typical exhaustive search because \nof \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; it proceeds in an order guided by information- not typical \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; exhaustive search.  Another corollary is that it is \nimpossible \n&gt; &gt; to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perform a typical exhaustive search of behavior space \nbecause \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no method to enumerate it:  It must be explor=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet you might still say, fine, semantically perhap=\r\ns it is \n&gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different, but still, in spirit are you no=\r\nt essentially \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something equally inefficient, i.e. looking =\r\nfor absolutely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And it is true t=\r\nhat in effect we are searching for every \n&gt; &gt; behavior, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; at least every behavior that looks distinguishable from \neach \n&gt; &gt; other=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with respect to the novelty metric and in an order from \n&gt; &gt; sim=\r\nplicity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high complexity.  Yet therein lies the fundam=\r\nental insight: \n&gt; &gt; While \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a search might sound bad,=\r\n it is a lot better to look at \n&gt; &gt; everything \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some =\r\nmeaningful order) and eventually run across what you \nwant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (perha=\r\nps after a very long time) than to look for one \nspecific \n&gt; &gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and *never* find it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are indeed suggesting that=\r\n this rather tortured choice \n&gt; &gt; (between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking for something =\r\nwithout hope and looking for \neverything) \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes the r=\r\neal choice that we face with the most \nambitious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems.  In ot=\r\nher words, objective-based fitness is \nliterally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doomed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwhen it comes to evolving many incredibly complex systems \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\ncratch.  It will simply never happen because at high \nlevels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nomplexity, there is going to be massive deception at many \n&gt; &gt; levels, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitness becomes as bad as random search in such a proble=\r\nm.  \nIn \n&gt; &gt; fact,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as our results show, you don&#39;t even have to ma=\r\nke the \nproblem \n&gt; &gt; all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard to cause fitness to c=\r\nrumble into something as bad as \nrandom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search.  What do you thin=\r\nk will happen if you are trying to \n&gt; &gt; evolve a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neural network i=\r\nnto the mind of a quantum physicist based \non how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brilliant it is=\r\n at quantum physics?  The answer: Nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A more down=\r\n-to-earth example is the car that I evolved on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Picbreeder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  It could never have evolved if evolving a car had been the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *o=\r\nbjective* because it was preceded by an alien face \n(evolved by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nomeone else).  It just so happens that the alien face is a \n&gt; &gt; stepping\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stone to a car, but if we had judged the alien face on \nit &quot;car-\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ness,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it would have failed miserably and been deleted.  He=\r\nnce if \nwe \n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking for a car we would never have found =\r\none.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In nature, if we had bred flatworms (the earliest=\r\n \nchordates) \n&gt; &gt; based \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their humanity, they too woul=\r\nd have never evolved into \n&gt; &gt; amphibians,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then reptiles, then ma=\r\nmmals, as they did.  The objective in \n&gt; &gt; long-run\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems is t=\r\notally blind to the necessary stepping \nstones.  \n&gt; &gt; Unless \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know them a priori, we are lost.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you su=\r\nppose we have never seen a flowering of \ndiversity \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compl=\r\nexity such as seen in nature in evolutionary \ncomputation?  \n&gt; &gt; In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or 40 years of this field, which is inspired by nature, we \n=\r\nhave \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seen something that comes even close to even =\r\nnature&#39;s modest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; achievements.  The problem is that we have been b=\r\nlinded by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    As soon as we set an objective,=\r\n the stepping stones to \nit \n&gt; &gt; often\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vanish into thin air.  The=\r\nre is no escape from this very \n&gt; &gt; sobering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fact.

I=\r\nt is \ndifficult to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relinquish this feeling of control, yet if we =\r\nrecognize \nthat in \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end the setting of such goals is its =\r\nown worst enemy, then \nwe \n&gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; begin to be liberated from thi=\r\ns longstanding compulsion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Note that I am not saying =\r\nfitness is always useless; \nobviously \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not the case. =\r\n I am talking about very ambitious \nproblems, \n&gt; &gt; beyond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the kin=\r\nd we have been able to solve yet- though even \nthe &quot;hard \n&gt; &gt; maze&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is bordering on such a problem.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You point out that=\r\n novelty search may get &quot;lost&quot; in a kind \nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; endless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off=\r\nshoot in behavior space.  And yes, in some situations, \nit \n&gt; &gt; very \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may.  Yet I believe it will not do so in many interesting=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; domains. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, if there was indeed a long offshoot =\r\nof the \nmaze, \n&gt; &gt; first,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there is a time limit for each ro=\r\nbot, it would make \nlittle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difference and would quickly be filled=\r\n up by novelty \nsearch.  \n&gt; &gt; If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are no obstacles =\r\nin the offshoot, it would be filled \nespecially \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  B=\r\nut at the same time, novelty search is not likely to go \noff \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one direction anyway.  Because it is a population, it wil=\r\nl \ngo \n&gt; &gt; off in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many directions at once.  While some parts may =\r\nshoot down \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diversionary offshoot, at the same time others wi=\r\nll begin \nto \n&gt; &gt; flow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the paths we want.  If it ha=\r\nppens to take the wrong paths, \nit \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fill that areas firs=\r\nt and eventually be pushed back into \nthe \n&gt; &gt; areas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncare about (only if each individual was given infinite time \n&gt; &gt; could it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be stuck in one area forever)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the end, of =\r\ncourse there is a chance it will fail to go \nthe \n&gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way i=\r\nn reasonable time; after all, it has no objective!  In \n&gt; &gt; fact, in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the hard maze experiment, it did once fail to find a \nsolution \n&gt; &gt; in =\r\n40\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; runs.  Yet look at how much more consistent it is than \nfitnes=\r\ns-\n&gt; &gt; based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search.  So the point is not that this is a guarante=\r\ne \n(there \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never be one).  Rather, it is a profoundly di=\r\nfferent kind \nof \n&gt; &gt; search,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is likely to reach places tha=\r\nt fitness-based search \ncan \n&gt; &gt; never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope to touch.  So it open=\r\ns up a whole new world of \n&gt; &gt; possibilities to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary comp=\r\nutation.  That does not mean it solves \n&gt; &gt; everything; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; course it may still not always give us what we want.  There \nis \n&gt; &gt; no\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method that will ever always give you what you want.  Yet \n&gt; &gt; ob=\r\njective\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitness is often even worse.  That is the sobering moral =\r\nof \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So in my view, NS is actually =\r\nsuited for exactly \nthose &quot;large \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spaces&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you sugges=\r\nt it will have trouble in.  And by large I \nmean \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LARGE.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n Those are the ones where objective-based fitness has no \nhope.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are spaces like life on earth, where it would be futile \n(an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; silly) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start with a single cell and select off=\r\nspring based on \nrelative\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; humanity.  The only reason we got to hu=\r\nmans in nature is \nbecause\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nobody said we had to get there.  It&#39;s=\r\n almost paradoxical, \nbut \n&gt; &gt; if \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accept it, it is a=\r\nn exciting liberation.  If we let go of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compulsion to be in =\r\ncontrol, we may find something we did \nnot \n&gt; &gt; expect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is qu=\r\nite significant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So actually the idea of running fitne=\r\nss-based search and \nthen \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search is less excitin=\r\ng to us although we raise it as a \n&gt; &gt; practical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter.  In some=\r\n domains, objective fitness is simply \nimpotent, \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the com=\r\npulsion to have some shred of guidance to hang onto \nis a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; false\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comfort.  We will have to let go, and then, strangely, we \nwill \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where we want to be.  It&#39;s like when your grand=\r\nparents told \nyou \n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you stop worrying so much about ma=\r\nking things work out, \nthey \n&gt; &gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work out on their own.  Did=\r\n you believe them?  Maybe there \nis \n&gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom in it than t=\r\nhere appeared to be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the thought provoking =\r\npaper.

In other words, it entirely abandons \nobjectives \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thereby also abandons fitness functions as the impetus \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; search.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet remarkably, we still show that such an algorit=\r\nhm \ncan \n&gt; &gt; perform\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *better* than one that actually tries to=\r\n achieve the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objective!  I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe this strange resu=\r\nlt has fascinating \nimplications \n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; le=\r\narning, artificial life, and even biology.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lat=\r\nely on this forum we have often discussed the \nnagging \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fitness function often does not properly recognize \nor =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reward the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stepping stones on the way to the solutio=\r\nn.  I went as \nfar \n&gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggesting that the fitness functi=\r\non can become an \n&gt; &gt; *obstacle* to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success (e.g. when we dis=\r\ncussed creativity in \nPicbreeder).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this =\r\ndiscussion was largely philosophical, Joel \n&gt; &gt; Lehman \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to make it concrete and actually introduce an \n&gt; &gt; algorit=\r\nhm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; makes an automated evolutionary process in *=\r\nany* domain \n&gt; &gt; behave \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; humans in Picbreeder, t=\r\nhat is, like open-ended \nevolution.  \n&gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approach is ca=\r\nlled &quot;novelty search.&quot;  The algorithm \nsimply \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; for behavior that is novel with respect to what has \ncome \n&gt; &gt; before.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The benefit of this approach is that it is immu=\r\nne to \n&gt; &gt; deception \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it does not even try to=\r\n achieve the objective.  I know \nit \n&gt; &gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strange but, c=\r\nounterintuitively, we show that in fact \nit is \n&gt; &gt; far \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nandscape than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitness-based search.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In other words, what we are saying is that to achieve \nsome \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ambitious objectives we might have for evoluti=\r\non, we \nmust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abandon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to explicitly achieve th=\r\nem.
