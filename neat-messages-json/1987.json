If the whole does not \nbehave, you cannot extrapolate back to what the error in the neurone \nequations was...\n\n(intrapolate, detrapolate...?)\n\nI assume they plan to use a &quot;realistic&quot; neurone model, e.g. based on \nbiophysics not cybernetics...\n\n         Ian\n\nAt 05:23 07/06/2005, you wrote:\n&gt;It&#39;s interesting they are doing this but it doesn&#39;t sound realistic\n&gt;at all.  Computing power seems to be the least of the challenges\n&gt;in &quot;modeling the human brain.&quot;  We hardly know anything past the\n&gt;primary visual areas, let alone neocortex.
