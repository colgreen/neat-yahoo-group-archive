But things got complicated \nmain=\r\nly because there is no way to make a matrix-like input layer, and \nto place=\r\n the hidden and output nodes in positions that are meaningful. \nAn intuitiv=\r\ne idea is to put the output at the center and the inputs and \nhidden neuron=\r\ns around it, but then it becomes not a visual field, you \nknow, a grid of i=\r\nnputs. The solution was to add an extra dimention and \nto put the hidden an=\r\nd output nodes behind the input layer, not on it. \nI think this is good, ev=\r\nen in reality there are only 3D neural \nnetworks, 2D is just a simplificati=\r\non. \nSomeone had mentioned that a roving eye is a controller and a \nclassif=\r\nier at the same time. I guess it is hard for HyperNEAT to figure \nout how t=\r\no control the eye at first. This is very important. \nCurrently I am trying =\r\nout Jason&#39;s suggestion about it (normalizing the \ninputs to avoid the multi=\r\nplication problem.), but it still doesn&#39;t \nlearn to find the shape on the f=\r\nield. \nPerhaps I should not use a roving eye at all? \n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On May 1, 2007, at 4:51 =\r\nAM, petar_chervenski wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; substrate space is 3D cartesian.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried it on a 2D space?
