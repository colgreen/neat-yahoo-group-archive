The OCR experiment \nwithout \n&gt; pruning usually topped out at about 10 out of 26 characters (best \nresult \n&gt; seen was 16/26 I think). With pruning switched on I see searches \n&gt; consistently attaining 20/26 with a current best of 24/26.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously a lot more details to come on this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
