The \nsimplest answer is that a CPPN can have more than=\r\n a single output.  \nThere can be additional outputs for things like biases =\r\nand learning \nrates.  Each such property will then be patterned across the =\r\nsubstrate \njust like weights.\n\nHowever, the one problem that comes up with =\r\nnodes is that node-centric \nproperties are overspecified by a 4D CPPN becau=\r\nse nodes are specified \nby only two dimensions (that is, they are points in=\r\n space rather than \nlines).  Therefore, you have to set a convention for wh=\r\nen to read the \nvalue of a node-centric output and assign it to a node.  Fo=\r\nr example, \nyou could say that the node at x1 y1 is set to the value of the=\r\n node \noutput only when x2 y2 are both zero.  Of course there are many \nalt=\r\nernative ways it could be done, but some convention must be set.  \n\nken\n\n--=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; \nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi there, \n&gt; I am asking for help. I succesfully implemented HyperNEA=\r\nT as an \n&gt; extension to the rtNEAT C++ package, but now I want to extend th=\r\nis \n&gt; further. I want to evolve leaky integrator networks (CTRNNs) with \n&gt; =\r\nHyperNEAT but I have no idea how to make the CPPN tell what time \n&gt; constan=\r\nt and bias to have for every neuron, because now it takes two \n2D \n&gt; vector=\r\ns (x,y) as an input + bias... There is only one output for the \n&gt; connectio=\r\nn&#39;s weight, but what about the individual neurons? I am \nkind \n&gt; of confuse=\r\nd..\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
