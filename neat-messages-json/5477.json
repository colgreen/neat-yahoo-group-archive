That is, if the controller requests the same tu=\r\nrn direction more than n times in row, simply refuse the request and don&#39;t =\r\nmove the robot.  The result will be occasional frozen robots.  However, the=\r\ny will evolve to deal with this problem, but of course, they cannot use spi=\r\nnning anymore, so whatever they come up with will not involve spinning.\n\nke=\r\nn\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aaandy.doubleaa&quot; &lt;aaandy.doubleaa@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Peter and Ken,\n&gt; Many thanks for the answer, I have been exper=\r\nimenting and I have tried \n&gt; fitness =3D s =95 (c1 - &#92;a&#92;) =95 (c2 - m) =95 =\r\n(c3/d)   \n&gt;  where s The variable S is the speed of the neural agent m/sec\n=\r\n&gt; a is Angular velocity Rads/sec(average )\n&gt; m =3D max sensor value current=\r\nly detected by a sensor.\n&gt; d is distance to the goal\n&gt; \n&gt; c1,c2 and c3 are =\r\nconstants that I can play with to change emphasize of each factor currently=\r\n c1 is 1 , c2 max sensor plus noise and c3 1 for punishment a small distanc=\r\ne to the goal\n&gt; \n&gt; works well but a lot of spinning of the robot \n&gt; \n&gt; Many=\r\n regards Andy \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; You could also weight the importance of the two components to emphasize=\r\n one over the other.  However, in answer to Andy, there is no de facto corr=\r\nect way to write the fitness function; there are several possibilities.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pe=\r\ntar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Try a composite fitness function where =\r\nthe distance between the target has to be minimized (for each time step the=\r\n fitness is MAX_DISTANCE - distance) and collisions with obstacles penalize=\r\nd (subtract a fixed value from the fitness score every time a collision occ=\r\nurs). Add these two and it should work fine, but there are many ways to do =\r\nit, of course. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;aaandy.doubleaa&quot; &lt;aaandy.doubleaa@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello =\r\neverybody, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is my first post and I&#39;m looking for a fitness alg=\r\norithm which can be used in a goal seek and obstacle avoidance within a maz=\r\ne with dynamic objects  all implemented within the NEAT methodology,  is th=\r\nere a de-facto algorithm already defined ?
