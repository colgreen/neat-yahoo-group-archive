It just evolves the network structure; you can activate that structure h=\r\nowever you want.\n&gt; \n&gt; In practice, most NEAT implementations follow the pro=\r\ncedure in the NEAT Software FAQ at http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.htm=\r\nl under question &quot;How are networks with arbitrary topologies activated?&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; To quote from that answer:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The activation function, bool Network::=\r\nactivate(), gives the specifics. The implementation is of course considerab=\r\nly different than for a simple layered feedforward network.  Each node adds=\r\n up the activation from all incoming nodes from the previous timestep. (The=\r\n function also handles a special &quot;time delayed&quot; connection, but that is not=\r\n used by the current version of NEAT in any experiments that we have publis=\r\nhed.) Another way to understand it is to realize that activation does not t=\r\nravel all the way from the input layer to the output layer in a single time=\r\nstep. In a single timestep, activation only travels from one neuron to the =\r\nnext. So it takes several timesteps for activation to get from the inputs t=\r\no the outputs. If you think about it, this is the way it works in a real br=\r\nain, where it takes time for a signal hitting your eyes to get to the corte=\r\nx because it travels over several neural connections. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So basically t=\r\nhe activation routine does not make any distinction between feedforward or =\r\nrecurrent connection:  On each timestep, activations travels the length of =\r\none connection from every node.  Whether the connection points backwards or=\r\n forwards doesn&#39;t matter.  This approach thus is somewhat easy to program.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; However, there is some controversy on whether this approach is always =\r\nbest (in terms of computational efficiency) and there are alternatives for =\r\narbitrary-topology networks.  This issue has been discussed on this group i=\r\nn the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;snapmedown&quot; &lt;snapme=\r\ndown@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mean resolve as in actually getting from inputs to =\r\noutputs.
