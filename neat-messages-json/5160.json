To add on =\r\nto Joel&#39;s response, you also asked whether there are more insights now into=\r\n novelty search than when the original paper was published.  Actually, the =\r\nresearch in this area has continued and we have studied a number of more sp=\r\necific questions on why novelty search works and under what conditions.  We=\r\n do hope to have these studies  published before long.  There are also a co=\r\nuple new papers on the subject coming out soon that extend it in various wa=\r\nys, which you may find interesting.  So yes there will be more insights com=\r\ning and our understanding of the phenomenon is expanding over what it was i=\r\nn 2008.\n\nSeveral others have also made some interesting investigations on i=\r\nt in recent years, including Jean-Baptiste Mouret&#39;s &quot;Novelty-based Multiobj=\r\nectivization&quot; (http://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mouret/papers/novelty_based_mul=\r\ntiobjectivization.pdf) and our 2009 paper, &quot;How Novelty Search Escapes the =\r\nDeceptive Trap of Learning to Learn.&quot; (http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications=\r\n/2009/risi.gecco09.html)\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;lehm=\r\nan.154@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The basic concept of novelty search is to expl=\r\nore the space of behaviors in a particular domain. This is accomplished by =\r\nrewarding individuals that display behaviors that are different from those =\r\nseen prior in a search. \n&gt; \n&gt; In contrast, fitness-based search will genera=\r\nlly reward individuals according to some fixed measure of progress. A signi=\r\nficant benefit of novelty search when compared to fitness search is that no=\r\nvelty search is not generally susceptible to the problem of &quot;deception&quot; whe=\r\nre following the gradients of the fitness function lead to dead-ends in the=\r\n search space. Deception is the reason that fitness functions must often be=\r\n carefully crafted and tweaked in order to solve difficult problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nnterestingly, sometimes exploring the behavior space may lead novelty searc=\r\nh to find the solution to a problem, though it was not directly trying to. =\r\nCounter-intuitively, it may consistently be faster at finding the objective=\r\n than an objective-based search in deceptive problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Searching for b=\r\nehavioral novelty is different from an exhaustive search of the genotype sp=\r\nace for many reasons. As you wrote, many genotypes may map to the same beha=\r\nvior; novelty search may avoid many of these equivalent behaviors because o=\r\nnce that area of behavior space has been thoroughly explored, it will not r=\r\neward individuals displaying those behaviors, and will instead focus search=\r\n on variations of genotypes that are demonstrating more novel behaviors.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In addition, the domain itself imposes limits on behaviors; for example,=\r\n physics constrains our behaviors, we cannot walk through solid objects. Fu=\r\nrther, demonstrating novelty may often require learning about a domain. For=\r\n example, to appear novel, a maze navigational robot may need to learn abou=\r\nt walls and how to avoid them . In fact, this is what happens in the maze d=\r\nomain explored in the ALifeXI paper. So, novelty search may be in some sens=\r\ne about transferring information from the domain into genotypes.\n&gt; \n&gt; An ex=\r\nciting aspect of novelty search is that the search is open-ended and can po=\r\ntentially continue endlessly finding novel behaviors that may grow in compl=\r\nexity. While a fitness-based search may have little to do after it has solv=\r\ned a particular problem, novelty search can continue to find new behaviors =\r\neven after it is has uncovered a solution.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope that this addresse=\r\nd some of your questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lior_fainshil&quot;=\r\n &lt;lior_fainshil@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I read the original article and thread abo=\r\nut novelty search and found it very interesting. It would be interesting to=\r\n hear if there are better insights about the idea now.\n&gt; &gt; In particular I =\r\nwant to understand how is the novelty search better than a systematic or a =\r\nrandom search of the genotype space. A brute force search of the genotype w=\r\nill certainly run on many occasions into the same phenotypes. The question =\r\nis to what extent can novelty search avoid this and does it have other bene=\r\nfits?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ps.\n&gt; &gt; I attended Ken&#39;s tutorial on developmental systems o=\r\nn GECCO2008, and in my opinion, it was by far the best presentation I saw o=\r\nn that conference. That&#39;s how I got introduced to NEAT. Now I decided to ta=\r\nke a look at it again and I am finding many interesting ideas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
