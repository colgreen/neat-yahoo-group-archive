T=\r\nhat one can choose whether to have\n&gt; threshold values in the nodes or a bia=\r\ns node, i.e they serve the same\n&gt; function?\n&gt; \n&gt; When I read literature on =\r\nneural networks, some mentions this\n&gt; threshold value when explaining the i=\r\nnput and weight summation\n&gt; calculation for a node, i.e. not the: activatio=\r\nnFunction((sum(W*I)))\n&gt; but the: activationFunction((sum(W*I)-Threshold)). =\r\n\n&gt; Biological neurons have thresholds so perhaps its used to more closely\n&gt;=\r\n model this behaviour, in conjunction with a fire-not fire output model\n&gt; f=\r\nor the nodes?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;p=\r\netar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Gaussian function fits just as well =\r\nas all other possible \n&gt; &gt; activation functions. OK well think of the bias =\r\nlike a shift of the \n&gt; &gt; function. The graph doesn&#39;t have to be centered ar=\r\nound the X=3D0 \n&gt; &gt; vertical axis. It may be shifted left or right. This is=\r\n what the bias \n&gt; &gt; does. It is possible to find a functioning neural netwo=\r\nrk without \n&gt; &gt; using any bias, depending on the domain, of course, but I t=\r\nhink in \n&gt; &gt; most cases it is essential, at least it speeds up the search t=\r\nowards \n&gt; &gt; finding a solution. There is evidence that evolution can use ev=\r\nen \n&gt; &gt; regular inputs as bias values, when they are just being the same al=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; the time (I refer to the Automobile Crash Prediction System that Ken=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; developed, using visual images as input instead of laser \n&gt; &gt; rangefi=\r\nngers). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Correy Allen=\r\n Kowall&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;coolbeanskowall@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How about Gaussian acti=\r\nvation function?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;pet=\r\nar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You refer to the bias value th=\r\nat is usually present in the NN \n&gt; &gt; nodes in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; most models. In NEAT=\r\n there is a bias input which has a constant \n&gt; &gt; value \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of 1.0. The=\r\nre is clear advantage for using it, otherwise the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hyperplanes that=\r\n the nodes represent would all cross the origin \n&gt; &gt; of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypers=\r\npace, which is limiting the possible behaviors the NN can \n&gt; &gt; have. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; But not all nodes in NEAT have a connection to the bias node. \n&gt; &gt; Evolu=\r\ntion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connects nodes to it when only when it is useful. In this way=\r\n the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; search space is further minimized, NEAT does not have to sear=\r\nch \n&gt; &gt; for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proper bias on every node. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, in Hype=\r\nrNEAT substrates, it is better to have a bias in \n&gt; &gt; every \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neuron=\r\n anyway, then the biases will be &quot;drawn&quot; by the CPPN. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pet=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stig.bergestad&quot; &lt;stig.ber=\r\ngestad@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hello!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was wonderi=\r\nng if the original NEAT(c++) used/uses threshold \n&gt; &gt; values\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for =\r\nnode activation?
