However, much of this focus has been on exploring alternati=\r\nve paradigms such as novelty search.  In contrast, this new paper aims to e=\r\nxpose directly some of the most serious problems with objective-based searc=\r\nh itself, both practically and philosophically.\n\nThe message is not only th=\r\nat objectives may not be the best way to drive evolution.  Perhaps deeper t=\r\nhan that, the results suggest that the usual way we evaluate our algorithms=\r\n, i.e. by giving them a task and seeing how reliably they can solve it, may=\r\n be flawed in the sense that it may not actually be accurately measuring th=\r\ne real potential of such algorithms.  We probably should rethink whether de=\r\nmanding the same result over and over again with 100% reliability is really=\r\n a good way to ascertain the potential an evolutionary algorithm.  The pape=\r\nr gives the full story.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
