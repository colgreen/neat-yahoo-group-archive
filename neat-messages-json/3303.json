The node placement schemes can be implemented in a similar \nway as vector=\r\n graphics is. Ken, I will do some study on these \nalgorithms. \n\nI already h=\r\nave a substrate class, capable of generating a parralel \n(layered, like mos=\r\nt drawings of backprop nets), circular and a matrix-\nlike layers of nodes i=\r\nn 3D, given the node counts for each layer. \nI&#39;ll add spherical, cubic and =\r\nperhaps even random such schemes. \n\nI like the idea of taking apart the sub=\r\nstrate from the CPPN-NEAT \nstuff. They are no similar things at all. It suc=\r\nks to have your \nexperimental application generate the substrate in some al=\r\ngorithmic \nway. \nThere should be a stand-alone app that deals with substrat=\r\nes, and \nanother one that runs the evolution and is experiment-specific. Th=\r\nis \nis more flexible. \n\nI am currently running experiments with leaky-integ=\r\nrator networks, \nthe CPPNs have 3 outputs and when the biases and time cons=\r\ntants are \ncomputed, the (x1, y1, 1.0) are used only (others are set to 0.0=\r\n). \nThis was a suggestion that Ken told me, and I want to thank him for \nth=\r\nis, because I see this is the right way to evolve node properties \nalong wi=\r\nth connections with the same connective CPPN :) \n\nSo the GUI I am planning =\r\nwill possibly include CTRNN substrates as \nwell. \n\nAs soon as I have it wor=\r\nking, I will send the application & source in \nthe files section. I appreci=\r\nate any help with this from our \ncommunity. \n\nPeter\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Ken Lloyd&quot; &lt;kalloyd@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken and Petar,\n&gt;  \n&gt; If I unde=\r\nrstand correctly what you are trying to accomplish, you \nmight want\n&gt; to lo=\r\nok a force-directed graph placement algorithm for node \nplacement given\n&gt; c=\r\nonnection nodes.

There have been great strides in reducing \nthe t=\r\nime\n&gt; complexity in these algorithms, and these may be expanded (with \nlitt=\r\nle\n&gt; adaptation) to n-dimensional cubes (and with a little more effort \nsep=\r\narable\n&gt; n-dim Hilbert spaces, or Riemann spaces).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Genome graphs may =\r\nbe then be presented in a GUI in OpenGL or \nDirectX.
