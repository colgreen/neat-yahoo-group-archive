At the extreme, the fitness function can be the\nentire behavi=\r\nor characterization (which means we try to get all\npossible fitness scores,=\r\n which is similar to Hutter&#39;s\nfitness-uniform-selection method).  Our preli=\r\nminary experiments\nsuggest that if you only use the fitness function as the=\r\n behavior\ncharacterization then that does not work as well as a more robust=\r\n\nbehavior characterization.  Yet combinations of behavioral and fitness\ninf=\r\normation may be useful and are an interesting subject for research.\n\nNature=\r\n has a sort of &quot;fitness function&quot; in the sense that everyone\nmust physicall=\r\ny reproduce to maintain a lineage.  Yet this fitness\nfunction does not meas=\r\nure progress towards any particular goal, so it\nis different than the objec=\r\ntive-based fitness used most often in EC,\nwhere we measure progress to a go=\r\nal.  The one in nature is more of a\n&quot;threshold condition&quot; for being allowed=\r\n to continue a lineage.  It\nmight be interesting to impose something like t=\r\nhat on a novelty search\ntoo, in combination with the novelty metric\n\nken\n\n-=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; It is possble to keep only the recent behaviors (not the whole \n&gt; his=\r\ntory). I believe this is apropriate since when you reach that \n&gt; point when=\r\n comparing to the archive becomes very slow, the search \n&gt; would be far awa=\r\ny from the initial behaviors anyway and the \n&gt; probability of going backwar=\r\nds therefore should be minimal, unless \n&gt; there is simplification (pruning)=\r\n of the genomes. \n&gt; One thing to ask is, is it possible to incorporate a ki=\r\nnd of \n&gt; objective function into the behavior characterization, but not tak=\r\ning \n&gt; that fitness score into consideration when individuals are selected?=\r\n \n&gt; The search should then focus on getting different fitnesses every \n&gt; ti=\r\nme, no matter high or low. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;M=\r\nattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;mattias@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But is this real=\r\nly true?  As I mentioned, we have run novelty \n&gt; search\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in these maze=\r\ns where the behavior is around 400 dimensions, which \n&gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from (x,=\r\ny) on each timestep.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While this is encouraging, I don&#39;t think yo=\r\nu&#39;ve actually \n&gt; tested &quot;full&quot;\n&gt; &gt; dimensions. If it requires 100.000 tests=\r\n to solve a maze with a \n&gt; size of\n&gt; &gt; NxN pixels, a maze of NxNxN voxels s=\r\nhould require (sqrt(100.000))\n&gt; ^3=3D31.6\n&gt; &gt; million tests, simply because=\r\n you now have a vastly larger space to\n&gt; &gt; search. Add another dimension to=\r\n that and you&#39;re cozying up to 10 \n&gt; billion\n&gt; &gt; tests. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The fact =\r\nthat storing every visited x,y over 400 timesteps does&#39;t \n&gt; require\n&gt; &gt; man=\r\ny more tests indicates that the path space for NEAT is fairly \n&gt; uniform\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in these tests, though it certainly could have exploded, it didn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nrobably for the reasons you suggest of complexification, try a \n&gt; sligthly\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; different path and you end up somewhere else, filling up the search \n&gt; =\r\nspace\n&gt; &gt; of possible ending positions pretty fast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This wouldn&#39;t =\r\nand couldn&#39;t happen in a volume (for lack of a better \n&gt; word)\n&gt; &gt; with man=\r\ny more dimensions. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus the space of possible trajectories is a=\r\nstronomical.  Yet \n&gt; even so,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with that type of characterization, the=\r\nre was no performance hit \n&gt; (in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiments not yet published).  Wha=\r\nt do you think that implies?  \n&gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you really feel that one astronom=\r\nical space is more expensive than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; another?  For example, we might hav=\r\ne a 3 dimensional maze with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar number of timesteps, but that w=\r\nould simply increase the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dimensionality of behavior from 400 to 1200.=\r\n  Those are still both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely high dimensional characterizations. =\r\n If moving from 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dimensions to 400 doesn&#39;t hurt, why would moving fr=\r\nom 400 to \n&gt; 1200?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do think that the two spaces are uncomparab=\r\nle. I&#39;ve tried to \n&gt; speculate\n&gt; &gt; on why, but I think that your explanatio=\r\nn ultimately is the correct \n&gt; one,\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s related to complexification. B=\r\nut adding another true dimension\n&gt; &gt; increases the problem search space by =\r\na great factor.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, we are talking about comparing already-=\r\ncharacterized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors, so the &quot;n&quot; in O(n^2) is not the same &quot;N&quot; tha=\r\nt is in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; O(N) for number of evaluations.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No, N grows st=\r\neadily and at one point the test of whether the \n&gt; solution is\n&gt; &gt; truly no=\r\nvel will take longer than the actual test itself. granted, \n&gt; you&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; be =\r\nin the range of hundreds of millions of tests before that \n&gt; happens, but\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; beyond that point, progress will steadily decrease. Actually, it \n&gt; stea=\r\ndily\n&gt; &gt; decreases from the first novelty inovation, but too slowly to be \n=\r\n&gt; noticable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Comparing two strings is not as expensive as evalua=\r\nting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an individual.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Two strings, no, comparing 1 string t=\r\no N strings will become \n&gt; expensive for\n&gt; &gt; very large N.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; O(N^2) =\r\nlooks good for small N. Then, suddenly; whammo! Simplest \n&gt; method,\n&gt; &gt; usi=\r\nng a bucket hash method with K buckets, you reduce the problem \n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nO(N^2) to O((N/K)^2), which is still O(N^2). So for large N, you&#39;re \n&gt; stil=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; stuck. That&#39;s for very large searches though.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; with regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; mattias\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
