At that point, if the phenomenon is truly reproducible across replic=\r\nate evolutionary runs (w/ different seeds), then we already have a simple q=\r\nualitative metric: How many replicates reproduced the phenomenon. Of course=\r\n, that is a weak qualitative analysis, but if other measures are lacking, i=\r\nt would still be more informative than saying, &quot;this technique worked once =\r\n(here&#39;s a video).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s only true if you can quantitatively measure =\r\nthe phenomenon. **If** you can do that, then of course you should report qu=\r\nantitative metrics on it (with p-values, effect sizes, etc.). But my point =\r\nis about results that you can&#39;t quantify. Should they be categorically excl=\r\nuded because they resist quantification? \n&gt; \n&gt; For example, are the 3D shap=\r\nes produced by CPPNs on EndlessForms interestingly different from those pro=\r\nduced by L-Systems? Are the images on Picbreeder.com more complex and nuanc=\r\ned than--or at least, interestingly different from--the images from Dawkins=\r\n&#39; Biomorphs? I think the answer is clearly yes, but any attempt to quantify=\r\n that would be a wasted exercise: the quantification would be full of probl=\r\nems, and you&#39;d spend a lot of time forcing a quantitative assessment of som=\r\nething that is patently obvious to every human being. Why force ourselves t=\r\no jump through that wasteful, and unhelpful, hoop?\n\n(Oops. I just noticed t=\r\nhat I wrote &quot;weak qualitative analysis&quot; instead of what I meant, &quot;weak quan=\r\ntitative analysis,&quot; in the paragraph above.)\n\nIf we can&#39;t quantify what we&#39;=\r\nre trying to show, then what are we really showing? At that point, it&#39;s mor=\r\ne of a proof of concept (&quot;hey look! this works in my model!&quot;) than a contri=\r\nbution to scientific knowledge. Proofs of concept are great to see so peopl=\r\ne know we have it working, and are best presented as a poster or late-break=\r\ning abstract. A proof of concept by itself probably won&#39;t be enough content=\r\n to properly fill a full-length paper.\n\nIn the example you bring up, what d=\r\noes the statement, &quot;the 3D shapes produced by CPPNs on EndlessForms [are] i=\r\nnterestingly different from those produced by L-Systems,&quot; actually tell us?=\r\n I agree that such a statement would be difficult to quantify because it is=\r\n a hollow statement (which touches on my section about hypothesis construct=\r\nion). What about the shapes makes them interestingly different? What is it =\r\nabout the underlying architecture that made the shapes interestingly differ=\r\nent? Answering those questions would lead to a quantitative measure out of =\r\nnecessity.\n\nIn short, if a statement can&#39;t be quantified, then it probably =\r\nhasn&#39;t been refined enough.\n\nCheers,\nRandy\n\n\n"}}
