But wh=\r\nen a CPPN produces weights for an ANN, the result (substrate) must be an AN=\r\nN. If each node of the substrate is not perceptron type (i.e does not have =\r\na sigmoid activation function), then we can not call it an ANN, right ? It =\r\ncould be called as some sort of an &quot;expression tree&quot;? And if it does not ha=\r\nve many hidden layers, it would represent a simple (repetitive, symmetrical=\r\n, etc) expression. A &#39;simple expression at large scale&#39; if it is dealing wi=\r\nth large number of connections. \nPlease correct me if i am missing somethin=\r\ng.\nThanks\nNikolai\n\n\n\n\n"}}
