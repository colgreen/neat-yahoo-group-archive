Note that the talk is mostly aimed at those wh=\r\no are more familiar with or partial to other techniques (so it isn&#39;t really=\r\n aimed at people in this group who already like the idea of neuroevolution)=\r\n, but it still may be interesting as an example of trying to motivate what =\r\nwe do to people from outside the area.  In particular, I tried to argue tha=\r\nt learning methods that focus on a single key principle (like deep learning=\r\n or reinforcement learning) can&#39;t be the whole story because of the high ch=\r\nance that any fundamental principle will nevertheless still need to vary in=\r\n innumerable subtle ways across the substrate of the brain:\n\nhttp://www.you=\r\ntube.com/watch?v=3DAbRrZ4IAVuY\n\nThere is also a question-and-answer session=\r\n at the end.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
