It&#39;s a bit of a concocted scenario but there it is.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I outlined in a previous mail my simulations where I let the agents \n&gt;decide on what they thought was sexually attractive, and how that gave \n&gt;rise to child-eaters. Child-eaters have many children, because a lot of \n&gt;the energy they spend on having children is regained when they eat their \n&gt;offspring. But as the child eaters quickly took over the population, it \n&gt;would quickly be wiped out. Lots of fun! Die, child-eaters, die!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nMattias, I think I&#39;m going to have to question the motives behind your \nexperiments :) They&#39;re not purely scientific are they :)\n\n&gt;I also tried sexual selection, where the sex of the offspring was \n&gt;determined genetically (not 50-50). As you may have guessed, being a \n&gt;male turned out to be very popular, because of the amount of energy \n&gt;needed for each child (tiny compared to that of the female). The \n&gt;population became heavily dominated by filandering males, and thus the \n&gt;population died out. My papa was a rolling stone...\n&gt;\n&gt;Population dynamics is a delicate thing, and great fun to play with.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDisturbingly, it&#39;s likely that nature has played out similar strategies \nover the last 3 billion years or so - give or take 500 million years :)\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
