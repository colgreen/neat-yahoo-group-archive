However, I have some concerns about\n&gt; the experiment=\r\nal design in this paper:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) You appear to be manipulating two variable=\r\ns at once.  (a) whether the\n&gt; EA has an objective and (b) whether there is =\r\na human in the loop.  Surely\n&gt; you have to pick only one at a time and cont=\r\nrol for everything else, right?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Furthermore, if it&#39;s IGA v. GA an=\r\nd &#39;interestingness&#39; is the evaluation\n&gt; criteria, that ain&#39;t a fair fight. =\r\n Why should I believe there is more to it\n&gt; than that?\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) How do we kn=\r\now that intermediate objectives are in any way significant\n&gt; to discovering=\r\n interesting pictures in Picbreeder?  I have a sneaking\n&gt; suspicion that to=\r\ntally random search, followed by focused objective based\n&gt; search when some=\r\nthing &#39;pops&#39; might be just as effective, and that the\n&gt; &#39;intermediate objec=\r\ntives&#39;, while certainly necessary to find a *particular\n&gt; * image, are not =\r\nvery helpful in general to finding interesting images.\n&gt;  If so, this is no=\r\n chink in the armor of objective based search.  I suppose\n&gt; without interme=\r\ndiate objectives there can be no exaptation, but does that\n&gt; matter?  What =\r\npercentage of evolved features in biological organisms have\n&gt; any exaptatio=\r\nn at all in their history?\n&gt;\n&gt; (4) Finally - and this is the big one - one =\r\nof the deadly sins of Science\n&gt; is claiming a result as the objective a pos=\r\nteriori, a point which eludes\n&gt; even some very famous scientists.  It&#39;s wha=\r\nt allows publications like this&lt;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/f=\r\neeling-the-future-is-precognition-possible/&gt;, which\n&gt; &#39;prove&#39; psychic pheno=\r\nmena by mining data for &#39;statistically significant&#39;\n&gt; results.  The problem=\r\n is, a result isn&#39;t significant unless you were\n&gt; specifically attempting t=\r\no confirm it when the experiment was designed (i.e.\n&gt; always follow up expl=\r\noratory experiment with a confirmatory experiment!).  I\n&gt; heartily endorse =\r\nexploring for/marvelling at results you weren&#39;t initially\n&gt; looking for, bu=\r\nt one should never use such results as the basis for any sort\n&gt; of comparis=\r\non.  In the case of the eye experiment, who cares if the GA\n&gt; couldn&#39;t evol=\r\nve the eye?  The IGA can&#39;t either, and the fact that it already\n&gt; did is im=\r\nmaterial!  I could be persuaded that the IGA is better at evolving\n&gt; intere=\r\nsting images, but I do not believe it&#39;s any better at evolving the\n&gt; &#39;eye&#39; =\r\n(or &#39;dolphin&#39;, or &#39;apple&#39;).  In fact, I would bet that&#39;s it&#39;s *worse\n&gt; * at=\r\n evolving those specific images, intermediate objectives\n&gt; notwithstanding.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, though I have a lot of doubts about this particular paper, I r=\r\neally\n&gt; appreciate these sorts of research directions.
