I need t=\r\no \nexplore the possibilities of the method more before I have any hard \ncon=\r\nclusions. But here I will try to address most issues about it. \n\nI am conce=\r\nrned with the fact that my particular method may not \nencompass all possibl=\r\ne patterns, but only a small subset. There are \nmany limits having a role i=\r\nn this model, and if I remove these limits, \nthis easily leads to huge arra=\r\nys of cells coming out from very simple \nCPPNs, or a sudden loss in phenoty=\r\npic variety. But generally the \npossibilities for the density patterns are =\r\nunlimited. The only limits \nare the constraints of the internal physics wor=\r\nld they grow up in as \nwell as the limits of the individual cell&#39;s &quot;program=\r\ns&quot;. \n\nI am not sure if there is really non-growth method for evolution of \n=\r\nsubstrates, because of the reasons I highlight below.\n\nI want to talk again=\r\n about the general issue. I am sorry if I repeat \nthis too much. In fact, I=\r\n want to try to summarize the whole thing, \nthe problem that is common to o=\r\nbject development and substrate \ndevelopment with CPPNs. I believe that the=\r\n problem is near to be \nsolved but it should be clear what exactly is the p=\r\nroblem. \n\nThere is a difference between size and complexity. Complexity is =\r\n\ndescribed in an infinite precision. The CPPN does it. But in reality, \nin =\r\na physics world (where objects are to be evolved), or a loose \ngeometric re=\r\npresentation of the physics world (where neural substrates \nare to be evolv=\r\ned), body size and density information is needed. \n\nSome people may ask why=\r\n. First, having huge density early in evolution \nis unnecessary and expensi=\r\nve, because the complexity is low anyway. \nSecond, by having the substrate =\r\n*configuration* evolve by itself, the \nencoding can exploit the physics wor=\r\nld indirectly via the development \nand perhaps discover very minimal soluti=\r\nons early and later elaborate \non them. \n\nFor example, consider the HyperNE=\r\nAT food gathering task. It is evident \nthat the circular substrate takes mo=\r\nre structure to evolve and be \nexploited effectively. But if HyperNEAT can =\r\narrange the substrate by \nitself, it should be able to discover both the ef=\r\nfective configuration \nand the wiring very early in evolution, which would =\r\nspeed it up. But \nthis is only my thought, it may not be true, we should re=\r\nally see it \nis proven experimentally. \n\nSo, back to size/complexity. We ca=\r\nn actually use any body size and \ndensity to approximate that complexity in=\r\n one final body at certain \nlevel of detail. No matter what the density is =\r\nor how many cells there \nare, complexity is constant. So far only humans de=\r\ncide body size and \ndensity. \n\nThere are several questions coming out of al=\r\nl this: 1) Can CPPNs \npotentially encode body size and density information =\r\njust like they do \nencode body complexity, 2) If they do, to what extent, i=\r\n.e. is it \nlimited to a small subset of densities or potentially infinite (=\r\nwhich \nis the solution that I am looking for). \n\nSee, they are excellent at=\r\n generating patterns in space. But in a \nrealistic physics world, the high-=\r\nlevel patterns have to be \ninterpreted in the appropriate way. The raw CPPN=\r\n output has just \neverything needed, but the pattern itself cannot *effecti=\r\nvely* \ndescribe quantity/density of matter. And more, because substrates an=\r\nd \nphysics bodies are structures with finite size, all these patterns \nhave=\r\n to be interpreted in a special way, completely different than a \nsimple ma=\r\npping from a higher-dimensional space. This is because an \nisomorphic mappi=\r\nng like in HyperNEAT does not contain information \nabout quantity of struct=\r\nural components, i.e. if I query for 100 links \nin 4D or 6D they are still =\r\n100 links mapped back to 2D for example. \nAnd I am basically allowed to que=\r\nry for links/points anywhere in  \nspace, which I can&#39;t do in physics. \n\nThe=\r\n ideal solution is such that *all* possible patterns from a CPPN \ncollapse =\r\nto isomorphic finite-sized bodies in the physics world. No \nexceptions - in=\r\ntroducing exceptions is the wrong way to solve the \nproblem. Plus, the over=\r\nall shape of the body and its internal \nstructure (i.e. complexity) should =\r\nbe the same regardless of density \nand body size. \n\nI know that it is actua=\r\nlly trivial to have another output that \nspecifies matter density. But the =\r\nrange of possible densities vs. \nmeaningful evolution dynamics is a bit uns=\r\natisfying. I remember one \nprevious discussion we had about substrate evolu=\r\ntion and I agree that \na slight mutation should not make it jump from, say =\r\n10000 nodes -&gt; 100 trillion. So there should be some kind of scaling for th=\r\ne range of \ndensities that are acceptable in the domain. Plus, this does no=\r\nt meet \nthe requirement that the produced body should be finite in size for=\r\n \nall possible patterns of the CPPN.\n\nIt looks like we should ask nature fo=\r\nr an advice again. Here is one \nobservation. From the biggest animals to th=\r\ne smallest (actually most \nmulticellular forms of life but not all), whales=\r\n, elephants, humans, \nmice and insects, all start development from one smal=\r\nl cell. OK the \ncells can vary in size among species but they all start fro=\r\nm one very \nsmall cell. But the phenotypes vary in size and complexity, it =\r\nis \nobvious. It looks like that DNA can encode huge complexity and body \nma=\r\nss as well as little complexity and mass, and all of it unfolds from \nthe s=\r\nimple egg-cell. And DNA instructs that egg on how to unfold. \n\nHere is one =\r\nlogical idea based on that observation. If we assume that \nthe quantity/den=\r\nsity of matter and overall body size can be somehow \nrepresented as a patte=\r\nrn in space, then, in order to have this variety \nof phenotypes, like with =\r\nonly 1 or many many structural components \n(call them cells), that entire p=\r\nattern has to be &quot;folded&quot; into one \nspot and then left to unfold as specifi=\r\ned in the pattern itself, its \ninternal &quot;program&quot; of how to unfold. \n\nBut I=\r\n am afraid that my approach with the egg does not solve the \nproblem when a=\r\n slight mutation can bump up the substrate density too \nmuch. Hope is not l=\r\nost, though - it is the general idea that we can \nmake a pattern in space f=\r\nolded in such a way that it describes \ninstructions for development. If don=\r\ne the right way, a slight change \nin the pattern should not lead to a huge =\r\nchange of matter quantity. It \nactually depends on the interpretation of th=\r\nat pattern. I am still \nlooking for ways to achieve this. As you see I trie=\r\nd some, but there \nare more possibilities that need to be explored. General=\r\nly I believe I \nam on the right way this time. \n\nHere is one insight I just=\r\n had right now. The same class of object can \nactually be allowed to grow i=\r\nn varying sizes, depending on the \n*inputs* to the CPPN. Considering the fa=\r\nct that plants can grow to \ngigantic sizes if boosted with the proper nutri=\r\ntion. So body size can \nbe made relative to the inputs of the CPPN somehow.=\r\n Then we can drop \nbody size as something we ask the CPPN for, but provide =\r\nit or make it \ndependant on the environment. A big tree and a small tree of=\r\n the same \nspecies is still a tree, so forget about size, only the complexi=\r\nty and \nthe finite nature of the body have to be inside the encoding. \n\nThe=\r\n method with the egg that I described earlier implements this idea \nin a ve=\r\nry limited way. But I am sure it is something that is worth \nexploring.\n\nPe=\r\nter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I begin to wonder if this is the right thing for evol=\r\nving \n&gt; &gt; substrates or I was misled by the desire to have this Alife stuff=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; working or probably I forgot the basics again.. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter, I was curious that you said you are now not sure if your \nmetho=\r\nd\n&gt; is the right way to evolve substrates.
