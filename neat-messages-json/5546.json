The first paper reveals an impor=\r\ntant insight into how novelty search can be combined most effectively with =\r\na more traditional objective.  Many have suggested making novelty in effect=\r\n one objective and fitness in effect another in a multiobjective context.  =\r\nHowever, this paper shows that there is a big downside to having a global o=\r\nbjective, even when combined with novelty search, because it precludes all =\r\nkinds of interesting niches that are not necessarily competitive at being g=\r\nlobally optimal.  Instead, the paper proposes that objective competition in=\r\n the presence of novelty search should only be among *similar* individuals =\r\n(i.e. it should be &quot;local&quot;).  That way, through the combination of novelty =\r\nsearch and competition, numerous interesting and diverse niches proliferate=\r\n in a single run, which is an important goal artificial life systems.  In f=\r\nact, this approach can produce wide ranges of competent artificial creature=\r\ns in just one run that past such experiments would have taken numerous runs=\r\n to produce.  A video montage from a single run is here: http://eplex.cs.uc=\r\nf.edu/ns/vc.html\n\n\nThe second paper shows how removing objectives impacts e=\r\nvolvability.  If you think about it, this result is intuitive:  If evolutio=\r\nn selects for behavioral novelty, then lineages that are good at producing =\r\nsuch novelty (i.e. evolvable lineages) will be favored.  The paper further =\r\nshows that self-adaptation, which has been popular yet sometimes performed =\r\ndisappointingly in the EA literature, works much better under novelty searc=\r\nh than under objective-driven search, in part because of selection for evol=\r\nvability. \n\nI think ultimately where the evidence is pointing is not that n=\r\novelty search in its pure form is the answer to every problem, but rather t=\r\nhat novelty search is itself an important stepping stone to a variety of mo=\r\nre exotic approaches that treat the objective in nontraditional ways with i=\r\nnteresting implications.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
