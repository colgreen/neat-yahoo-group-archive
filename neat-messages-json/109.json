It is probably\n&gt; quite difficult since it involves long term \n&gt; accurate and discrete memory.  But the input\n&gt; representaiton,\n&gt; i.e. how you represent the cards to the network,\n&gt; is probably a major issue.  And it&#39;s not clear what\n&gt; the right way would be, so it needs careful\n&gt; consideration\n&gt; since some representations are likely impossible for\n&gt; an ANN to\n&gt; deal with.  But I think it&#39;s quite an interesting\n&gt; experiment,\n&gt; and I hope someone tries it out.  I am unfortunately\n&gt; \n&gt; involved in plugging NEAT into too many experiments\n&gt; at\n&gt; the present time, but if you put your code in the\n&gt; files section of this board, hopefully someone will\n&gt; take\n&gt; interest.  If I find time I might play with it\n&gt; myself.\n\nOK, done.  There are two ASCII files, concen.c &\nconsubs.c.  They are to be compiled and linked with\nany C compiler.  Yes, I think this will be very\ndifficult for most ANN topologies.  I expect to start\nwith a deck of only 4 cards of 2 different kinds!\nBut I want to see if we can develop ANNs that truly\nfunction as universal Turing machines.  If I can&#39;t\nsucceed with the usual ANN topologies I thought I\nwould make a memory peripheral that the ANN can use.\n\nAbout the inputs & outputs, I&#39;m envsioning 2 input\nlines for every card position.  One would be binary to\ntell whether there is a card there or not.  The other\nwould go through steps of 1/N to identify the card.\nOr I might use all binary with N+1 lines for each\nposition.  So a deck of 6 cards of 3 kinds would have\n24 binary input lines.\n\nOutputs would be one for each card position, the one\nthat goes high indicates which card to expose.\n\nm\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
