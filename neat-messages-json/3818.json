My question is if you think it is a good idea to try\nencouraging=\r\n a network to divide a problem into smaller sub problems\nand then solve it.=\r\n\n\nThis is my thought:\n\n- Let say that every neuron has 3 coordinates (x,y,z=\r\n) \n- Assuming that you can tell which neurons were performing well in one\ne=\r\npoch \n(Backprop run, network weights that didn&#39;t have to be changed much et=\r\nc)\n- All those nodes should &quot;gravitate&quot; towards each other\n- Nodes close to=\r\n each other have a higher probability to form a\nconnection.\n\nThe result sho=\r\nuld be a network that in someway tries to be modular.\nNext step should be t=\r\no see if it is possible to do individual training\nof different areas of the=\r\n network.\n\nI mean when you learn math and when you are painting, different =\r\nareas\nof the brain is active.\n\nComments?\n\nBr,\nChristofer\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n"}}
