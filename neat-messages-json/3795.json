Please don&#39;t hesitate to l=\r\net me know if problems of\nthis sort still occur.\n\nTwo representation method=\r\ns are in place:\n\nWindowed, in which a window around PacMan constitutes the =\r\ninputs.\nEach tile in the window (except under PacMan himself) has an input\n=\r\nassociated with dots/walls, power pellets, and ghosts. Users can\nselect whi=\r\nch inputs are used through the parameters file.\n\nGlobal, in which details o=\r\nf the maze are used as inputs, e.g.,\nPacMan&#39;s X and Y coordinates, ghost X =\r\nand Y coordinates, ghost state,\npower pellet state, presence of walls or do=\r\nts around PacMan. Again,\nthe specifc inputs used are selectable through the=\r\n parameters file.\n\nI hope this can be useful and/or entertaining.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
