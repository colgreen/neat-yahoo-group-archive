They indeed help with this =\r\ntype\nof speculation.  You make a sound mathematical case about point\ndistri=\r\nbutions, yet I believe at the same time that they can also be\ninterpreted t=\r\no support my hypothesis:\n\nYou note that the walls get nearly filled close t=\r\no the starting\nposition, but that this density peters out farther away.  Ye=\r\nt you do\nnot any further tackle the question of why this density is peterin=\r\ng\nout.  My hypothesis with respect to complexification ascending through\na =\r\nset of heuristics suggests that this petering out is the key\nphenomenon, an=\r\nd that it is indicative of the fact that vast swaths of\npossible trajectori=\r\nes are never (and would never need to be) considered.\n\nNow that I look at t=\r\nhe two graphs from novelty search, thanks to you\nfocusing me on them, I thi=\r\nnk that even the difference between the two\nof them provides further eviden=\r\nce for this view.\n\nIn both graphs, as you note, the immediately accessible =\r\ncorridors from\nthe starting position are filled along the walls.  These rep=\r\nresent to\nme the most trivial (linear) heuristics, i.e. &quot;turn and run&quot; in s=\r\nome\nsimplistic function of sensory inputs.    \n\nYet what&#39;s very interesting=\r\n is that the two mazes exhibit different\nphenomena after that.  In the medi=\r\num map, the density even in the next\ncorridor decreases significantly, and =\r\nin fact, in corridors after\nthat, it is extremely sparse.  This rapid decli=\r\nne in density indicates\nthat NEAT is ascending through heuristics that repr=\r\nesent general\nprinciples that involve the &quot;weaving&quot; concept needed to run t=\r\nhrough\nthe maze.  Notice that it can do this because the maze is repetitiou=\r\ns\nin a way that allows a fairly compact concept to describe the solution\nbe=\r\nhavior.  The significant decrease in density supports the idea that\nNEAT is=\r\n not coming close to enumerating all possible behaviors and is\nrather lifti=\r\nng the heuristic to higher levels of generality, which\nhappens to be a grea=\r\nt way to escape to novel behaviors in this maze.\n\nHowever, in the hard maze=\r\n, you see something different: Even after one\nor two turns into different e=\r\nnclosures, the density on walls remains\nhigh.  My interpretation of this fa=\r\nct is that the arbitrary meandering\nof this maze does not allow for a simpl=\r\ne general heuristic to get from\none enclosure to the next, and therefore NE=\r\nAT ends up having to go\nthrough less heuristic-like and more enumerative-li=\r\nke behaviors.  In\nother words, it has to learn specific directions like &quot;go=\r\n straight\nthen turn turn then go straight then..etc..&quot; which precludes it f=\r\nrom\ngaining an advantage with lower levels of complexity that could\ndescrib=\r\ne general navigation strategies.  Nevertheless, we see that in\nthe compartm=\r\nent just before the compartment with the goal, density\nindeed finally decre=\r\nases (for example see the sparseness in the\nupper-right of the right boundi=\r\nng wall of the maze and above the lower\nwall of upper-right compartment), s=\r\nuggesting that it is beginning to\nhit on some heuristics that are general e=\r\nven in this more arbitrary maze.\n\nThus these depictions seem to support my =\r\noverall hypothesis:  The more\nregular the domain, the less density will be =\r\nencountered over the\nentire space of behaviors.   After all, what makes the=\r\n medium maze\n&quot;medium&quot; for a *novelty* search?  Why should it be an &quot;easier&quot;=\r\n for a\nmethod that is not trying to do anything in particular?  The answer =\r\nis\nthat its solution involves a kind of behavioral regularity, and is\nthere=\r\nfore encountered earlier as the complexity bucket fills from\nbottom to top.=\r\n\n\nThus it appears there are again two interpretations of the result. \nWhen =\r\nI see the medium map density graph, I see an analogy for any\nproblem where =\r\nas soon as we find a general heuristic we begin to\nescape at a rapid rate i=\r\ngnoring vast swaths of the behavior space\n(because they would be more compl=\r\nex to represent).  And the good news\nis that most interesting problems shou=\r\nld have some heuristic\nproperties, from the regular ambulation of a virtual=\r\n creature to the\nregular rules of a game like checkers.  Yet even in the ha=\r\nrd maze,\nsome generalities (though more complex ones) do begin to take hold=\r\n,\nand density drops accordingly.  Overall, then, the equations that\nguide t=\r\nhe increase in # evaluations should not increase simply\naccording to surfac=\r\ne areas and open volumes.  Rather, it would depend,\nas it should if novelty=\r\n search is to succeed, on generality.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nMattias Fagerlund&quot; &lt;mattias@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken, \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking at the pictu=\r\nre in the paper that describes where different\n&gt; novelties have ended up su=\r\nggests that walls get nearly completely filled\n&gt; close to the starting posi=\r\ntion, petering out significantly further\naway. \n&gt; \n&gt; The open areas are lig=\r\nhtly filled with novelties increasing in tight\nspots\n&gt; and decreasing furth=\r\ner from the starting position. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, if we extend that behaviour to th=\r\ne third dimension, which was where\n&gt; my reasoning started even though I was=\r\nn&#39;t too clear about that in my\n&gt; conversations, it would appear that a (sqr=\r\nt(X))^3 would be close to the\n&gt; expected consequence;\n&gt; \n&gt; Walls, now areas=\r\n, would be almost uniformly filled (increased from lines\n&gt; to ^2). Empty ar=\r\neas, now volumnes, would be sparsely filled (increased\n&gt; from area ^2 to vo=\r\nlume ^3). \n&gt; \n&gt; That would indicate that some of the novelties would expand=\r\n X^(3/2) and\n&gt; some would expand X^2, which might make the resulting sum wo=\r\nrse than\n&gt; (sqrt(X))^3.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand your explanation that not the ent=\r\nire search space is\ngoing to\n&gt; be searched due to the complexification natu=\r\nre of NEAT, but that doesn&#39;t\n&gt; enter into the computation if what I say abo=\r\nve is correct. Extending the\n&gt; current behaviour in 2D (which allready inco=\r\nrporates the advantage you\n&gt; descrive) into 3D should look similar to the 2=\r\nD result, and therefore\n&gt; require that many more novelties to be visited.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If some additional effect would occur making the 3D version look\n&gt; sign=\r\nificalty different from the 2D version, then all bets are off, but\n&gt; specul=\r\nating about that seems a wee bit... speculative?  ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; mattias=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
