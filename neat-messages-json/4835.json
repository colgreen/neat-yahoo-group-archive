The idea that there are &quot;huge classes of problems where pure Novelty =\r\nsearch will not work&quot; misses that it is a shock that it works in any seriou=\r\ns domains at all!  Would you really expect a method that does not even know=\r\n what it is looking for to solve *anything* better than fitness-based searc=\r\nh?  Yet in fact we have been accumulating more and more domains where it do=\r\nes better.\n\nNevertheless, of course there are domains in which it will perf=\r\norm poorly.  Yet the onus here should not be on novelty search, which does =\r\nnot purport to try to solve anything at all.  What I think is more interest=\r\ning is the embarrassing result that fitness-based search is so inept agains=\r\nt an algorithm that does not even know what it is looking for.  The whole t=\r\nhing is more of an indictment on the way we have been conducting search, an=\r\nd the way we have been interpreting learning algorithm results, than it is =\r\nan endorsement of novelty search as the solution to all problems.  \n\nFor ex=\r\nample, in the past, when fitness-NEAT attempts to solve a problem and fails=\r\n, we would have said the problem is NEAT.  Yet when novelty-NEAT solves the=\r\n same problem seamlessly, the lie of the original interpretation is reveale=\r\nd.  In fact, there are many negative results for many algorithms that we sh=\r\nould be questioning in light of novelty search.  We have been assuming that=\r\n the fitness-based paradigm *is* learning, when it is only a small sliver o=\r\nf what learning can be.  \n\nI also do not think that expanding the maze 100 =\r\ntimes would cause much problem, besides needing individual evaluations to l=\r\nast 100 times longer.  But the number of evaluations needed to evolve a sol=\r\nution would be about the same.  Taking away the walls would cause it to nee=\r\nd more evaluations, but I don&#39;t see it really causing a fundamental problem=\r\n.  So I would dispute that it is as brittle as you say.\n\nBut the insight I&#39;=\r\nm raising is not about that anyway.  It&#39;s about the flaw in concluding too =\r\nmuch from an attempt to optimize an objective about what a particular algor=\r\nithm can accomplish.   If novelty might take longer without the walls, fitn=\r\ness will be even worse (longer time in deceptive traps).  In some sense, we=\r\n are flirting with the futility of all of search.  Novelty+fitness MOEA is =\r\nlikely a solution to some problems that neither one can solve alone, so it&#39;=\r\ns a promising idea, but I think novelty search is significant for more than=\r\n being a solution to something.  It is a symptom of a major interpretive pr=\r\noblem that stretches back into EC history.\n\nken  \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jean-Baptiste-\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for writ=\r\ning this paper. It is really interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it is particularly f=\r\nascinating how well Novelty + Fitness\n&gt; Multiobjective competed with pure N=\r\novelty search on a problem designed to\n&gt; showcase the benefits of Novelty s=\r\nearch.\n&gt; \n&gt; My original instincts regarding Novelty search were that it was=\r\n a great way\n&gt; to overcome deception, but that there are huge classes of pr=\r\noblems where\n&gt; pure Novelty search will not work (e.g. take the problem you=\r\n and the\n&gt; original novelty search paper used, make it 1000 times larger, a=\r\nnd get rid\n&gt; of the bottom and left walls up to the first walls that jut in=\r\n). I had\n&gt; thought that a combination of Novelty + Fitness would be able to=\r\n handle such\n&gt; problems well, which your results strongly imply. Your paper=\r\n suggests that\n&gt; you will conduct tests on such problems. Have you tried th=\r\nat yet?

It&#39;s about novelty search and, since=\r\n we\n&gt; &gt; talked a lot about it on this mailing-list, it could interest some =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here is the paper:\n&gt; &gt; http://chronos.isir.upmc.fr/~mo=\r\nuret/papers/novelty_based_multiobjectivization.\n&gt; &gt; pdf\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Abstract:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   Novelty search is a recent and promising approach to evolve\n&gt; &gt;   neu=\r\nro-controllers, especially to drive robots. The main idea is to\n&gt; &gt;   maxim=\r\nize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency.\n&gt; &gt;   However, aban=\r\ndoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical\n&gt; &gt;   in many context=\r\ns. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective\n&gt; &gt;   evolutionary algorit=\r\nhm is employed to reconcile novelty search with\n&gt; &gt;   objective-based optim=\r\nization by following a multiobjectivization\n&gt; &gt;   process. Several multiobj=\r\nectivizations based on behavioral novelty\n&gt; &gt;   and on behavioral diversity=\r\n are compared on a maze navigation\n&gt; &gt;   task. Results show that the multio=\r\nbjectivizations is better at\n&gt; &gt;   fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty=\r\n search while keeping a\n&gt; &gt;   comparable number of iterations to converge.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; &gt; tel : =\r\n(+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt; &gt; 3 ((4&({*.(=3D+/))++/=3D3:)@([:,/0&,^:(i.3)@|:&quot;2^:2=\r\n))&.&gt;@]^:(i.@[) &lt;#:3 6 2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
