seem=\r\ns that the micro mutations you talk about, if I&#39;m=A0interpreting=A0papers r=\r\night, is one of\n&gt;&gt; the reasons standard NEAT doesn&#39;t handle fractured domai=\r\nn problems well. As you\n&gt;&gt; say, it can&#39;t &quot;get there from here&quot;. It can&#39;t bu=\r\nild enough structure and optimize it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; performance to find a better solu=\r\ntion before that species dies out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually &quot;fractured domains&quot; wasn&#39;t =\r\na term I was aware of, however I\n&gt; just read this:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 Evolving Neural =\r\nNetworks for Fractured Domains (2008), Nate Kohl\n&gt; and Risto Miikkulainen.\n=\r\n&gt; =A0 http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/kohl.gecco08.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; So frac=\r\ntured domains =3D discontinuity. And yes I would say that&#39;s\n&gt; definitely a =\r\nmajor problem with NEAT (not sure about HyperNEAT). I&#39;m\n&gt; interested in the=\r\nir use of radial basis functions, which is something\n&gt; that has been mentio=\r\nned before on this group but not something that\n&gt; I&#39;ve looked into deeply.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is this the problem you&#39;re looking to address here? Or just a method o=\r\nf escaping a local\n&gt;&gt; maxima in fitness by allowing more radical adjustment=\r\ns/growth to network topologies in\n&gt;&gt; general?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well it&#39;s essentially the=\r\n same thing if discontinuity is the reason\n&gt; you&#39;re stuck - which is very o=\r\nften the case I would say. Complex\n&gt; fitness lanscapes are almsot by defini=\r\ntion &#39;fractured&#39; (As an exercise\n&gt; try and think up a complex landscape/dom=\r\nain that isnlt fractured).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One thing I was wondering about, and I have=\r\nn&#39;t poked around to see if anyone has done\n&gt;&gt; some research into, is fiddli=\r\nng with the species die-off parameter. I was thinking it might\n&gt;&gt; be worth =\r\ntrying (if someone hasn&#39;t done it yet), is to remove the species die off if=\r\n-hasn&#39;t-\n&gt;&gt; improved-in X generations bit if no species fitness has improve=\r\nd in some specified\n&gt;&gt; amount of generations.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t expect this to=\r\n be a major issue where we are right now. If\n&gt; a species hasn&#39;t improved in=\r\n a long time then it&#39;s probability of\n&gt; improving in a further equally long=\r\n time is low. Evolutionary\n&gt; techniques constarined by computing resources =\r\nare always a\n&gt; probabilities game - you try and spend your limited CPU time=\r\n searching\n&gt; the areas of the space that have the highest probabilities of =\r\nyielding\n&gt; good solutions. This same argument sort of applies to the idea o=\r\nf\n&gt; increasing populations - from one perspective the size of the\n&gt; populat=\r\nion is irrelevant as you can only evaluate some fixed number of\n&gt; genomes p=\r\ner unit of time. The main effect of pop size is thus to\n&gt; provide a broader=\r\n genetic base to drive genetic crossover and to keep\n&gt; an as diverse as pos=\r\nsible population of search points across the\n&gt; fitness landscape.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I =\r\nthink if you&#39;ve sat with the same &quot;champion&quot; for a large number of generati=\r\nons, it could\n&gt;&gt; be worthwhile to do something radical, like greatly increa=\r\nse mutations,\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. Just generally - if a search is stuck then &#39;do so=\r\nmething else&#39;\n&gt; would seem to be good advice :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure someone has=\r\n toyed with this at some point. I can always use another couple\n&gt;&gt; hundred =\r\nof pages of papers/dissertations to add to my &quot;to-be-read&quot; pile going into =\r\nmy\n&gt;&gt; thesis :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I think others have played with dynamic mutation rate=\r\n. The problem I\n&gt; think is that there may not be any easy routes out of a l=\r\nocal maxima,\n&gt; increasing mutations will sample points a little further out=\r\n than\n&gt; before but it&#39;s potentially clutching at straws in many cases. The\n=\r\n&gt; other way of looking at it is that the encoding space or the fitness\n&gt; la=\r\nndscape (sort of teh same thing) could be changed such that there\n&gt; are eas=\r\nier routes to the good solutions - that&#39;s essentially what the\n&gt; radial bas=\r\nis function paper above is doing - your nets can;&#39; get there\n&gt; from here, s=\r\no use a different type of net.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n"}}
