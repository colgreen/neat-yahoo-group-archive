You wi=\r\nll get better\nresults if, as you increase resolution, single units end up a=\r\nctivating\nmore than one sensor as they would in a real world radar system.\n=\r\n\n2) I would stay away from NERO itself because the graphics and the\nphysics=\r\n are cost prohibitive for many units.  I suggest making a 2d\ncase where all=\r\n of the players are circles (easy collision detection,\neasy distance calcul=\r\nation) and all of the obstacles are convex shapes\n(circles would be even be=\r\ntter).  Then you can fight massive wars with\nthousands of units and not wor=\r\nry about the overhead.\n\n3) Try to use my HyperNEAT implementation (ok, this=\r\n isn&#39;t a real\nsuggestion, more like a shameless plug) :-P\n\nJason G.\n\n\n"}}
