The time stamp does not guarantee that some uninte=\r\nnded matches might happen (e.g. if two separate computers in different plac=\r\nes somehow create a connection at the exact same millisecond since 1970 on =\r\ntheir clocks), but it makes them very unlikely.  \n\nIf I recall right, I thi=\r\nnk this idea is implemented in Dance Evolution:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/da=\r\nnce_evolution/\n\nWe were worried that people might want to trade dancer geno=\r\nmes that they evolved among each other and that it would confuse people tha=\r\nt they could not mate with each other (since they are likely from completel=\r\ny separate runs on different machines).  So I think we did start using time=\r\n-stamp based innovations numbers.\n\nAnother option is pure-random innovation=\r\n numbers, which would also work, but would lose the nice property that inno=\r\nvations numbers record the order that innovations occurred.\n\nken\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; as I und=\r\nerstood, the innovation number that is assigned to each genome is valid onl=\r\ny to run neat on one computer. For example, if i run neat on the same probl=\r\nem on different computers at the same time, the results each will produce, =\r\nwill not be genetically compatible , is that correct? Because if one comput=\r\ner names link node139-&gt;node293 as gene #422, another may name it as gene #1=\r\n2102. So, in order to run neat, say, on 3 computers, I will have to change =\r\nthe function that generates innovation number:\n&gt; //Return last innovation n=\r\number in Genome\n&gt; double Genome::get_last_gene_innovnum() {\n&gt;   return ((*(=\r\ngenes.rbegin()))-&gt;innovation_num)+1;\n&gt; }\n&gt; to shared among all computers an=\r\nd give a unique innovation number for any computer in the set.\n&gt; I am corre=\r\nct?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to all in advance.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
