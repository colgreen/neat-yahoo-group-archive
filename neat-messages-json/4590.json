Any weight above 1.0 will make the \nsignal stronger and =\r\nany weight below 1.0 will make it weaker. Weights \nclose to 0.0 will make t=\r\nhe signal disappear. This is the way ANNs \nignore information. Suppose you =\r\nhave an ANN with all weights set to 0. \nThe output you will get may be stat=\r\nic all the time, but the lack of \nsignal doesn&#39;t mean there is lack of *inf=\r\normation*, since the NN is essentially trained to ignore everything. \nThe m=\r\nathematical model that is used to represent artificial neural \nnetworks doe=\r\nsn&#39;t cover conservation of energy or anything like that. \nIn fact, why you =\r\nwould need such a thing at all? Is there a merit in \nthe approach? I am int=\r\nerested.\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Eric Mohlenhoff &lt;eric.mohlenh=\r\noff@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From my (probably limited) understanding of neurobiolo=\r\ngy, such a\n&gt; conservation of energy principle would not be applicable to th=\r\ne \nmodel\n&gt; of neurons firing. At least not in the sense that I believe you =\r\nare\n&gt; describing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Energy&#39; as it were, is not really &#39;transferred&#39; bet=\r\nween any given\n&gt; neurons in such a system. Neurons only interact via \nneuro=\r\ntransmitters\n&gt; being released into and absorbed from the synaptic cleft bet=\r\nween \nsaid\n&gt; neurons. Electrical energy (which I gather is to what you are\n=\r\n&gt; referring) is confined to within a particular neuron itself. In a\n&gt; prope=\r\nrly functioning neuron, this energy is neither received nor\n&gt; transmitted. =\r\nIn fact, (and I may be mistaken here, so somebody \ncorrect\n&gt; me if I am) I =\r\nbeleive that the effects of such neurological diseases\n&gt; as multiple sclero=\r\nsis are actually precipitated by this electrical\n&gt; energy escaping the cell=\r\n due to a degeneration of the myelin sheath\n&gt; that would normally cover the=\r\n axon of the cell, along which the\n&gt; electrical signals within the cell tra=\r\nvel from dendrite to axon\n&gt; terminal.\n&gt; \n&gt; If it were the case that a conse=\r\nrvation of energy principle was\n&gt; applied to such a model, and the electric=\r\nal signals *were* being\n&gt; transmitted cell-to-cell, this would impose a cei=\r\nling on the number \nof\n&gt; layers possible in the network, degree of recursio=\r\nn in feedback\n&gt; networks, etc. due to what would be inevitable signal degra=\r\ndation to\n&gt; the point of no longer being usable. That is unless there was a=\r\nlso \nthe\n&gt; provision for &#39;repeater&#39; cells/nodes in the network (a concept t=\r\nhat \nI\n&gt; have personally not encountered as of yet).\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, the en=\r\nergy that is &#39;distributed&#39; across connecting \nneurons\n&gt; actually comes from=\r\n within the cell (insert complex/detailed\n&gt; discussion about mitochondria, =\r\nphosphorylation, etc. here... haha),\n&gt; itself being a function of the type,=\r\n amount, and possibly other\n&gt; yet-to-be-discovered properties of the neurot=\r\nransmitters (and \npossibly\n&gt; other chemicals as well) that are within the s=\r\nynaptic cleft at the\n&gt; time that the firing was initiated.\n&gt; \n&gt; A better an=\r\nalogy (I believe) would be the one proposed by a large \nbody\n&gt; of the liter=\r\nature: a single neuron is a black-box function. It takes \na\n&gt; given input (=\r\nabsorbing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft) \nand\n&gt; produces an out=\r\nput (releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic\n&gt; cleft). Any conservati=\r\non of energy principle is resetricted to being\n&gt; applied to the processes o=\r\nccurring within the cell itself, because \nin\n&gt; this (limited) sense the cel=\r\nl is acting as a closed system for that\n&gt; electrical energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this=\r\n helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric\n&gt; \n&gt; PS Anyone, feel free to correct me if any of this is=\r\n off-base or \njust\n&gt; plain wrong too. I&#39;m just going by my cursory understa=\r\nnding of these\n&gt; things, and so could be mistaken about some of this.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOn Wed, Feb 25, 2009 at 8:39 AM, Raymond Von Wahlde\n&gt; &lt;rvonwahlde@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; I have a question relating to the analogy of the interconnected \nnod=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; of an artificial neural net as neurons. A node receives inputs \nthat=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; are fed into an activation function. The activation function \n&quot;fires&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; an output somewhat comparable to a synapse firing. As implemented \nin\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ANN&#39;s, the same output value (its &quot;energy&quot; as it were) from the \nnode is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fed through weighted links to other nodes. What would be the \neffect o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; imposing a sort of &quot;conservation of energy&quot; principal on the ANN?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t it the case that in an actual neural net, when a neuron \nfires i=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; total energy is distributed somehow to its connecting neurons. The\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; total energy received by the connected neurons can not be more \nthan the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; energy generated by the sending neuron. What if in an ANN, the \nvalue\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; coming from a node was split evenly between the outgoing links? \nAnd\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; for the receiving nodes, the sum of the weighted inputs could not\n&gt; &gt; exc=\r\need the total energy generated by the sending nodes. Would \nthere be\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\ny benefit to forcing this restriction on an ANN?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
