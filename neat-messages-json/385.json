So the core of the\ncode is from that, although it&#39;s been much expanded and\nchanged.  I think it&#39;s definitely a good idea to take \nadvantage of available robot simulators, and NEAT should\ndo quite well with most any realistic robot simulator.\nThe one concern is that some simulators are not built for\ntraining, which means that they may not let you turn off\nthe graphics or run in &quot;fast forward&quot; mode.  If you\ncan&#39;t do that, evolution will take forever because each\ntrial has to take place in slow real-world physical time.\nSo you should make sure for any simulator that it allows\nyou to run the simulator without the graphics, or at least\nwith the graphics in extreme fast forward.\n\nTo answer your second question, if NEAT is trained on a\nrealistic simulation of a real physical robot (e.g. Khepera)\nthen the results should be transferable.  In practice, the\ntransfer will not be a perfect and a few extra generations\nof refinement evolution in the real world may be necessary.\nNolfi and Floreano&#39;s book, &quot;Evolutionary Robotics,&quot; addresses\nthe issues of crossover to the real world in detail.  The\nmain problem is that once you enter the real-world, everything\nis constrained by real-world time and so evolution must\nbe necessity proceed at a much slower rate.\n\nI think trying your ANJI NEAT (hmm...how to say it?) with\nrobot simulators would be great.  NEAT is known to be good\nin that kind of domain.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Some of you may have read our previous Tech Report,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Competitive\n&gt; &gt; Coevolution through Evolutionary Complexification.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; That paper has\n&gt; &gt; now been replaced with a much-updated journal paper\n&gt; &gt; in the Journal of\n&gt; &gt; Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), by the same\n&gt; &gt; title.  The newer\n&gt; &gt; paper has been expanded and updated, and includes\n&gt; &gt; significantly more\n&gt; &gt; experimental results.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Cool...thanks for the update, Ken.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m interested to read this updated paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a question about how you implemented your robot\n&gt; simulation.  Did you do all the simulation stuff from\n&gt; scratch?\n&gt; \n&gt; Though we&#39;re primarily concentrating on game domains,\n&gt; we&#39;ve been looking at robot control as well.  There\n&gt; are a few good opensource robot simulators out there. \n&gt; In Java, there are KSIM and TeamBots:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ehrg.cs.wright.edu/ksim/ksim.html\n&gt; http://www.teambots.org/\n&gt; \n&gt; I had previously looked at JRobots, but it is not\n&gt; opensource, and the restrictions for developing the\n&gt; bots is prohibitive for research.\n&gt; \n&gt; KSIM models Khepera robots and TeamBots models Nomad\n&gt; and Cye robots.  TeamBots also includes a SoccerBots\n&gt; package which pits teams of five against one another,\n&gt; and it includes a fairly large range of hard-coded\n&gt; strategies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our focus right now is trying to finally get our NEAT\n&gt; implementation released (we&#39;ve settled on the name of\n&gt; ANJI--Another NEAT Java Implementation), but we&#39;d like\n&gt; to look down the road at a variety of domains to\n&gt; extend it, and robot simulations seem like a pretty\n&gt; interesting domain (but we&#39;d rather not code\n&gt; everything from scratch if we can help it).\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also wondering if any of the NEAT control\n&gt; algorithms that you evolved for your robot control\n&gt; experiments might be portable to a physical robot.  I\n&gt; notice a professor named Peter Stone there at UT\n&gt; Austin who seems to be involved in RoboCup competition\n&gt; with both wheeled and legged robots, both physical and\n&gt; simulated.  Is there any crossover in what you guys\n&gt; do?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
