In order to\nallow \nthe network to search for a hiding strategy, the environment must let\nthe \nagents hide. So the rock they are hiding behind may take 5 degrees of\nthe \nfield of view, and the agent might take 8 degrees of the field of view.\nHiding \nbehind that rock would prove ineffective to perceptive agent in pursuit\n. \nThe environment to me is just as important as the multi agent \naspect. A single agent can use features of the environment to position\nitself \nmore optimally with regard to the other agents. \nI&#39;m particularly interested in the hiding strategy, because I think it\nrequires \nboth a visual type of perception, and some form of memory to remember \na) that it is hiding, and \nb) who it is hiding from. \n\nThe general gist is to randomize the environment during the search, much\nlike the random objects being thrown at the agent in the new version of \nVirtual Humans. \n\n&gt;That said, it is common practice in such &quot;radar&quot;-like sensor systems \n&gt;to have the arcs slightly overlap so you don&#39;t get jumpy transitions \n&gt;when an object moves from one arc to the other. \n\nI think using a narrow array of ray intercepts, and averaging the\nresults of \nsmall clusters into each input would give me a rough vision system. I\nthink \nthat combined with the 360 degree radar-like sensor would provide a\nperipheral \nvs foveal input bouquet. \n\nWhy arn&#39;t simple vision systems a common practice? Is it only because it\ntakes longer to compute, or is there something else?\n\nchad \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_FE3B_01C43C16.81BEAAC0\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;Hey Chad, what do you mean by &quot;how many arcs it falls into?&quot;  My  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;understanding is that any object will in general only fall into one  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;arc. &lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAn object might fill more of the field of view than one arc.
