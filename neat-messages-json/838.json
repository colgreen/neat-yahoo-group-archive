My ultimate\n&gt; goal is to explore NEAT and co-evolution as applied to\n&gt; Texas Hold&#39;em.  No dreams of a super player but it\n&gt; combines two interests of mine.\n\nHi Karl.  Have you read any of Watson and Noble&#39;s work on Pareto\nCoevolution applied to Texas Hold &#39;Em?  Or looked at Aaron Davidson\nand Darse Billings&#39; stuff?\n\nPhilip and I are also interested in applying coevolved neural networks\nto Texas Hold &#39;Em.  We&#39;ve got a working implementation of NEAT in\nJava, and a fair amount of the framework for evolving Hold &#39;Em\nplayers.\n\nWe&#39;re focusing pretty heavily on getting our code released before the\nGECCO conference next month, and then our primary focus will shift to\nGomoku, but we&#39;re still interested in a variety of domains, including\nincomplete information ones such as Poker.  So if you want to talk\ntheory or practice regarding Texas Hold &#39;Em, coevolution, etc., let me\nknow.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
