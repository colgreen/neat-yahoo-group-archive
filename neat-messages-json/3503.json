Every picture is=\r\n the\n&gt; result of nothing more than one or more people selecting images they=\r\n\n&gt; liked from a group of candidates.  So no, they do not start from any\n&gt; g=\r\niven pictures.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I believe this point deserves emphasizing.  To me, it=\r\n&#39;s pretty\n&gt; amazing that all of these pictures started from nothing.  There=\r\n was\n&gt; never an artist and no initial designs.  It&#39;s a genuine testament to=\r\n\n&gt; the power of evolution to produce complex results.  In fact, it is\n&gt; one=\r\n of the few demonstrations of this supposed evolutionary\n&gt; capability (i.e.=\r\n towards higher complexity and organization) that is\n&gt; actually intuitive t=\r\no the naked eye.  For example, check these out:\n\nI agree. That is simply in=\r\ncredible. A standing ovation is in order for you\nand all involved. Last nig=\r\nht when looking at the pictures for the first time\nI was sure you guys were=\r\n &#39;cheating&#39; by seeding the images with photos of\ncars and faces. \n\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/picbreeder_collage.png\n&gt; \n&gt; (press &quot;zoom&quot; in your=\r\n browser to see it at highest quality- browsers\n&gt; default to a worse resolu=\r\ntion)\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, it shows the power of CPPN encoding that it could b=\r\ne\n&gt; steered to such a variety of recognizeable objects through nothing\n&gt; bu=\r\nt what is in effect a pop-15 greedy GA.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course the reason it was po=\r\nssible is because humans are doing the\n&gt; evaluation- which yields another l=\r\nesson: The fitness function in most\n&gt; evolutionary computation is a liabili=\r\nty against getting to high-level\n&gt; complexity.  There are deep reasons that=\r\n human evaluation is actually\n&gt; more analogous to what happened over natura=\r\nl evolution than any other\n&gt; type of evaluation scheme we run on computers.=\r\n  We are often misled\n&gt; into believing that interactive evolution is less &quot;=\r\nnatural&quot; than\n&gt; normal EC.  Actually, the opposite is true.\n\nI can think of=\r\n my own reasons why this highly controversial statement\n*might* be true, bu=\r\nt I would be interested in hearing yours. Why do you make\nthis claim?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThe exciting thing is that this experiment just started.  Who knows\n&gt; where=\r\n it is going to go?  We didn&#39;t know we&#39;d be seeing cars and\n&gt; sunsets but t=\r\nhe system and its users (who deserve a lot of credit)\n&gt; offer constant surp=\r\nrises.  Hopefully people will branch from some of\n&gt; the deepest lineages (i=\r\n.e. most complex, having been through the most\n&gt; generations) to go even fa=\r\nrther down the path that they are going.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This is pretty neat!=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ...both puns intended. :-p\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do these things start fro=\r\nm a picture (e.g. a car)?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Congrats on pulling this off.

The technology behind Picbreeder is a novel NE=\r\nAT-based\n&gt; Genetic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Art applet that is integrated into a massive growing=\r\n &quot;tree of\n&gt; life&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that never ends. Anyone who evolves a picture they li=\r\nke can\n&gt; publish\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it to the world and thereby permanently add their crea=\r\ntions to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ever-expanding tree of life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes Picbreede=\r\nr particularly powerful and unique is that you\n&gt;&gt;&gt; can *branch* from the pu=\r\nblished work of any other user that has\n&gt; come\n&gt;&gt;&gt; before.  In other words,=\r\n you do not have to begin from scratch.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead, for example, if you wa=\r\nnt to a evolve a face, you can\n&gt; branch\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from one of the many published =\r\nfaces and explore an infinite\n&gt; number\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of variations from that starting=\r\n point.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps most intriguing is that we do not know what is pos=\r\nsible to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; evolve.  As lineages are built upon lineages, complexification=\r\n in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; NEAT means that images can theoretically become more and more\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c=\r\nomplex.  Thus, in theory, anything is possible.  In this sense\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Picbreed=\r\ner&#39;s users are pioneers, exploring collectively a space\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; has neve=\r\nr been exhaustively explored and discovering together\n&gt;&gt;&gt; creations that no=\r\n one of us could have discovered alone.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope that you will decid=\r\ne to join us on Picbreeder as we explore\n&gt;&gt;&gt; this space.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
