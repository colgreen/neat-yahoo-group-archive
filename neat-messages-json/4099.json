The\neasiest part of=\r\n the answer is probably just that the inputs and\noutputs should be in a con=\r\nfiguration that is projected from the shape\nof the body, and both inputs an=\r\nd outputs should have correlated geometry.\n\nHowever, the little questions a=\r\nre the hard ones, like what to do when\nthere are multiple degrees of freedo=\r\nm at the same location (such as a\nhip).  It seems erroneous to simply squee=\r\nze such different directions\narbitrarily into the same area. Perhaps more u=\r\nseful would be to have\nmultiple input and output layers, each with a map of=\r\n the joints of the\nbody that rotate along a certain axis.\n\nThe multiple lay=\r\ners could be joined together on a 3rd dimension, or\neffectively completely =\r\nseparated by making them separate inputs or\noutputs (i.e. by having multipl=\r\ne sets of inputs or outputs).  \n\nTo simplify the problem, you might start o=\r\nut for practice with a robot\nthat only has a single degree of freedom at ea=\r\nch joint.  That way, you\ncould just have a single input map and a single ou=\r\ntput map without any\ndifficult conceptual issues.  If it works out well, yo=\r\nu could expand\nfrom there to more complex representations.\n\nLike I said, th=\r\nis research area is an experiment in progress, but I do\nbelieve we will eve=\r\nntually have some standard practices for how to\nproject a body onto a subst=\r\nrate.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing\nanything you find out.\n\nken\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;peterberrington&quot; &lt;peterberrington@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In ot=\r\nher words, how do you configure a substrate for hyperneat for a\n&gt; list of i=\r\nnputs that correspond to joint angles and velocities and a\n&gt; list of output=\r\ns that correspond to the desired joint state (i.e. hold,\n&gt; relax, extend, o=\r\nr contract)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Vinod K. Valsalam wrote an excellent paper on making modu=\r\nlar\n&gt; subnetworks in order to take advantage of a symmetrical configuration=\r\n\n&gt; of legs, as in a quadruped trot, bound, pace or &quot;pronk&quot;. This sounds\n&gt; l=\r\nike a good idea, but in the case of a biped or humanoid creature (for\n&gt; exa=\r\nmple, the ragdoll rig I&#39;m currently working on has 20 1-dof\n&gt; joints), I&#39;m =\r\nnot sure I want to limit myself from exploring behavior\n&gt; that isn&#39;t strict=\r\nly modular with respect to the limb. Symmetry is only\n&gt; bilateral in a huma=\r\nnoid, you won&#39;t achieve as dramatic a reduction in\n&gt; search space as you do=\r\n with 4 or more symmetrical limbs by\n&gt; compartmentalizing it that way.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n So the question is, how do I lay out my ragdoll model in the substrate\n&gt; i=\r\nf I want to take advantage of the geometric relationship between the\n&gt; join=\r\nts in the body?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
