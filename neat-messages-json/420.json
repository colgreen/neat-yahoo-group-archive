Which\n&gt; basically means all we \n&gt; would really need to do is settle on trivial details\n&gt; such as tag and \n&gt; attribute names - I&#39;ll adopt yours since they seem\n&gt; entirely \n&gt; reasonable/straightforward. \n\nWell that was easy. :)\n\n&gt; Perhaps some additional\n&gt; data at the head of \n&gt; a file to indicate which implementation and code\n&gt; version the data came \n&gt; from and other stuff like that. \n\nYes...good idea.\n\n&gt; Note that the XML I\n&gt; posted was purely a \n&gt; NN definition - not a genome/chromosome. The\n&gt; distinction was necessary \n&gt; because I was using an indirect encoding.  I never\n&gt; got around to \n&gt; outputting genome XML but with NEAT being a direct\n&gt; encoding one XML \n&gt; dialect does both jobs.\n\nRight.  Right now in our implementation, the\nchromosome/network xml is somewhat redundant. \nAlthough, JOONE employs the concept of layers, so our\ntranslation from chromosome.xml to network.xml\nincludes and algorithm that places hidden nodes in\nlayers based on their distance in connections from the\ninput layer.\n\nAlso, at some point we would like to use indirect\nencoding, so we thought it useful to implement both.\n \n&gt; &gt;We also use XML to persist information about runs,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;we use XSL style sheets to convert the XML into SVG\n&gt; &gt;for display purposes. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; As Joseph said - very clever :)  Looking forward to\n&gt; seeing the output \n&gt; from these.\n\nI had posted some examples in the Files section\nbefore, but I went ahead and updated them.  There is\nnow a folder called &quot;SVG Output&quot;, which contains the 5\ntypes of graphical output we&#39;ve implemented so far:\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/SVG%20Output/\n\nYou can view them in any browser, but you&#39;ll need an\nSVG viewer plug-in, such as Adobe&#39;s:\n\nhttp://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html\n\nTo view the files, go to the SVG Output folder in\nYahoo groups, right click on the file name (e.g.\n&quot;fitness.svg&quot;), and select &quot;Save Target As...&quot;.  When\nthe Save dialog box comes up, change the file\nextension from &quot;.xml&quot; to &quot;.svg&quot; and save the file\nwherever you want.\n\nAs long as you have the plug-in installed, you should\nbe able to just double-click the file and view it in\nyour browser.\n\nIf you have any problems viewing the SVG examples, or\nhave any questions, just let me know.\n\n&gt; Not really. I personally try to keep tag and\n&gt; attribute names as short as \n&gt; possible since they get repeated so much and\n&gt; therefore add to file size \n&gt; bloat if they&#39;re to long. So e.g. instead of src-id\n&gt; I might have used \n&gt; src. And I might have used the word genome instead\n&gt; of chromosome in this \n&gt; case - since the two mean the same thing within the\n&gt; context of NEAT AFAIK. \n\nYeah...we used &quot;chromosome&quot; because that&#39;s the\nterminology used by JGAP, the GA package we built our\nimplementation on top of.  I&#39;m not wedded to it, or\n&quot;src-id&quot; or &quot;dest-id&quot;. \n\nAnybody else care much one way or the other?\n\n&gt; Most schemas I see \n&gt; these days define lower case tag/attribute names\n&gt; (e.g. xhtml / xforms \n&gt; tags are all lower case) -  note that XML is case\n&gt; sensitive.\n\nYes...I&#39;ve had to troubleshoot XSL problems because of\ncase sensitivity. :)\n\n&gt; Great minds think alike eh ;) \n\nYes...I suppose they do. :)\n\n&gt; Apart from my comments above about keeping names\n&gt; short this is \n&gt; essentially the dialect I had in mind. One trivial\n&gt; point - I would move \n&gt; the &lt;count&gt; tag to be an attribute within the\n&gt; &lt;specie&gt; tag.\n\nThat&#39;s a good suggestion...will do.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
