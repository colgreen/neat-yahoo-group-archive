One thing to be aware of though, is there is only one instanc=\r\ne\nof the fitness function created, so you have to test bots one at a\ntime a=\r\nnd then update the function with a new Chromosome (and hence a\nnew bot).  I=\r\n seem to remember you wanted to have a multi threaded\nversion of this.  NEA=\r\nT4J does support distributed learning, and each\nlearning agent will have th=\r\neir own instance of the appropriate fitness\nfunction.\n\nLet me know how it g=\r\noes, and if the process works I can integrate it\ninto the NEAT4J framework.=\r\n\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C=EDcero Augusto&quot; &lt;ciceroaug=\r\nusto@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I&#39;m trying to do something like that but with unre=\r\nal tournament\nbots.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of overriding the initialise method I exte=\r\nnded the\n&gt; NEATFitnessFunction where the method evolve generates the NN and=\r\n\nassociates\n&gt; it to the bot, than I connect the bot to the game and after s=\r\nome time I\n&gt; disconnect him and call a method from the bot that returns me =\r\nhis\nscore or\n&gt; something like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there something wrong with my w=\r\nay of doing this kind of experiment?\n&gt; \n&gt; On 11/4/06, Matt Simmerson &lt;m.sim=\r\nmerson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Hey guys\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is possible, I am just por=\r\nting this bit of functionality from my\n&gt; &gt; original AI framework.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nasically, you have to create a class that extends\n&gt; &gt; NEATGATrainingManager=\r\n and overrides initialise(). In the new\n&gt; &gt; initialise() method, call super=\r\n.initialise(0 and then create the robot\n&gt; &gt; NNs from the GA population. You=\r\n can then put these in an arena where\n&gt; &gt; you feed the nets realt time inpu=\r\nts eg speed, direction etc. As your\n&gt; &gt; bot goes around it will be given a =\r\nraw score based on your criteria.\n&gt; &gt; Assign this score to the nets Chromos=\r\nome.

To find a s=\r\nuitable NN, we want to use a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Genetic Algorithm. Inputs for the NN are=\r\n leg positions, ground\ncontact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensors for each leg, desired walking =\r\nspeed and so on. Outputs\nof the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NN are the next positions for all the=\r\n joints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Know my question:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Within the XOR-Example (I runn=\r\ned NEATGATrainingManager) the\nNeural Net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be trained with data pr=\r\novided by the xor/xor.csv file.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In our Application (robot) we don&#39;t h=\r\nave any training data\navailable,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we just want to evolve neural networ=\r\nks and evaluate them by applying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fitness function. (for example h=\r\now fast walks the robot,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; direction, etc.) How do we start NEAT, so th=\r\nat it does not need a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trainig set? Is there an example/tutorial avail=\r\nable that shows\nhow to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use NEAT without a training set? Unfortunately=\r\n, I couldn&#39;t work\nit out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so far how to do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks a lo=\r\nt for any information!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iwan\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n=\r\n&gt; C=EDcero Augusto  - Bacharelando em Ci=EAncia da Computa=E7=E3o - UFBA\n&gt;\n=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;ve achieved success in your field when you =\r\ndon&#39;t know whether what\n&gt; you&#39;re doing is work or play.&quot;\n&gt;   - Warren Beatt=\r\ny\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Nada existe de permanente a n=E3o ser a mudan=E7a.&quot;\n&gt;   - Her=E1cit=\r\no\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
