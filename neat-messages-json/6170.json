It w=\r\norked well in practice in the domains explored in that paper, and is likely=\r\n robust to some variation. \n\nIncreasing or decreasing the probability effec=\r\ntively changes the amount of pressure driving the current population away f=\r\nrom previously discovered points. This seems easier to interpret than how t=\r\nhe choice of the threshold (and/or rules for the threshold to adjust dynami=\r\ncally) affect search. So the more direct implications of changing the proba=\r\nbility may be another benefit for the random sampling approach to adding to=\r\n the archive (also if the probability remains constant over the run, which =\r\nis how I usually implement it, then you have an easy-to-calculate expectati=\r\non for the size of the archive over time).\n\nKeith, thanks for providing the=\r\n code to your automatic method for calculating a reasonable sample probabil=\r\nity, it sounds like an interesting approach. Your experiments with test beh=\r\naviors also sound illustrative and support the idea that randomly sampling =\r\nthe space may better approximate what is really novel at a given time in th=\r\ne search.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.colema=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joel,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been experimenting with novelty search=\r\n and have decided to try the\n&gt; probabilistic approach to determine if an in=\r\ndividual is added to the\n&gt; permanent archive.

While it is true that the archive alone provides some\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; about where in the space of behaviors has *previou=\r\nsly* been searched,\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; population gives additional informatio=\r\nn about where is *currently*\n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; searched.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In other words, it is likely desirable to have the population itself\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; spread over the space of previously unexplored behaviors. If only t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; archive is taken into account, it is possible that the populati=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; itself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may converge to searching one novel area of the beha=\r\nvior space (where\n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are few archive points), which could p=\r\notentially lead down blind\n&gt; &gt; alleys.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When the population is take=\r\nn into account there is some repulsive\n&gt; &gt; force\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; within the popula=\r\ntion to maintain diversity and explore different\n&gt; &gt; novel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; areas o=\r\nf the behavior space -- which may in general benefit exploring\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; overall search for novelty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=80=B9=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=B9\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That said, the simpler=\r\n algorithm you suggest is interesting.

One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slightl=\r\ny strange thing about it is that the evaluation order of\n&gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; within a generation may matter; that is, the novelty of an individua=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; evaluated later in the population may be affected by archive add=\r\nitions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; earlier. I am not sure if that is bad or good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In a generational novelty search in particular, it may be wise to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reduce selection pressure or increase the number of nearest neigh=\r\nbors\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considered in calculated novelty. The reason is that unlike i=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; steady\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; state variation, where the novelty of an individu=\r\nal will smoothly\n&gt; &gt; vary over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time (as individuals are replaced i=\r\nndividually), in a generational\n&gt; &gt; model,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the novelty of an indiv=\r\nidual can change abruptly over generations\n&gt; &gt; (what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; novel one =\r\ngeneration may not be novel even the next generation). To\n&gt; &gt; provide\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; a smoother gradient, it may thus be important to reduce novelty\n&gt; &gt; pre=\r\nssure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (e.g. by decreasing the greediness of the search through the=\r\n survival\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; threshold or however you are applying pressure, or by in=\r\ncreasing the\n&gt; &gt; size\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of the neighborhood considered for calculati=\r\nng novelty, which may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; smooth novelty calculations).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I hope you find this response informative, while novelty searc=\r\nh is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; viable whether it is generational or steady-state, there are =\r\nsome\n&gt; &gt; factors\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that may increase its performance when specializi=\r\nng the algorithm to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; generational or steady-state evolutionary algo=\r\nrithms in particular.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Joel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I ha=\r\nve a question about implementing novelty search in a\n&gt; &gt; generational\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; GA.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;Abandoning Objectives: Evolution through the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Search for Novelty Alone&quot; (Lehman and Stanley, 2011, pg 13), it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; suggests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that it&#39;s necessary (or at least a good idea) t=\r\no determine the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; novelty of\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; an individual against =\r\nthe archive and the (entire) current\n&gt; &gt; population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m wondering why this is better than the following approach:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; for (individual I in population)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; N =3D novelty of I measur=\r\ned against archive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; if (N &gt; threshold)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; add I to ar=\r\nchive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; That is, if you iterate through the populat=\r\nion, adding\n&gt; &gt; individuals to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; archive as you go,=\r\n then is this equivalent (or a reasonable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; approximation)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; to checking each individual against the entire population and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; archive?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, why not?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n in advance for any assistance! :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Oliver\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T: 0421 972 953 | E: oliver.col=\r\neman@ | W: http://ojcoleman.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
