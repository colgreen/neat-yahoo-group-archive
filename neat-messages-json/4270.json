(By the way, by &quot;Adaptive\nNetworks=\r\n,&quot; I assume you are referring to adaptive neural networks?)\n\nIn any case, a=\r\nnother option is the University of Texas at Austin,\nwhich is where I did my=\r\n Ph.D. under Prof. Risto Miikkulainen, who has\na leading group in the area:=\r\n\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu\n\nAnother good lab is Prof. Jordan Pollack&#39;s DEMO =\r\nLab at Brandeis:\n\nhttp://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/\nhttp://www.cs.brandeis.e=\r\ndu/~pollack/\n\nHowever, Jordan tells me that he will be renaming and revampi=\r\nng his\nlab soon, so it will no longer be called &quot;DEMO.&quot;  However, it is\nund=\r\noubtedly still a good place to be.\n\nThere are some newer places too with gr=\r\noups led by new professors,\nincluding Prof. Bobby Bryant&#39;s &quot;Neuroevolution =\r\nand Behavior\nLaboratory&quot; at the University of Nevada at Reno\n(http://nebl.c=\r\nse.unr.edu/) and Prof. Josh Bongard&#39;s new group at the\nUniversity of Vermon=\r\nt (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/).\n\nProf. Hod Lipson at Cornell formerly=\r\n worked with Prof. Pollack and\nruns the Cornell Computational Synthesis Lab=\r\n:\n\nhttp://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\n\nHowever, that lab is a focused on emergent=\r\n phenomena in general, with\na broader scope than some of the others.\n\nOne o=\r\nther important group is Prof. Dario Floreano&#39;s Laboratory of\nIntelligent Sy=\r\nstems.  This lab is in Switzerland, so I am not sure if\nit conducts its day=\r\n-to-day work in English (it might), but in any case\nit is very prominent in=\r\n the area:\n\nhttp://lis.epfl.ch/\n\nNot all these groups have an explicit focu=\r\ns on neural networks, but\nmost have done some good work with them.\n\nNote th=\r\nat any Ph.D. program in North America should be willing to\nsupport you fina=\r\nncially if you get in.  \n\nken\n \n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;frayn.mich=\r\nael&quot; &lt;frayn.michael@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am about to head=\r\n over to the University of Sussex (in Brighton,\n&gt; England) to do their MSc =\r\nin Evolutionary & Adaptive Systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, as I am Canadian, the con=\r\ncept of doing a PhD there is a\n&gt; little daunting because of the cost. Unfor=\r\ntunately, I am not aware of\n&gt; many other Universities that would be interes=\r\nted in funding a PhD of\n&gt; such research focuses (let alone would be able to=\r\n comprehensively\n&gt; support students along the way). This assumes, of course=\r\n, that my MSc\n&gt; is wildly successful and I come up with a research question=\r\n worthy of\n&gt; funding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyhow, I was hoping that some of the members he=\r\nre might be able to\n&gt; point out other Universities (in North America or Eng=\r\nlish-speaking\n&gt; Europe) that may be appropriate to do such a PhD in. These =\r\nare the\n&gt; ones I&#39;m familiar with now:\n&gt; \n&gt; University of Edinburgh\n&gt; Univer=\r\nsity of Sussex\n&gt; University of Central Florida\n&gt; \n&gt; I realize this isn&#39;t di=\r\nrectly related to NEAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\n&gt; a more knowledgeable group=\r\n on the subject matter a hand. If there is a\n&gt; more appropriate group, then=\r\n please just point me in the right\n&gt; direction and I&#39;ll not post about this=\r\n again here. Apologies if it&#39;s\n&gt; too off-topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
