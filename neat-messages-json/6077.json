As a non-objective type of behavioral search, =\r\nit is indeed reminiscent of novelty search.  Like both of you I&#39;m not reall=\r\ny sure if the idea is that new, though it&#39;s not entirely the same as anythi=\r\nng else either.  Another question is whether it has any advantage over easi=\r\ner-to-understand ideas like searching for novelty. A couple concepts that r=\r\nemind me a bit of this work outside novelty search include &quot;homeokinesis&quot; (=\r\nhttp://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/videos/) and &quot;Maximum Entropy Invers=\r\ne Reinforcement Learning&quot; (which at least sounds quite similar) (http://www=\r\n.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Greg&quot; &lt;greg_barton@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.insid=\r\nescience.org/content/physicist-proposes-new-way-think-about-intelligence/98=\r\n7\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From the article: &#39;Entropica&#39;s intelligent behavior emerges from=\r\n the &quot;physical process of trying to capture as many future histories as pos=\r\nsible,&quot; said Wissner-Gross.&#39;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fairly close to searching for novel=\r\nty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
