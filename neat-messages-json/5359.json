In other words, you would =\r\nlikely  add the problem of evolving a binary decoder on top of the original=\r\n problem, which would only compound its difficulty.  In general, a good ide=\r\nal to strive for is to keep the coordinate system of the inputs as simple a=\r\ns possible with respect to the computations it will need to do.  That is no=\r\nt always clear, but as a rule of thumb it can help to guide input design de=\r\ncisions.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;garrerc&quot; &lt;garrerc@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m totally new to all of this, but I think you might consider two &quot;ban=\r\nks&quot; of inputs that each encode a binary number.  The first bank is the bina=\r\nry encoding (01001 for node #9 for instance) for one node and the second ba=\r\nnk is the same for the second node.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it all depends on what kin=\r\nds of patterns you think might exist with respect to the node IDs I guess. =\r\n I mean, if you think that all nodes whose IDs are divisible by 3 evenly ar=\r\ne connected to those whose IDs are divisible by 3 with a modulus of 1, then=\r\n doing a different encoding scheme taking that into effect might work bette=\r\nr.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I&#39;m a NN novice and just starting to learn NEAT myself!\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -- Chris\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;p_mridul&quot; &lt;p_mridul@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am working on a bioinformatics problem, but it&#39;=\r\ns easier to talk about it in graph theory terms....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a graph=\r\n with a large number of nodes (~9000), and about 3000 edges between the nod=\r\nes...
