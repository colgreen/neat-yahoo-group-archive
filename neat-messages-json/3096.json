I&#39;m \ncurr=\r\nently doing research in Q-Learning in the area of walking \nrobots.  I ran a=\r\ncross NEAT and I&#39;m very interested in using it as a \nfunction approximator =\r\nof my value function. \n\nI am doing a single pendulum balancing upright (muc=\r\nh like the \nmountain-car problem). I am currently discreteizing the state-s=\r\npace \ninto a 60x60x3(position,velocity,action) table.  This is fine for 2 \n=\r\nstates, but the model I will be implementing for my walker (3-link \npendulu=\r\nm) has 6 states.  I have hopes of adapting Matlab NEAT for \nNEAT+Q.\n\nI have=\r\n a few questions on neural nets that I couldn&#39;t find a clear \nanswer on by =\r\nsearching through the internet.  \n\n1) State Features:\n   In the mountain ca=\r\nr example there are two states: position and \nvelocity.  However, the neura=\r\nl net has 20 inputs (10 for position, \nand 10 for velocity).  Am I correct =\r\nin assuming that each of the 10 \ninputs represents 1/10 of the unit circle =\r\nfor position?  I read that \nNeural Networks like inputs in the range of 0 t=\r\no 1 (why is this?).  \nSo if the position is in a certain region, is the inp=\r\nut for that \nfeature 1 and 0 for all other state features that represent ot=\r\nher \npositions?  Or can it be a fraction between 0 and 1?\n\n2) Net Output:\n =\r\n  The mountain car problem had 3 outputs, 1 for each action.  I&#39;m \nguessing=\r\n that the output with the highest value corresponded to a \ndiscrete action.=\r\n  If NEAT+Q was to approximate a value function \nhowever, would the outputs=\r\n still be the 3 actions?\n   In addition, By using the sigmoid 1/(1+exp(-4.9=\r\nx)) the output of \neach node is forced to be 0 or 1 correct?  In NEAT+Q the=\r\n output error \nis: r+gamma*Va&#39; which would be used in back-propagation.  Bu=\r\nt if the \noutput is either a 0 or a 1, how could this be used to model a va=\r\nlue \nfunction?  Unless the output of the NN is just the sum of inputs into =\r\n\nthe output node.\n\n3) Matlab NEAT:\n   Other than number_input_nodes and num=\r\nber_output_nodes in the \nneat_main.m file, is the entire experiment contain=\r\ned in the \nxor_experiment_vec.m file?  I&#39;m assuming this is where the Q-Lea=\r\nrning \nand dynamics simulation would take place.\n   Does Matlab NEAT use ba=\r\nckpropagation to optimize the weights?  I \ndidn&#39;t see anywhere in the code =\r\nwhere the weights were backpropagated \n(perhaps I missed something).\n\nSorry=\r\n my message was so long, but I&#39;ve read through the most of the \nStanley/Whi=\r\nteson/Stone papers, the 17-page help file, the \nreadme&#39;s contained in the c=\r\n++ and matlab versions of NEAT, and a few \nunrelated NN websites.  Needless=\r\n to say I&#39;m new and sort of lost.  \nAny assistance is greatly appreciated.\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
