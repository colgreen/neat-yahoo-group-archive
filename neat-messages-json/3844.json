It&#39;s interesting to th=\r\nat George Marsaglia&#39;s KISS \nRNG\n&gt; is given the thumbs up, I used his XOR sh=\r\nift algorithm as the basis\n&gt; for my FastRandom class in SharpNeat. I may we=\r\nll switch over to \nusing\n&gt; the KISS algorithm though based on the discussio=\r\nn in this article. \nOh\n&gt; and also someone made a comment on the codeproject=\r\n page where\n&gt; FastRandom lives - &quot;Worst ever random generator!...Passes FIP=\r\nS 140-1\n&gt; with approximately 0.7 %. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure why this guy was so pas=\r\nsionate about RNG&#39;s but I do intend \nto\n&gt; check out this FIPS test one day.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall though I don&#39;t think NEAT is going to be particularly harmed\n=\r\n&gt; by the kind of flaws inherent in some of these RNGs. For most of \nwhat\n&gt; =\r\nwe do we just want uniformly distributed numbers to mix things up a\n&gt; bit. =\r\nAny patterns in the generated sequence probably aren&#39;t\n&gt; particularly detri=\r\nmental IMHO.
