Am I understanding right that \nyou are running a s=\r\neparate evolution population inside each sensor \nnode?  Or are all the sens=\r\nor nodes part of one large population?  In \nthe latter case, it is more lik=\r\nely that rtNEAT might help, but there \nare still a lot of issues specific t=\r\no the domain.  (For example, if \ncommunication is only local than global va=\r\nriables cannot be \nguaranteed.)  \n\nMy guess without a lot of background is =\r\nthat this will be a \ndifficult domain to fit into rtNEAT&#39;s framework.  Howe=\r\nver, I could \nbe wrong as I don&#39;t know exactly what would be measured as fi=\r\ntness.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ghuaien&quot; &lt;ghuaien@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am currently working on the project of sensor network where I \nwo=\r\nuld\n&gt; like to use neural network as forcast system in each sensor node.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I would like to compare my result with that of rtNEAT (if rtNEAT \ncan\n&gt; m=\r\neet our requirement in sensor system).\n&gt; \n&gt; To my best knowledge, rtNEAT ca=\r\nn do real time processing if the\n&gt; computational power is strong enough (be=\r\ncause of the population is\n&gt; generally large, e.g. 100 --- even though it i=\r\ns not a large \npopulation\n&gt; in terms of statistics). But since sensor node =\r\nwill only possess \nbasic\n&gt; processing ability, I am not sure if rtNEAT can =\r\nbe applied in such\n&gt; scenario or not .. AND, just to want to make it clear:=\r\n we are \nlooking\n&gt; for the solution system which can do training online and=\r\n which \nwill be\n&gt; deployed inside one sensor node (so that each sensor will=\r\n have\n&gt; embedded rtNEAT model, e.g.).\n&gt; \n&gt; (in my case, I will deploy one n=\r\neural network system with roughly \n100\n&gt; number of sypnaptic connections in=\r\nside the sensor node, in order to\n&gt; keep the computation cost --- for train=\r\ning --- low)\n&gt; \n&gt; Can any one help me through ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks alot\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
