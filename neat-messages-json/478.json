How many generations\ndid\n&gt; &gt; you run, what was your pop size, and did you get a chance to look\nat\n&gt; &gt; the winning structure at all?  One thing that&#39;s also always\nuseful \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; check is that the number of species is reasonable over the \n&gt; run...huge\n&gt; &gt; explosions of species, or lack of species, can indicate a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; popsize was 150. The first few easy tasks were solved within the \n&gt; first dozen generations - which is behaviour I had witnesses\nbefore. \n&gt; Following that a plateau was reached after about 150-200\ngenerations.\n&gt; \n&gt; The number of species hovered around 40 to 70.\n&gt; \n\nThis sound like a bit too many species for a population of 150. \nIdeally, you&#39;d want around 10 species (so the average size of a\nspecies would be around 15).  This is one good reason to use a dynamic\nspeciation threshold: then you could set the target number of species\nto 10.  The NEAT FAQ explains how to do this.  The problem is in a\npopulation with 70 species and 150 networks, you will have a lot of\nspecies with 2 or 3 members- not enough to have any real diversity\nwith those tiny species.\n\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you give a little more info on what you mean by &quot;amalgamate\n&gt; &gt; matching innovations per generation?&quot;  I thought you meant \n&gt; refreshing\n&gt; &gt; the recorded list of innovation numbers each generation, but then \n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; you ask whether I do this in the initial population as well, I&#39;m\nnot\n&gt; &gt; sure what you mean?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, amalgamate isn&#39;t the right word. Yeh I did mean the\nrefreshing \n&gt; (normalizing?) of the innovation ID&#39;s per generation. I currently \n&gt; generate a random population by linking each output to a single, \n&gt; randomly chosen input. My innovation ID&#39;s are being incremented \n&gt; during this phase - so yeh, I need to change this.\n&gt;  \n\nI&#39;m still not 100% sure I know what you mean.  (For example, the word\n&quot;normalize&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to fit with what I thought we were talking\nabout) I want to make sure I understand it so that we can catch any\npotential problem, so could you describe in a little more detail\nexactly what you do each generation with the innovation ID&#39;s?\n\n&gt; &gt; As far as elitism, keep in mind each species should have its best\n&gt; &gt; member copied (as opposed to only the best in the population).  It\n&gt; &gt; definitely should make a positive difference in performance, \n&gt; assuming\n&gt; &gt; your species are not too small.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thinking about thia again I realise that what I said isn&#39;t 100% \n&gt; correct. What I actually do is pure roulette wheel selection - but \n&gt; then the offspring get added to the existing population (therefore \n&gt; increasing it&#39;s size by 2x). I then cull the least fit 50%. So in \n&gt; effect I have implemented elitism - but the fittest individuals are \n&gt; not guaranteed to be selected for reproduction. This final point is \n&gt; what I&#39;m intending to change.\n&gt; \n\nYou do this on a per-species basis right?  In other words, you cull\nthe least fit 50% of each species as opposed to the least fit 50% of\nthe population?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
