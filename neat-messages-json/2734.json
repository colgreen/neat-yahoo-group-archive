Another thing you need to deal with (and this is ve=\r\nry\ntricky) is that there is an inherent bias the data set acquired by\nobtai=\r\nning history: you don&#39;t have data on shares that are no longer\ntraded, eith=\r\ner because of takeover, privatisation or just plain going\nbust! So when you=\r\n acquire a historical data set, you&#39;re only getting\ndata for companies that=\r\n have existed - largely unchanged - over the\nwhole period. Don&#39;t forget sha=\r\nre price changes due to stock splits,\neither (Mann Group, to my certain kno=\r\nwledge, have split 5 or 6 to 1\nthis year).\n\n&gt; One problem I envisage with l=\r\nonger histories is that older data may be \n&gt; fairly useless in evolving a t=\r\nrading strategy for the present, since no \n&gt; doubt automated trading and se=\r\nmi-automatic analysis/trading has\nprobably \n&gt; been progressing in leaps and=\r\n bounds in the last 5 years or so, thus \n&gt; fundamentally altering the short=\r\n term dynamics of the markets. \n\nMaybe, but the bulk of the money in the ma=\r\nrkets tends to be from\ninstitutions such as pension fund managers, who have=\r\n to find somewhere\nto invest for our retirement! Systems (IT ones) that man=\r\nage\ninvestments are probably less likely to be effecting large changes in\nt=\r\nhe market. The rise and rise of the hedge fund may be starting to\nhave an i=\r\nmpact, and the current environment where tidal waves of\nprivate equity are =\r\nwashing over the market must be having some\ndifferent kind of impact as wel=\r\nl.\n\nI&#39;m wondering if, to complicate your model nicely, you might provide\nnu=\r\nmbers from moving windows of different lengths: the long run, for\nunderlyin=\r\ng stock value, and the short run (how short? dunno) to assess\ncurrent marke=\r\nt &quot;peculiarities&quot;.\n\n&gt; However \n&gt; if that is the case it might actually show=\r\n up in experiments - e.g.\nif a \n&gt; strategy evolves that does really well fo=\r\nr several years in a row and \n&gt; then starts doing badly for a long period.\n=\r\n\nOne would hope so. A combination of data windows might help model to\nknow =\r\nwhen it&#39;s out of its depth.\n \n&gt; So on the whole it&#39;s very interesting that =\r\nNEAT has found a strategy \n&gt; that performs really well over the provided da=\r\nta set, but all this does \n&gt; for now is provide food for thought for the ne=\r\nxt round of\nexperimentation.\n\nThat&#39;s the name of the game, though, isn&#39;t it=\r\n!\n\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
