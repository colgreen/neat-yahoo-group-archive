What is &quot;this community&quot;?  i.e. how wide does the style\n&gt; &gt; spread.  I have written papers in the past, but they were for\n&gt; &gt; biochemistry and you are quite right, when I read CS papers these\n&gt; &gt; days the style always does subtly jar with me.  But are all CS\n&gt;papers\n&gt; &gt; the same, or does the GA/NN/EC etc etc community have its own sub-\n&gt;style?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I forgot to answer this part.  I think &quot;this community&quot; is AI in\n&gt;general, but you can&#39;t go wrong just follow GA/NN/EC conventions.\n&gt;The style may extend to the broader CS community but I don&#39;t read\n&gt;enough papers outside AI to be sure.  I do know that other\n&gt;disciplines, such as in the humanities, have very different styles\n&gt;and conventions.  Even biology is different enough that I would not\n&gt;feel confident writing a biology paper for publication even if I\n&gt;knew what I was talking about.\n\nI&#39;ve read enough graphics and simulation papers to know that the AI \nstyle is not drastically different, whether there are any subtleties \nremains to be seen :)\n\nThe current situation with the issue is that I approached my friend \nat the U of Sheffield and asked him if he thought there would be \nanybody in his dept. who might collaborate with me on this, and he \nimmediately produced a couple of good names.  He&#39;s going to sound \nthem out when he gets a moment.\n\nI&#39;m not getting too many hopes up, I anticipate the most probable \nresponse will be &quot;yes I am very interested but sadly I have no time&quot;...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
