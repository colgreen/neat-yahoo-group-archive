I really appreciate your finding and posting this.  Yeah!  I \n&gt;am looking forward to reading it later.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh me too. There does seem to be a lot of highly specialised research \nin the field of biological neurons, but most of it is extremeley hard to \ndigest or even understand where it fits in to the bigger picture. As one \nexample take a look at the list of articles in the current edition of \nthe journal of neuroscience:\n\nhttp://www.jneurosci.org/current.shtml\n\nOne paper I came across elsewhere that has stood out so far is this one:\n\nhttp://www.menem.com/~ilya/digital_library/neural/london-etal-02.pdf \n&lt;http://www.menem.com/%7Eilya/digital_library/neural/london-etal-02.pdf&gt;\n\nAgain, I don&#39;t fully understand everything that is being described in \nthis paper but a few concepts emerged from skimming over it. The main \nconcept is that individual neurons don&#39;t directly descibe a continous \nactivation function such as a sigmoid, they actually fire in pulses, \nnormally of fixed magnitude and that decay at varying rates. The \nfrequency of the firing is roughly analagous to the ANN concept of an \noutput signal. This isn&#39;t new to me but is an important point to keep in \nmind because some beneficial properties of bio-neurons may be \nattributable to nuances of this particular mechanism.  Also it seems \nthat neurons usually act in large groups so that useful signals are \nactually an aggregrate output of many neurons - and I think this \naveraging out does actually give a sigmoid shape.\n\nBio-neurons also seem to exhibit varying delays between the activation \nlevel being reached and the neuron firing, and this may be useful in \nareas such as motion detection - where an array of neurons with a range \nof delays can be made to fire at the same time even though they each \nreceived an input signal at a different time, e.g. like when the image \nof a moving object passes over a visual sensor array.\n\nWith all of these nuances I think you have to try and decide whether \nthey are just peculiarities of biology that are overcome by say, \naveraging outputs to describe a sigmoid, or whether they are inherently \nuseful - note also that bio-neurons are prone to dying, so the averaging \nout helps out there too. Hopefully Koch&#39;s book will answer some of these \nquestions.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
