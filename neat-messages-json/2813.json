Unfortunately some things do get out of \ndate, but it is also true t=\r\nhat the rtNEAT distribution includes all \nthe original NEAT functionality p=\r\nlus more (including Hebbian \nlearning and FS-NEAT capability).  So really y=\r\nou get everything you \nneed with rtNEAT except Guile and some visualization=\r\ns.\n\nGuile is not necessary to run experiments so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too \nmu=\r\nch of a loss, but the gtk is used for both network and species \nvisualizati=\r\nons, so those unfortunately aren&#39;t available without it.  \nBut there are ot=\r\nher network visualizers, and you could e.g. convert \na NEAT genome file int=\r\no the XML convention used in one of those, \nlike SharpNEAT or NEVT, the neu=\r\nroevolution visualization toolkit\n(http://nevt.sourceforge.net/http://nevt.=\r\nsourceforge.net/).\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;leoinria&quot; &lt;leoinria@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Iwas able to compile rtNEAT :-D, it was just a gcc problem,=\r\n just \nset\n&gt; it to compile with gcc3.4 and good .. however for NEAT, even w=\r\nith \nthe\n&gt; patch and compiling with gcc-3.4, it is impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also,\n&gt;=\r\n is it possible to get the GTK and Guile set up to work on new\n&gt; machines? =\r\nis there any hope at all?
