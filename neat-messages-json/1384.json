And I am talking about\n&gt; NEAT-type high cpu utilization applications, with\n&gt; arithmetic and trignometric calculations as well as\n&gt; image processing.\n\nI&#39;m also very interested in this question.  The C#\nenthusiasts like to claim that there is not much\ndifference.  I&#39;m of the opinion that there will be a\n10-fold slowdown if C# is used in place of C++, for\ncpu intensive applications.  But I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m\ncorrect, and I don&#39;t have any evidence to present,\njust memories of anecdotes.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
