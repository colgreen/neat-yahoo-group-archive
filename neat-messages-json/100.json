Although we give weaker genomes a chance by \n&gt;&gt;protecting them in a species, overall, weak genomes and weak \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;species \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;will be culled from the population. So if I create a population of \n&gt;&gt;random genomes then they will all be in a species of one to begin \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;with - \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;and the stronger genomes will progressively take over the \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;population \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;based on their relative fitness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;First, I&#39;m not sure why every genome would be a in a species of size \n&gt;1?  Wouldn&#39;t some of them by chance be in the same species?  This of \n&gt;course depends on the compatibility threshold.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk yes that is true.\n\n&gt;More importantly, although it is true that down the line the better \n&gt;random topologies will come to dominate, you still end up wasting \n&gt;significant time evaluating completely useless random topologies.\n&gt;\nYes.\n\n&gt;Because the population is speciated, you waste even more evaluations \n&gt;than you normally would since these poor random topologies will \n&gt;persist longer than normal due to fitness sharing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nCorrect. :) ...\n\n&gt;The reason starting minimally takes care of this problem is that \n&gt;then every topological innovation is tried and tested, leading to \n&gt;topologies that have been justified through evaluations and \n&gt;therefore *desereve* to be protected a species where they have a \n&gt;chance to elaborate.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI also see the speciation from the perspective of allowing multiple \nregions in the search space to be searched at once, thus limiting the \npossibility of getting stuck in a local maximum.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a sensible fix, but NEAT for example was designed to avoid\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the need for this kind of ad hoc fitness tinkering. If you start\n&gt;&gt;&gt;minimally and speciate, the system should tend towards minimality\n&gt;&gt;&gt;without the need for penalities.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I think I&#39;m missing something! How do you prevent NEAT genomes/networks \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;from growing out of control? After all a network may have thousands of \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;neurons but only a couple of them may actually be performing the task at \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;hand. Perhaps this is just a consequence of NEAT&#39;s speed - it doesn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;(hasn&#39;t had to) evolve long enough to fall into this trap? How long do \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;NEAT evolution runs normally last? From what I know so far I can only \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;imagine that if we gave NEAT a problem that was too hard to solve and \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;left it to evolve for any considerable time then the genomes would just \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;keep getting longer - I&#39;m more than happy to be proved wrong though :)\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Speciation has a more powerful effect than you are imagining.  \n&gt;Speciation means that with a very hard problem NEAT will *both* keep \n&gt;getting more complex *and* stay simple.  That&#39;s because the simpler \n&gt;species is protected, and therefore will never go extinct as long as \n&gt;it is competitive (and in a hard problem where NEAT can&#39;t make \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes but what I don&#39;t see is how that species as a whole is prevented \nfrom drifting into a state where all the member of that species have \nlarge numbers of non-functional neurons. Each generation your species is \npartly (or completely) re-generated from good memeber of the previous \ngeneration. Some of those offspring will contain extra, non-functioning \nneurons and connections that neither help nor hinder that particular \nindividual. Thus, over several generations I would expect to see genome \nbloat. Now I&#39;m fully open to being proved wrong on this, but at the \nmoment I just don&#39;t see the mechanism that prevents this from \nhappening.  I guess I just need to experiment more and watch closely \nwhat happens.\n\n&gt;progress, all the species will look about the same: bad).  On the \n&gt;other hand, other more complex species will also continue to \n&gt;appear.  That&#39;s what&#39;s so appealing about speciating based on \n&gt;topolgoies- it means that NEAT doesn&#39;t put all its eggs in one \n&gt;basket.  It maintains simple candidates and increasingly complex \n&gt;ones at the same time.  Thus, it does not suffer from universal \n&gt;bloat.\n&gt;\nOK so if a more complex genome arises (with non-functioning \nneurons/connections) then it is sufficiently different to form a new \nspecies, thus protecting the simple structure. BUT, if the complex \nspecies is just as good as the simple one then it will begin to take \nover it&#39;s fair proportion of the population.  Over time the simple \nspecies will be dwarfed by more and more complex species of about equal \nfitness.\n\n&gt;We have run experiments to demonstrate this property empirically.  \n&gt;In the experiments, we assigned completely random fitness to all the \n&gt;genomes.  Now, you might expect complexity to just keep rising in \n&gt;such a situation, but in fact, because of speciation, a very simple \n&gt;species persisted throughout the runs, while at the same time \n&gt;complexity in other species continued to increase.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk, but the simple species&#39; proportion of the population must surely \nshrink into oblivion after a short while?\n\nI hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m being awkward on this. I&#39;m just trying to \nunderstand what is going on. Unfortunately work commitments mean I don&#39;t \nhave any time to experiment further right now which compounds the \nproblem somewhat.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
