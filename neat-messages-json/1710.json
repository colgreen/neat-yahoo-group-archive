The only comment I had is the same one I had before,\n&gt; that you do not define the &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; algorithm used in zooming\n&gt; the images and the picture you show does not look like what I think of as\n&gt; nearest neighbour.  But I doubt that many in your audience will pick up on\n&gt; that and I don&#39;t know whether it matters anyway...\n\nThanks for the feedback, Ian.\n\nYes, we could have spent a bit more space discussing interpolation\nalgorithms, but thought it might be a distraction.  We might possibly\nbe asked to add something in by reviewers, if it makes it that far.\n\n&gt;          In what sense is the image processing the bottleneck?  Is is\n&gt; because you have to zoom, translate and rotate the viewed portion of the\n&gt; image in every evaluation frame?\n\nYes, basically.  Each individual gets about 100 steps to move across\nthe canvass and view portions of the image.  On a given step, the\nimage can be moved up/down, left/right, zoomed in/out, and rotated, so\nthere&#39;s an affine transform for every step, and this is\ncomputationally expensive.\n\n&gt;  Writing your own (simple) image manipulation in\n&gt; C will cut the run-time hugely.  If you are already doing that then your\n&gt; problem is more severe...\n\nNo, right now we&#39;re using Java&#39;s image processing package.  We&#39;re\nlooking at using a package called ImageMagick, and exploiting native\nmethods to speed up the processing.\n\nBut we also hope to use Jim&#39;s SEMIANN neural net framework to gain\nsome speed there.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
