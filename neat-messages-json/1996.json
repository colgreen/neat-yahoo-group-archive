(the NN will be the function approximator\nfor a reinforcement learning algorithm, so the &quot;updates&quot; to the value\nfunction will come incrementally over time, the full training set is\nnot available initially), Anyway, I&#39;m just getting started, so any\nideas would be helpful. \n\nThanks,\n\n-Chris\n\n\n\n\n"}}
