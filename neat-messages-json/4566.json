It has been a very long time since I have \nmessed =\r\nwith any type of AI coding (over a decade) so it will pretty \nmuch be like =\r\nstarting over for me. The last program I even messed \nwith was written in a=\r\nssembly for DOS called BUGZ. It was a \npredator/prey style AI, worked prett=\r\ny good and supported up to 2000 \ninsects. It still even works in the Window=\r\ns console.\n\nOne thing about the Windows NEAT implementation is that it is a=\r\n bit \nunstable, most likely due to it running out of memory. As long as I \n=\r\nkeep the time length at 1000 or below, it usually won&#39;t crash.\n\nIn your opi=\r\nnion would building a FSM handler be simply make it create \na predefined sc=\r\nript once a paticular node tree becomes stable after a \nset amount of gener=\r\nations?\n\nThanks,\nLS\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanl=\r\ney@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Lancer, thanks for the contribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several years =\r\nago, Prof. Stephanie Forrest at the University of New\n&gt; Mexico told me abou=\r\nt a class assignment she had given in which her\n&gt; students evolved FSMs wit=\r\nh their own NEAT implementations.  The\n&gt; results were apparently mixed, wit=\r\nh some seeming to work and some \nnot\n&gt; working at all.  However, she had no=\r\nt required the students to\n&gt; implement speciation because of time constrain=\r\nts in the semester, so\n&gt; these were NEAT implementations without species.  =\r\nBased on that fact\n&gt; that some seemed to work okay anyway, I&#39;d guess that w=\r\nith a full\n&gt; implementation of NEAT, it might work pretty well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of cou=\r\nrse, there are some new issues that come up.  For example, \neach\n&gt; node has=\r\n a different identity.  Also, maybe more interesting, it is\n&gt; not clear wha=\r\nt topology should begin evolution in the initial\n&gt; population (or if perhap=\r\ns the initial population should contain a\n&gt; variety of simple topologies).\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lancersolurus&quot; &lt;gaming@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I uploaded a version of Mat&#39;s NEAT program that will compile \nunde=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; Visual Studio 2005. All I did was fix in-loop variable creations \n(a=\r\n no-\n&gt; &gt; no from 2005 onward) and adjust some of the internal settings. \nEn=\r\njoy...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A question, has anyone attempted to mix NEAT with a FSM?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lancer Solurus\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
