People have\n&gt;speculated on doing something like that for a long time actually,\n&gt;but I don&#39;t know of anyone who actually did it before.  It would be\n&gt;an interesting study in its own right to see if doing that improves\n&gt;the algorithm.  One thing it makes me wonder about is that when you\n&gt;have discrete species you can set a target # of species and\n&gt;use &quot;dynamic thresholding&quot; to hold that number stable.  Since you\n&gt;don&#39;t have an actual # in your implementation, you can&#39;t set a\n&gt;target in the same way.  This brings up what the benefit of setting\n&gt;targets is.  One benefit is that it allows you to make sure you\n&gt;don&#39;t get explosions in the # of species, which would lead to a lack\n&gt;of diversity within each species.  In other words, the whole\n&gt;population could end up separated from each other.\n\nI&#39;ve no idea whether Ashot&#39;s ideas are exactly the same as mine, but I \nwould say that is only a problem when you have non-continuous \nspecies.  With continuous species you can have N species of 1 and the only \ndown-side is that it will be harder to find a partner for sexual \nreproduction (much like any inner-city in that regard :).  If we think \nabout what a population like that means, it is indicating that we are in a \nwide area of search-space with very little in the way of fitness \nchanges.  That&#39;s why no individual stands out enough to be awarded a larger \nproportion of the population.  But in that case it is good to spread the \npopulation as widely as possible to try and find way off the planes and \ninto the mountains.  When an individual finds the foothills, it will get a \nlarger proportion of the population, but the speciation mechanism will then \ncome into play to stop it immediately taking over the whole thing.\n\n&gt;   Another nice\n&gt;thing is it allows several themes to totally diverge from each other\n&gt;over long periods of time.  In your scheme, it seems possible that\n&gt;because there is no particular guard in place keeping any two\n&gt;individuals from mating, over time you might get more uniformity and\n&gt;convergence.  Not sure about this though, of course it depends on\n&gt;your parameters...but I wonder how things compare.\n\nI think he does have a partial guard, in that he selects mating pairs with \na probability inversely based on their distance.  But he may also be \nprotected by a more natural mechanism, in that when the parents become too \ndisparate, they will become &quot;infertile&quot; with one another and although the \nsystem may try to breed them, their offspring will all be of lower fitness \nthan themselves.\n\nIn genetic theory this is one possible first-step in the creation of \nnatural species.  e.g. where we get two sub-species which produce less-fit \noffspring when cross-bred then when in-bred.  This introduces a selection \nfactor to evolve a preference not to mate with the other sub-population, \nwhich then closes a feed-back loop to drive the two apart.\n\nA contradictory theory, observed in human &quot;attractiveness&quot; studies, \nsuggests that there is a best degree of diversity to breed with.  When you \nsee a member of the opposite sex who has a different genetic background and \nwho seems very sexy in an exotic way, the theory is that person is just \ndifferent enough that your sub-conscious tags them as a really promising \nmate.  The idea is that people who are too similar don&#39;t bring your \noffspring any novel factors, and will even lead to more homozygous \ndeleterious recessives.  But people who are too different, will have \n(presumably minor) &quot;competing conventions&quot; problems and thus cannot so \nusefully &quot;merge their genetic and cultural differences&quot; with your own.  The \nBorg never mentioned that part, did they :)\n\nIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
