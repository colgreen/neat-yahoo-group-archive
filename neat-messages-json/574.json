Several\nother people have mentioned to me they ran across it with NEAT as\nwell. One thing to note is that people using backprop and things like\nthat wouldn&#39;t ever see this solution since they only use feedforward\nnetworks.  So if you wanted to be really fair in a comparison, you&#39;d\nhave to disabled recurrency (i.e. make it illegal).  However, I think\nit only goes to show how important topology is when you discover\nthings like this.  Neural net textbooks never even mention this\npossibility as far as I know.\n\nI wanted also to ask you about your table (below) ...\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Take a look at this network that performs logical XOR...\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------\n&gt;     neuron id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;bias&quot;\n&gt;     neuron id=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;in&quot;\n&gt;     neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;in&quot;\n&gt;     neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;out&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     connection src-id=&quot;0&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot; weight=&quot;1.64327624043105&quot;\n&gt;     connection src-id=&quot;1&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot; weight=&quot;-3.3017311279049&quot;\n&gt;     connection src-id=&quot;2&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot; weight=&quot;-3.3025163810043&quot;\n&gt;     connection src-id=&quot;3&quot; tgt-id=&quot;3&quot; weight=&quot;-7.44947553716588&quot;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Activate Fn is (1.0D/(1.0D+(Math.Exp(-accumulator))))   - this has \n&gt; continuous output of 0.0 to 1.0\n&gt; \n&gt; It surprised me because I was expecting at least 1 hidden node -\nthe \n&gt; textbook example I have been using for tests has 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; The truth table for the network looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0    1    2    3(t0)    3(t1)\n&gt; --------------------------\n&gt; 1    0    0    0.83     0.01\n&gt; 1    0    1    0.16     0.05\n&gt; 1    1    0    0.16     0.05\n&gt; 1    1    1    0.007    0.007\n&gt; \n\nWhat is t1?  Is it after one more activation?  Generally in\nclassification problems, the right thing to do is let the network\nrelax (i.e. stop changing) before taking the outputs.  I&#39;m not sure\nyou did that here, but if you didn&#39;t, it&#39;s possible if you let it\nrelax the values would be even more separated.  For more info on\nrelaxation in classification problems, see the following question in\nthe NEAT FAQ:\n\n-How do I ensure that a network stabilizes before taking its output(s)\nfor a classification problem?  \n\nken\n\n&gt; Admitedly the seperation between true and false is small, but it&#39;s \n&gt; there. From this we can see that the non-linearity introduced by\nthe \n&gt; feedback on the output node plays a crucial part. So although there\nare \n&gt; no hidden nodes, for practical purposes the output node is\nperforming \n&gt; the role of a hidden node.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just though i&#39;d mention it as a nice small example of how an\nevolution \n&gt; based search has found an unexpected (to me anyway!) architecture.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
