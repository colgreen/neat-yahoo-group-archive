It seems like a good early step in algorithms for\nexploring good\n&gt; topo=\r\nlogies, but it&#39;s obviously far simpler and more limited than\nsomething\n&gt; li=\r\nke NEAT.  As far as I understand it, you basically use multi-layer\n&gt; percep=\r\ntrons, train them with backprop, and when the learning\nstagnates you\n&gt; add =\r\nin another hidden node...rinse and repeat until you solve the\nproblem or\n&gt; =\r\nreach diminishing returns.\n\nThere was something of a religious conflict abo=\r\nut a decade back\nbetween the BackProp and CasCor sects of the multi-layer p=\r\nerceptron\nchurch. Like all such things it seems silly now (perhaps because\n=\r\nhaving moved on to NEAT I&#39;m now apostate?).\n\nMy reservation with CasCor was=\r\n its potential weakness in generalising\nin less well-bounded spaces. A majo=\r\nr strength was less vulnerability\nto being trapped local maxima, since each=\r\n training exemplar was fully\nexplored (potentially including adding a hidde=\r\nn node) before moving\non. So CasCor networks were very good at recognising =\r\nwhat they&#39;d seen\nbefore, but (I believed) needed caution when generalising.=\r\n So I was\nmore of a backprop guy.\n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
