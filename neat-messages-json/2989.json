I have fo=\r\nund \nit to be mainly just disruptive.  However, others here have \ndeveloped=\r\n more principled ways of pruning networks which probably \nwork better than =\r\nmy random toggler.\n\nIn any case, I believe that you are correct- if you rea=\r\nlly want to \nkeep everything together in the network then it would be neces=\r\nsary \nto check both the in-node and out-node.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;tansey4&quot; &lt;tansey4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on my o=\r\nwn implementation of NEAT using the rtNEAT code \nas\n&gt; a starting point.  I =\r\nam on the mutation operators and had a \nquestion\n&gt; about  Genome::mutate_to=\r\nggle_enable(int times).  When the method \nfinds\n&gt; a gene to disable (if the=\r\n gene is enabled), it does a check to see \nif\n&gt; it can do this without frag=\r\nmenting the network.  The comment says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We need to make sure that an=\r\nother gene connects out of the in-\nnode\n&gt; &gt; Because if not a section of net=\r\nwork will break off and become \nisolated\n&gt; \n&gt; My question is does it only c=\r\nheck the in_nodes and not the \nout_nodes?\n&gt;  If we don&#39;t check out_nodes, w=\r\nouldn&#39;t it be possible for the \noutputs\n&gt; to become disconnected from the n=\r\network?  If you have a network of \n1\n&gt; input and 2 output nodes, where the =\r\ninput is connected to both\n&gt; outputs, wouldn&#39;t this method consider it vali=\r\nd to disable one of \nthe\n&gt; connections?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
