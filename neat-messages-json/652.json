Do you \nknow yet on what day you&#39;ll be presenting?\n\nDerek and I also had discussed the virtues of identifying \nsuperfluous inputs by seeing which ones wind up disconnected in \nsolutions.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shimon Whiteson&quot; &lt;shimon@w...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Philip,\n&gt; \n&gt; My name is Shimon Whiteson and I&#39;m a PhD student at UT (Ken is my\n&gt; officemate).  I&#39;ve been working on a research project recently \nthat is\n&gt; exactly along the lines you mention.  I think that the \nimplications of\n&gt; starting absolutely minimally are even greater than you say.  In \naddition to\n&gt; avoiding possibly unnecessary connections, starting minimally can \neliminate\n&gt; entire inputs that might be superfluous.  In some domains with \nvery rich\n&gt; feature sets, pruning out the irrelevant ones is critical to \nsuccess (i.e.\n&gt; the feature selection problem).  But even if you already know you \nhave the\n&gt; optimal feature set, starting with a population of networks with no\n&gt; connections can still yield an improvement for the same reason \nthat NEAT can\n&gt; do better than fixed-topology neuro-evolution: because it \nconcentrates the\n&gt; early part of the search in lower dimensional spaces.  You mention \nin your\n&gt; message that starting w/o connections could slow things down but \nin many\n&gt; cases it may speed things up because it reduces the dimensionality \nof search\n&gt; in early generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken and I have written a paper that describes our preliminary \nresults in\n&gt; this area and are submitting it to a workshop at GECCO.

In doing some runs with XOR with subtractive \nmutations,\n&gt; &gt; we found that our smallest solutions do not require a connection\n&gt; &gt; from the bias input node.  This led me to wonder what would \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; if I were to start with a more minimal arhitecture.  I did some \nruns\n&gt; &gt; starting with 0 connections, and was still able to solve it in \nabout\n&gt; &gt; the same number of generations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So a few question:\n&gt; &gt; - has anyone else tinkered with alternate starting architectures?\n&gt; &gt; - is there any reason to start with ANY hidden neurons or\n&gt; &gt; connections?\n&gt; &gt; - Ken, in your experiments, do you have the bias input fully\n&gt; &gt; connected along with the other inputs?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s possible that, with more complex domains, starting with \nsuch a\n&gt; &gt; small architecture would yield significantly slower results as \nthe\n&gt; &gt; members of the population take longer to start up.  We&#39;ve read \nother\n&gt; &gt; experiments where the starting architecture is a sparse randomly\n&gt; &gt; connected matrix.  But that would still allow for the \npossibility of\n&gt; &gt; starting with a connection that you never need, and never being \nable\n&gt; &gt; to get rid of it.  Starting with fewer connections might take\n&gt; &gt; longer, but gives you a better shot at a minimal solution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
