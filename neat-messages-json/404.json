However, only hidden nodes that are connected to an\ninherited\n&gt; &gt;link should be copied to children.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ok that makes sense. If a node is not being connected to then throw\nit \n&gt; away. We can always add more in later. If I do go the way of \n&gt; distinguishing between input, hidden and output nodes then I would \n&gt; probably place the 3 node types in 3 different Vector(ArrayList in\nC#) \n&gt; structures - this avoids the additional task of having to seperate\nthem \n&gt; out each time we want to decode the Genone into a Network\n&gt; \n\nThat makes sense.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Some questions then:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;1) I see from your recent email that you (optionally) allow input \n&gt; &gt;&gt;nodes to be removed. Do you also allow input nodes to be added?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In general, the previous posting was not meant to imply that input\n&gt; &gt;nodes are allowed to be removed.  They really should never be\nremoved\n&gt; &gt;or added.  There should always be a constant set of possible\ninputs. \n&gt; &gt;However, it is possible to start out with some *disconnected* input\n&gt; &gt;nodes, which later get &quot;added&quot; in the sense that a new connection\n&gt; &gt;appears that links them into the network.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Got it. This really goes back to my previous email - we can\nconsider \n&gt; input nodes to be connection points for the NN rather than proper \n&gt; working nodes. Do you agree?\n&gt; \n\nYes I agree.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
