Something like that would allow the\n&gt; experiment to run much \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, a more realistic approach is to store\n&gt; information about how to \n&gt; rapidly calculate a network result along with the\n&gt; network.  Then, you can \n&gt; activate the network as many times as you need to,\n&gt; optimally.  You simply \n&gt; have an initial overhead cost of the analysis and\n&gt; &#39;strategy&#39; determination.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, such a thing is definitely overkill for xor. \n&gt; But for image enlargement, \n&gt; where analyzing the fitness of a single network may\n&gt; involve billions (yes, \n&gt; billions) of activations, every little bit will\n&gt; help.\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nThe ANN code in my programs is extremely fast in\nexecution, but does not cover a general topology.  I\nhave two varieties.  One is the standard MLP, with\nroughly sigmoidal neurons.  The other is the fully\nconnected recurrent binary net, similar to a Hopfield\nnetwork.  If either of those suit your application,\nthen you can use my code.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
