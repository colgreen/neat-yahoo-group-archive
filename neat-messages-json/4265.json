I&#39;ve worked with the Boolean function (4\n&gt; inputs, 1 out=\r\nput) :\n&gt; \n&gt; (A xor B) and (c xor d)\n&gt; \n&gt; This function is interesting becau=\r\nse (1) it&#39;s deceptive and (2) it&#39;s\n&gt; modular (the xor is used twice).\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve tried to set-up NEAT (using the c++ source code) but it does not\n&gt; lea=\r\nd to any good fitness. Can anybody with more experience than me\n&gt; with NEAT=\r\n try ? It should be quick for any &quot;neat master&quot; and it would\n&gt; prevent me f=\r\nrom drawing any false conclusion ...\n&gt; \n&gt; If it works for you, I would be g=\r\nlad to know how. If not, any\n&gt; explanation will be welcome. I know that nov=\r\nelty search would probably\n&gt; work to overcome the deceptiveness but I need =\r\nto compare with the\n&gt; standard NEAT at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean=\r\n-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; http://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt; tel : (+33) =\r\n6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
