I\nam sure they will be the foundation of great discussions at GECCO=\r\n.  I&#39;ll\ntry to keep my response more brief than before.\n\n1) Indeed recent q=\r\nuadruped results are not in the same setup as in your\nwork; that is a legit=\r\nimate qualification and they do not constitute a\nproof that in your particu=\r\nlar setup HyperNEAT would succeed.  However,\nthey are arguably at least com=\r\nparably complex.  For example, the CTRNN\nin\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/=\r\nrisi_gecco13b.pdf\n&lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf&gt;   is a=\r\n complicated\nstructure and the CPPN that encodes it is required not only to=\r\n generate\na controller for a single quadruped morphology, but to generate m=\r\nultiple\ncontrollers for multiple morphologies, all from the same CPPN.  A v=\r\nideo\nof three controllers all from the same CPPN is here:\nhttp://youtu.be/o=\r\nLSSt5GyHNk &lt;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&gt;\n\n2) I think the question of what i=\r\ns &quot;target-based&quot; can actually be\ninteresting, but I completely agree that t=\r\nhe semantic side of the\nargument isn&#39;t really important.  But what I do fin=\r\nd interesting is the\nidea that these two scenarios differ substantively in =\r\nyour mind (as you\nput it):\n\n&quot;there is an important difference between FFs t=\r\nhat require a single\nspecific phenotype and FFs that require only that some=\r\n goal be achieved&quot;\n\nI think by &quot;single specific phenotype&quot; you mean pattern=\r\n-matching (i.e.\nimage-matching).  But I think this distinction doesn&#39;t real=\r\nly exist: \nThere are an unlimited number of networks (i.e. CPPNs) that can =\r\nencode a\nparticular two-dimensional image, just as there are an unlimited n=\r\number\nof CPPNs that can encode a particular behavior or goal (such as\nfollo=\r\nwing a line).\n\nWhat makes both target-based and fundamentally the same is n=\r\not the\nnumber of ways they can be solved, but rather the way the fitness\nfu=\r\nnction interacts with the search process.  The problem is that\ntarget-based=\r\n fitness encourages piece-wise incremental progress, which\ntends to be high=\r\nly deceptive.  For example, with an image, matching a\nsingle pixel can rais=\r\ne fitness even if the function that causes that\npixel to be matched has no =\r\nrelationship whatsoever to the overall\nregularities in the target pattern. =\r\n The same is true in control tasks: \nA mutation that causes a quadruped to =\r\nlunge forward clumsily is rewarded\nfor the slight improvement in fitness, w=\r\nhereas an important underlying\nregularity (e.g. oscillation) necessary to g=\r\net really good at the task\nis never established.  Non-target-based fitness =\r\n(or what I call\n&quot;non-objective&quot;) avoids these problems because it *does* re=\r\nward\nestablishing regularities: it appreciates new regularities even if the=\r\ny\ndon&#39;t immediately raise fitness.\n\nBut what&#39;s most interesting to me is yo=\r\nur intuition that there is some\nway to sidestep the tradeoff in combining i=\r\nndirect encodings with\ntarget-based fitness functions.  That is, you suspec=\r\nt there may exist an\nindirect encoding that can both elaborate regularities=\r\n compositionally\nover very many generations and also almost deterministical=\r\nly satisfy an\narbitrary target-based objective.  I am convinced that is not=\r\n the case \n(it would be too good to be true), but you rightly point out tha=\r\nt my\nposition is a hypothesis.   However, just as a thought experiment, can=\r\n\nyou really imagine any neural network encoding (including DNA) that\nwould =\r\ngive you Einstein-level intelligence if the target was simply to\nscore maxi=\r\nmally on an IQ test?  It is plain to me that the stepping\nstones to human l=\r\nevel cannot be crossed in the presence of a\ntarget-based objective (or any =\r\none conceivable).  However,\ninterestingly, that does not mean that such a n=\r\neural network does not\nexist in the search space.  It just means a target w=\r\non&#39;t get you there.\n\n3) We apparently disagree on whether 6 is a big number=\r\n (for nodes needed\nto represent fracture).  If you try to devise an encodin=\r\ng that\nrepresents fracture with fewer than that, my intuition is that you w=\r\nould\nbe sacrificing an enormous breadth of flexibility in the kinds of\nfrac=\r\nture (and patterns in general) that you can represent.  Think about\nthe num=\r\nber of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in fracture: it&#39;s not really\nwell-defined, but =\r\na single line of fracture has a lot of dimensions:\n\n-position\n-orientation\n=\r\n-curvature (which can be arbitrarily complex)\n-fracture gradient (that is, =\r\none region can smoothly transition into\nanother in a kind of interpolated t=\r\nransitional zone)\n-embedding (fracture can potentially be hierarchical or r=\r\negular, i.e.\ndependent on higher-level containing regions)\n\nThe idea that a=\r\nll of that can be encoded in anything less than about 6\nsimple functions se=\r\nems optimistic.  Of course, if you are willing to\nsacrifice some of those d=\r\negrees of freedom, then you can get fewer\nnodes, but the exquisite minutia =\r\nof such patterns would be lost (and\nyou&#39;d move more towards direct encoding=\r\n, like the wavelets do).\n\nBy the way, here are some cool examples of compli=\r\ncated kinds of fracture\nfrom Picbreeder (such as fractured periodic zones, =\r\nbut even more complex\nthan even that):\n\nNontrivial color patterns in each z=\r\none:\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D11328\n\n\nVery complex=\r\n brush-stroke pattern inside the apple vs. outside (the DNA\nfor this one is=\r\n fascinating):\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D7109\n\n\n\nFr=\r\nactured regions covering a distorted surface, giving a remarkable\nunderlyin=\r\ng curvature:\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D2684\n\n\nA col=\r\nor variant: http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D6652\n\n\nWhen I=\r\n see so many remarkable examples like these on Picbreeder, the\nmessage to m=\r\ne is that we have only scratched the surface of what CPPN\nencoding can teac=\r\nh us about representation.  That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s\npremature (in the face =\r\nof such a treasure trove of evidence) to be\nworrying about whether we can r=\r\nepresent some subcomponent of such\npatterns with less than 6 nodes.  At pre=\r\nsent I&#39;m amazed they can be\nrepresented at all, let alone with under 6 node=\r\ns.\n\nThanks very much for raising these issues in any case - it&#39;s a great\nde=\r\nbate to have about representation and search and goes to the heart of\nthe f=\r\nield of GDS/indirect encoding.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;s=\r\nhimonw&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your interesting and thought-pro=\r\nvoking comments.  I&#39;ll give\nsome brief reactions here, and I hope we can ha=\r\nve a productive\ndiscussion about it at GECCO.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) I won&#39;t comment for no=\r\nw on the new experiments you&#39;ve been running\nbecause the details are not av=\r\nailable yet.  Instead, I will just comment\non the various walking gait doma=\r\nins, because the details of the\nadditional results you mentioned are in tha=\r\nt case already available, in\nnewly published GECCO papers.\n&gt;\n&gt; FIrst of all=\r\n, these are very cool results, and nice success stories\nfor HyperNEAT.  It&#39;=\r\ns great to see that the GDS community is continuing\nthe push the envelope i=\r\nn terms of robot locomotion, which seems to be\nemerging as a nice applicati=\r\non for indirect encodings.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I would simply caution against plac=\r\ning all these variations\non the walking gait task on a one-dimensional spec=\r\ntrum of difficulty. \nIn our paper, we took the orignal walking gait task an=\r\nd made only one\nchange (increasing the mass of the torso) which clearly mak=\r\nes the task\nharder.  In the papers Ken mentioned, there are other differenc=\r\nes, e.g.,\nthe use of an SUPG encoding, the use of CTRNNs, the use of a diff=\r\nerent\nsubstrate topology, and varying the length of the legs.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s comp=\r\nletely legitimate to make these changes and they don&#39;t\ndetract from the res=\r\nults at all.   But they are confounding factors when\nit comes to comparing =\r\nHyperNEAT&#39;s performance on walking gait tasks of\ndifferent difficulties.  S=\r\nome of these changes may make the task harder\nin some ways but other change=\r\ns may make it easier in others ways, and so\nfar we don&#39;t have experimental =\r\nresults that control for these factors.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) I hope to avoid a semantic d=\r\nebate about what is a &quot;target-based&quot;\nFF.  If you want to include what I was=\r\n calling a &quot;regular&quot; FF in the\nscope of target-based FFs, I won&#39;t object.  =\r\nBut my point is that,\nregardless of what you call them, there is an importa=\r\nnt difference\nbetween FFs that require a single specific phenotype and FFs =\r\nthat\nrequire only that some goal be achieved.  For the latter, there may be=\r\n\nmany ways to skin the cat, though in any interesting problem, good\nsolutio=\r\nns are still quite rare.  The distinction is important because,\nwhile the f=\r\normer category is arguably only of theoretical interest, the\nsecond categor=\r\ny corresponds to what I consider the most interesting and\nimportant class o=\r\nf FFs, because these are the FFs that naturally arise\nin a very large numbe=\r\nr of real-world optimization problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, using your terminology, I ag=\r\nree it is reasonable to say\nHyperNEAT&#39;s difficulties with fracture are prob=\r\nably limited to\n&quot;target-based&quot; FFs.  But for me, this is a potentially seri=\r\nous\nrestriction, since target-based FFs include not just pathological FFs\nb=\r\nut a large class of real-world FFs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the wavelet method, I wou=\r\nld still definitely call this an\nindirect encoding, but it is in some sense=\r\n &quot;less indirect&quot; because it\nlacks the compositional functions of HyperNEAT.=\r\n It&#39;s a perfectly\nreasonable hypothesis that such compositionality is advan=\r\ntageous in some\nways.  However, if that&#39;s true, then we should be able to d=\r\nemonstrate\nthat by finding tasks where HyperNEAT outperforms the wavelet me=\r\nthod\n(FYI, in the extended analysis Thomas is conducting for his master&#39;s\nt=\r\nhesis, we have found one variation of the line-following task where\nthis is=\r\n the case).  So in that sense, the wavelet method is a useful\nbaseline, whi=\r\nch is the whole reason we introduced it.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) If it&#39;s true that it takes =\r\n~6 nodes to represent fracture, then I\nthink this a potentially important p=\r\noint.  On regular FFs, it could\ncontribute to the difficulty of discovering=\r\n fracture, since\nrepresentations that have only some of the necessary compo=\r\nnents may not\nbe rewarded (I think you would call this &quot;deception&quot;).  In\nPi=\r\ncbreeder-like tasks, we already see that fracture can evolve anyway,\nbut th=\r\nis doesn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t do it even better if fracture required\nfewer no=\r\ndes to represent.  If we think that the solutions to many\ninteresting probl=\r\nems require fracture, then I think it&#39;s at least\npossible that one could de=\r\nvise a better representation for such problems\nthan the CPPNs used in Hyper=\r\nNEAT.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I understand it, your approach to dealing with &quot;regular&quot; FFs i=\r\ns to\nreformulate them &quot;in a way that respects the need for phenotypic\ndiver=\r\nsity and open-endedness.&quot;  That&#39;s a very interesting approach and I\nthink i=\r\nt has a lot of merit, but I don&#39;t think it will solve all our\nproblems beca=\r\nuse it presupposes that such a reformulation is possible\n(or that the prior=\r\n knowledge it requires is available).  In some cases,\nI think we are just s=\r\ntuck with hard FFs and we need to develop better\nmethods to deal with them.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the idea that &quot;an unhappy and unhealthy indirect encoding is=\r\n\none with only a strict target to which to aspire&quot;: this is a very\nintrigui=\r\nng hypothesis, but to me it is only a hypothesis.  I think it&#39;s\ntrue of exi=\r\nsting indirect encodings, but that for me does not in any way\nrule out the =\r\npossibility of developing a different indirect encoding for\nwhich that is n=\r\not true, and I think that&#39;s one thing we should be\nworking on.   One of the=\r\n reasons that I&#39;m interested in indirect\nencodings is that I strongly belie=\r\nve this can be done.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Shimon\n&gt;\n\n\r\n--3-8316961626-4664525102=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html;

I am sure they will be the foundation of great discus=\r\nsions at GECCO.&nbsp; I&#39;ll try to keep my response more brief than before.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Indeed recent quadruped results are not in the same setup as in y=\r\nour work; that is a legitimate qualification and they do not constitute a p=\r\nroof that in your particular setup HyperNEAT would succeed.&nbsp; However, =\r\nthey are arguably at least comparably complex.&nbsp; For example, the CTRNN=\r\n in&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pdf&quot;&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco13b.pd=\r\nf&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp; is a complicated structure and the CPPN that encodes it is requ=\r\nired not only to generate a controller for a single quadruped morphology, b=\r\nut to generate multiple controllers for multiple morphologies, all from the=\r\n same CPPN.&nbsp; A video of three controllers all from the same CPPN is he=\r\nre: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyH=\r\nNk&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/oLSSt5GyHNk&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I think the question of=\r\n what is &quot;target-based&quot;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What makes both target-based and fundamentally the same is=\r\n not the number of ways they can be solved, but rather the way the fitness =\r\nfunction interacts with the search process.&nbsp; The problem is that targe=\r\nt-based fitness encourages piece-wise incremental progress, which tends to =\r\nbe highly deceptive.&nbsp; For example, with an image, matching a single pi=\r\nxel can raise fitness even if the function that causes that pixel to be mat=\r\nched has no relationship whatsoever to the overall regularities in the targ=\r\net pattern.&nbsp; The same is true in control tasks:&nbsp; A mutation that =\r\ncauses a quadruped to lunge forward clumsily is rewarded for the slight imp=\r\nrovement in fitness, whereas an important underlying regularity (e.g. oscil=\r\nlation) necessary to get really good at the task is never established.&nbsp=\r\n; Non-target-based fitness (or what I call &quot;non-objective&quot;) avoid=\r\ns these problems because it *does* reward establishing regularities: it app=\r\nreciates new regularities even if they don&#39;t immediately raise fitness.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;But what&#39;s most interesting to me is your intuition that there is some =\r\nway to sidestep the tradeoff in combining indirect encodings with target-ba=\r\nsed fitness functions.&nbsp;

It&#39;s great to see that the GDS community is continuing the push=\r\n the envelope in terms of robot locomotion, which seems to be emerging as a=\r\n nice application for indirect encodings.  &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; However, I wou=\r\nld simply caution against placing all these variations on the walking gait =\r\ntask on a one-dimensional spectrum of difficulty.  In our paper, we took th=\r\ne orignal walking gait task and made only one change (increasing the mass o=\r\nf the torso) which clearly makes the task harder.  In the papers Ken mentio=\r\nned, there are other differences, e.g., the use of an SUPG encoding, the us=\r\ne of CTRNNs, the use of a different substrate topology, and varying the len=\r\ngth of the legs.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; It&#39;s completely legitimate to make these =\r\nchanges and they don&#39;t detract from the results at all.   But they are conf=\r\nounding factors when it comes to comparing HyperNEAT&#39;s performance on walki=\r\nng gait tasks of different difficulties.  Some of these changes may make th=\r\ne task harder in some ways but other changes may make it easier in others w=\r\nays, and so far we don&#39;t have experimental results that control for these f=\r\nactors.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 2) I hope to avoid a semantic debate about what is=\r\n a &quot;target-based&quot; FF.  If you want to include what I was calling =\r\na &quot;regular&quot; FF in the scope of target-based FFs, I won&#39;t object. =\r\n But my point is that, regardless of what you call them, there is an import=\r\nant difference between FFs that require a single specific phenotype and FFs=\r\n that require only that some goal be achieved.  For the latter, there may b=\r\ne many ways to skin the cat, though in any interesting problem, good soluti=\r\nons are still quite rare.  The distinction is important because, while the =\r\nformer category is arguably only of theoretical interest, the second catego=\r\nry corresponds to what I consider the most interesting and important class =\r\nof FFs, because these are the FFs that naturally arise in a very large numb=\r\ner of real-world optimization problems.  &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; So, using your t=\r\nerminology, I agree it is reasonable to say HyperNEAT&#39;s difficulties with f=\r\nracture are probably limited to &quot;target-based&quot; FFs.  But for me, =\r\nthis is a potentially serious restriction, since target-based FFs include n=\r\not just pathological FFs but a large class of real-world FFs.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Regarding the wavelet method, I would still definitely call this an ind=\r\nirect encoding, but it is in some sense &quot;less indirect&quot; because i=\r\nt lacks the compositional functions of HyperNEAT. It&#39;s a perfectly reasonab=\r\nle hypothesis that such compositionality is advantageous in some ways.  How=\r\never, if that&#39;s true, then we should be able to demonstrate that by finding=\r\n tasks where HyperNEAT outperforms the wavelet method (FYI, in the extended=\r\n analysis Thomas is conducting for his master&#39;s thesis, we have found one v=\r\nariation of the line-following task where this is the case).  So in that se=\r\nnse, the wavelet method is a useful baseline, which is the whole reason we =\r\nintroduced it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 3) If it&#39;s true that it takes ~6 nodes to r=\r\nepresent fracture, then I think this a potentially important point.  On reg=\r\nular FFs, it could contribute to the difficulty of discovering fracture, si=\r\nnce representations that have only some of the necessary components may not=\r\n be rewarded (I think you would call this &quot;deception&quot;).  In Picbr=\r\needer-like tasks, we already see that fracture can evolve anyway, but this =\r\ndoesn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t do it even better if fracture required fewer nodes=\r\n to represent.  If we think that the solutions to many interesting problems=\r\n require fracture, then I think it&#39;s at least possible that one could devis=\r\ne a better representation for such problems than the CPPNs used in HyperNEA=\r\nT.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; As I understand it, your approach to dealing with &quot=\r\n;regular&quot; FFs is to reformulate them &quot;in a way that respects the =\r\nneed for phenotypic diversity and open-endedness.&quot;  That&#39;s a very inte=\r\nresting approach and I think it has a lot of merit, but I don&#39;t think it wi=\r\nll solve all our problems because it presupposes that such a reformulation =\r\nis possible (or that the prior knowledge it requires is available).  In som=\r\ne cases, I think we are just stuck with hard FFs and we need to develop bet=\r\nter methods to deal with them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Regarding the idea that &qu=\r\not;an unhappy and unhealthy indirect encoding is one with only a strict tar=\r\nget to which to aspire&quot;: this is a very intriguing hypothesis, but to =\r\nme it is only a hypothesis.  I think it&#39;s true of existing indirect encodin=\r\ngs, but that for me does not in any way rule out the possibility of develop=\r\ning a different indirect encoding for which that is not true, and I think t=\r\nhat&#39;s one thing we should be working on.   One of the reasons that I&#39;m inte=\r\nrested in indirect encodings is that I strongly believe this can be done.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Shimon&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--3-8316961626-4664525102=:4--\r\n\n"}}
