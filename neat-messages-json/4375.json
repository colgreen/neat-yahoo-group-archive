That is\n&gt;&gt; because smaller populations are greedier (they concentrate resources\n&gt;&gt; on a small part of the search space) and apparently pole balancing\n&gt;&gt; benefits greatly from greedy search.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s really interesting. I have always thought the higher the\n&gt; population size the better.\n\nHello. I think Ken is saying that if you are measuring success by fewest\n*evaluations* then it is better to have a lower population size. You need a\nlot of generations because you need to mutationally tune the weights, but\nyou don&#39;t need that much diversity because you can just hill climb. So if\nyou cut the population size down, you get more generations for fewer\nevaluations. \n\nI do think it is the case that, all else equal, a larger population will be\nbetter (on average: individual runs may differ) if you are counting success\nin terms of number of generations. \n\n\n\n"}}
