I think t=\r\nhe reason\nthe compatability threshold could get so high is because increasi=\r\nng\nthat threshold doesn&#39;t actually decrease the number of species. At\nleast=\r\n not when you keep the list of species in a fixed order and\nassign new offs=\r\npring to the first specie it matches. The effect of\nincreasing the threshol=\r\nd will then be that all species will lose their\noffspring to the first spec=\r\nie because the threshold is so high that\nthey all match the first specie.\n\n=\r\nAnalyzing the chromosomes revealed that they were not at all spread\nout lik=\r\ne crazy. So I think the problem was that at least one\nchromosome of each sp=\r\necie was not performing bad enough to be killed\noff and thus it&#39;s specie ne=\r\nver disappeared. Increasing the threshold\ndoes not have any influence on th=\r\ne decision whether to kill off the\nlast survivor of a specie, so it just ke=\r\npt rising without bounds. The\nonly effect of increasing the threshold was t=\r\nhat all offspring was put\ninto the first specie, causing the uneven distrib=\r\nution I was talking\nabout.\n\nThe solution I am currently using is to keep th=\r\ne species sorted by\nsize (smallest specie first) and adding offspring to th=\r\ne smallest\nspecie it matches. If it does not match any specie and we alread=\r\ny have\nenough species, then increase the compatability threshold to the\nmin=\r\nimum threshold needed to match it to one of the species.\n\nFurther experimen=\r\ntations revealed that this way I got a very nice and\neven distribution of c=\r\nhromosomes over the species, but badly\nperforming species never got extinct=\r\n because of the fitness sharing.\nBadly performing species do decrease in si=\r\nze, but when they get small\nenough, they get assigned enough fitness by fit=\r\nness sharing and they\nsurvive. So I have now made sure the lowest performin=\r\ng specie is\nkilled off if it is older than 30 generations, as you did with =\r\nthe\nrobot duel experiments (I&#39;m using the robot duel too, but with larger\nt=\r\neams and some new rules to advocate cooperation).\n\nGreetings,\nBas\n\n\nBTW: I =\r\nhad set the coefficients for excess genes, disjoint genes and\nweight differ=\r\nence to 1, 1, and 2, respectively. Mutation rates are set\nsuch that I get n=\r\neural networks with a complexity of 100 to 200 after\n500 generations (start=\r\ning with 22 inputs, 3 outputs and one connection).\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a lot of cre=\r\native ideas in this thread that merit looking \n&gt; into.  Ultimately empirica=\r\nl comparisons would be the most revealing \n&gt; when it comes to alternative m=\r\nethods, and a lot of you present \n&gt; clever hypotheses.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I can&#39;=\r\nt help feeling that something more simple is going \n&gt; wrong in the situatio=\r\nn Bas describes.  That is, I&#39;m not sure the \n&gt; problem is really to do with=\r\n my original simple speciation scheme.  \n&gt; It sounds more like there is a s=\r\nystem parameter problem.  I&#39;m really \n&gt; wondering why the compatibility thr=\r\neshold has to go above 40 before \n&gt; species are getting barely inclusive.  =\r\nIt sounds like the whole \n&gt; population is spread out (in terms of either to=\r\npologies or weights, \n&gt; or both) like crazy.  Why would that happen in only=\r\n 100 generations?\n&gt; Bas, what is the rate at which you add nodes and links?=\r\n  Also, what \n&gt; is the strength of your mutations?  Finally, what are the \n=\r\n&gt; coefficients of the compatibility distance equation?  (they could be \n&gt; t=\r\noo big)\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be instructive to observe several examples of genomes=\r\n that \n&gt; are outside of 40 distance from each other.  What is causing that =\r\n\n&gt; huge distance?  It&#39;s possible that structure has been added willy-\n&gt; nil=\r\nly and speciation would thus have no way of handling the \n&gt; explosion.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n In my experience, I have never seen a speciation dynamic so out of \n&gt; cont=\r\nrol as the one Bas describes unless some other parameter is \n&gt; screwy.  The=\r\nrefore, while I think all the creativity in this thread \n&gt; is fantastic, I =\r\nthink it really isn&#39;t addressing the core problem \n&gt; Bas is having.  I coul=\r\nd be wrong, of course.  But it&#39;s worth trying \n&gt; to debug the situation a l=\r\nittle before turning to alternative \n&gt; methods.  (With the rationale that a=\r\nlternative methods would be no \n&gt; more likely to solve an unrelated systemi=\r\nc problem than the original \n&gt; method.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Please don&#39;t take this as disc=\r\nouraging the exploration of \n&gt; alternative speciation schemes.  I have to s=\r\nay that this thread is \n&gt; one of those enlightening and substantive trading=\r\ns of ideas that one \n&gt; rarely encounters on most internet newsgroups.  I&#39;m =\r\njust saying \n&gt; Bas&#39;s specific problem might be something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;itsmebas&quot; &lt;Bas@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m evolving an extension of Stanley & Miikulainen&#39;s robot duel \n=\r\n&gt; domain\n&gt; &gt; in ANJI 2.01, but I&#39;m having trouble setting the speciation \n&gt;=\r\n threshold.\n&gt; &gt; If I set it too high, all of my 100 chromosomes will (of co=\r\nurse) \n&gt; stay\n&gt; &gt; in one specie. But when I set it a bit lower, I end up wi=\r\nth 100\n&gt; &gt; species of 1 chromosome after some 100 generations. I can&#39;t seem=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; find the golden middle. On his FAQ\n&gt; &gt; (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/us=\r\ners/kstanley/neat.html), Kenneth \n&gt; Stanley\n&gt; &gt; himself presents a method t=\r\no automatically set the speciation\n&gt; &gt; threshold by descreasing or increasi=\r\nng it with, say, 0.3, whenever \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; number of species becomes more or=\r\n less than a preset target amount \n&gt; of,\n&gt; &gt; say, 10.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, whe=\r\nn I apply this method (with population size 100 and \n&gt; target\n&gt; &gt; species c=\r\nount 10), then after some 100 generations I end up with \n&gt; 20 to\n&gt; &gt; 25 spe=\r\ncies and a speciation threshold of 40 and rising. Of the\n&gt; &gt; resulting spec=\r\nies, one specie contains 50 chromosomes, 10 species\n&gt; &gt; contain 5 chromosom=\r\nes or less and 10 species contain just one \n&gt; chromosome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has anyo=\r\nne else encountered such problems before, or have some \n&gt; idea to\n&gt; &gt; what =\r\nmight be causing this?
