Perhaps I&#39;ll look into \nit a \n&gt; bit further, check out the implications, etc. Trouble is you see \nthe IT \n&gt; job market is pretty buoyant in the UK so there&#39;s [potentially] \nquite a \n&gt; few opportunities there also. hmm.\n&gt; \n\nColin, when you say there are opportunities in the UK job market,\nare you thinking just in terms of jobs in general or do you mean \npossibly using NEAT in a real application?
