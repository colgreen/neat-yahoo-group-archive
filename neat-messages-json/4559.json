Bi=\r\nped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n\nDefinitely true! :) Wh=\r\nile robots with 3+ legs are generally stable, \nbiped robots have trouble ke=\r\neping their balance. My zero-g experiment \nwith novelty search showed that =\r\ngetting an oscillation pattern that \nresembles a walking human is not a big=\r\n problem. But add gravity and it \nfalls every time. Kind of frustrating :/ =\r\n\nIt is possible to get a good biped walking behavior with HyperNEAT or \njus=\r\nt regular NEAT, but it is hard to get results in practice.. Tyler \nStreeter=\r\n has done such experiments, in fact my own experiments were \ninspired by hi=\r\ns work. \nIt is interesting that NEAT performs well even in cases of only on=\r\ne \nleg. Remember that NEAT Hopper demo? \nSo I guess the failure of my exper=\r\niments is not because it is \nincredibly hard to evolve good biped walking g=\r\nait. It is hard indeed, \nbut not that hard :) \n\n&gt;2. The sine wave I provide=\r\nd made it really easy to evolve periodic \n&gt;gaits.\n\nYes, inputting just a si=\r\nne wave to the substrate is something clever \nand I never thought of that. =\r\nI actually prefer leaky integrators \nbecause a CTRNN substrate made up by l=\r\neaky integrators doesn&#39;t need \nany inputs to make oscillations. It doesn&#39;t =\r\nneed inputs and timing at \nall. The time constant range in the leaky integr=\r\nator substrate becomes \nthe thing that is as important as the period of the=\r\n sine wave in your \nsystem. \n\n&gt;3. Leaky integrators hurt performance for so=\r\nme reason.\n\nProbably. The main reason behind why leaky integrator-based sub=\r\nstrates \nmay perform worse is because not all networks are guaranteed to \no=\r\nscillate. Some just stabilize forever. Getting oscillation with leaky \ninte=\r\ngrator networks is like a small short-term challenge of its own. \n:) Inputt=\r\ning a sine wave explicitly makes the whole thing different. \nBut there is a=\r\nn interesting observation of leaky integrator substrates \nevolving with Hyp=\r\nerNEAT. The neural activity itself appears \ndistributed in a complexifying =\r\ngeometric pattern. The time constants \nand biases of the neurons are genera=\r\nted by a 2D/3D spatial CPPN. \n\n&gt;4. I used a PID-based setup, where the targ=\r\net angle was the output of \nthe\n&gt;neural net (and not the force to be applie=\r\nd).\n\nI used the same :) The outputs are all the target joint angle rescaled=\r\n \nto min/max angle of the particular joint. But I tried applying forces \nan=\r\nd even direct angular velocities. It is interesting, it has \ndifferent dyna=\r\nmics but the PID-based setup is closest to reality \nanyway :) \n\nPeter\n\n--- =\r\nIn neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Very interest=\r\ning paper! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It reminds me ab=\r\nout the experiments I made with HyperNEAT for\n&gt; &gt; controlling biped robots.=\r\n Did you try using leaky-integrator based\n&gt; &gt; neurons for the substrate?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I found them very useful for generating\n&gt; &gt; oscillation patterns. Substra=\r\ntes of leaky integrators with tanh()\n&gt; &gt; activation functions produce oscil=\r\nlations much easier than others.\n&gt; &gt; Hm.. I should really try with robots w=\r\nith 3 legs or more. Getting\n&gt; &gt; biped walking with HyperNEAT is perhaps too=\r\n ambitious right now.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have thought a lot about your biped experiment=\r\n. I&#39;d be really \ninterested\n&gt; in hearing your opinion, and that of anyone e=\r\nlse on this list, as to \nwhy\n&gt; your results were so different from mine. I =\r\nfound that it did not \ntake that\n&gt; much tuning to get HyperNEAT to evolve r=\r\neally good quadruped gaits. \nBut, as\n&gt; you note, it was much harder to evol=\r\nve gaits in your biped setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can suggest a few hypotheses as to wha=\r\nt explains the difference. \nThese are\n&gt; not mutually exclusive, and it migh=\r\nt not be the case that any one of \nthem\n&gt; explains most of the difference, =\r\nbut instead that they add up to the\n&gt; difference. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Biped gaits are =\r\nharder to evolve than quadruped gaits\n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it=\r\n really easy to evolve periodic \ngaits.\n&gt; 3) Leaky integrators hurt perform=\r\nance for some reason\n&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle =\r\nwas the output \nof the\n&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThere are other differences of course, such as the inputs and the \nnumber o=\r\nf\n&gt; hidden nodes. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll make a few comments on each hypothesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1=\r\n) Biped gaits are harder to evolve than quadruped gaits.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be=\r\n easy to test by simply trying a biped with my setup.\n&gt; Unfortunately, I ha=\r\nve some other obligations that will prevent me \nfrom\n&gt; testing this anytime=\r\n soon, but if you (or anyone else) would like to \ngive it\n&gt; a try, that wou=\r\nld be cool. I can send you the code I used. One would \njust\n&gt; need to chang=\r\ne the quadruped into a biped. Alternately, you could \ntry to\n&gt; mimic my set=\r\nup in your &quot;Ultimate NEAT&quot; ;-).\n&gt; \n&gt; I do have access to a huge computing c=\r\nluster. So, if someone makes \nthe code\n&gt; modifications to my setup (which I=\r\n know compiles on our cluster) and \nsends\n&gt; them to me, I can do a batch of=\r\n runs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The sine wave I provided made it really easy to evolve perio=\r\ndic \ngaits\n&gt; \n&gt; This would be an easy test. You could just plug a sine as a=\r\nn input \ninto your\n&gt; biped. Note: I found that the period of the sine wave =\r\nmade a huge\n&gt; difference. If I made it too fast or too slow, evolution basi=\r\ncally \nignored\n&gt; the signal. Within the range of periods that worked, I fou=\r\nnd that I \ngot\n&gt; different types of gaits with different period speeds. Wit=\r\nh slower \nperiods,\n&gt; I observed cool tortoise-like gaits with left-right sy=\r\nmmetry. With \nmedium\n&gt; periods, I got the gaits in the paper. With faster p=\r\neriods, I saw \nslightly\n&gt; more frantic versions of the gaits in the paper.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; As a side note, I tried to evolve the period for a short while and \nit=\r\n was a\n&gt; miserable failure. I&#39;d like to try that again, and would be \ninter=\r\nested to\n&gt; hear people&#39;s thoughts as to why it failed. Maybe I&#39;ll describe =\r\nthat \nattempt\n&gt; in another email. If someone out there is curious, let me k=\r\nnow and \nI&#39;ll send\n&gt; it out sooner rather than later.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Leaky integra=\r\ntors hurt performance for some reason.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not try leaky integrators=\r\n. Did you ever try your setup without \nthem?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not try them becaus=\r\ne the default sigmoid neurons worked so \nwell out of\n&gt; the box that I did n=\r\not experiment with alternatives. Both Ken \n(during\n&gt; preliminary conversati=\r\nons about the paper) and one of the papers&#39; \nreviewers\n&gt; asked about leaky =\r\nintegrators, so there is clearly some interest out \nthere\n&gt; in seeing how l=\r\neaky integrators would compare to the neurons\n&gt; we used in the paper.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nDo most of you feel leaky integrators would perform better? Why? I \nhave\n&gt; =\r\nnever worked with them, nor do I know that much about them, so I \ndon&#39;t hav=\r\ne\n&gt; great instincts on this front. Is it possible that they could have \nmad=\r\ne\n&gt; things worse in Petar&#39;s setup?\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be cool to test them out i=\r\nn my setup. Again, I won&#39;t be \nable to get\n&gt; to this in the near future so =\r\nif someone out there wants to swap \nthem in and\n&gt; give it a go, that would =\r\nbe interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) I used a PID-based setup, where the target angle wa=\r\ns the output \nof the\n&gt; neural net (and not the force to be applied).\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n could not figure out whether your setup did this as well. What \nwere the\n&gt;=\r\n outputs in your system?\n&gt; ---------\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think any/all of these hyp=\r\notheses explain the difference in \nresults?\n&gt; What other likely hypothesis =\r\nam I missing (I am sure there are \nlots).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for checking ou=\r\nt the paper,\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; PS. Tripods would be fun. I also think adding feet=\r\n and a flexible \ntorso\n&gt; would be interesting.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; He=\r\nllo all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ever since I first understood HyperNEAT I have wanted t=\r\no see how \nit\n&gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perform at controlling legged robots.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; A paper I wrote on that subject was just accepted, so I can share \nit\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you now. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A copy of the paper, and videos of the sim=\r\nulated robots, can be\n&gt; &gt; obtained\n&gt; &gt;&gt; here:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \nhttp://devol=\r\nab.msu.edu/SupportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNE\n&gt; &gt; AT\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you find it interesting.

T.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Evolving coordinated gaits with the HyperNEAT generative \nencodin=\r\ng.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing \nS=\r\npecial\n&gt; &gt; Section\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on Evolutionary Robotics, 2009. Trondheim, Norway. =\r\nTo appear.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Legged robots show promise for complex mobility tasks=\r\n, such as\n&gt; &gt; navigating\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rough terrain, but the design of their contro=\r\nl software is both\n&gt; &gt; challenging\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and laborious. Traditional evolutio=\r\nnary algorithms can produce \nthese\n&gt; &gt;&gt; controllers, but require manual dec=\r\nomposition or other problem\n&gt; &gt;&gt; simplification because conventionally-used=\r\n direct encodings have\n&gt; &gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taking advantage of a problem&#39;s reg=\r\nularities and symmetries. Such\n&gt; &gt; active\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intervention is time consumi=\r\nng, limits the range of potential\n&gt; &gt; solutions, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; requires the user=\r\n to possess a deep understanding of the \nproblem&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; structure. This pap=\r\ner demonstrates that HyperNEAT, a new and\n&gt; &gt; promising\n&gt; &gt;&gt; generative enc=\r\noding for evolving neural networks, can evolve\n&gt; &gt; quadruped gaits\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wit=\r\nhout manually decomposing the problem. Analyses suggest that\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT =\r\nis\n&gt; &gt;&gt; successful because it employs a generative encoding that can more\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; easily\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reuse phenotypic modules. It is also one of the first\n&gt; &gt; ne=\r\nuroevolutionary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; algorithms that exploits a problem&#39;s geometric symmetr=\r\nies, which \nmay\n&gt; &gt; aid its\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performance. We compare HyperNEAT to FT-NE=\r\nAT, a direct encoding\n&gt; &gt; control, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find that HyperNEAT is able to =\r\nevolve impressive quadruped gaits \nand\n&gt; &gt; vastly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; outperforms FT-NEAT.=\r\n Comparative analyses reveal that HyperNEAT\n&gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are more h=\r\nolistically affected by genetic operators, resulting in\n&gt; &gt; better\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coo=\r\nrdination of the quadruped&#39;s legs. Overall, the results \nsuggest\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; HyperNEAT is a powerful algorithm for evolving control systems \nfor\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n complex,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet regular, devices, such as robots.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution La=\r\nb, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
