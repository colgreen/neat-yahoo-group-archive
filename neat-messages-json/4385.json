We are working on getting graphical\nvisualizati=\r\non of CPPNs onto Picbreeder.  We actually do have a fairly\nsophisticated vi=\r\nsualizer right now internally in our group, but it\nneeds to be upgraded to =\r\nwork with the latest Picbreeder code. \nHopefully that will happen soon, bec=\r\nause I think it&#39;s a fantastic\neducational tool.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken. Thanks=\r\n for adding this new feature. Now it is easier to \n&gt; analyze genome complex=\r\nity vs. phenotype complexity. I know Picbreeder \n&gt; is generally intended to=\r\n be a place for fun, but adding such features \n&gt; also helps researchers to =\r\nunderstand the workings of CPPNs. You know, \n&gt; it would be cool that a whol=\r\ne section for research purposes to exist. \n&gt; It may contain graphical visua=\r\nlization of the CPPNs and that thing \n&gt; with the intermediate pictures at e=\r\nach hidden node. And the God mode \n&gt; from DelphiNEAT&#39;s genetic art program,=\r\n too. Well it is only a \n&gt; suggestion, in general researchers can write the=\r\nir own tools, but \n&gt; Picbreeder has already a huge database of interactivel=\r\ny evolved \n&gt; pictures, so it would be good to be able to use that. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pe=\r\nter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know some people have been interested in knowing the complexity o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; CPPNs that produce different patterns on Picbreeder.  To address \n&gt; t=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; question, Picbreeder now displays the number of nodes and number of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; connections in every published CPPN on the site.  The detailed \n&gt; disp=\r\nlay\n&gt; &gt; of any image (i.e. when you click on images that are in lists) show=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; information right above the enlarged image.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The most conne=\r\nctions I&#39;ve seen just browsing around is around 500. \n&gt; &gt; For example, &quot;Hab=\r\nitable Earth&quot; takes 477 connections to represent: \n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder.or=\r\ng/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D5776\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, some interesting image=\r\ns take a lot less.  The &quot;butterfly,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; for example, takes just 108: \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhttp://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4376\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those w=\r\nho don&#39;t know about Picbreeder, it&#39;s front page is at\n&gt; &gt; http://picbreeder=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
