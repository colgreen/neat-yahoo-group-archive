It was mentioned that I&#39;ll add \nto it, bu=\r\nt it turned out that I cannot, so, I have to write that \nagain.. :)\n\nI real=\r\nized the concept of CPPNs, it is really an interesting \nindirection of crea=\r\nting the phenotype. Instead of evolving the \nphenotypes directly, &quot;phenotyp=\r\ne builders&quot; are evolved, and their \nproduct is evaluated. I don&#39;t know if t=\r\nhis is the same as the \ncomposition of functions, it is simply phenotypes c=\r\nonstructing \nphenotypes. I even think there may be infinite levels of such =\r\nan \nindirecton, like phenotypes create phenotypes that further create \nphen=\r\notypes.. \nIt is really interesting that ANY phenotype can be described by a=\r\n CPPN, \nsince the CPPN can approximate any possible function with infinite =\r\n\nprecision. \nBut WHAT is the phenotype space? It is very hard to interpret =\r\nthe \nresults from a CPPN into something practical. Consider the case when I=\r\n \nevolve Alife creatures, composed of &quot;cells&quot; that live in a complex \nsimul=\r\nated environment.\nGiven the phenotype&#39;s space as a vector (the object space=\r\n origin \n(0,0,0)), and 3 unit vectors for the XYZ axises, we can build the =\r\n\ncreature using the CPPN around the origin, and so on... The CPPN will \ntel=\r\nl me &quot;here place a muscle cell&quot;, &quot;there is no cell here&quot;, right? \nBut when =\r\nto stop? How big is the phenotype??? What if the individual \nCPPN produce a=\r\n negative image, saying &quot;there is an empty space around \nthe origin, and ev=\r\nerything that goes further into infinity are cells, \ncells... \nThis is what=\r\n is confusing me.\n\nAnothier thing to mention, I have the idea of using lots=\r\n of activation \nfunctions plus splitting the node activation into 2 stages.=\r\n \nFirst is the summing function. \nI realized that summing the weighted inpu=\r\nts in the node is equial to a \nOR logic operation on them. Would it be more=\r\n powerful to add more to \nthat, like AND? \nIt turns out that multiplication=\r\n is AND in fact..
