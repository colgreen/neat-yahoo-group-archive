If a complex of genes has formed that are all \n&gt;&gt;interdependent, that could be a bad move.  Maybe safer would be to \n&gt;&gt;just make adding *all* the excess and disjoint genes probabilistic.  \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Good point.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On the other hand, the real question of how to do it can only be \n&gt;&gt;addressed through comparisons of the types you&#39;ve been doing, i.e. \n&gt;&gt;runs with one method vs. runs with another.  \n&gt;&gt;\nOn the simple-ocr experiment there isn&#39;t much in it. The \n&#39;all-or-nothing&#39; approach (10% chance of getting all genes) performed \nslightly poorer than copying across 10% of all excess/disjoint genes. \nAlso the population complexity rose to about 1000 in an hour with \nall-or-nothing versus 600. As I said before though, simple-ocr is \nprobably artificially simple compared to most problems and will probably \nbenefit from single connection genes being copied.\n\nI&#39;m going to try again with a different problem domain, but following \nIan&#39;s comments and my previous emails it&#39;s looking like there may be \nroom for some improvement in this area anyway.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
