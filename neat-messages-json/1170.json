I&#39;ll try making a copy of one and converting all\n&gt; &gt;&#39;double&#39; to &#39;float&#39; and seeing if it outputs identical results.\n&gt;\n&gt;You won&#39;t get &quot;identical&quot; results.  But you may get ones which are\n&gt;different but as good.\n\nAll right, I tested it.  I took an existing generated code and converted \n&#39;double&#39; to &#39;float&#39; and added an &#39;F&#39; to the end of every constant (excpet \nintegers).  The resultant code was less than 5% faster.  And the error was \nabout 5% less with floats than with doubles.\n\nSince the whole purpose was to be anal retentive about image quality, trying \nto do better than the current state-of-the art enlargement techniques, I \nthink I&#39;m going to stick with the higher accuracy for now, and just throw \nmore CPU&#39;s at the problem! :)\n\n&gt;Like I said before, your numbers already have far too many decimal places,\n&gt;even for double.\n\nI&#39;ll check it out.  After I figure out exactly (without any ambiguity) how \nmany decimal places before I am just being wasteful, I&#39;ll adjust the \ngenerated code accordingly.\n\n\n\n"}}
