It&#39;s a\n&gt; popular\n&gt; joke amongst some of my peers that someone so atrocious at poker is\n&gt; attempting to write a program that can play it.  At any rate, it&#39;s not\n&gt; clear\n&gt; to me that the odds of winning are the sum and whole of the game.  If for\n&gt; no\n&gt; other reason then that there are many assumptions that go along with that\n&gt; probability.  Perhaps if we had the odds of winning at every stage in the\n&gt; game given the actions of others.  The problem is that those odds\n&gt; disregard\n&gt; the betting strategy of other players which, I believe it could be argued\n&gt; is\n&gt; really what poker is all about.  If you simply take the case of a flush\n&gt; draw\n&gt; for example, I think it is easy to see that it is not only the odds of\n&gt; winning but how those odds are distributed over the course of the game\n&gt; that\n&gt; matters in terms of betting strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; - jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2/17/07, Thomas Haferlach &lt;thomas-haferlach@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Intuitively it seems to me that one should be able to abstract from the\n&gt; &gt; actual raw hand data.
