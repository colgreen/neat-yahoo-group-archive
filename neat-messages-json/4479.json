The last days I ha=\r\nve tried your mentioned\nways. As I think you may be interested in the resul=\r\nts, here they are.\n\nIt is no scientific work, but I have build some kind of=\r\n benchmark. I\nhave stopped the training after three hours and compared the =\r\nresults.\n\nInput neurons: 625\noutput neurons: 15\n\n1) Normal representations,=\r\n just leave the not filled values 0.0\nWe set this fitness to 100%\n\n2) Use t=\r\nhe formula x =3D (x/2)+0.5 and assign 0.0 if the value is unknown:\nThis ver=\r\nsion got only 89% Fitness after the training time.\n\n3) Using additional neu=\r\nrons for blocks that are unassigned. I have\nused 61 additional neurons For =\r\nthese blocks. I have set the values of\nthe original neurons like in 1)\nTher=\r\ne were still some neurons left that had no marker if they were\nunassigned. =\r\nBut They were not unassigned in blocks, so I ignored the\nmarker for those n=\r\neurons.\nMarker was: neuron block is not assigned =3D&gt; 1.0\nFitness: 106%\nI t=\r\nhink it is working better, but as the network got bigger and I am\nstopping =\r\nafter 3 hours, maybe this is the reason for the only slightly\nimprovement\n\n=\r\n4) Same as 3) but with the following marker:\nneuron block is assigned =3D&gt; =\r\n1.0\nFitness: 98%\n\n5) Using random values if the values are unassigned:\nFitn=\r\ness: 96%\n\nI would say this benchmark is not very representative. Maybe my\np=\r\nroblem is something else.\n\n@Jeff\n\nI have run the net on only the neurons th=\r\nat are available every time\n(never unassigned). But I got no improvement ov=\r\ner using more data. I\nam just thinking that the more data the better.\n\n@ALL=\r\n\nMaybe there is a other problem.\n\nChanging training data during runtime:\n\nI=\r\n would have not problem to let the training ran for some weeks. But\nmost of=\r\n the time when training data gets exchanged (I change the 80000\ntest exampl=\r\nes every half hour - I have over billion of test cases) the\nNN Fitness stop=\r\ns. Then it increases again after the fifth or fourth\ntraining data exchange=\r\n. Maybe I should not change the training data\nwhile I am in training, but I=\r\n think that should help. What do you think?\n\nCalculating output:\n\nI need a =\r\npercentage distribution at the output. So the sum of all 15\noutput neurons =\r\nis 1.00\n\nI am doing the following (for example if there were only 4 neurons=\r\n):\n\nN1: -0.3\nN2: -0.1\nN3: 0.2\nN4: 0.6\n\nI am adding the smallest number (Abs=\r\n(-0.3)) to all neurons plus some\nextra of 0.001 so no neuron gets completel=\r\ny 0 ( I can not use 0 in my\nprogram).\n\nSo:\nN1: 0.001\nN2: 0.201\nN3: 0.501\nN4=\r\n: 0.901\n\nI take the sum of all values (1.604) and subtract every value by t=\r\nhis\n value:\n\nN1: 0.00062\nN2: 0.12468\nN3: 0.31234\nN4: 0.56172\n\nSo these is p=\r\nercentage distribution. Maybe this calculation is the\nproblem, is there an =\r\nother way?\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
