I think yahoo is having issues.  I suggest that anyone who \nposts thr=\r\nough online forms make a copy of your message before \nsending it.\n\nAnyway, =\r\nI think what you are saying actually is the kind of answer I \nwould have  h=\r\noped to hear to my question, or at least it is the kind \nof answer I might =\r\nhave expected if their answers had been more \ndetailed.  \n\nYet I personally=\r\n would not really take the answer in that direction \nif I had been asked my=\r\n own question (and of course I am biased!).  \nThe problem is that I do not =\r\nthink that mechanisistic descriptions \n(e.g. how a gene is transcribed) are=\r\n necessarily the right level \nabstraction for explaining how complexity is =\r\nrepresented and \nsearched.  Don&#39;t get me wrong- understanding the actual me=\r\nchanisms \ndoes provide clues to the underlying explanation, but they do not=\r\n in \nthemselves capture it.  \n\nIt&#39;s easy to get into a debate on what an &quot;e=\r\nxplanation&quot; actually \nmeans.  AI researchers usually hold a really high sta=\r\nndard for \nexplanation, which is that a good explanation tells you how to \n=\r\nimplement something yourself.  So for example, if you have an \nexplanation =\r\nof intelligence, it should tell me how to build it.  If I \ncan&#39;t do that, t=\r\nhen it&#39;s not reaching the treshold.  AI is sometimes \ncriticized for having=\r\n such an absurdly high standard for theoretical \nvalidation.  Nevertheless,=\r\n I think that I personally tend to \nsympathize with the implementation-cent=\r\nric mentality.  I want to know \nhow to do it myself.\n\nAnd I think that kind=\r\n of thinking leads to higher levels of \nabstraction.  Sure, there may be in=\r\n effect more than 30,000 genes, \nfor a variety of physical reasons.  Yet th=\r\nere are even only \n3,000,000,000 base pairs in the entire human genome.  Th=\r\nat is still \nmagnitudes below 100 trillion.  Not that such an argument inva=\r\nlidates \nthe idea that information can be combined in different ways- of \nc=\r\nourse that is exactly what&#39;s going on- but the question is, how \nexactly?  =\r\n\n\nAnd my thoughts like many in EC gravitate towards ideas in indirect \nenco=\r\nding, which has grown up mainly in EC.  Of course, for myself and \nmy stude=\r\nnts, this line of thought has culminated in the \nHyperNEAT/CPPN style of ex=\r\nplanation, which is that in effect \nregularities are discovered that can be=\r\n expressed as functions of \nspace and thereby encode spatial patterns.  As =\r\nthose regularities \nevolve, they are elaborated upon, which at a high level=\r\n of \nabstraction means that they are composed with yet more \nfunctions.  Th=\r\ne nice thing about such a process is that you \ncan easily discover simple r=\r\negularities early (thereby addressing the \nissue of search, the second part=\r\n of my question), and they form a \nscaffold for future elaboration.  Furthe=\r\nrmore, it creates patterns as \na function of Cartesian space, which is what=\r\n you need to do if you \nare going to create something situated in a physica=\r\nl/geometric \nuniverse.  The explanatory appeal of this idea, which is \nsubs=\r\ntianally more abstract than the nuances of RNA-&gt;protein encoding, \nis that =\r\nyou can actually implement it, so it&#39;s an AI-style \nexplanation.\n\nOf course=\r\n, if it is a proper abstraction, the explanation must \nultimately reduce do=\r\nwn to the mechanisms of biology, which I believe \nit does.  In particular i=\r\nn Meinhardt&#39;s &quot;Theoretical aspects of \npattern formation and neuronal devel=\r\nopment&quot; \n(http://www.eb.tuebingen.mpg.de/departments/former-departments/h-\n=\r\nmeinhardt) you can see how genetic regulatory networks in biology in \neffec=\r\nt encode chemical gradients into spatial patterns that form the \nbasis of o=\r\nther more complex spatial patterns situated in the \ncoordinate frames of th=\r\ne original gradients.  The term I like to use \nis &quot;a plan upon a plan upon =\r\na plan.&quot;\n\nIn any case, that is the direction I would go with answering such=\r\n a \nquestion myself, which is influenced by biology but not as physically \n=\r\nmechanistic as biologists often prefer to be.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; First off, I apologize if=\r\n this is a double post.

If someone out there=\r\n has received my previous message\n&gt; unexpectedly - oops!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken&#39;s initial=\r\n question of 30,000 genes determining a 1 trillion\n&gt; connection brain is in=\r\ncomplete.\n&gt; \n&gt; While there may be around 30,000 genes in our genome, don&#39;t =\r\nforget \nthe\n&gt; central dogma of molecular biology:  DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Protein.  =\r\nOnce \nDNA\n&gt; is transcribed to RNA, RNA is processed and can result in multi=\r\nple\n&gt; variants which can then lead to subtle differences in the translated\n=\r\n&gt; proteins.  An example is the Retinoid X Receptors.  On particular\n&gt; subse=\r\nt, i.e. RXR-alpha, has one gene but multiple isoforms resulting\n&gt; from RNA =\r\nvariants.  Each of these has subtly different activities \nwith\n&gt; respect to=\r\n retinoid binding, DNA specificity, transcriptional \ncontrol,\n&gt; etc.  This =\r\neffectively amplifies the number of apparent genes we \nhave.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, not=\r\n all genes are expressed in all cells.  Cells have somewhat\n&gt; specific cont=\r\nrols over what genes are expressed, to what level they\n&gt; are expressed, and=\r\n when they are expressed.  This gives each cell \ntype\n&gt; a different proteom=\r\ne that specifies that cells behavior and \nfunction.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just to add to t=\r\nhe complexity, proteins will be influenced by the\n&gt; milieu in which the are=\r\n present.  For example, tamoxifen has been\n&gt; commonly used as an anti-breas=\r\nt cancer agent due to its ability to\n&gt; antagonize the estrogen receptor, wh=\r\nich is required for growth of \nsome\n&gt; breast cancer tumors.  In cervical ce=\r\nlls, however, tamoxifen acts as\n&gt; an AGONIST.  Based upon the cellular cont=\r\next in which the receptor \nis\n&gt; present, tamoxifen exhibited different role=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fractal analogy used in one of the replies is somewhat \napplica=\r\nble\n&gt; and I would extend this to an analogy with Steering Behaviors (as\n&gt; e=\r\nxemplified by Craig Reynolds).  In both these systems you have a \nvery\n&gt; si=\r\nmple set of rules leading to very complex behaviors.  Given the\n&gt; complexit=\r\ny of protein expression and its role in determining cell\n&gt; behavior, the re=\r\nsulting set of highly complex rules provides a \nmedium\n&gt; in which emergence=\r\n of brain and mind can occur.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kirk\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Daniel Tuohy&quot; &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the answers we=\r\nre indeed lacking.

Two points which I rely on are (1)\n&gt; &gt; Generations w=\r\nere occuring much more rapidly for microorganisms \n(and on\n&gt; &gt; a much small=\r\ner genome), so a billion years is a long time and (2) \nThe\n&gt; &gt; search space=\r\n isn&#39;t being searched for, say, a human-like solution \nall\n&gt; &gt; at once.

Your question gets to \nissues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; a developmental biologist should primarily be interested \nin.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; development\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the human brain, he should have=\r\n been able to give other \nexamples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he was =\r\nmore familiar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Ra=\r\nkic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A \nsmall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cell,=\r\n a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of \nneocortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expansi=\r\non during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science?\n_ob=3DArticleURL&_udi=3DB6T0V-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 3Y6PFXS-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n1P&_user=3D10&_rdoc=3D1&_fmt=3D&_orig=3Dse=\r\narch&_sort=3Dd&view=3Dc&_acct=3DC000050221\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&_version=\r\n=3D1&_urlVersion=3D0&_userid=3D10&md5=3D4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; e43\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The more than 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface\n&gt; without a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comparable increase in its thickness during mammalian\n&gt; evolution =\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis of\n&gt; =\r\ncortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development. According to the proposed model, cortical=\r\n \nexpansion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the result of changes in proliferation k=\r\ninetics that\n&gt; increase the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; number of radial columnar units wit=\r\nhout changing the \nnumber of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neurons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within each unit=\r\n significantly.

Yet I \nfind that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nxplanation doubtful given that we were after all at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;debate&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and complexity, which is precisely the =\r\n\nsubstance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. I also agree that Dawkins =\r\nseemed closest to \nreally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Daw=\r\nkins would be very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our area o=\r\nf EC if only there was an opportunity to tell \nhim\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of experience\n&gt; with it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I gu=\r\ness you didn&#39;t have a chance to corner him and talk \nthings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) Dawkins does seem like he would be interested in a lot \nof th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being presented at GECCO. Did he just show up =\r\nfor the \npanel, or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the conferen=\r\nce at all?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was also thought the other really inte=\r\nresting exchange \nwas at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 33:45\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the video, when the=\r\n question of whether or not you \ncould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mouse w=\r\nith feathered wings came up, and Wolpert and Jones \nboth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; no, while Dawkins seemed to say probably not, but not for \nany of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasons the other guys came up with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Derek\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; Daniel Tuohy (danielr2e@)\n&gt; &gt; Artificial Int=\r\nelligence Software Engineer\n&gt; &gt; Stottler Henke\n&gt; &gt; 404-314-8467\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
