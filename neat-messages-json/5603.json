I&#39;m still working on that front in order to try and get some\nexpeimental results to back up (or refute) the idea. In the mean time\nthough while working on a test problem it occurred to me that there&#39;s\na very easy change we perhaps should all be making in our existing\nNEAT code, and that is to select genomes from a larger proportion of\nthe population. Withn NEAT we tend to think of speciation with fitness\nsharing as the principle mechanism for maintaining diversity, which it\ndoes do. But if at each generation we keep, say, the top 20% of each\nspecies (elitism) and also select from that same 20% then we&#39;re giving\nup a futher source of diversity within each species. (20% is the\ndefault in SharpNEAT but I think similar values are generally used in\nmost NEAT based work).\n\nIf we think about populations in the natural world then they have a\nmuch lower turnover rate where some small proportion die and are\nreplaced each year. Of course if you pick a longer period of time the\nturnover rate per unit of time is higher, but the point is that there\nis a more continuous and slow &#39;turnover&#39; in populations, and this\nallows diverse set of genomes to create offspring over and over again\ndespite having relatively low fitness. It&#39;s a balance between faster\napproach to local optima (and potnetially gettign stuck) and takign a\nbroader slower approach taking in a broader region of the search\nspace.\n\nI still think there&#39;s additional merit in breaking the region down in\nsub-regions and balancing the diversity evenly, hence I will be\npursuing that idea, but for now many of us can improve diversity in\nour searches by tweaking some config settings. I tried this with a\ndeceptive task that required an ANN to both balance a pole but also to\nswing it up from a position where the pole is pointing straight down.\nIt&#39;s quite tricky combining the fitness from these two seperate tasks\nand increasing the elitism and selection proportions substantially\ndoes seem to help in this instance (e.g. I tried 80%).\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
