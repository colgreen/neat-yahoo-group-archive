That means if you wanted to make money off of it, you&#39;d\n&gt;have to talk to them to get a license.  Of course research doesn&#39;t\n&gt;require any permission, so this shouldnt matter to most people.  But\n&gt;it&#39;s something to consider if you have greater ambitions.\n\nHi,\n\nObviously if anybody should patent parts of NEAT, it should be Ken.\n\nBut I&#39;m still not sure I feel happy about it....\n\nDid you patent the original NEAT?  Presumably if you didn&#39;t, you \ncan&#39;t now because its well in the public domain?\n\nHopefully this patent covers only the very specific implementation \ndetails of rtNEAT and could never impinge on anything so unrelated as \ncontinuous SLEAT?\n\nThe reason this matters is, for example, I have always freely shared \nall my ideas and insights with the group.  But would I want to do \nthat if there was any possibility of my ideas becoming somebody \nelse&#39;s intellectual property?  I hurry to say I&#39;m not saying this has \nhappened, I don&#39;t recall making any suggestions about this exact \narea. I&#39;m just saying that given we have a community here, which to \nsome extent develops together, I&#39;m not at all encouraged by the idea \nof some areas of our work becoming the property of less than us all.\n\n         [[In fact, since this whole group is accessibly to anybody \nwho chooses to subscribe, we are effectively putting everything we \nsay here into the public domain, and I&#39;d hate to see that limiting \nwhat people think they can say, also.]]\n\nIan (hoping not to have to put a licensing agreement into his emails).\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
