I don&#39;t think the quadruped solution is anything like nature&#39;s\n&gt; solutions to quadruped walking.  The HybrID quadruped was allowed to *further*\n&gt; evolve to adjust to joint faults, whereas real-life quadrupeds would simply\n&gt; adapt during their lifetime, which is a major difference.  In fact, walking\n&gt; solutions in the real world are adaptive and malleable, not canned circuits\n&gt; that only produce a single gait.  If a dog hurts its knee, it changes how it\n&gt; walks.  The HyrbrID quadruped can&#39;t do that.  Even an insect that loses a leg\n&gt; can adjust and keep walking.\n\nYou are correct that I overreached. I was trying to distance this problem\nfrom traditional EC toy problems only. Clearly there is a ton more to\nnatural gaits (including intralife learning) than what we have shown.\n\n&gt; Thus my guess is that the underlying encoding in nature is regular after all,\n&gt; and the irregularity that may ultimately arise within the brain is because of\n&gt; changes that are guided by adaptive rules.  But what the DNA codes for are\n&gt; those *rules*, not the changes that the rules produce.  Thus the rules\n&gt; themselves can certainly be distributed in a regular pattern.  If an irregular\n&gt; fault then arises, the rules for how that local area should change will cause\n&gt; changes for that area.  In fact, the rules must be distributed in a mostly\n&gt; regular manner:  How could it be that you should somehow adapt differently to\n&gt; a right knee fault than to a left one?  The underlying concept of adaptation\n&gt; is symmetric.\n\nYou make very interesting points. At this point it is speculation, but it\nseems we disagree in our guesses as to the amount of hard-wired irregularity\nthere is in natural systems. For example, Hyenas have longer back legs than\nfront legs: my guess is that there are some hard-wired differences in the\nneural controllers between the back and front legs. I am sure learning plays\na huge role as well, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if (a la the Baldwin\neffect), some of the knowledge began to be encoded genetically. I guess only\nvery advanced empirical studies will reveal which of us is right. Another\nissue, of course, is that we still do not have a good handle on how much\nvariation on a theme HyperNEAT can produce. We know the extremes: it can\nproduce some variation, on the one hand, and it has a hard time making\nexceptions for only one link in 100 on the other, but I still do not have a\ngood feel for whether it could make exceptions in the case of the Hyena, for\nexample, where it simply has to make two legs do something slightly\ndifferent. In our HybrID imperfect joint experiments, throughout the entire\nrun one of the joints (or a few) had a slight bit of error, and HyperNEAT\ndid not do as well as HybrID. So to me that is some evidence that HyperNEAT\ncurrently would have a harder time with my Hyena example than HybrID, and it\nseems to me that we want an encoding that can deal with the Hyena example.\n \nI would also like to point out that HybrID statistically significantly\noutperformed HyperNEAT on the simulated quadruped problem even when the\nquadruped did not have any imperfect joints. I think this shows that, in\ngeneral, rigid regularity is not ideal, and the ability to make exceptions\nwill be helpful in many cases, even on very regular problems. Then again, it\ncould be that HybrID is overfitting, and thus would perform less well on\nmore generalized tasks than HyperNEAT, or HyperNEAT+Learning. I think it is\nan interesting area of research.\n\n&gt; So I still do not see evidence that CPPNs, nor nature for that matter, should\n&gt; be expected to encode for ad hoc irregularities such as a creature that is\n&gt; born with a single gait attuned to an asymmetric body with a bad knee.  That\n&gt; is, creatures derive their gaits from their bodies, not vice-versa.  They\n&gt; sense their limbs once they are alive and adapt the way they move to the limbs\n&gt; with which they find themselves.  Hopefully those limbs are intact, but if\n&gt; not, or if they become disabled, they adapt.\n\nI do agree that it would be great if our evolved organisms were able to do\nall of these things. But those are alternate ways to produce necessary\nirregularities. My instincts tell me that we will want such variation on\nthemes throughout the body (e.g. each rib is slightly different, as are\nfingers) and brain. This gets back to the issue of how well HyperNEAT can\nmake variations on themes. Can it do ribs? Fingers? You see the picbreeder\npics and conclude that it can. I see the results from my attempts to have it\nmake exceptions and wonder if it is good enough on that front, and whether\nwe should try to make it better.\n\n&gt; It certainly could be possible that some new set of activation functions or\n&gt; augmentations of CPPNs could be better at producing the kinds of regularities\n&gt; and exceptions that are most effective for building brains.  But I do think\n&gt; that it is incorrect to frame this issue as a problem with capturing\n&gt; exceptions.  I mean, I guess I don&#39;t accept the premise of the question of\n&gt; whether it is a zero-sum game.  That question assumes that somehow we need\n&gt; more exceptions, but I do not see evidence for that.  I can think of\n&gt; innumerable possible &quot;exceptions&quot; for animal body plans, but nature would be\n&gt; able to evolve virtually none of them, even with proper selection pressure.\n&gt; How about fingers coming out of one ear, or a tongue on the bottom of one\n&gt; foot?  Or maybe one half side of the body entirely covered in hair but the\n&gt; other bald?  Or maybe we could breed babies to be born with a nice smiley-face\n&gt; tattoo on one cheek?\n&gt; \n&gt; These are ridiculous, but I do not see any clear a priori distinction that you\n&gt; have articulated between what is ridiculous and what isn&#39;t.  You seem to have\n&gt; the intuition that what HybrID produces is exactly in the class of &quot;not\n&gt; ridiculous&quot; exceptions, but in my view just because something worked does not\n&gt; mean it has any relation to nature at all.  Still, ok, it doesn&#39;t have to be\n&gt; like nature, but the question is whether it somehow sets up a new ideal vision\n&gt; for indirect encodings.  And I don&#39;t see that because I think the quadruped\n&gt; born with the broken joint is no less arbitrary than a baby with a smiley-face\n&gt; tattoo.  \n\nThe examples you raise are about as extreme as I can imagine. But I don&#39;t\nthink the exceptions I was testing for in my HybrID paper are in any way as\nridiculous. \n\nHybrID outperformed HyperNEAT even without imperfect joints. Thus, in the\nmost regular version of a non-toy problem, there were exceptions/variations\nthat helped. I think it is much more analogous to think of these as the\nkinds of variations on a theme that produce slightly different fingers, or\nback legs longer than front legs, than to think of these exceptions as\nsimilar to a finger sticking out of an ear. I was not comparing HyperNEAT to\nHybrID on a rigged problem where it was beneficial to make ridiculous\nexceptions. I tested it, in fact, on a problem that many have faulted for\nbeing too regular! Even then, exceptions (i.e., variations on a theme)\nhelped out. I then went on to show that exceptions that I think are pretty\nreasonable (minor noise in joints of the body) are even more challenging for\nHyperNEAT, possibly because it is too biased toward regularity.\n \n&gt; So you might wonder what irregularities I would think are not arbitrary.  The\n&gt; things that are not arbitrary are those irregular motifs that I intuitively\n&gt; observe in nature such as imperfect symmetry (e.g. the heart on one side or\n&gt; right-handedness) and repetition with variation (e.g. receptive field patterns\n&gt; in the brain or fingers on the hand).\n\nWe agree that producing such irregularities is a good thing. I guess we\ndisagree on whether my results to date are evidence of ridiculous\nexceptions, or desirable variation. More tests on different problems with\nsuch desired variations (e.g. a robot with back legs longer than the front)\nwill help us refine our picture.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s hard for me to think of major exceptions.  Maybe the lobster&#39;s claw?  But\n&gt; of course in all the immensity of nature there will be here and there a\n&gt; bizarre occurrence, but those do not make a rule.  (And anyway, to my\n&gt; intuition the lobster&#39;s claw is more a kind of imperfect symmetry than an\n&gt; arbitrary exception.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Admittedly, a lot of what I&#39;m going on here is intuition rather than logic.\n\nMe too. I hope you don&#39;t mind that I am out in the world raising these\nissues. You know more than anyone that I think HyperNEAT is fantastic, and\nrepresents a huge leap forward in terms of evolving bodies and brains as\ncomplex as those in nature. As I said, I personally believe we can solve the\nissues I raise within the HyperNEAT framework.\n\n&gt;&gt; In fact, isn&#39;t HybrID an example of this? Mutation-selection balance aside,\n&gt;&gt; FT-NEAT should only make a change to a pattern HyperNEAT produced if the\n&gt;&gt; change helps fitness. I realize HybrID is not the long-term solution (partly\n&gt;&gt; because of the scaling issues you mentioned), but isn&#39;t it at least an\n&gt;&gt; example of how an algorithm can make advances on the exception-making front\n&gt;&gt; without losing much, if anything, on the producing-regularity front?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a really good question/argument, and it is worth thinking about.  But\n&gt; ultimately I would not draw that conclusion from HybrID.  Rather, I would say\n&gt; that it simply works in practice on lower-dimensional structures, and I would\n&gt; not draw any more general lesson from it on the potential for representing\n&gt; more exceptions.  My guess is that if such a power were available at much\n&gt; higher dimensionalities, it would add a kind of noise on top of whatever\n&gt; regularity might be discovered, thereby handicapping the ability to discover\n&gt; regularity.  That is, my guess is that the ability to make completely\n&gt; arbitrary regular exceptions probably would not scale well.  Since scaling to\n&gt; massive sizes is part of what interests me, I would need more evidence to\n&gt; convince me that there is a need for such exception-making at large scales.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me conclude by emphasizing that I am *not* suggesting that CPPNs in their\n&gt; present form are the best encoding we will ever get.  There may indeed be\n&gt; better ones (and it&#39;s worth investigating), but what I think would make them\n&gt; better is not trying to get &quot;more exceptions&quot; but rather trying to figure out\n&gt; what kinds of exceptions there should be and what kinds of regularities there\n&gt; should be and where they would all fit into the big picture.  That is, to me\n&gt; it is more a question of kind than a question of degree.  And unfortunately,\n&gt; arguments about kind are much more specific and hair-splitting than general\n&gt; arguments about degree.\n\nI agree with this sentiment fully. That is why I think it is interesting to\nconduct experiments like those in the HybrID paper, where we are learning\nabout what kinds of irregularities HyperNEAT is capable of. As you have said\nto me in the past, one of the interesting things about the HybrID work is\nthat it shows that there is some low hanging fruit left on the tree that\nHyperNEAT is not grabbing. It is an open and interesting question if that is\nfruit that we want our encodings to eat! Currently you and I have different\nguesses as to the answer to that question, but at least we think that it is\nworthwhile to continue to think about these issues and research them.\n\nThanks again for the interesting discourse.\n\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks again for your interesting comments.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Sun, 26 Jul 2009 23:29:15 -0000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HybrID: A Hybridization of Indirect and Direct Encodings\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for Evolutionary Computation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff knows some of my thoughts on the issue of regularity vs. irregularity\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; neuroevolution and also that I recognize the nice results with HybrID, so\n&gt;&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; post is just my attempt to put out some thoughts on this important issue,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rather than a challenge to the HybrID concept.  Basically, HybrID creates a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; good opportunity to discuss these issues.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Taking a long term view, what I would like to question is the idea that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is a problem with a method that has &quot;trouble&quot; discovering arbitrary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irregularities.  It important to note that HyperNEAT has no trouble\n&gt;&gt;&gt; representing &quot;irregularity&quot; in the general sense.  In my 2007 paper on CPPNs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.html), I included explicit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; examples of irregularities and how easy they are to represent.  For example,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see the &quot;Warped Symmetry&quot; panel in figure 9 on page 24.  So I think the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; issue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is definitively *not* that HyperNEAT (or more specifically, CPPNs with a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; certain set of activation functions) has trouble representing or discovering\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irregularity, but that it has trouble discovering *particular*\n&gt;&gt;&gt; irregularities.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet such trouble may actually be a good thing.  If it were too easy to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; represent any arbitrary irregularity, then you would have an encoding that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; poor at discovering regularities.  So this argument could go in circles.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it&#39;s important to recognize that we are looking at a trade-off.  Nature\n&gt;&gt;&gt; faces\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the same trade-off.  It is difficult to say for sure whether DNA is biased\n&gt;&gt;&gt; towards regularity or irregularity, but I would guess looking at biological\n&gt;&gt;&gt; organisms that regularity reigns, and that irregularities are of certain\n&gt;&gt;&gt; *types*, that is, you would be hard pressed to &quot;breed&quot; a human with a hand\n&gt;&gt;&gt; protruding from his or her right knee, no matter how many generations were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; available.  Yet we see things like the heart on one side, right-handedness,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; etc.  But those do not mean that the encoding can simply bend to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; arbitrary\n&gt;&gt;&gt; whims of a random target.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So I think what you need if you want to evolve a really interesting artifact\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is not an encoding that is entirely flexible with respect to irregularity.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a particular encoding would often fail to meet ad hoc irregular targets,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is probably a sign of its long term potential, rather something we&#39;d want to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fix.  If we did &quot;fix&quot; it, we&#39;d be heading back towards the chaos and entropy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of direct encoding.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, we should be careful about whether we consider difficulty\n&gt;&gt;&gt; achieving\n&gt;&gt;&gt; specific irregularities a problem to solve or an asset in the long run.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Certainly there should an ability to create &quot;repetition with variation,&quot; but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; CPPNs (as well as nature) exhibit that consistently.  So it&#39;s important to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; careful what we consider to be a pathology versus an asset.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; That said, HybrID is a good practical idea.  It is clear that in some\n&gt;&gt;&gt; problems\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it is just what is needed to perfect solutions with particular irregular\n&gt;&gt;&gt; needs.  Of course, when the networks become really big, e.g. with millions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; connections, HybrID might begin to lose some of its ability to cope with the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; very high dimensionality, even if it is just tweaking on top of preexisting\n&gt;&gt;&gt; regularities encoded by the CPPN.  Nevertheless, at lower dimensionalities,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff&#39;s paper shows, it can really help.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, my main point is that the issue of what we actually *want* in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding with respect to regularity and irregularity is quite subtle and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; deserves considered contemplation.  The CPPN with the usual set of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; activation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; functions may not ultimately be the very best representation to bias towards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; what we want, but if there is something better, it would not be better by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; virtue of simply being able to capture irregularities more easily.  Rather,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; any advantage would be gained through a much more subtle argument, which\n&gt;&gt;&gt; likely refers to both regularities and irregularities of certain types, and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; why they are appropriate for the kinds of neural structures we hope to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; evolve.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Recently I have shown that HyperNEAT has trouble making exceptions to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules it discovers (Clune et al. PPSN 2008). I would like to introduce a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paper that will be at ECAL 2009 which shows one way to remedy this problem:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; combining a generative encoding (HyperNEAT in this case) with a direct\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding (FT-NEAT in this case).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The resulting algorithm, which we call HybrID (Hybridization of Indirect\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Direct Encodings), combines the best of both encodings, and outperformed\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT on all of the problems we tested it on, sometimes by as much as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 40%. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d be really interested to hear what the people on this list think of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work. For example, I&#39;ll bet there are interesting ways to remedy the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of making exceptions within HyperNEAT, and it would be interesting for us\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a community to explore them. But in the interim, if any of you are\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deploying\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT on some task and want a possible performance boost, HybrID is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easy\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to implement and may lead to a significant improvement.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is a link to the paper:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HybrID-ECAL-2009.pd&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\nf\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is the abstract from the paper:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Evolutionary algorithms typically use direct encodings, where each element\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the phenotype is specified independently in the genotype. Because direct\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encodings have difficulty evolving modular and symmetric phenotypes, some\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; researchers use indirect encodings, wherein one genomic element can\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; influence multiple parts of a phenotype. We have previously shown that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT, an indirect encoding, outperforms FT-NEAT, a direct-encoding\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control, on many problems, especially as the regularity of the problem\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increases. However, HyperNEAT is no panacea; it had difficulty accounting\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for irregularities in problems. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hybridized Indirect and Direct encoding (HybrID), which discovers the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; regularity of a problem with an indirect encoding and accounts for\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irregularities via a direct encoding. In three different problem domains,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HybrID outperforms HyperNEAT in most situations, with performance\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; improvements as large as 40%. Our work suggests that hybridizing indirect\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and direct encodings can be an effective way to improve the performance of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolutionary algorithms.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
