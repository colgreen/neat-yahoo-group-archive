In fact, killing off a species is a delicate =\r\nbusiness and needs to be done carefully.  You cannot simply &quot;delete&quot; the sp=\r\necies because NEAT allocates offspring based on a formula that would be una=\r\nware of such a deletion, which could lead to e.g. a reduction in the popula=\r\ntion size.  By intervening at the fitness level, it is possible to leave th=\r\ne allocation procedure alone to do its thing and rely on the fitness penalt=\r\ny to take care of extinguishing the species.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I would point out that, in JNE=\r\nAT at least, &quot;killing&quot; the species just means\n&gt; adjusting the fitnesses of =\r\nthe organisms to 1% of their value and letting\n&gt; selection do as it will fr=\r\nom there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Mar 7, 2010 at 9:08 PM, Jeff Clune &lt;jclu=\r\nne@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The dropoff_age is a way to penalize stagna=\r\ntion.

The growth and death of species afterwards is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; determined=\r\n by some code in the epoch() method that does not appear\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to resemb=\r\nle NEAT speciation. I&#39;m concerned that whatever JNeat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing, it=\r\n isn&#39;t what Ken had in mind, and it leads to some strange\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; behavior=\r\n. Attached is a graph showing how the number of species\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; grows duri=\r\nng a run of the XOR experiment.
