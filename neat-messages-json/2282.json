To me it seems that your functions are \nequivalent to one of these trees that map a load of inputs to an output...\n\n&gt;\tThis is very much work-in-progress,\n&gt;\nIsn&#39;t everything?\n\n&gt;\tOK, so the basic idea is to take the ideas behind Ken&#39;s &quot;standard&quot; NEAT \n&gt;and add just enough new pieces to enable some modularity.  I also wanted to \n&gt;build in some ability to exploit symmetry, but my first take on that didn&#39;t \n&gt;pan out, so I&#39;ve put that on hold for the moment.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI wonder, have any of the modular NEAT experiments investigated \nexploitation of symmetry? So e.g. when attaching modules to the inputs \n(or each other) if you have knowledge that e.g. the inputs describe \npoints on a 2D surface then you can attach to those inputs in various \npermutations of rotation, translation and reflection - instead of \nattempting random combinations.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;(i) by considering the input cells in terms of there geometric relationship \n&gt;to one another, we can rephrase our original expression as:\n&gt;\n&gt;X = IsMine(LeftOf(B)) AND IsMine(RightOf(B)) AND IsEmpty(B)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\tThis gives us an expression that remains valid even if B is substituted \n&gt;for some other cell, so we can rewrite it with a variable:\n&gt;\n&gt;X = IsMine(LeftOf(p)) AND IsMine(RightOf(p)) AND IsEmpty(p)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk this is now a bit like taking an ANN (or an EP) and scanning across \nall of the boards positions looking for good moves. So like roving eye \nonly not roving. A scanning eye. (Getting feelings of Deja vu here).\n\n&gt;(iii) for the overall output, I have assigned each board an additional real \n&gt;value, which is its output weighting.  The overall output of the system is \n&gt;the weighted sum of all generated boards, weighted by their output \n&gt;weighting.  the system is then taken to be choosing the play the cell with \n&gt;the highest value on this output board.\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;\tThat&#39;s the basic idea.  Is anybody completely lost?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSort of. Actually although not central to your post I like the idea of \nexploiting symmetry, the work we were doing manually normalizing TTT \nboard state was very specific to the problem at hand. A more generic \ntechnique for searching out symmetries sounds like a good idea. So e.g. \nwhen modules are connecting the connection routine could be \nparameterised to connect &#39;surfaces&#39; of different dimensionality, shape, \nsize, rotation etc. in the hope that one of the surfaces described is \nrelevant to the problem - so for TTT a 2D surface of size 3x3.\n\nIn addition I often wonder if we shouldn&#39;t just replace the old style \nneuron with sigmoid activation fn with nodes that apply one of a fixed \nset of functions. A sort of  EP-NEAT fusion, this is basically what I \nwas describing a while ago in the discussion about good benchmark \nfunctions. Does anyone have a good argument for/against this? I suppose \naligning the input/output value ranges of different functions is one \nproblem, but that could be solved by with a bit of normalisation I suspect.\n\nTaking this further I would like to modify the sharpneat framework to be \nmade more generic so that EP-NEAT could be defined by slotting an  an \nEP-NEAT node type and any associated  logic/functionality required. \nStandard NEAT with ANN&#39;s then becomes one possible implementation of a \nwider technique. Actually Ken makes this point on the NEAT web page \nsomehwere - that the topolgy evolvign aspect of NEAT is useful in other \narena&#39;s, not just ANN&#39;s.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
