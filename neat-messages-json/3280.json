For instance, consider something \nlike a\n&gt; poker g=\r\name where we want to input both players&#39; actions and the cards \nwe\n&gt; see. W=\r\ne might be able to come up with geometric encodings for either \nof\n&gt; these =\r\nindividually, but there&#39;s no obvious spacial relationship \nbetween\n&gt; cards =\r\nand actions.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
