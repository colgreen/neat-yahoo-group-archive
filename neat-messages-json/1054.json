There will be a predetermined order \nand you will all go back to back.  LBP&#39;s are not organized into \ncategories so a panel wouldn&#39;t make much sense.   People who go to \nLBP sessions usually like the fact that they are faster paced than \nother presentations, so in other words if there&#39;s a paper you don&#39;t \nlike it&#39;s over soon anyway.\n\nBy the way, check it out, the schedule is up at:\n\nhttp://www-illigal.ge.uiuc.edu:8080/GECCO-2004/talk-schedule.html\n\nYou guys are 5th up in your session.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll be presenting our paper at GECCO during a Late-Breaking Paper\n&gt; session, and here are the instructions from the website:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.isgec.org/gecco-2004/\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Late Breaking Paper (LBP) talks should take no more than 15 \nminutes in total. \n&gt; \n&gt; Set-up of necessary presentation equipment should be calculated \ninto\n&gt; the allotted presentation time.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; They&#39;ve got 8 LBP&#39;s scheduled during a 2 hour and 10 minute block \nin\n&gt; the same room.  I&#39;d be interested to hear anyone&#39;s experiences \nduring\n&gt; a presentation like this, as this is our first.  When I saw that\n&gt; they&#39;d scheduled a group of presenters to a block, I thought it \nwould\n&gt; be something like a panel format.  Or do we just draw straws and \ngive\n&gt; our presentations back-to-back?\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n"}}
