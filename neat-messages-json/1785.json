I think NEAT is massively attractive\n&gt; here: topology can vary and a larger range of input data can be\n&gt; presented (I&#39;d be inclined to start with an un- or\nsparsely-connected\n&gt; network and let the program work out what&#39;s useful).\n&gt; \n\nMike, from recent work here, starting sparsely looks like a really\ngood idea.  We are working on a paper right now that reports great\nresults from starting this way as opposed to starting fully-connected.\n An earlier workshop paper from last year on the topic is here:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:geccows04\n\nThis year&#39;s paper simplifies the technique and shows more definitive\nresults in a more significant domain.  So I&#39;d say your inclination is\npromising.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
