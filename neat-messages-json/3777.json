The substrate in \nHyperN=\r\nEAT is the geometric space of the neural network.  In other \nwords, nodes a=\r\nre situated at location in the subtrate.  HyperNEAT then \ndecides how to co=\r\nnnect those nodes by querying a CPPN to ask for the \nconnection weights.\n\nS=\r\no you could say that it &quot;substitutes&quot; for the &quot;random generation of \nconnec=\r\ntions,&quot; but that is not really accurate because the CPPN still \nreceives ra=\r\nndom connections from mutations in the same way the the \nneural network doe=\r\ns in regular NEAT.\n\nThe difference is that in HyperNEAT, the CPPN (which is=\r\n the genome) \nactually generates the neural network, whereas in regular NEA=\r\nT the \ngenome and the neural network are the same thing (which is it is \nca=\r\nlled a &quot;direct encoding&quot;)\n\nI also do not know what you mean by &quot;use a subst=\r\nrate as an activation \nfunction.&quot;  A substrate is an entire network, which =\r\nmay perform a \nhighly complex task.  It may have multiple outputs.  So I am=\r\n not sure \nif it makes sense to use it as a single activation function, unl=\r\ness it \nis part of some kind of larger hierarchical structure, but I am not=\r\n \nsure if that would be very useful.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Lu=\r\nca_PI&quot; &lt;wolfgroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using hyperneat in csharp v=\r\nersion. If I understand well the\n&gt; substrate is only a substitution of the =\r\nrandom generation of the\n&gt; connections, right? or not? :P\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone have=\r\n tried to use a substrate as an activation function? The\n&gt; connections and =\r\nthe structure of the network will be fixed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy year to all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lu=\r\nca\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
