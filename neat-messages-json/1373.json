Here&#39;s how\n&gt; the selection algorithm works:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Pick a uniform random number between the min and\n&gt; max population fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Select the individual in the population with\n&gt; fitness closest to the random number; use this\n&gt; individual to reproduce.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course NEAT already has a method to keep the\n&gt; population diverse, but in my domain I still usually\n&gt; have a bunch of species all converged on different\n&gt; local optima.  I&#39;m experimenting with using this\n&gt; selection method in combination with NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on this selection\n&gt; method?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyler\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
