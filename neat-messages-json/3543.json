In Golem the goal is to ambulate and cover distance.  \nTh=\r\nat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; a pretty specific goal set up by an experimenter .  I don&#39;t see \nh=\r\now it\n&gt; &gt; differs from any other TBE-type goal?  Or do you mean to say \ntha=\r\nt all\n&gt; &gt; evolution is in effect TBE?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I was trying to point=\r\n out that it is probably more of a \ncontinuous\n&gt; spectrum than a binary att=\r\nribute. Nature and good alife is one end \nof the\n&gt; spectrum, Golem is somew=\r\nhere in the middle, and matching a complex \npicture\n&gt; pixel for pixel is on=\r\n the other end.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if the problems you outline with TBE are right (an=\r\nd I think \nmany of them\n&gt; are), then it might make sense to say something l=\r\nike &quot;the more you \nmove away\n&gt; from TBE, the less you will have these probl=\r\nems.&quot;\n&gt;\n\nThat&#39;s a good point, Jeff.
