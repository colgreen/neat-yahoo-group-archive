You need to look at the actual textual \ndescription of the genome (loadable in Ugo&#39;s third panel) and see \nwhat the genome actually contains.   I believe JNEAT is sound; other \npeople have used it to evolve other things like control networks \nsuccessfully.   If Ugo is reading here he may have further insight.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; There is probably a more serious problem than the\n&gt; &gt; fitness function,\n&gt; &gt; since this is quite abnormal.  By the way, if you\n&gt; &gt; download either \n&gt; &gt; Mattias Fagerlund&#39;s demos or Ugo Vierruci&#39;s JNEAT,\n&gt; &gt; you can watch XOR \n&gt; &gt; in action and see how solutions should look.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks, Ken.  We&#39;re having a look at Ugo&#39;s\n&gt; implementation now for comparison.\n&gt; \n&gt; JNEAT does find very efficient solutions in a\n&gt; relatively small number of generations...seems to be\n&gt; working quite well.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I&#39;ve noticed some strange topologies\n&gt; displaying via the gui.  I don&#39;t know if this is a\n&gt; problem with the gui or with the algorithm itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve uploaded pics of these in the Photos section of\n&gt; our Yahoo Group.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, here the First Winner Genome as a node\n&gt; (9), which appears to have to incoming connections,\n&gt; but no outgoing connections.  How would such a\n&gt; structure even be allowed to evolve with NEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=exa\nmple1.gif&.view=t&.done=http%\n3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%\n26.view=t\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s another, where the Current Genome has a node\n&gt; (12) without any outgoing connections:\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=exa\nmple2.gif&.view=t&.done=http%\n3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%\n26.view=t\n&gt; \n&gt; And another:\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=exa\nmple3.gif&.view=t&.done=http%\n3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%\n26.view=t\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this an error, or am I not understanding how either\n&gt; NEAT or JNEAT works?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How many generations are your runs going?  How many\n&gt; &gt; species are you \n&gt; &gt; seeing form?  What does your fitness graph look\n&gt; &gt; like?  When does it \n&gt; &gt; typically lift off the plateau (where it still\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t made the \n&gt; &gt; crucial connection that allows the problem to be\n&gt; &gt; solved)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t know yet.  We&#39;ve only been looking at textual\n&gt; output so far.  But within the next day or two we&#39;ll\n&gt; generate some graphics and upload them to the Photos\n&gt; section.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Protect your identity with Yahoo!
