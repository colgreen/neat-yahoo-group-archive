I am trying to alter the windows version\n&gt;to do some color recognition.  Primarily, my goal is to be able to use the\n&gt;algorithm.  After I feel comfortable with the code, I will apply it to\nboard\n&gt;games.  I am hoping to create a neural network that will act as a heuristic\n&gt;function.\n\nSpeaking from my own experience, I think you&#39;ll find it&#39;s much easier to use\nKen&#39;s NEAT code under Cygwin than it is to adapt the Windows NEAT code.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
