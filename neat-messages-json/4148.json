I&#39;m not very\nfamiliar with them, but she&#39;s been working with these models in her\nresearch.\n\nYou can browse the source code of our project here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/neat-python/source/browse -- what you want is\nin /trunk/neat/ifnn. The code is a mix of Python and C++, but there is\na &quot;pure python&quot; version of the InF and some C++ bindings. You can\neasily understand the sources since Python is &quot;almost&quot; like\npseudo-code :-)\n\nHope it helps!\n\nCesar\n\nOn Thu, Jun 19, 2008 at 1:45 AM, Derek James &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hey all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve just recently started working with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)\n&gt; neurons, and since I don&#39;t have any prior experience with them and I&#39;m\n&gt; relying on written resources, I thought I&#39;d post a quick question here\n&gt; to see if anybody else had done much work with them. I have a few\n&gt; questions regarding their implementation, as well as spike-time\n&gt; dependent plasticity (STDP).\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve got almost 400 members now in the group...anybody have any\n&gt; experience implementing these things?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Derek\n\n"}}
