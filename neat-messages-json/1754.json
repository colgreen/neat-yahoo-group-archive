Good stuff.\nIt did clear up most of the details I was wondering about, but it\nwould be handy to have your code available to look at in case there is\nsomething more I&#39;m wondering about.\n\nI am currently working on comparing different ways of encoding\nmodularity for evolving controllers in the simple game of Cellz, where\nagents have radial symmetry. One of the methods will be something very\nmuch like modular neat, but without the speciation and symbiotic\ncoevolution parts. (If I understand your thesis right, you didn&#39;t find\nany evidence that the symbotic coevolution part actually improved\neffectiveness.)\n\nI definitely think that the general idea of modular neat is a (the?)\nkey to scaling up evolutionary computation in certain domains with\ninherent symmetry, such as complex visual input. Actually, I&#39;m not\nconvinced that artificially embryogenetic systems (e g GRN-based)\nneccessarily have more to offer in terms of evolvability (though they\nmight be more interesting from a biological point of view) than the\nstraightforward approach to modularity taken in neat.\n\nJulian\n\nOn Thu, 2 Dec 2004 14:14:52 -0600 (CST), Joseph Reisinger\n&lt;joeraii@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  Hi Julian,\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I wrote Modular NEAT for my undergraduate thesis at UT; so, the GECCO\n&gt;  paper was kind of a distillation of the thesis, with a little extra work\n&gt;  on measuring modularization. If you&#39;re interested, I put the thesis itself\n&gt;  is in the files section of this group (honors-thesis.ps.gz). That version\n&gt;  is a little heavier on the implementation and analysis side, so it might\n&gt;  be helpful to you.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Unfortunately I haven&#39;t put any work into it since finishing the GECCO\n&gt;  paper, though I am working on a GRN-based system that I hope to get some\n&gt;  results on by the next GECCO deadline. Anyway I still have a ton of ideas\n&gt;  for modular NEAT, and I&#39;d love to see the work continue on it. I think the\n&gt;  results were pretty clear that its a powerful optimization, at least for\n&gt;  some types of domains.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  As for the source code, I&#39;ve been planning for a while now to make a\n&gt;  formal release of it, but I really haven&#39;t had a lot of time to go over\n&gt;  the code. I&#39;d be more than happy to package it up and send it to you in\n&gt;  its current state, and to answer any questions you have, but, the code\n&gt;  itself is not well-documented (much less so than Ken&#39;s original NEAT code\n&gt;  :P) and probably needs to be rewritten. Let me know if you&#39;re interested\n&gt;  though; I can at least point out the really obscure implementation details\n&gt;  for you.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Joe\n&gt;  \n&gt;  -- \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Joseph Reisinger\n&gt;  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  On Thu, 2 Dec 2004, Julian Togelius wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m a beginning research student at University of Essex, UK (more on\n&gt;  &gt; me at http://julian.togelius.com) and I&#39;m also new to this group.
