Things like statistics are\n&gt;  part of the engine.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Whether it&#39;s &quot;too much information&quot; for the nets to learn, I don&#39;t\n&gt;  know...that&#39;s what experiments are for. :)\n&gt;\n\nI see...well, it&#39;s hard to say insofar as I don&#39;t know what that\ninformation is right now.  That is to say, I&#39;m still up in the air in\nmy own mind as to what we would need to supply.  But by all means post\nthe code somewhere and let&#39;s take a look.\n\njeff\n\n-- \n...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\ninteresting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\nin, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\nwell, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\nidea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\ngradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\nhanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\nbecause this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\nin it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\nthink this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n\n-- Douglas Adams\n\n"}}
