Is it a delta request, i.e. is it a\nrequested change, o=\r\nr is it an absolute angle that is requested?  \n\nMy suggestion is to allow o=\r\nutputs to request only very small\nincremental changes in angle, such as &quot;mo=\r\nve one degree up&quot; or &quot;move\none degree down&quot; at maximum.  If there are enoug=\r\nh time steps per\nsecond, then it should move to the correct angle in reason=\r\nable time.\n\nHowever, perhaps I misunderstood how your output works.  If so,=\r\n how\nare you interpreting the output?\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nmatthias.linhardt&quot; &lt;faulerlennert@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Good morning everyone!\n&gt; =\r\nThanks a lot, Colin, these were very good ideas you had! I spent the \n&gt; who=\r\nle day and night checking everything, but I haven&#39;t found my \n&gt; mistake so =\r\nfar. But I made some interesting discoveries, which I hope \n&gt; help me find =\r\nthe culprit or at least point me in the right direction. \n&gt; I tried differe=\r\nnt settings with the 1joint condition and everything \n&gt; worked out fine (ag=\r\nainst my earlier expectations). \n&gt; 1. I started with the easiest task: 3 ra=\r\nndom start angles (0=B0-180=B0), \n&gt; 1 goal angle (90=B0). Time elapsed unti=\r\nl perfect movement was observed: \n&gt; 30 generations.\n&gt; 2a. 3 random start an=\r\ngles (0=B0-180=B0), 3 differnt goal angles (45=B0, \n&gt; 90=B0, 135=B0). 50 ge=\r\nnerations until perfect behavior.\n&gt; 2b. Same as 2a, but with 12 random star=\r\nt angles. 70 generations.\n&gt; 3. 3 random start angles (0=B0-180=B0), 3 rando=\r\nm goal angles (30=B0-150=B0). \n&gt; 90 generations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although more generat=\r\nions were needed with increasing task complexity \n&gt; (and I think the time n=\r\needed is appropriate, taking into account that \n&gt; gravity has to be masterd=\r\n, or am I wrong?), all of the above tasks \n&gt; was solved with very good resu=\r\nlting behaviour. Then I started to add \n&gt; a second joint and suddenly every=\r\nthing was back to normal (which in \n&gt; my case means: bad). \n&gt; 4. 1st joint:=\r\n 3 random start and 3 random goal angles (0=B0-180=B0). 2nd \n&gt; joint: 3 ran=\r\ndom start and 3 random goal angles (0=B0-360=B0). Observed \n&gt; behaviour: un=\r\ntil generation 50 fast improvements, generation 50-100 \n&gt; minor improvement=\r\ns, generation 100-600 no improvements at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Judging from the above m=\r\nentioned data, I would suggest two \n&gt; possibilites:\n&gt; A. The 1st joint work=\r\ns well, meaning I made a mistake concerning the \n&gt; 2nd joint (and all follo=\r\nwing) which makes it impossible for NEAT to \n&gt; solve the problem (e.g. not =\r\nall of the necessary input is provided).\n&gt; B. There is a more general mista=\r\nke I made, resulting in lower \n&gt; performance with increasing task complexit=\r\ny and concerning not only \n&gt; the 2nd joint but all joints in general (e.g. =\r\nan error in the \n&gt; communication between NEAT and the simulator).\n&gt; \n&gt; Pers=\r\nonally, I would vote for A, so as long as nobody disagrees (for \n&gt; example,=\r\n because you think the 1st joint should learn much faster \n&gt; these easy tas=\r\nks), I will try some easier tasks with 2joints (like \n&gt; the ones with 1join=\r\nt, e.g. with one joint having a non-random goal \n&gt; angle) in order to narro=\r\nw down the field.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can&#39;t thank you guys enough, it&#39;s very good to hav=\r\ne someone with \n&gt; fresh ideas listening to one&#39;s problems. I was really des=\r\nperated as I \n&gt; made no progress at all over the last weeks, but now I&#39;m fu=\r\nll of hope \n&gt; to get it right in the end.\n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
