Input\nnodes are blue, hidden green, and output lavender. \nExcitatory connections are black, while inhibitory\nones are in red.  The opacity of the connections are\nrelated to the magnitude of their connection weight. \n\nThere&#39;s probably not a need for a single standard\nlayout view...SVG files are easy to edit and\nindividual users can modify them to suit their\npreferences.  But it would be nice to have a\nboilerplate layout.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
