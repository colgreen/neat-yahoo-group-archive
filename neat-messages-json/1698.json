When\nevolving, we have a pop size of 100, and 30 randomized objects for\nevaluation.  But a best-evolved individual may have identifed all 30\ncorrectly, but when shown a test set of 100, for example, it will\nstill miss two or three.  It seems like the evaluation set may be too\nsmall to generalize *all* possible randomizations.\n\nSo we thought about increasing the evaluation set, but our image\nprocessing is our big bottleneck, and the more evaluations we add, the\nslower runs take.\n\nDoes you think it makes sense to chop the pop size in half and up the\nevaluation set during evolution?  Or does anybody have any other\nideas?\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n"}}
