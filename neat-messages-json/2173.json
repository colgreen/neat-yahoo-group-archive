In the one run I&#39;ve performed so far the chain grew to\n&gt;&gt;length 19 in about 6 hrs. Over a further 4 hrs max fitness increased 9\n&gt;&gt;times, but no new dominant genome was found.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;How can this happen?  Isn&#39;t the only way max-fitness increases by finding a \n&gt;genome that beats the whole of the previous chain?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNo, it is possible because the scores are weighted. A bit more info... \n\nTo obtain a fitness score a new player is tested against each player in \nthe dominance chain. A test is currently just 2 games, one each way. \nEach of the games is scored as descibed by these constants:\n\n        const double P1_SCORE_WIN = 2.0;\n        const double P1_SCORE_DRAW = 1.0;\n        const double P1_SCORE_LOSE = 0.0;\n\n        const double P2_SCORE_WIN = 4.0;\n        const double P2_SCORE_DRAW = 2.0;\n        const double P2_SCORE_LOSE = 0.0;\n\nSo winning as player 2 is worth more than winning as player 1, etc. and \neach player being tested gets an overall score of between 0 and 6.0 (won \nboth games). This score is then multiplied by the index of the dominance \nplayer on the chain (+1 &#39;cause the indexes are 0 based). This aproach \nwasn&#39;t scientifically arrived at, it just seemed like a good idea on the \nbasis\nthat later player added to the chain are probably better than earlier ones.\n\nAnyway, wehat this means is that a new player might be able to beat the \ncurrent dominant player but not the whole chain, and therefore score \nmore than the dominant player did.\n\n&gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Performance against a random player isn;t a brilliant metric but it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;the best I have to hand. I&#39;m thinking of trying a combination of random\n&gt;&gt;and Derek & Philips &#39;best&#39; player strategy - alternating between the two\n&gt;&gt;strategies for each move. That way the player isn&#39;t unbeatable, isn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;deterministic (always plays the same game!) but plays a better game than\n&gt;&gt;pure randomness.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As another option, I could give you some code that for any board and \n&gt;proposed move will tell you whether against a perfect minimax player that \n&gt;move would lead to a win, lose or draw...\n&gt;\n&gt;Or maybe, using normalisation to reduce the number of boards, it would now \n&gt;be possible to iterate over all possible games and just count the \n&gt;proportion of win/lose/draw.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI like the idea. I can probably cobble somthign together using the \n&#39;BestPlayer&#39; strategy I borrowed from Derek & Philip. I don&#39;t know how \nthat strategy compares with a perfect minimax player - I&#39;ll read up on \nminimax first.\n\n&gt;&gt;Anyway the figures above are the best I&#39;ve seen so far from any of my\n&gt;&gt;recent TTT experiments. Also note that Derek & Philip reported these\n&gt;&gt;rates against a random player in their TTT paper:\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If this is the best so far, why is it &quot;not brilliant&quot;?  Do you just mean in \n&gt;the sense of you didn&#39;t find a perfect player yet?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n From the point of view of a human player. If I were playing this ANN \nplayer not knowing who or what I was playing I&#39;d evaluate it as quite \npoor. It&#39;s all progress though, and very educational.\n\n&gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;So unless I&#39;ve overlooked some bug it seems to me that my TT search has\n&gt;&gt;got stuck in a rut. This isn&#39;t surprising really since I evaluate\n&gt;&gt;againat a dominance chain that represents just 19 strategies, all or\n&gt;&gt;most of which are probably what Ken termed alien strategies, as far as\n&gt;&gt;it&#39;s possible to have an alien strategy in TTT! After all it is a pretty\n&gt;&gt;simple game.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You could also try probing the relationship between a player and a \n&gt;dominance-chain entry more deeply...\n&gt;\n&gt;e.g. you start with an empty board, which means there is only one game they \n&gt;can play against each other...\n&gt;\n&gt;On the other hand, if you made the first two moves for them, you can force \n&gt;them to play errr, I think its 12 different games...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, this makes sense. The normalised board state means that I am no \nlonger able to perform 16 games per evaluation, which allowed me to more \nfully evaluate the interaction of two given strategies. Playing from a \nnumber of starting states should achieve a similar thing.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Directions then are to try more traditional co-ev techniques, I only\n&gt;&gt;used a dominance chain because it seemed like a nice solution and was\n&gt;&gt;easy to implement. oh and maybe implementing dead spots in the fitnes\n&gt;&gt;space as discussed recently.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I must have missed that discussion?  Or &quot;dead spots&quot; something I know under \n&gt;a different name?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I&#39;m referring to the recent discussion about avoiding areas of the \nfitness space where dead species are or were located.\n\n&gt;w.r.t fitness functions.  I&#39;ve been actively, if slowly working on evolving \n&gt;TTT for a week now.  My technique is a bit different from yours.  Can we \n&gt;come up with a way to compare my progress against yours?\n&gt;\nIterating over all possible board states after normalisation and \nassigning a score to each possible move based on how &#39;good&#39; that move is \nseems like a reasonable basis to start from.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
