NERO is the novel video \ngame we are developing based ona real-time version of NEAT.  NERO \nhas a lot of features that are interesting even if you aren&#39;t into \ngaming:  you can basically set up neuroevolution experiments and \nchange the fitness function dynamically in real-time, watch your \nwhole population evolve at once, and even interact with them as they \nevolve.  And you don&#39;t need to understand anything about GAs, NEAT, \nneuroevolution, or anything technical in order to play with it.  If \nyou are curious about its progress, the website is being updated at:\n\nhttp://nerogame.org\n\nThere are new screenshots and movies.  You can also go directly to \nmovies at movies.nerogame.org.\n\nWe are hoping to release the game in a few months so that people can \nplay on the internet.  \n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
