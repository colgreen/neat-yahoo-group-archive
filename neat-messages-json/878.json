Easy to read, good content. It seems so obvious once \nyou\n&gt; spell it out.\n\nThanks, Chad.\n\n&gt; I did have a question about one table:\n&gt; \n&gt; Type Avg. minutes perrun\n&gt; (rounded to nearestminute)\n&gt; COMPLEXIFYING 216\n&gt; SIMPLIFYING 210\n&gt; BLENDED 170\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this to process a constant number of generations, or to achieve a\n&gt; certain fitness against the hand coded opponents?\n\nOur runs were performed for a set number of generations.  In this \ncase, 200 individuals were evolved for 200 generations.  As we note \nin the paper, there is some randomness in the game play of our hand-\ncoded players, so there is some variation in the lengths of games.  \nBut since so many games were played each generation, the variation \nshould average out over the run.\n\nNote that the Blended runs averaged a little under 3 hours each, \nwhile the Complexifying runs averaged about 46 minutes longer.  I \nthink Colin mentioned having complexifying, then simplifying phases, \nbut I think our paper suggests that this would be less efficient than \nsearching with both dynamics as you go.  When the average complexity \ngets larger and larger, its going to bog down your system resources.  \nThe Blended approach keeps the average complexity smaller to begin \nwith, which is probably more efficient than bloating and trimming.  \nThat said, it would be interesting to see someone verify this.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
