Cool stuff.  It&#39;s exciting to=\r\n see\nyou expand NEAT in such a novel way.  I have a few comments and questi=\r\nons.\n\n1) I agree there is intuitive appeal to the CPPN scheme.  The way\nsub=\r\ntle elaborations are applied to core structure seems powerful.  But\nI can&#39;t=\r\n see what the next step from here is - specifically, to produce\nan ANN.  \nT=\r\nhe examples in the paper produce 2D greyscale images.  Do you already\nhave =\r\nideas how a CPPN would produce a directed network graph with\nconnection wei=\r\nghts?  I suppose one simple scheme would be to interpret\nthe X and Y inputs=\r\n as neuron IDs, and the output as the connection\nweight between those IDs. =\r\n The range and density of neuron IDs would\nneed to be represented somehow. =\r\n Does that seem lik the right track? \nDo you envision CPPNs with multiple o=\r\nutputs?\n\n2) Can you give a short definition of &quot;gradient&quot; and &quot;coordinate\nf=\r\nrames&quot; in the context of the paper?  They&#39;re used several times, and\nI thin=\r\nk I have the general idea from context.  But they are pivotal to\nthis domai=\r\nn, so I want to make sure I have a clear understanding.\n\n3) You list repeti=\r\ntion, repetition with variation, symmetry, imperfect\nsymmetry, elaborated r=\r\negularity, and preservation of regularity as the\n6 patterns exhibited in na=\r\nture that a good model should include. \nOther than your own intuition, is t=\r\nhere any justification for this\nbeing a necessary and complete list?\n\n4) I&#39;=\r\nm skeptical of the human-guided evolution process you used with\nevolutionar=\r\ny art.  It seems like you&#39;re arguing that an important step\non the path to =\r\nevolving a bird is to evolve a bird-shaped picture. \nBut birds weren&#39;t sele=\r\ncted because somebody thought they looked like\nbirds, they were selected mo=\r\nstly based on behavior.  \nYou mention 2 other schemes (L-Systems and Turing=\r\n&#39;s &quot;reaction\ndiffusion model&quot;) that produced organic-looking structures.  T=\r\nhose\nwere both around 50 years ago (I think), and they haven&#39;t (as far as I=\r\n\nknow) led to serious biologically-inspired computer systems.\n\n5) You draw =\r\na strong dichotomy between CPPNs and develompental\nprocesses because CPPNs =\r\naren&#39;t time-based.  But, the CPPN network is\ngoing to have to be activated,=\r\n and each step is going to take time. \nAlso, one could view the model as ha=\r\nving one of the inputs be time. \nIt can be very fast, but a gene regulatory=\r\n network in a computer is\nmuch faster than a biological one.  Am I missing =\r\nsomething here?\n\n6) This is a semantic nitpick.  You write in paragraph 4 o=\r\nf section\n2.3, &quot;[biological evolution] does not start searching in a space =\r\nof\nthe same complexity as the final solution&quot;.  Describing evolution as\nhav=\r\ning a &quot;final solution&quot; is misleading - it makes it seem directed. \nThere is=\r\n no final solution, there are just solutions good enough to\nsurvive.\n\n- Phi=\r\nlip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
