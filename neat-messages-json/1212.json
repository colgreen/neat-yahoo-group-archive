You can \nfind it here:\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/iex_client.tar.bz2\n\nNote:  If your client machine is a Linux 2.6 machine, you can opt to \ndownload pre-compiled\n(-march=i686 -O3), statically linked binaries.  In the config file, set \nMODE=bin.\n\nThe client runs perfectly under cygwin (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/), \nso windows users can contribute, too.  They just have to work from the \nsources.\n\nI&#39;ll be building all the fancy reports and graphs this weekend.  This new \nversion will have a lot more cool stuff I can show. :)  In the mean time, \nyou can see what (little) has been created (or check on my progress) here:\n\nhttp://www.hanlonsrazor.com:81/neat/iex/reports/\n\nThanks!\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
