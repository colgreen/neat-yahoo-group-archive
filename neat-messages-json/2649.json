As you might guess, I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been working on\n&gt; &gt; it. I have had moderate success. My best ANNs can produce 90% of the\n&gt; &gt; correct bits for\n&gt; &gt; a short path of only 5 steps. For a seven step path the best have been a\n&gt; &gt; little over\n&gt; &gt; 80%.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds like an interesting task and a useful area to explore.  It makes\n&gt; sense that as the &quot;path&quot; gets longer the ANN performs less and less well.\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that the % of correct bits is the fitness function you want to\n&gt; use, though.  If the virtual organism here takes a wrong turn very early on,\n&gt; they could end up very, very far from the orginal starting point.\n&gt; \n&gt; You may want to simply use distance from the orginal starting point as a\n&gt; fitness function.  Or, you might want to use the number of correct responses\n&gt; in inverse order, so that if the path was:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0\n&gt; \n&gt; and the correct output was:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1\n&gt; \n&gt; If the ANN output a 0 for it&#39;s first output, it would immediately get a\n&gt; fitness of 0.  Or you could have an &quot;undo&quot; feature, so the individual could\n&gt; back up.  I don&#39;t know which of these options you&#39;d want to play with, but\n&gt; if what you really want to be modelling is the navigational task you\n&gt; describe, and not merely pattern output, then fitness as a percentage of\n&gt; correct bits doesn&#39;t seem intuitive to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice domain, though, and I&#39;m interested to hear more results and progress.\n\nYou are cetainly correct that in the biological case, a one-bit error ruins the return\npath, since it no longer takes the animal home.  And also, as you point out, an error\nnear the start of the return trip has a worse result than one near the end. \n\nIf I was mainly interested in modeling the animal behaviour I would use a different\nfitness function.  But my main interest here is in studying a binary ANN used as a state\nmachine.  In principle a state machine should be able to memorize a sequence of bits,\nand then emit a corresponding series of bits.  So I think my ANN is capable of 100%\naccuracy for this task, if I can evolve the right set of weights.  Since my goal is 100%\naccuracy given any bit sequence as input, I think I&#39;m using the appropriate fitness\nfunction.\n\nI&#39;m not using NEAT, but rather the fully connected binary ANN that I used in the 4Play\nproject.  I would like to see someone apply NEAT to this problem.\n\nm\n\nMitchell Timin\n\nI&#39;m proud of http://ANNEvolve.sourceforge.net.
