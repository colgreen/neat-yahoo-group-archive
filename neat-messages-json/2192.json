I wonder, are the frequencies \nof alpha, beta waves, etc. multiples of each other or are they perhaps \nnon-harmonic? There&#39;s some info here:\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_waves\n\n\n&gt;Thus we have a mechanism for bringing multiple data sets into a single \n&gt;network without having to provide a multiplexer between the data-store and \n&gt;the processing network.  Instead, all we need is four &quot;trigger lines&quot;, each \n&gt;going high during a different phase of the cycle.  And an instruction to \n&gt;each data store telling it which of those lines means to send its \n&gt;contents.  The output from the stores can then all be mixed into a single \n&gt;channel, as only one store will ever be transmitting at a time.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nPerhaps we could devise a simple experiment based on this idea?\n\n&gt;A search can be performed by keeping the current best concept in one phase \n&gt;and iterating other concepts through the other phases...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYou mean compare one pattern (by which I mean a pattern in time *and* \nspace) with a load of other patterns? For say, recognition tasks.\n\nDragging the topic back to board games, perhaps we could apply the whole \nof a board&#39;s state in fewer inputs but over several phases. So a \ntic-tac-toe state could be applied into 3 nodes over 3 phases, or 1 node \nover 9 phases. I can&#39;t see this gaining us anything but I&#39;d be \ninterested to see just what did happen.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
