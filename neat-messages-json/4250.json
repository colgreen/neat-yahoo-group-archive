However=\r\n, usually when people attempt benchmarks they do not \ncompare their results=\r\n explicitly with others.\n\nAt the same time, as you know, I have changed my =\r\nphilosophy somewhat \nsince 2003 because I have realized that benchmark comp=\r\narisons can \nlead to misunderstanding unless they are controlled very caref=\r\nully.  \nOne of the problems is the &quot;target-based evolution problem,&quot; which =\r\n\nis one of the inspirations for novelty search.  In short, evolving \nto an =\r\narbitrary target can lead to misleading intuitions about what \nis possible =\r\nwith a particular encoding because of deception.  Often \na &quot;failed&quot; encodin=\r\ng very well could represent the target if only it \nhad been led to it throu=\r\ngh an alternative path through the search \nspace.\n\nAlso, another problem wi=\r\nth benchmarks is that they may obfuscate \nmore fundamental advantages of pa=\r\nrticular approaches because they do \nnot focus on general capabilities.  (A=\r\nlthough, of course, if you do \nenough of them, perhaps general capabilities=\r\n start to be clearer.)  \nBut that is why I advocated more focus on looking =\r\nfor biological-\nlike regularities in the patterns output by particular enco=\r\ndings, \nrather than looking for a single particular pattern, or even a \nsin=\r\ngle set of patterns.  Like I&#39;ve said before, evolution never \nproduced a wh=\r\neel but that hardly means DNA is a bad encoding.\n\nOf course benchmarks can =\r\nplay a role and I do think more comparisons \ncould be done, but we also hav=\r\ne to be cautious about their \nmisapplication.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;ddambro84@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Derek,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m n=\r\not really aware of much, if any benchmarking work that has \nbeen\n&gt; done in =\r\nthe field other than some of the papers mentioned in the \nother\n&gt; post.  An=\r\n outsider might think our ultimate goal is to create a \nFrench\n&gt; flag!  I t=\r\nhink it would be great to see such benchmarking of\n&gt; artificial embryogeny,=\r\n as things seem to be about the same as when \nKen\n&gt; wrote his paper: everyo=\r\nne is just trying stuff with their own \nsystem,\n&gt; without any regard to the=\r\n other systems out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken and I did try to do something like (alth=\r\nough not as indepth as \nhis\n&gt; paper suggests) with my 2007 HyperNEAT paper&#39;=\r\ns results.  I built a\n&gt; program that let me look at the Hypercube patterns =\r\nand we were \nable to\n&gt; learn a lot about HyperNEAT by watching how the patt=\r\nerns changed \nover\n&gt; evolution, and were able to isolate modules that contr=\r\nibuted to \nthings\n&gt; like symmetry.  We have a forthcoming journal publicati=\r\non about\n&gt; HyperNEAT in general that talks a bit about this.\n&gt; \n&gt; David\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seein=\r\ng Peter Krcah&#39;s stuff (http://ero.matfyz.cz/) at GECCO this \nyear\n&gt; &gt; got m=\r\ne re-interested in artificial embryogeny. I went back and \nreread\n&gt; &gt; Ken&#39;s=\r\n paper &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/=\r\npub-view.php?PubID=3D121), which is a \nvery nice\n&gt; &gt; paper. I was specifica=\r\nlly wondering about the suggestions at the \nend\n&gt; &gt; of the paper, regarding=\r\n benchmarks for AE systems, such as:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evolution of:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Pure=\r\n symmetry (e.g. bilateral symmetry)\n&gt; &gt; --Specific shapes (e.g. rings, star=\r\ns, and trees)\n&gt; &gt; --Specific connectivity patterns (e.g. for neural network=\r\ns)\n&gt; &gt; --Simple controllers (e.g. for double pole balancing)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ken g=\r\noes on to say:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Such benchmark comparisons will eventually make it=\r\n possible to\n&gt; &gt; predict the performance\n&gt; &gt; of AE systems based on their l=\r\nocation in the taxonomy. For \nexample, one\n&gt; &gt; benchmark might be to evolve=\r\n a five-pointed star. This benchmark \ncan\n&gt; &gt; be attempted\n&gt; &gt; with a syste=\r\nm in which all the dimensions of development are \nfixed\n&gt; &gt; except the cell=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fate dimension. That dimension can vary from using only \nprepatterning=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; to using every\n&gt; &gt; conceivable form of fate determination, from stocha=\r\nstic\n&gt; &gt; self-organization to signaling,\n&gt; &gt; migration, and proliferation. =\r\nThe results can be measured using\n&gt; &gt; several criteria: How\n&gt; &gt; fast does t=\r\nhe objective shape evolve? How often and how many \ngenes\n&gt; are reused by\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the solution genome? Is symmetry used, or is each point in the \nstar\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nspecified by a separate\n&gt; &gt; section of genetic code=97that is, is there eme=\r\nrgent modularity? \nFor\n&gt; &gt; every possible\n&gt; &gt; setting on the varying dimens=\r\nion (e.g., cell fate \ndetermination), data\n&gt; &gt; will be available\n&gt; &gt; for co=\r\nmparison.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This sounds like a great idea. I&#39;m wondering, though...=\r\nwhat kind \nof\n&gt; &gt; response has this generated? Have there been any follow u=\r\np \npapers on\n&gt; &gt; AE systems that have tried to apply such benchmarks in a \n=\r\nsystematic\n&gt; &gt; way?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have these types of benchmarks been systematic=\r\nally applied to \nthe 2D\n&gt; &gt; representations evolved using HyperNEAT?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I also noticed rereading Sims 1994 paper that he displays hand-\ncoded\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; examples of recognizable morphologies such as a primate hand, a\n&gt; &gt; human=\r\noid form, and a tree structure. But I&#39;m wondering if and/or \nhow\n&gt; &gt; easy s=\r\nuch structures arise using his encoding when starting from \na\n&gt; &gt; simple co=\r\nre structure and either using artificial selection or a\n&gt; &gt; fitness functio=\r\nn tailored to evoke similar structures.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Derek\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
