I just finished reading the competition details in the supplied\nPDF (http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/index.html).\n\nThis is a fascinating problem domain.  I am looking forward to seeing some &quot;animations&quot; of the\nresulting competitions.\n\nAnd it also seems like a great place to try out some GA kinds of solutions.  I am not sure how\nNEAT could be used here, though.  I think it might be a fun conversation to start.  Who has some\nideas about how one might use NEAT as part of the solution software set?  Any ideas?\n\n\nJim\n\n\n--- Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- Karl Lewin &lt;lewinke67@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; not sure if anyone is interested in this but\n&gt; &gt; depending\n&gt; &gt; on the task that gets published it might interest\n&gt; &gt; some.\n&gt; \n&gt; This looks like a very interesting and challenging\n&gt; contest.  It was tempting me until I finally clicked\n&gt; the DATES link.  You have to finish it over this\n&gt; weekend!  This to me seems like a 3 month project. \n&gt; Perhaps there are some people who have been working on\n&gt; very similar problems and hence are ready to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.
