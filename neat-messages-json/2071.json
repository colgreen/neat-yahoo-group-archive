It seems to us that all \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry I&#39;ve been a bit behind on following this thread so this answer \n&gt;may be obsolete by now, but it is not so much a question of what is \n&gt;necessary as much as just being consistent with past experiments \n&gt;(after all, that&#39;s what makes it a benchmark).   Certainly there are \n&gt;cases once in a while where a 10,000 timestep network can fail at \n&gt;100,000 timesteps.  Whether that matters, or whether all our lives \n&gt;would have been easier if they&#39;d originally just decided to call it \n&gt;a day at 10,000 is no longer really possible to debate unless you \n&gt;want to stop comparing with predecessors.  Personally, I would have \n&gt;preferred to stop at 10,000.  Then again, Gruau may have had good \n&gt;reason for the 100,000 test.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n From what I&#39;ve seen in my experiments, if a network achieves 100,000 \nsteps then it will balance a pole indefinitely in the simulator. Of \ncourse if the poles are moving in a none chaotic manner then you can \nassume they will balance forever. If however they are moving chaotically \nthen you cannot assume that some future state won&#39;t destabilise the \nsystem - good solutions on the anti-wiggle test though seem to keep the \npoles almost perfectly upright, which doesn&#39;t mean the system is \nnon-chaotic, but I would rate the chances of  a dramatic destabilisation \nof such an apparently stable system to be low.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
