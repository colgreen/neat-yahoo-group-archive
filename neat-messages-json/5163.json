If the task is sufficiently deceptive, random search will actua=\r\nlly outperform fitness directed search. It seems to me that the new algorit=\r\nhm must be compared against both fitness directed search and random search.=\r\n\nPreference for simple models can be incorporated into random search by giv=\r\ning higher probabilities to simpler models. A classic solution would be to =\r\nlet the probability decrease exponentially with the number of nodes in the =\r\ncompact description.\nAre there any theoretical or practical results regardi=\r\nng the comparison with a random search? Do you have any estimates or ideas =\r\non this?\nI am not saying that novelty search won&#39;t work, but I think this p=\r\noint must be cleared. I also want to try gain a better understanding of how=\r\n and why the search works.\n\n\n\n"}}
