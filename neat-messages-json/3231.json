It&#39;s lik=\r\ne saying\nthat someone who cut your head off &quot;respected&quot; your head by keepin=\r\ng\nits internal integrity intact. In fact, tile coding is peforming a\ngrievo=\r\nus violation against the existing geometry of the domain, and\ndoes not dese=\r\nrve to be credited with respecting geometry\nwhatsoever. I&#39;m hard pressed to=\r\n imagine how one could do worse\nbeyond cutting things up into even tinier a=\r\nnd tinier bits; but even\nthen, those bits still contain &quot;nearby elements in=\r\n the state\nspace.&quot; So that isn&#39;t saying much.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to argue whe=\r\nther or not\n&gt; tile-coding is better than HyperNEAT, it probably is better i=\r\nn a\nfew\n&gt; cases, but worse in more. Rather, I just wanted to point it out a=\r\ns\nan\n&gt; example of a line of research that built in some geometric\nassumptio=\r\nns.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m obviously not a big fan of tile coding :) I&#39;m not really\nconcern=\r\ned whether it might do better in some cases; the problem with\nit is that it=\r\n is a dead end for future progress because it is about\nruining our ability =\r\nto exploit geometric relationships.\n\nThink about this: If left is -1 and ri=\r\nght is 1, I can easily learn\nto treat right and left the same way by simply=\r\n running the left-\nright dimension through a Gaussian centered at 0. Anythi=\r\nng above\nthat Gaussian now sees left and right as the same, and therefore\nm=\r\nakes a geometric generalization.\n\nTile coding would make even something tha=\r\nt simple impossible,\nforcing you to learn left separately from right. Now a=\r\nny innovation\nyou make on processing the left side will be totally opaque t=\r\no the\nright because they are cut into different variables. That kind of\napp=\r\nroach obviously cannot scale up. If it&#39;s better on some problems\nit&#39;s becau=\r\nse those problems are misleading wrt to future progress in\nmachine learning=\r\n.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
