Possibly then,\n&gt; strategies that worked well with 5x5 would not work\n&gt; well with 19x19.  So what about 100x100 Go?  If you\n&gt; considered the domain of Go the class of all games\n&gt; with the same ruleset, but with scalable board sizes,\n&gt; the domain would technically be open-ended, would it\n&gt; not?\n\nYeah, you could certainly consider this an open-ended domain, but I don&#39;t\nthink you&#39;ll have any more capacity for unbounded complexification.\n100x100 Go is not any harder (well, relatively speaking) than 19x19 Go,\nits just the same strategy streched over a larger area. I mean, Go\nstrategy doesn&#39;t really change on larger boards. Eventually I think you&#39;ll\nhit a point where play doesn&#39;t get any better, and all new complexity is\njust going to processing the new inputs.\n\nThis is the kind of problem I want to address with modular NE. Some\ndomains are solvable by NE for small sizes, but they are scalable, which\nmakes traditional NE infeasible after a certain point. If we could analyze\nthe basic patterns that make up the solution, we could figure out how to\nreplicate them correctly so that the NE solution is scalable.\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\n\njoeraii@...\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
