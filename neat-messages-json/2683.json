I&#39;m thinking about external \nfitness criteria=\r\n which are computed on separate validation / test \ndata sets (separate from=\r\n weight / topology optimization) which one \nuses generally on training neur=\r\nal networks. To my knowledge separate \ndata sets are not used in NEAT.\n\nWha=\r\nt actually is the stopping criterion for the training process ? I \nwould ex=\r\npect something like decreasing fitness on a validation set in \norder to pre=\r\nvent overfitting.\n\nThanks, \nAchim\n\n\n\n\n"}}
