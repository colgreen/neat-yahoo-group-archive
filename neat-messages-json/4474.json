I spent the \nwhole day and night checking everything, but I haven&#39;t fo=\r\nund my \nmistake so far. But I made some interesting discoveries, which I ho=\r\npe \nhelp me find the culprit or at least point me in the right direction. \n=\r\nI tried different settings with the 1joint condition and everything \nworked=\r\n out fine (against my earlier expectations). \n1. I started with the easiest=\r\n task: 3 random start angles (0=B0-180=B0), \n1 goal angle (90=B0). Time ela=\r\npsed until perfect movement was observed: \n30 generations.\n2a. 3 random sta=\r\nrt angles (0=B0-180=B0), 3 differnt goal angles (45=B0, \n90=B0, 135=B0). 50=\r\n generations until perfect behavior.\n2b. Same as 2a, but with 12 random sta=\r\nrt angles. 70 generations.\n3. 3 random start angles (0=B0-180=B0), 3 random=\r\n goal angles (30=B0-150=B0). \n90 generations.\n\nAlthough more generations we=\r\nre needed with increasing task complexity \n(and I think the time needed is =\r\nappropriate, taking into account that \ngravity has to be masterd, or am I w=\r\nrong?), all of the above tasks \nwas solved with very good resulting behavio=\r\nur. Then I started to add \na second joint and suddenly everything was back =\r\nto normal (which in \nmy case means: bad). \n4. 1st joint: 3 random start and=\r\n 3 random goal angles (0=B0-180=B0). 2nd \njoint: 3 random start and 3 rando=\r\nm goal angles (0=B0-360=B0). Observed \nbehaviour: until generation 50 fast =\r\nimprovements, generation 50-100 \nminor improvements, generation 100-600 no =\r\nimprovements at all.\n\nJudging from the above mentioned data, I would sugges=\r\nt two \npossibilites:\nA. The 1st joint works well, meaning I made a mistake =\r\nconcerning the \n2nd joint (and all following) which makes it impossible for=\r\n NEAT to \nsolve the problem (e.g. not all of the necessary input is provide=\r\nd).\nB. There is a more general mistake I made, resulting in lower \nperforma=\r\nnce with increasing task complexity and concerning not only \nthe 2nd joint =\r\nbut all joints in general (e.g. an error in the \ncommunication between NEAT=\r\n and the simulator).\n\nPersonally, I would vote for A, so as long as nobody =\r\ndisagrees (for \nexample, because you think the 1st joint should learn much =\r\nfaster \nthese easy tasks), I will try some easier tasks with 2joints (like =\r\n\nthe ones with 1joint, e.g. with one joint having a non-random goal \nangle)=\r\n in order to narrow down the field.\n\nI can&#39;t thank you guys enough, it&#39;s ve=\r\nry good to have someone with \nfresh ideas listening to one&#39;s problems. I wa=\r\ns really desperated as I \nmade no progress at all over the last weeks, but =\r\nnow I&#39;m full of hope \nto get it right in the end.\nWith best regards,\nMatthi=\r\nas\n\n\n"}}
