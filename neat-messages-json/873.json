That&#39;s because no one tries to \nsolve XOR with a recurrent network- they always use feedforward \nsolutions.  It&#39;s kind of interesting that NEAT finds a recurrent \nsolution, but it ruins comparisons with other methods since they \ndon&#39;t have the ability to do that so it isn&#39;t really fair.  I \ndisabled the addition of recurrent connections for my XOR \nexperiments.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, cgreen@d... wrote:\n&gt; Quoting Karl Lewin &lt;lewinke67@y...&gt;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From the FAQ:\n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; How do I ensure that a network stabilizes before\n&gt; &gt; taking its output(s) for a classification problem?\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; Note that output may not always stabilize in some \n&gt; &gt; cases.\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What are peoples thoughts on handling this? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve tried both:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Iterate until output stabilizes or N iterations \n&gt; &gt; have been performed. (N=10 or 100) \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Same as 1 but if it doesn&#39;t stabilize by N \n&gt; &gt; iterations set output to the maximally wrong value.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the XOR problem if I use the first method the best\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; network tends to have this structure:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 0       1        2\n&gt; &gt; &#92;       |       /\n&gt; &gt;  &#92;      |      /\n&gt; &gt;   &#92;     |     /\n&gt; &gt;    &#92;    |    /\n&gt; &gt;     &#92;   |   /\n&gt; &gt;      &#92;  |  /\n&gt; &gt;       &#92; | /\n&gt; &gt;        &#92;|/\n&gt; &gt;         3--&#92;\n&gt; &gt;         |  |\n&gt; &gt;         &#92;--/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Karl,\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly I think this is the same structure I posted on the \nlist not long \n&gt; ago, but the output oscillated between high and low values and \nonly gave the \n&gt; correct answer after exactly two iterations of the network. Anyway \nback to the \n&gt; question - very simply, if the network does not stabilize within N \niterations \n&gt; then my XOR experiment assigned a fitness of zero. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
