In the \narticle at Toms hardware there was mention that some of the vehcles \nsuffered from very basic problems such as stalling on the startline. \nSurely an NN with inputs from a rev counter & throttle position could \neasily have solved that particular problem, not to mention some of the \nbigger problems such as overall vehicle control and navigation.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
