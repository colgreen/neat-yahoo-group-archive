Haven&#39;t finalized any universities as\nyet. \n&gt; \n&gt; You recommended UCSD, could you guys suggest more places where\nsimilar work is going on? \n&gt; I know, UT Austin is one :)\n&gt;\n\nJordan Pollack&#39;s group at Brandeis also does the kind of work you&#39;re\ninterested in : http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/\n\nFinding good places to study neuroevoltuion in the US is a real\nproblem.  Joseph Reisinger, who is in this group and also looking for\ngrad schools, may have some other suggestions.  But outside UT Austin\nthere aren&#39;t a lot of places with big neuroevolution research groups.\n \nThe UK has a few schools.  In the US, you should probably apply to\nschools that are ranked well in AI, but also maybe talk to professors\nafter getting in somewhere to make sure they are interested in\nneuroevolution.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
