You \n&gt; can use any activation method you want with a NEAT\n&gt; network.\n\nThat is true, and could be useful if the method in\nNEAT was slow for some application.  One could take\nthe topology and weights that were evolved, and then\nwrite code to implement it in a speedy manner.\n \n&gt; &gt; For example, is NEAT fast enough to use a\n&gt; NEAT-evolved\n&gt; &gt; network in a real time application?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The NN activations generally don&#39;t take up\n&gt; significant computation \n&gt; time.  We can run 50 networks at the same time in\n&gt; real-time easily \n&gt; on a single processor.  Obviously at some huge\n&gt; network size things \n&gt; will start slowing down, but then again, what else\n&gt; can you do if a \n&gt; huge network is necessary to solve the task?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I think most interesting domains assume\n&gt; their cost mostly \n&gt; from domain simulation and not network activation.\n\nIt&#39;s probably true that for most applications, the\napplication-specific code probably takes longer than\nprocessing the NEAT net, but we can&#39;t be sure that&#39;s\ntrue until someone measures the latter.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
