If  there are several\n&gt; species with the maximum species then I will just cull them as normal,\n&gt; so I only preserve the fittest species if is the only one. Yeh that\n&gt; should work I think. By culling the fittest species I think I was trying\n&gt; to achieve to much in the context of a single search, it&#39;s better to\n&gt; allow the user to decide when a search has stagnated and needs\n&gt; resetting. I suppose I could add in a new, &#39;re-start age&#39; parameter that\n&gt; detects when the entire search has stagnated for some [large] # of\n&gt; generations and resets the population.\n\nI think I understand a little better now how your algorithm is working\nand what&#39;s going on.  Thanks for the explanation.\n\nYour changes sound pretty sensible, too.\n\nI was just surprised at the extremely large difference in the\nprogression of fitness in the different complexifying/blended/phased\nruns.  From our experience so far, NEAT has proven to be fairly robust\nand consistent given changes in parameters and implementation\nspecifics.\n\nThat is, from day one of working with NEAT, we&#39;ve only ever seen\nupward-moving fitness graphs.  Some are flatter than others, but we&#39;ve\nnever seen the fitness spike and then plunge.  That seemed like an\nextremely odd dynamic for any kind of NEAT run.\n\nPart of your explanation of the dynamics centered on whether or not\nthe fitness evaluation was deterministic or not.  Per some of the\ndiscussions about adding randomness or noise to the evaluation, this\nseems like an important thing to do in almost any domain.  In pattern\nrecognition, if the fitness evaluation is deterministic, it seems to\nme that the networks are much more prone to overfitting to the\ntraining set and are going to be extremely brittle (this aside from\nthe fact that your crossover function is based on whether or not the\nnetworks have equal fitnesses).\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
