I&#39;m curious\n&gt; about how to \n&gt; get a confidence output from a system. I think any system should be\n&gt; decomposed, \n&gt; but how? There are many methods that do many things, some better \nthan\n&gt; others.\n&gt; I haven&#39;t read anything before on decision confidence, and I \ncouldn&#39;t\n&gt; follow \n&gt; the link Ken gave. This computer isn&#39;t so reliable ( corrupt \nversion of\n&gt; win98 ver1 ), \n&gt; so I&#39;ll have to wait till I get back up to campus to read what he\n&gt; posted. \n&gt; As a matter of fact, I&#39;m still learning about the vast number of\n&gt; different network flavors \n&gt; invented so far. Once the papers about how slow back propagation is\n&gt; started coming \n&gt; out, the variety of learning algorithms exploded. \n&gt; When I get a better handle on it, I think the NEAT algorithm would \nblend\n&gt; well with many \n&gt; of the structures I&#39;ve been seeing. The LSTM neuron is pretty \nnovel and\n&gt; has good learning \n&gt; characteristics. It could become a subset of the NEAT tool set. \nThere is\n&gt; nothing wrong \n&gt; with evolving networks that learn things as they go. The challenge \nis\n&gt; evaluation fitness. \n&gt; The solution space may well explode when you start adding \nvariables like\n&gt; that, but \n&gt; then that&#39;s the biggest strength of the genetic algorithm. I&#39;ve \nhad too\n&gt; much coffee, I could \n&gt; babble for hours... Sorry for the ramble. \n&gt; \n&gt; Chad \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Hi Chad, \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes I think I understand. I would tend to think of the technique \nyou \n&gt; describe as being a further level of task decomposition. I \ndescribed \n&gt; braking the goal task into layers, high to low. I think the \ntechnique \n&gt; you describe would fit in nicely by taking a sub-task at a \nspecific \n&gt; layer and braking it down further. Would you agree? \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
