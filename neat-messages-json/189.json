The advantage of\n&gt;state vector storage would be in speed.  Furthermore,\n&gt;for certain tasks there may be no way to modify the\n&gt;weights while solving the problem at hand.  (I might\n&gt;be wrong about that; I don&#39;t really understand how the\n&gt;weights would be modified during one trial of a card\n&gt;game.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell exactly, which is why I like to think of weight changes as medium \nto long term memory and skill acquistion and short term (state) memory \nas just providing data to already acquired skills.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
