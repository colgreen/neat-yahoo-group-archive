A good journal is a loooong\n&gt;process that can take more than a year or even  years before the\n&gt;paper ever sees print.  For conferences you need to check the\n&gt;deadlines for submission and prepare accordingly.  For journals\n&gt;there is no deadline.\n\nAnd, of course, if I submit it to IEEE CIG symposium then the chances \nare _I&#39;ll_ be asked to review it ;-)\n\n&gt;Conferences like GECCO are double-blind, which means reviewers don&#39;t\n&gt;get to see the author&#39;s name or affiliation, and the author doesn&#39;t\n&gt;get to know who the reviewer was.  So your lack of affiliation\n&gt;should have no impact.  However, you may want to give yourself some\n&gt;kind of &quot;made up&quot; affiliation, like a company or laboratory name,\n&gt;for when it goes into print.  Derek and Philip on this group both\n&gt;did that and have published late breaking papers at GECCO.  They\n&gt;have experience in trying to publish without academic affiliation,\n&gt;so they may be able to give you some perspective.\n\nRight.  I usually only associate the idea of submitting a paper to a \nconference with also attending the conference, which is not so easy \nfor me...  But I guess that&#39;s just because in the past I encountered \nthings the other way around.  First getting sent to a conference and \nthen rushing together a paper or poster.  I guess there&#39;s no actual \nrequirement to be attending if you submit a paper?  I mean for a \nposter there&#39;s kind-of no point unless you are there to stand by it \nand field questions, but...\n\n&gt;Note that the main barrier to independent publishing in research is\n&gt;not lack of affiliation.  In my opinion, it is style.  It took me\n&gt;years to learn the acceptable manner of speech, sectional divisions,\n&gt;order of exposition, etc., for this community.  And I had the\n&gt;benefit of a veteran (Risto) constantly correcting and rewording\n&gt;everything I wrote.  Without that, you may end up sounding like you\n&gt;are an outsider.\n\nRight.  What is &quot;this community&quot;?  i.e. how wide does the style \nspread.  I have written papers in the past, but they were for \nbiochemistry and you are quite right, when I read CS papers these \ndays the style always does subtly jar with me.  But are all CS papers \nthe same, or does the GA/NN/EC etc etc community have its own sub-style?\n\n&gt;And that&#39;s a subtle problem, because being able to write good prose\n&gt;is not the same as knowing the customs and conventions of a\n&gt;particular research community.  Researchers can tell when non-\n&gt;researchers submit papers because they break all the conventions\n&gt;unwittingly.\n\nBeing me, I would probably break some of them sarcastically :)\n\n&gt;So the conclusion is that you need to be really careful about\n&gt;following the conventions of your predecessors.  It is not\n&gt;impossible to do, but it is a point most people outside academic\n&gt;communities don&#39;t appreciate since they don&#39;t necessarily realize\n&gt;that there is such a strong set of conventions.\n\nThanks Ken, this is most encouraging.  The hint about conferences is \na good one and well taken, because I always used to hate the great \nlong delays that any communication with journals seemed to \nrequire.  GECCO is clearly a prime conference to choose.  And IEEE \nCIG I like because I know the organisers (although really I would \nexcuse myself from reviewing my own paper, obviously).  Are there any \nother conferences that leap to mind as obvious choices?\n\nThe other nice thing about conference papers is often they are \nrequired to be very short.  I do like terse, even if I can&#39;t always do it.\n\nWhat would a good made up affiliation look like?  Is doing that quite \nlegit?  I mean, err, well it seems a bit dodgy in some sense I can&#39;t \nput my finger on....\n\n((OK, so it&#39;s late at night and I&#39;m blithering now, I&#39;ll sign off))\n\nThanks,\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
