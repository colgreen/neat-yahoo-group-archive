It seems to me that the agents/robots wouldn&#39;t be able to\n&gt; perceive any difference between the two starting points.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m probably missing something simple, but the idea of halving the\n&gt; number of evaluations is attractive if there isn&#39;t much benefit to the\n&gt; second evaluation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Drew\n&gt;\n\n"}}
