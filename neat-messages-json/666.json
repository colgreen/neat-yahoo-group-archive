Instead I was \n&gt; thinking of periodically trimming back the\n&gt; population&#39;s complexity by \n&gt; only allowing these types of mutation (deletion) and\n&gt; running the search \n&gt; algorithm as normal, this should work because the\n&gt; search is elitist and \n&gt; therefore we will never loose the good networks we\n&gt; have evolved so far. \n&gt; I was initially intending to do this to trim back\n&gt; unecessary clutter in \n&gt; good networks prior to performing any visualization,\n&gt; but I think it may \n&gt; be useful as part of the search itself.\n\nPhilip and I are working on a late-breaking paper for\nthe GECCO conference on this very subject.\n\nPer your approach, I&#39;ve seen some use in the\nliterature of networks trained with backprop then\nbeing pruned with a GA, and there have been at least a\ncouple of neuroevolutionary techniques (including\nYao&#39;s EPNet) that use additive and subtractive\nmutations in the search.\n\nNot to jump the gun on conclusions yet (we&#39;re in the\nmiddle of running experiments), but it seems that\nincluding subtractive mutations in the search makes\nfor a slightly less efficient search, but\nsignificantly more efficient solutions.\n\nAs others have done, we&#39;ll post the paper once it&#39;s\ncomplete and on its way to GECCO, probably mid-May.\n\nDerek\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
