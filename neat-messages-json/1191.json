They spoke in very vague terms\nfor the first half hour, and when they finally put some data up on the\nslides, when someone asked what they were representing, they mumbled\nsomething about how they couldn&#39;t say what the graphs actually showed\nbecause it was proprietary.\n\nGECCO is apparently a fusion of different conferences, and it seemed\nto me that many more of the papers and workshops/tutorials were geared\nmore toward Genetic Programming than any other use of GAs.\n\nThere was an interesting presentation in my LBP session by a guy from\na company that had successfully used GP techniques to identify\nunexploded ordnance in military artillery ranges that were to be\nconverted to civilian use.  I spoke to another guy from somewhere\ncalled Aerospace Corp who said he was skeptical of ANNs and mostly\nlooking for GP-based approaches to analyzing aerial and satellite\nphotography.  It seems to me that ANN-based approaches to these sorts\nof fuzzy recognition problems would be more promising than GP\napproaches...so if anything I got a lot of ideas about potential\ncommercial connections, if anything.\n\nMaybe Ken or Joseph had different experiences, though.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
