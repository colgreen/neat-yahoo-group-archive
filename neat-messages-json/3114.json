Then add a new type of mutation\nthat can add new neuro=\r\nns with the identity activation function.\n\nBasically what I am proposing is=\r\n starting with the same initial NEAT\nconfiguration of all the inputs connec=\r\nted to the outputs via sigmoids.\nBut doubling up this configuration with an=\r\n identical net connected\nvia the identity activation function.\n\nThe whole p=\r\noint of this would be to create a hybrid network that is\ngood at capturing =\r\nthe linear aspects (A+B, cross product) of the data\nand composing it with t=\r\nhe non-linear aspects.\n\nBut now that I think about it. I guess a good start=\r\ning question would\nbe is a Neural Net using only the  Identity activation f=\r\nunction good\nat approximating linear functions?\n\nSomething like this might =\r\nbe good at approximating time series with a\nsimple linear trend. So you don=\r\n&#39;t have to detrend the data.\n\nThanks,\n\nShane\n\n\n"}}
