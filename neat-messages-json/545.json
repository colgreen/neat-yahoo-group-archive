I am still not able to see its value for\n&gt; scientific work.  It seems to me to be a part of\n&gt; business and web programming, where perhaps it is\n&gt; useful.  For scientific work I think it will mainly be\n&gt; a source of delay and failed projects.  Don&#39;t forget\n&gt; that learning about the various software systems you\n&gt; mentioned requires time.  \n\nOne of the main values to XML as I understood it was its ability to\nsend data to nice graphing packages, so we can look at nice networks.\n But I am a little unsure at this point about whether this will pan\nout since it seems there is now some question on how to get good\ngraphs with nodes in the right layers.  If you can&#39;t do it with XML,\nit seems to take a lot of its support away.  On the other hand, I get\nthe sense a solution will turn up sooner or later, so I wouldn&#39;t count\nit out.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
