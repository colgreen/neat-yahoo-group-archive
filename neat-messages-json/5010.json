NEAT is indeed a general met=\r\nhod for evolving weighted connected graphs.  However, it is also important =\r\nto note that if you are trying to evolve a particular type of graph (i.e. w=\r\nith certain restrictions), it makes applying NEAT to it more complicated.  =\r\nThe less restricted the structure, the easier it is to apply NEAT to it.  F=\r\nor example, it is easy to evolve recurrent networks with NEAT because it do=\r\nes not need to know if each connection is recurrent or not.  However, if yo=\r\nu wanted to restrict recurrence, you would have to keep track of informatio=\r\nn to allow you to detect whether a new link might be recurrent or not.  If =\r\nyou were to evolve GP program trees, the restrictions are even more severe,=\r\n so that is even more tricky to set up and guarantee coherence for all oper=\r\nations.  I am not sure exactly where HMMs lie on this continuum, but hopefu=\r\nlly not too restricted (since then NEAT will be easier to set up for them).=\r\n\n\nIn terms of where to start, I do think that my dissertation is a good ref=\r\nerence for NEAT in general.  It is true there are various bits that have be=\r\nen updated over time, like phased pruning, which could indeed be helpful.  =\r\nBut these amendments can be added later once the basic structure of the alg=\r\norithm is validated.  Another potentially useful enhancement is Feature Sel=\r\nective NEAT (FS-NEAT), which allows you to start without all the inputs con=\r\nnected.  Perhaps something like that could be useful for HMMs too.  Here is=\r\n a paper about FS-NEAT: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?whiteson:gecco05\n\nG=\r\nenerally I think the best approach is to start with the simplest possible v=\r\nersion of NEAT (i.e. with the essentials of histortical marking, speciation=\r\n, and complexification), validate that with XOR, and then continue from the=\r\nre to make it more fancy if desired.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m planning this seme=\r\nster to investigate the applicability of the NEAT\n&gt; algorithm to the evolut=\r\nion of Hidden Markov Models.  I&#39;m getting a PhD in\n&gt; Bioinformatics, and HM=\r\nMs have many applications to biological sequence\n&gt; analysis.  The HMMs used=\r\n are currently built by hand and can be quite\n&gt; complex, and though there h=\r\nas been some successful research into evolving\n&gt; them, none that I know of =\r\nhas attempted to take advantage of NEAT&#39;s bag o&#39;\n&gt; tricks.\n&gt; \n&gt; HMMs are ve=\r\nry similar structurally to neural networks, and my suspicion is\n&gt; that many=\r\n of the same pathologies that confound the evolution neural\n&gt; structures ap=\r\nply to HMMs.  If I&#39;m right, then NEAT seems like a very\n&gt; attractive soluti=\r\non.  I&#39;m hoping that I can use the NEAT algorithm almost in\n&gt; it&#39;s entirety=\r\n, since almost everything seems applicable to this domain (and\n&gt; I believe =\r\nKen has said that NEAT can be thought of as a general structure\n&gt; evolving =\r\nalgorithm, rather than being specific to ANNs).\n&gt; \n&gt; The first step is sort=\r\ning out exactly what the canonical version of NEAT is.\n&gt;  My plan is to use=\r\n Ken&#39;s dissertation as the primary reference.  Is this\n&gt; wise?  Or have the=\r\nre been advances in the intervening years that I ought to\n&gt; know about?  Fo=\r\nr instance, one nuance that a colleague of mine at UT\n&gt; mentioned is SharpN=\r\nEAT&#39;s periodic decomplexification phase.  He suspects\n&gt; this phase is quite=\r\n useful, even though it is not part of the original NEAT\n&gt; spec.  What do y=\r\nou guys think?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, if you were to set one of your students to the tas=\r\nk of writing their\n&gt; own NEAT from scratch, which resources would you point=\r\n him/her to?\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
