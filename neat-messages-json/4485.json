Pole Balancing (which I know is included \nwith C+ NEAT) would be a =\r\ngreat start for me, but shame on me, I don&#39;t \nknow C+, only Java and theref=\r\nore am using Ugo&#39;s JNEAT. That&#39;s when \nyou guys come into play. ;-)\nI hope =\r\nsome of you already tried single- or double pole balancing \nwith Java, so m=\r\ny question is the following: Would someone be so kind \nto give me the code =\r\n/ let me try out his pole balancing experiment?\n\nTo make this clear, I don&#39;=\r\nt want to steal your work or something, I \njust want to better get to know =\r\nNEAT and understand what I am doing \nwrong in my own experiments. \nYour hel=\r\np would be very much appreciated!\n\nThanks a lot!\nMatthias\n\n\n"}}
