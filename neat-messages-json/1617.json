I&#39;d like to add one other \nthing about parameter tweaking which is that sometimes you can look \nat the bigger picture of exploitation vs. exploration as a guide to \nhow to tweak the parameters.  For example, if you find your \npopulation converging prematurely, you may want to increase \nmutations powers or rates, or make selection less strict, i.e. be \nmore explorative.  On the other hand if you can&#39;t make any progress \nyou may want to be more exploitative.  Elitism is also a kind of \nexploitation.  Also, it&#39;s always good to check whether the number of \nspecies is generally stable and species have a healthy size.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bryan Adams&quot; &lt;bpadams@m...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m currently working on a modification to NEAT (using a genetic\n&gt; regulatory network to create a more flexible genome), and I had a\n&gt; question about parameter settings.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m starting by benchmarking the system with the XOR test, and I \nhave\n&gt; reproduced the original NEAT results (solutions in an average of \n3600\n&gt; evaluations over several hundred runs).  However, when I add some \nnew\n&gt; code, I&#39;m faced with the problem of not just setting my own new\n&gt; parameters, but potentially changing the standard NEAT parameters.\n&gt; \n&gt; My question, then, is this: how do you set the parameters that \ngovern\n&gt; the NEAT system?  I&#39;ve played with mutation rates (especially\n&gt; structural), speciation settings (including dynamic thresholding), \nand\n&gt; the other odds and ends (popsize, minimum size for elitism, \nfraction\n&gt; of parents to reproduce, weight caps), but I&#39;m not always sure what\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for when I make changes.  What, aside from a solution, \nare\n&gt; the variables to look for when evaluating the quality of a run?\n&gt; \n&gt; And I will provide bonus stars for anyone who has a non-ad-hoc\n&gt; approach to setting some of these variables.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I appreciate any thoughts or suggestions,\n&gt; \n&gt; --Bryan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
