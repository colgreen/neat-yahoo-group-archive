Is there anything you know that\n&gt; &gt;might be causing this?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Erm, no, I can&#39;t think what that might do that.  It&#39;s only the \n&gt; simplest=\r\n thing using some crude GDI graphics to display the number \nof \n&gt; jobs it h=\r\nas and a simple scrolling graph of best-fitness, \n&gt; average-fitness and ave=\r\nrage-size.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you sure you set up the working directory correctly?  I=\r\n think \n&gt; there would be no graphics if there were no jobs at all...  You \n=\r\ncan \n&gt; easily tell because it will have created the &quot;todo&quot;, &quot;current_SS&quot; \na=\r\nnd \n&gt; &quot;done&quot; directories in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a log file (master.log or mas=\r\nter_SS.log, depending \nwhether \n&gt; you took it before or after I updated it)=\r\n which may reveal \nsomething...\n&gt; \n&gt; Was it using CPU?  You can tell becaus=\r\ne if you have the task-\nmanager \n&gt; &quot;performance&quot; tab open when the screensa=\r\nver starts, you can look \nat \n&gt; the history graph when the screensaver clos=\r\nes...\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, what OS are you on?\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this mean you a=\r\nre considering giving it some serious CPU?  Or \n&gt; were you just looking.  I=\r\nf you are going to give it some CPU then \n&gt; I&#39;ll send you some job files ;-=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; I was considering better graphics, e.g. a continuous shown TTT \ngame=\r\n \n&gt; between the current champion and some sort of \n&gt; semi-random/semi-perfe=\r\nct player, but since I only got the one \n&gt; volunteer and he isn&#39;t using the=\r\n graphical version...\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In 15 minutes everybody wil=\r\nl be in the future.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
