I&#39;m not even sure \nthat the activation method should be considered NEAT-specific.  You \ncan use any activation method you want with a NEAT network.\n\n&gt; For example, is NEAT fast enough to use a NEAT-evolved\n&gt; network in a real time application?\n&gt; \n\nThe NN activations generally don&#39;t take up significant computation \ntime.  We can run 50 networks at the same time in real-time easily \non a single processor.  Obviously at some huge network size things \nwill start slowing down, but then again, what else can you do if a \nhuge network is necessary to solve the task?\n\nAnyway, I think most interesting domains assume their cost mostly \nfrom domain simulation and not network activation.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
