The user\ncould be asked to observe each face for a set amount of time (e.g., 30\nseconds), and choose the one that looked &quot;more natural&quot;.  Success\nwould be contingent upon lots of traffic, but it would be an\ninteresting fitness function.\n\nI&#39;m reminded of Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, I think. \nHe uses himself as the fitness function for evolving digital images of\ncreatures, like wasps.  The computer just initially created random\nbitmap pictures, like 100x100.  He would pick the ones that &quot;looked\nmore like a wasp&quot;, and they would then survive and mutate.  Eventually\nhe got bitmaps that looked like a whole lot like wasps.  (I could be\nbutchering the explanation...it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read\nthat bit...)\n\nBut the concept of using human judgment as a fitness function is still\ninteresting and valid, I would think.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
