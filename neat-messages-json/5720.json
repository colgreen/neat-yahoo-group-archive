What h=\r\nas slightly thrown me is that most of the whitepapers I have read indicate =\r\nthe innovation numbers are only assigned to and incremented by new links.  =\r\n\n\nWorking an example through, I start with a simple 2 input, 1 bias, 1 outp=\r\nut genome/network that contains 3 links from each sensor to output. I would=\r\n expect to have an innovation database holding 7 entries, 0 - 3 relating to=\r\n new nodes, and 4 - 6 relating to the new links.  \n\nIf a mutation occurs wh=\r\nich adds a new node (likely first as there is no room for another link) my =\r\ninnovation database will hold an eighth entry for the new node (with a node=\r\n ID of 7) and 2 new link innovations linking say node 1-&gt;7 and 7-&gt;3.  If an=\r\nother genome tried to make the mutation on the same link, the innovation da=\r\ntabase would be consulted and the new node (7) would be returned along with=\r\n the new links.  \n\nThis implementation makes sense however if anyone can sp=\r\not a mistake or explain the mismatch with the whitepapers please let me kno=\r\nw.\n\nMy second question on the network side is probably elementary to neural=\r\n net programming.  In the example given above I have ended up with a net lo=\r\noking like:\n\n       (3) \n      / | &#92;\n     / (7) &#92;\n    /   |   &#92;\n   (0) (1) =\r\n (2)\n\nIf I run through the nodes in node ID / innovation number I&#39;ll have t=\r\no make a number of passes before I can get the correct value of the output.=\r\n  At this stage this is only 2 but could get worse.  The following ideas oc=\r\ncur:\n\n- Renumber the nodes when generating the genotype (however this in it=\r\nself requires a number of loops and other headaches)\n- Record a y position,=\r\n as I believe Mat Buckland (and maybe others) do to use as an helper\n- Trav=\r\nerse the network a number of times when evaluating (the simplest method but=\r\n feels expensive). \n\nI can see the latter is the only way around recursive =\r\nlinks, although I&#39;ve not yet seen a need to implement these yet.\n\nAny help =\r\nvery much appreciated!\n\nBen\n\n\n"}}
