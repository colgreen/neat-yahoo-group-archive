You are saying\nthat you m=\r\night capture the shape of a protein binding region (or some\nother important=\r\n region) with a CPPN and then use that CPPN-encoded\nmodel to test other che=\r\nmical compounds?  \n\nBut if you already have a model of the intended shape, =\r\nwhat additional\ncapability would the CPPN provide other than encoding the 3=\r\nD model\nthat you already have?  Or do you mean you might try creating new\ns=\r\nhapes with the CPPN that you haven&#39;t thought of and see how they\nreact with=\r\n known compounds?  There are probably other ways it could go\nas well, but I=\r\n&#39;m curious from the point of view of computational\nchemistry where the most=\r\n exciting opportunity would be.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtw=\r\nist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I may be over-interpreting the CPPN pro=\r\ncess, but it stimulated a few\n&gt; ideas.  I work in the field of Computationa=\r\nl Chemistry and my in my\n&gt; day to day operations I deal with drug-like chem=\r\nical compounds.  The\n&gt; 3D shape of a chemical is a principle determining fa=\r\nctor of its\n&gt; activity.  On top of 3D shape, you have different functional =\r\ngroups\n&gt; that impart different properties.  For example, let&#39;s say the shap=\r\ne is\n&gt; just right to bind to a particular enzyme (and prevent it from runni=\r\nng\n&gt; amok) but you need an oxygen atom at a particular location, or a\n&gt; nit=\r\nrogen, or any atom with a hydrogen attached, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are two ways t=\r\no get to this type of information.  First is\n&gt; having a large collection of=\r\n chemicals with a known endpoint.  For\n&gt; this I usually apply the standard =\r\npattern recognition tools.  Another\n&gt; more difficult approach is when you d=\r\non&#39;t have much data for\n&gt; chemicals, but you know the 3D structure of the e=\r\nnzyme and where you\n&gt; want your chemical to bind.  I&#39;m wondering if there i=\r\ns an application\n&gt; for CPPNs here.  Can the CPPN capture the shape of the s=\r\nite along with\n&gt; the essential properties based on the protein itself and t=\r\nhen be used\n&gt; to assess different chemical compounds that have not yet been=\r\n tested -\n&gt; try to predict their activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts??\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kirk=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kirk, what is your idea for applying CPPNs to pattern recognitio=\r\nn?  I\n&gt; &gt; am not sure I followed exactly how the CPPN would be connected to=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; neural network?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Peter mentioned, we have used the idea=\r\n of CPPNs to represent\n&gt; &gt; connectivity patterns rather than the spatial pa=\r\ntterns you saw in the\n&gt; &gt; CPPN paper.  These connectivity patterns can then=\r\n be interpreted of\n&gt; &gt; neural network connectivity patterns, which means yo=\r\nu can evolve\n&gt; &gt; neural networks with regularities in their connectivities.=\r\n  There are\n&gt; &gt; currently four papers on this approach to evolving ANNs wit=\r\nh CPPNs,\n&gt; &gt; which is called HyperNEAT.  Those papers are available from my=\r\n\nhomepage\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or from EPlex =\r\npublications:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe particular papers are:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploit=\r\ning Neural Network Sensor and \n&gt; &gt; Output Geometry\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Generating Lar=\r\nge-Scale Neural Networks Through Discovering Geometric\n&gt; &gt; Regularities \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -A Case Study on the Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machin=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; Learning\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; A longer journal paper on HyperNEAT is also forthcoming in Artificial\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Life journal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, you can also interactively evolve you=\r\nr own CPPNs images\n&gt; &gt; online at http://picbreeder.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Because spa=\r\ntial patterns and connectivity patterns can represent just\n&gt; &gt; about anythi=\r\nng, there are other potential applications of CPPNs beyond\n&gt; &gt; representing=\r\n ANNs, but currently there is no publication of such an\n&gt; &gt; application tha=\r\nt I know of.  But it would be interesting to see more\n&gt; &gt; work in that dire=\r\nction.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_cher=\r\nvenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT uses CPPNs to =\r\nbuild the neural network phenotypes (and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolves CPPNs).
