We can speculate on the right approach in this case \n(and I=\r\n have my hunches) but we won&#39;t know until we do some experiments \nand try i=\r\ndeas out.\n\nTo give some of my thoughts, perhaps the most obvious thing is s=\r\nimilar \nto what you suggest:  Have two separate input sets, one for the &quot;ty=\r\npe A \ninfo&quot; and one for &quot;type B info.&quot;  \n\nThe way this would look is e.g. i=\r\nf A was 2D and B was 2D then the CPPN \nwould have 4 inputs, 2 represent A s=\r\nource nodes and 2 representing B \nsoource nodes.\n\nThen, I would still have =\r\nonly one set of outputs.  I am still a little \nunclear on why you say the o=\r\nutputs are from the second substrate?  In \nmy understanding, this is still =\r\nall one substrate, it&#39;s just that it \ncollects inputs from two different so=\r\nurces.  But it can still exist \nwith only one set of outputs.  So if the ou=\r\ntputs are 2D, the CPPN would \nhave 2 more inputs representing the output ar=\r\nea for a total of 6 inputs \n(and one output representing the weight of a co=\r\nnnection in the \nsubstrate).\n\nIf there was a hidden layer you could have it=\r\n exist in either the same \ngeometry as A, the same geometry as B, or the sa=\r\nme geometry as the \noutputs.  (For example by introducing a z dimension to =\r\nany of these)  \nOr you could have each kind of hidden layer all at once.\n\nO=\r\nf course, as you note, there are a lot of ways to do something like \nthis. =\r\n I think it will be a great issue to explore, but it may require \nstarting =\r\nwith a very simple domain that isolates the issue (i.e. \northogonal input t=\r\nypes) so we can concentrate on that rather than on a \nspecific domain with =\r\nits own complications.\n\nOne other issue to note is that even if two sets of=\r\n inputs are in \neffect unrelated, it may not necessarily hurt antyhing to p=\r\nut them in \nthe same geometry.  For example, they could be two separate pla=\r\nnes in \nthe same cube.  On the face of it, it seems like that could cause \n=\r\nproblems, but we don&#39;t yet know whether the situation is that difficult \nto=\r\n deal with in practice.  There could also be hidden relationships \nthat are=\r\n not obvious but still exploitable in a surprising way.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Johnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.johnson@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hype=\r\nrNEAT folks,\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s the recommended strategy for handling inputs that =\r\nrepresent \nconcepts\n&gt; that are not geometrically related? For instance, con=\r\nsider something \nlike a\n&gt; poker game where we want to input both players&#39; a=\r\nctions and the cards \nwe\n&gt; see. We might be able to come up with geometric =\r\nencodings for either \nof\n&gt; these individually, but there&#39;s no obvious spaci=\r\nal relationship \nbetween\n&gt; cards and actions.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
