It depends on the \ntop=\r\nology and the algorithm used for activation.  In fact, a lot of \nold resear=\r\nch into topology-and-weight-evolving ANNs used to cite \nactivation times as=\r\n the *reason* for evolving topologies.\n\n2) &quot;Fast activation&quot; is actually a =\r\npretty irrelevant factor in a lot \nof modern control tasks.  In a complex s=\r\nimulated world, for example, \nthe CPU time spent activating the network is =\r\ntrivial compared to the \ntime spent in simulation and sensor calculations. =\r\n This is true in \nNERO, for example.  Even if the network activations in NE=\r\nRO were \nimprove by a multiple of 10 (i.e. 10x better) it would have a \nneg=\r\nligible effect on overall system performance.  The point is, the \nbelief th=\r\nat the time it takes to activate the network is a primary \nconcern is somew=\r\nhat antiquated. \n\n3) This is the most important point: NEAT is not just evo=\r\nlving \ntopologies in order to find &quot;the perfect topology.&quot;  NEAT is using \n=\r\nthe fact that it is evolving topologies to make *evolution* fast.  \nIt does=\r\n that by minimizing the size of the networks being searched \nso that evolut=\r\nion is searching in a low-dimensional space, which \nleads to faster evoluti=\r\non.  Note that the *real* cost in \nneuroevolution is in the number of netwo=\r\nrks that need to be \nevaluated in order to find a solution.  That is, the c=\r\nost of needing \nto evaluate many generations of additional networks dwarfs =\r\nthe cost \nof a slightly slower activation function.  One reason for that is=\r\n \nthat the cost of an evaluation includes a lot more than just network \nact=\r\nivation in many applications (as explained in #2).  Therefore, \nthe point t=\r\no remember is that NEAT is using topology as a way to \nincrease the power o=\r\nf evolutionary search.  That is a powerful and \nimportant consideration ove=\r\nr and above how fast network activation \nis.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;myhabalixyp&quot; &lt;myhabalixyp@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As we know, NEAT gets a ab=\r\nnormity topology structure of a ANN for \na \n&gt; special function not similar =\r\nwith the traditional BP networks. \nSince \n&gt; the traditional BP networks are=\r\n constructed with clear layers. Now \nI&#39;m \n&gt; puzzled that it seems more comp=\r\nlex for a abnormity topology \nstructure \n&gt; network to workout the output of=\r\n a input although it has less \nnodes and \n&gt; connections.It takes more memor=\r\ny and longer time. Although the \nnetworks \n&gt; with layers have more &quot;complex=\r\n&quot; topology, them have regular \nalgorithm \n&gt; and can workout a output more q=\r\nuickly with less memory. What \nbenefit do \n&gt; the abnormity topology structu=\r\nre networks bring to us? Only \nbecaues \n&gt; they are &quot;simpler&quot; only when we s=\r\nee them with our eyes?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
