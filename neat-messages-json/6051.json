I suppose=\r\n that this should be the case. However, it could be that the objective sear=\r\nch favors occasionally deceptive stepping stones (with regard to symmetrica=\r\nl objects).\n\nOn the other hand, we have to admit that this is just a proper=\r\nty that would be nice to see in the evolutionary search.

So they are easily able to make spheres in the cen=\r\nter of the bounding box (by just using that input and ignoring x, y, and z)=\r\n. We often saw spherical &quot;rollers&quot; that dropped and expanded part of their =\r\nsphere to push them away from the origin.

It raises the question of how bilateral symmetr=\r\ny arose in biological organisms.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have no link to literature or a=\r\nny kind of evidence, but with regard to this paper I was wondering what kin=\r\nd of creatures would emerge if you would start with an organism that has sp=\r\nherical symmetry (as far as you can represent spherical symmetry with voxel=\r\ns ;)) encoded through a CPPN. This ancestor organism would be something lik=\r\ne a unicellular organism in nature. Starting with a CPPN of such an organis=\r\nm would mean that radial and bilateral symmetry is in actual fact a departu=\r\nre from spherical symmetry. And I suspect that from this starting position =\r\nbilateral symmetry should be easier to reach (and it is maybe biologically =\r\nmore plausible!?).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; @Jeff: can you try that for us? :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom this perspective, complexification (or diversification) would mean break=\r\ning the symmetry rather than approaching it, which seems to me more natural=\r\n. But as I said, I am not familiar with the literature in this area.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best,\n&gt; &gt; Martin\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
