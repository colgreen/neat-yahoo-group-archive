Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Networks \n(CTRNNs).  Tyler=\r\n Street wrote a version of leaky-NEAT that implements \nthis type of neural =\r\nnetwork, and I believe Peter&#39;s current HyperNEAT \ncode also implements leak=\r\ny integrators in the neural substrate.  So \nthis type of thing has been com=\r\nbined with NEAT already to some extent.\n\nOf course, there are possibly othe=\r\nr ways to implement these concepts \naside from CTRNNs, and you may have an =\r\nalternative idea in mind, so \nit doesn&#39;t mean that your idea has already be=\r\nen implemented- just \nthat related ideas are out there. \n\nI&#39;m also not sure=\r\n what kind of neuron is in bug brain (thanks for the \nlink), so that may be=\r\n another alternative.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Greg &lt;placeboza@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for the welcome ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; There seems to be a number of =\r\npossible directions to further NEAT, \nthings\n&gt; that I can&#39;t find mention of=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example - has temporal delay and signal decay been experimented =\r\n\nwith\n&gt; NEAT ? They are a little challenging to implement in this setting, =\r\n\nbut not\n&gt; impossible.\n&gt; I&#39;m particularly thinking of the neural nets in th=\r\ne classic \ngame &#39;bugbrain&#39;\n&gt; (http://www.biologic.com.au/bugbrain/) whose b=\r\nrains are fairly \nunlimited,\n&gt; just difficult to design.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m quite the=\r\n amateur, so it&#39;s entirely possible I missed some news \non it\n&gt; \n&gt; Greg\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; On 7/4/07, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Thanks Greg=\r\n, I&#39;m glad you found it useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;Greg&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;placeboza@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n just read about Kenneth Stanley&#39;s NERO and rtNEAT, which is \nboth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\nfuriating and exciting at the same time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying to establish an=\r\n efficient method of crossing over a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recurrent NN, when I found infor=\r\nmation on NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So on the one hand, I&#39;m overjoyed to find the answers=\r\n, I was\n&gt; &gt; hoping to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figure it out for myself :/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great w=\r\nork, Kenneth, particularly the matching of chromosomes \nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crossover=\r\n (historical numbers, etc) and the speciation ;)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m reluctant =\r\nto give details of the game I&#39;m planning, but it\n&gt; &gt; will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truly un=\r\nique in both AI and style.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But right now, I&#39;m going to play NER=\r\nO :D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; `Don&#39;t make me come down there` -=\r\n God\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
