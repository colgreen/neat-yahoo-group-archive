I wond=\r\ner what \nsort of performance impact these changes might have.\n\nI wanted to =\r\nclarify your last remark about novelty search. The \nalgorithm you suggest d=\r\noes have certain surface similarities to \nnovelty search. \n\nThe idea of avo=\r\niding previously explored areas of search space is not \nnew, and is known a=\r\ns tabu search. The combination of this with \nspeciation may allow for more =\r\nefficient search by avoiding previously \nexplored areas of search space whi=\r\nle promoting genotypic diversity. As \nI understand it, this is what you wer=\r\ne suggesting. Feel free to \ncorrect me if I have misrepresented your idea.\n=\r\n\nNovelty search also uses a tabu-search like approach to bias search, \nalth=\r\nough it operates in behavior space (phenotype, behavior within a \ndomain) a=\r\ns opposed to search space (genotype). This in itself is not \noriginal, as t=\r\nhere exists previous work that used behavior-based \nspeciation with NEAT.\n\n=\r\nThe main contribution of novelty search is to demonstrate that in \ndeceptiv=\r\ne domains searching only for novel behaviors (i.e. completely \nignoring any=\r\n measure of fitness) can be more effective than a method \nthat uses a measu=\r\nre of fitness to bias search. This is a surprising \nresult because nearly a=\r\nll practical search methods rely on measuring \nprogress towards a goal. Whi=\r\nle in deceptive domains fitness may be led \ninto cul-de-sacs in search spac=\r\ne (local optima), novelty search cannot \nbe deceived in the same way since =\r\nit is not looking for anything other \nthan different ways to behave.\n\nI do =\r\nagree that the archive in novelty search may be similar in \nphilosophy to y=\r\nour idea of a FIFO list of dead species that guide \nsearch away from explor=\r\ned areas of search space. That is, both methods \nkeep a historical record o=\r\nf previous individuals and use that record \nto encourage search to progress=\r\n in alternate directions.  However, I \nwould say that the archive is not th=\r\ne defining feature of novelty \nsearch. \n\nAnyways, I think your ideas for fu=\r\nrther exploration into speciation \nare promising, and would be interested i=\r\nn seeing their effect on hard \nproblems. I am looking forward to seeing ver=\r\nsion 2 of sharpneat.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;col=\r\nin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Here are some thoughts on speciation that probabl=\r\ny don&#39;t warrant a\n&gt; deep discussion but I post them for the record.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cu=\r\nrrently sharpneat takes a casual approach to speciation and I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering=\r\n if there are improvements to be had. This ties in with my\n&gt; recent post ab=\r\nout genome compatibilty metrics and \neuclidean/manhattan\n&gt; distance.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn sharpneat v2 I&#39;m trying to make the code base more abstract and\n&gt; re-usab=\r\nle, e.g. I&#39;m separating the NeatGenome and EvolutionAlgorithm\n&gt; classes fro=\r\nm being dependent on each other and also using generics \nso\n&gt; that we can p=\r\nlug in new genomes or algorithms with minimum effort.\n&gt; Thus my previous di=\r\nscussion resulted in my creating an\n&gt; ICompatibilityMetric&lt;TGenome&gt; interfa=\r\nce which can be plugged in to \nthe\n&gt; NeatEvolutionAlgorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking a=\r\nt speciation again I see that at the outset I simply assign\n&gt; genomes to sp=\r\necies if they are within some distance and if not then \nI\n&gt; place the new g=\r\nenome in its own species. Independent of this I also\n&gt; adjust the compatibi=\r\nlity threshold once per generation in an attempt\n&gt; to keep the species coun=\r\nt between some limits (which has its own\n&gt; problems and is another email in=\r\n the making). A possible problem \nwith\n&gt; this approach is that the first at=\r\ntempt at speciation will probably\n&gt; just assign the first N genomes in the =\r\npopulation as being the first\n&gt; genome in each species - these genomes then=\r\n become [temporary]\n&gt; exemplars for the species, that is, the remaining gen=\r\nomes are \ncompared\n&gt; against them and if they are close enough to an exempl=\r\nar they are\n&gt; assigned to that species.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an alternative approach I w=\r\nas thinking of taking the discussion\n&gt; about compatibility (or distance) me=\r\ntrics a step further and \nactually\n&gt; explicitly representing where genomes =\r\nare in the encoding space with\n&gt; something like an IEncodingSpace interface=\r\n, the idea being that I \ntake\n&gt; the total number of unique connection IDs i=\r\nn the whole population as\n&gt; being the number of spacial dimensions, I then =\r\ndefine the location \nof\n&gt; each genome in each dimension as being the connec=\r\ntion weight for \nthat\n&gt; ID (using 0 if a genome doesn&#39;t have a connection f=\r\nor agiven ID). \nFrom\n&gt; here I can find the range/limits of locations (weigh=\r\nts) in each\n&gt; dimension, which effectively defines an enclosing hypercube t=\r\nhat the\n&gt; current population is inside. I can now divide up the hypercube i=\r\nnto\n&gt; equally sized sub-cubes in order to find clusters of genomes that \nar=\r\ne\n&gt; close together and use this as the basis of my initial set of \nspecies.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to all that I suspect it makes sense to keep the \nexempla=\r\nr\n&gt; for each species consistent throughout the life of the species - so \na\n=\r\n&gt; genome (representing a point in space) we keep to one side, that may\n&gt; ha=\r\nve been removed from the population long ago. This keeps each\n&gt; species &#39;an=\r\nchored&#39; in space and prevents it from drifting. We then\n&gt; have the choice o=\r\nf keeping a FIFO buffer of dead species as an\n&gt; indicator of parts of the s=\r\nearch space that have recently been\n&gt; searched - avoiding these spaces when=\r\n creating new genomes. This is \nan\n&gt; idea I raised a few years ago and whic=\r\nh I think is known as novelty\n&gt; search.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
