The videos of quadruped and hexapod ga=\r\nits I\n&gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for la=\r\nst\n&gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; \n&gt;      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/key=\r\nword?modularne\n\nI read your paper when you posted it last year. I think it =\r\nis very\ninteresting work. In particular, I think it is cool that you can pr=\r\noduce all\nof these different types of gaits. I do not get that kind of vari=\r\nety with\nHyperNEAT, but I think that is because I am only using one fitness=\r\n function\n(speed) and the two gaits I get reliably may simply be faster tha=\r\nn the other\ntypes of gaits. Why do you think you do not see a collapse down=\r\n to a single\nfastest gait type in your work? Is it because you bias them so=\r\n strongly to\none type of gait (in each setup) that they cannot override tha=\r\nt bias and\nchoose a faster gait? If so, that is a cool and interesting resu=\r\nlts, so I am\nmerely asking out of curiosity and not as a criticism. It is g=\r\nood to be able\nto get these systems to produce the types of gait we want in=\r\n addition to\nsimply producing fast gaits.\n\nI wonder if I selected for certa=\r\nin slower speeds, or if I selected for\nenergy efficiency, if I would get di=\r\nfferent gaits that are more commonly\nseen in nature. It would be a cool exp=\r\neriment to try.\n\nOut of curiosity, how would you label these two gaits?\n\nI =\r\nthink of this as pronk:\n\nhttp://devolab.msu.edu/sites/devolab.msu.edu/files=\r\n/HyperNEAT_medianFitness_1\n.mpeg\n\nand this as gallop:\n\nhttp://devolab.msu.e=\r\ndu/sites/devolab.msu.edu/files/HyperNEAT_bestIndividual_\n1.mpeg\n\nI think it=\r\n looks like a gallop because to me it looks like this:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia=\r\n.org/wiki/File:Muybridge_race_horse_animated.gif\n\n&gt; With only minor adjustm=\r\nents to your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; substrate configuration to repre=\r\nsent non-linear oscillators.  In fact,\n&gt; you would get a configuration simi=\r\nlar to my modular controllers by\n&gt; restricting the network inputs to just t=\r\nhe joint angles and producing\n&gt; angular velocities instead of angles as out=\r\nputs.\n\nThose changes alone would make them non-linear oscillators? But the =\r\nonly\nchange you mention is reducing the number of inputs. How would taking =\r\nout\nsome of the inputs (the touch sensor, the pitch, roll, yaw and sine) ch=\r\nange\nmy system to possess non-linear oscillators? Or do you mean that there=\r\n are\nother &#39;minor adjustments&#39; that need to be made? If so, what would they=\r\n be?\n\nHow would you describe my system? Do I have linear-oscillators? Or\nli=\r\nnear-non-oscillators? Please forgive me if these are na=EFve questions, but=\r\n\nI am very interested in learning the proper terminology for this field.\n\n&gt;=\r\n HyperNEAT would then\n&gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by h=\r\nand.  I think that\n&gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if succ=\r\nessful would\n&gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.\n\nI think I am =\r\nmissing something. Reducing the number of inputs would not\nsuddenly obviate=\r\n the need for the sine wave.\n\nNevertheless, I do think it would be an inter=\r\nesting experiment to see\nwhether HyperNEAT can produce the gaits you obtain=\r\ned, but I think whether\nthat occurs is related to the fitness function issu=\r\ne I raised above.\n\n&gt; BTW, did you find that\n&gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch,=\r\n yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary to\n&gt; evolve good gaits in your experi=\r\nments?\n\nFor the setup in the paper, such information increased performance =\r\n(although\nI wouldn&#39;t call the extra information necessary, as the experimen=\r\nts without\nsuch information still evolved coordinated gaits, just slower on=\r\nes).\n\nI did experiments with and without PRY (pitch, roll and yaw) and the\n=\r\nperformance was better with PRY inputs. I also ran experiments with and\nwit=\r\nhout the touch information and found that the touch information helped.\nOdd=\r\nly, and to my disappointment, I found that these results depended on\nother =\r\naspects of the system. For example, when I used a different period for\nthe =\r\nsine wave, and the gaits were thus different (e.g. much faster and more\nfra=\r\nntic), it was no longer the case that the PRY and touch information\nhelped.=\r\n As such, the system does seem to be somewhat chaotic and therefore\ngeneral=\r\n statements such as &quot;PRY inputs help&quot; are unjustified.  I don&#39;t fully\nunder=\r\nstand why that is the case, although I have some ideas.\n\n\nThanks for your q=\r\nuestions and comments.\nJeff\n\n\n\n"}}
