I do have a couple thoughts on the target-based\nexperiment:\n\nF=\r\nirst, the evolved results from the target-based runs all look really\nintere=\r\nsting.  They do look like they were carved with a lathe, which is\nkind of s=\r\nurprising.  Maybe you should seek funding from a\nbanister-design company!\n\n=\r\nIn any case, regarding the connection to my paper with Brian, we\nobserved b=\r\nasically two phenomena:  One is that if the target is\nsufficiently complex,=\r\n it simply cannot be reached.  However, when the\ntargets were simple enough=\r\n, in fact they could be reproduced reliably. \nYet the problem when the targ=\r\nets actually were reproduced well was that\ntheir CPPNs were two or three ti=\r\nmes as large as the CPPN that generated\nthe original target.  So our messag=\r\ne was not simply that you can&#39;t reach\ntargets, but that even when you do, y=\r\nou pay a price with inelegant\nrepresentation complexity.  Your case appears=\r\n somewhere in the middle:\nthe attempts do not look bad, although they are n=\r\not perfect\nreproductions either.\n\nI am guessing that the target you chose i=\r\ns thus sort of on the\nborderline of complexity that is almost reproducible,=\r\n like the &quot;Eye&quot;\ntarget in our paper.  What would be interesting would be to=\r\n see the CPPN\nstructures of the best approximations to see whether they are=\r\n encoding\nthe fundamental concept or stringing it together inefficiently.  =\r\nI know\nyou said that the morphologies themselves don&#39;t look &quot;piecemeal,&quot; bu=\r\nt\nthey could still be constructed in a piecewise fashion mathematically. \nF=\r\nor example, figure 8i has some subtle ridges suggestive of unnecessary\nunde=\r\nrlying complexity.\n\nAnother interesting factor is the number of evaluations=\r\n to get within\n90%.  It varies across your treatments, but 30,000 evaluatio=\r\nns or so\nlooks like a reasonable expectation with your system.   With a\npop=\r\nulation of 15 in Picbreeder, that would be 2,000 generations, which\nis a re=\r\nally large number for the complexity of the target object (you\ncan also see=\r\n objects of similar complexity in EndlessForms from 10 or 20\ngenerations). =\r\n So I think your experiment is pretty consistent with ours\noverall, though =\r\nit wasn&#39;t geared at making the same point.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@...=\r\nm, Jeff Clune &lt;jeffclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello everyone-\n&gt;\n&gt; Hod Lipson and=\r\n I have a new publication on evolving 3D morphologies\nwith\n&gt; CPPNs, which e=\r\nxplains the algorithm behind EndlessForms.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; PDF:  http://goo.gl/HRXL=\r\nD\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of you will at least enjoy quickly scanning the figures to see\nt=\r\nhe\n&gt; evolved shapes, which are higher resolution and different than those\no=\r\nn\n&gt; EndlessForms.com.  You can also see a picture of the evolved shapes 3D\n=\r\n&gt; printed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The diversity of shapes I was able to discover just playing =\r\nwith the\nsystem\n&gt; myself for a few hours is pretty incredible, which is a t=\r\nestament to\nKen&#39;s\n&gt; CPPN encoding. Additionally, I ran tests with and witho=\r\nut recurrence\nin the\n&gt; CPPN genome, and with different inputs to the CPPN, =\r\nand you can see\nthe\n&gt; difference those choices make in the resultant object=\r\ns. For example,\nwith\n&gt; CPPN recurrence, the shapes often look more fractal.=\r\n I believe (but\nplease\n&gt; correct me if I am wrong) that this is the first p=\r\nublication with a\ntest of\n&gt; CPPNs with and without recurrence.\n&gt;\n&gt; FInally,=\r\n I conducted target-based evolution by evolving CPPNs to match\na\n&gt; goal obj=\r\nect. I&#39;d be interested to hear if you think the goal was\nreached,\n&gt; and how=\r\n to interpret these results in light of Brian Woolley & Ken\nStanley&#39;s\n&gt; pap=\r\ner on CPPNs not being able to reach target 2D objectives.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I like b=\r\nest about being able to evolve 3D objects is learning how\nthe\n&gt; CPPN search=\r\n space works: mutations frequently produce very sensible\n&gt; variation. For e=\r\nxample, the two 3D printed elephants in figure one are\n&gt; brothers, and are =\r\nclose relatives of the three elephant-looking things\nin\n&gt; figure 4 (b2-4). =\r\nIt&#39;s nice to see mutations have such smooth, sensible\n&gt; effects, instead of=\r\n creating wildly different objects.\n&gt;\n&gt; As always, please let me know your =\r\nthoughts and questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;\n&gt; Postdoctoral Fel=\r\nlow\n&gt; Hod Lipson&#39;s Creative Machines Laboratory\n&gt; Cornell University\n&gt; jeff=\r\nclune@...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
