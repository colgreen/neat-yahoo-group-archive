The inputs are various \ntechnical\n&gt; indicators, but I like the output =\r\nto indicate five states--Buy/Sell\n&gt; (going long), Short/Cover (going short)=\r\n, and do nothing.  Ideally,\n&gt; each signal would be a 1 or 0 (all zeros indi=\r\ncates to do nothing \n(i.e.\n&gt; keep current position - long, short, or out).\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Is this best framed as a classification problem (now is a good \ntim=\r\ne\n&gt; to buy, sell, short, cover), or would some type of 0-1 analog output\n&gt; =\r\nbe best (meaning buy when buy is &gt; sell by 0.2 or something)?  How \ndo\n&gt; yo=\r\nu force a binary output in the software anyway?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Should I try to pre=\r\ndict the percentage change (up or down) over \nthe\n&gt; next n time periods, an=\r\nd then only buy or sell when there is say a \n3%\n&gt; change from now?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. =\r\nwhen recurrence evolves in NEAT, does it look back only 1 time\n&gt; period, or=\r\n can it evolve longer lookbacks?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Thanks, Todd\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
