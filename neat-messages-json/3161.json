G=\r\nlobal doesn&#39;t \nproduce as interesting set of controllers, but it may allevi=\r\nate the \ncrash problems some have experienced.  I also cut down the number =\r\nof \nreplicates on each run from 10 to 5.  This should produce a more \ninter=\r\nesting experience.\n\nAlso remember that the PacMan Visualizer will not opera=\r\nte unless you \npress the &#39;B&#39; key.  Once you do press &#39;B&#39;, PacMan will run t=\r\nhrough \nhis maze after each generation using the current best controller.  =\r\n\nPressing &#39;B&#39; again, will toggle the visualizer.  Be patient after \npressin=\r\ng &#39;B&#39; as it takes a little while to get to the end of the \ngeneration.\n\nI&#39;m=\r\n working on determining the source of the crash some have \nexperinece - ple=\r\nase test this and let me know if it is still a \nproblem.  I&#39;m also working =\r\non some other enhancements many of which \nare based on feedback from users.=\r\n\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n\n"}}
