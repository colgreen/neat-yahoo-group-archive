I started out with grandiose ideas like the ones you have below and\nend=\r\ned up happy if I could get an agent that was as smart enough to not fold\nwi=\r\nth pocket aces. :-)\n\nThat&#39;s an exaggeration, of course, but--to my endless =\r\nchagrin--not by too\nmuch. \n\nNevertheless, I would love to see someone pull =\r\nof a neural network that\nlearns to play poker well, even if it also uses a =\r\nset of rules to get it\nwithin range of great play. Most of the people I kno=\r\nw who work on poker AI\ncan&#39;t even get complicated expert systems/rule engin=\r\nes to play poker well.\nThere is periodic talk of using neural nets, or EC, =\r\nbut no one seems to get\nvery far with it. I myself tried some machine learn=\r\ning techniques and found\nit very hard to find a good representation of an i=\r\nndividual hand of betting\nhistory, let alone variable size windows into pre=\r\nvious hands.\n\nIn short, I&#39;d love to see what you come up with as I do not y=\r\net know of\nanyone who has had much luck with this. I also have not scoured =\r\nthe\nliterature. Do you know of other papers where NNs learned to play decen=\r\nt\npoker?\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State Unive=\r\nrsity\nVisiting Scholar, Instituto de Biolog=EDa Molecular y Celular de Plan=\r\ntas,\nValencia, Spain\n\njclune@...\n34 679 921 530  (mobile in spain)\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n&gt; From: tansey4 &lt;tansey4@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Tue, 13 Feb 2007 19:37:06 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Questions about NEAT =\r\nfor poker\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m a grad student at Virginia Tech and I would=\r\n like to enter a bot\n&gt; into the AAAI poker competition in July.  I&#39;ve been =\r\nworking on poker\n&gt; AI in my spare time for the last 3 years.  I&#39;ve looked a=\r\nt a lot of the\n&gt; Alberta group&#39;s work and talked to most of them at last ye=\r\nar&#39;s AAAI\n&gt; competition.\n&gt; \n&gt; My general plan is to use KB-NEAT and a set o=\r\nf controllers + variables\n&gt; to evolve a network for rapid player modeling a=\r\nnd exploitation in\n&gt; limit (and possibly no-limit) Hold Em.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of t=\r\nhe knowledge in poker is very explicit with little\n&gt; exceptions.  For insta=\r\nnce, &quot;cap with the nut flush&quot; (i.e. never stop\n&gt; raising) is a perfect exam=\r\nple of a piece of advice that works in 80%\n&gt; of cases, but certain situatio=\r\nns, like the board being paired,\n&gt; invalidate that advice.  I hope to help =\r\nkick-start the learning\n&gt; process by developing a fairly in-depth set of ad=\r\nvice rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; My bot will also deviate from the normal approach of game_=\r\nstate -&gt;\n&gt; atomic action (e.g., fold/call/raise).  Instead I&#39;m going to hav=\r\ne the\n&gt; bot select a &quot;play&quot; at the start of each round.  I define a play as=\r\n a\n&gt; set of betting actions that handle any case in the current round.  An\n=\r\n&gt; example post-flop play (from first position) would be\n&gt; Check-Raise-Call.=\r\n  Here, there is no way that the bot could ever reach\n&gt; a situation where i=\r\nt doesn&#39;t know what to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I chose to use plays for two reasons.  Firs=\r\nt, they simplify the input\n&gt; to the network as you do not have to consider =\r\nthe sequence of bets.\n&gt; Second, I believe that most (non-novice) human play=\r\ners actually use a\n&gt; similar--or even higher level-- model when playing.  F=\r\nor instance,\n&gt; good players no-limit players (and to a lesser extent, limit=\r\n players)\n&gt; will often play a single hand in a loose fashion (usually attem=\r\npting a\n&gt; large bluff), hoping that the next hand will give them a similar\n=\r\n&gt; situation but with a legitimate hand.  In such cases, players are\n&gt; actua=\r\nlly planning on making the bluffs and subsequent big hands well\n&gt; ahead of =\r\ntime.  The evidence for this should be the speed with which\n&gt; most limit ri=\r\nng games are played.  As the stakes rise, the speed of\n&gt; the game tends to =\r\nincrease, as players create more abstract plays.\n&gt; \n&gt; The inputs for my net=\r\nworks will be broken down into three main\n&gt; categories: betting, stats, and=\r\n history.  Betting will simply be a\n&gt; represenation of the previous rounds&#39;=\r\n bet history.  Stats will\n&gt; encompass things like hand strength vs a random=\r\n player, flush draw\n&gt; probability, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; History will be a set of playe=\r\nr statistics broken into 3\n&gt; sub-categories: total, previous hand, and a va=\r\nriable range.  The\n&gt; statistics for each category will all be the same, wit=\r\nh only the\n&gt; sample size varying.  Total will encompass the entire play his=\r\ntory of\n&gt; the opponent.  Previous hand will look only at the previous hand.=\r\n\n&gt; Variable range will use the play over the previous N hands (where N &lt;\n&gt; =\r\n30).  This way I hope to be able to model players that quickly change\n&gt; the=\r\nir play.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Is there a way I can use mult=\r\niple networks per individual in the\n&gt; population?  I.e., I want to have a s=\r\neparate network for each round,\n&gt; since there are different inputs (cards, =\r\nbets) for each successive\n&gt; round.  I have considered making one monolithic=\r\n network and using\n&gt; extra nodes to represent on/off status of the round-sp=\r\necific data, but\n&gt; I feel like that would add a lot of needless noise to th=\r\ne network.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This is related to 1, but is there any way to also encor=\r\nporate\n&gt; other variables in my evolution parameters?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Is there any c=\r\node available for the KB-NEAT so I can incorporate my\n&gt; custom advice?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If anyone is interested in a more detailed description of the inputs,\n&gt;=\r\n let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Wesley\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
