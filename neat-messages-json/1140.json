In \nRobot Duel, for example, there is only so good you can get, and \nafter that the domain can&#39;t support anything more interesting \nbecause the game has been mastered as much as possible.  \n\nWe know games like Go support a very wide range of complexity, but \nin a game like that the problem is that stagnation is likely to set \nin as search finds certain strategic plateaus that are hard to get \nout of.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible that stagnation we observe in 1,000 \ngeneration runs isn&#39;t actually stagnation when viewed from the \nvantage point of millions of generations, but who knows?\n\nHere is a well-recognized and interesting challenge:  Design a \ndomain, maybe a robot domain like robot duel, where there is room \nfor virtually *unlimited* ever-increasing complexity.  It turns out \nthis is very hard to do, and most domains turn out to have a limit \nto how much intelligence can help after a certain point.  Such \ndomains are called &quot;open-ended,&quot; and designing them to be truly open-\nended is perhaps as hard as AI itself.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; hey,\n&gt; \n&gt; has anyone created a simulation of considerable complexity like \nken&#39;s \n&gt; robot dual domain and let it run for very long period of time like \na \n&gt; million generations to see what kind of strategies evolve? i was \njust \n&gt; kinda curious to know how far competative co evolution could go. \n&gt; anyway thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; timmy\n\n\n"}}
