I remember now that this is why I \nsuggested \n&gt; pruning only after a period of stagnation... the theory being that \nyou just \n&gt; leave the neutral structure and continue searching in the higher \nspace while it \n&gt; is still working. If you then reach a point of stagnation *then* \nprune your way \n&gt; back to the lower search space - which could be quite a bit lower \nfor the first \n&gt; prune.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course if you did this and still stagnated then you wouldn&#39;t \nwant to trigger \n&gt; off another prune phase, there would be no point. So perhaps if we \nset a flag \n&gt; that tells us that pruning is an option, and which gets set to \ntrue whenever an \n&gt; improvement is found. So when stagnation does occur we check the \nflag first \n&gt; before deciding to prune.\n&gt; \n\nHere&#39;s an interesting idea:  Do your pruning idea on a per-species \nbasis instead of on the whole population.  In other words, see if a \nspecies has improved, and then if the species is stagnant, set a \nflag inside the species saying mutations for the while should be \npruning mutations.  That way, different species can be in different \nphases out of phase with each other.\n\nThis kind of per-species analysis is possible in NEAT \nimplementations that are like mine since I keep keep track of \nspecies continuity throughout the run.  In other words, my NEAT \nimplementation knows how long it&#39;s been since the last improvement \nof every species.  If you do speciation like I do, this is possible.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
