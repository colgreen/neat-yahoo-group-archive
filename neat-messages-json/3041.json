Additive mutations acts on the\nCPNN. So there is any violations of the NEAT\nphilosophy : minimal genotype with well conceived\nmutations. Of course, small modifications of the CPNN\nlead to huge modifications in the target phenotype, as\nin all compact neural networks encodings like cellular\nencoding. The HyperNEAT seems to be a new step in this\nfamilly of encodings :D\n\nThe hidden nodes of the genotype (the CPNN) are added\nby NEAT as usual. The hidden nodes of the phenotype\n(the jumbo sized neural network) are never added, it&#39;s\nup to the substrate conception to provide enought\nneurons. The HyperNEAT allows to put thousands of\nneurons, so we can be generous with the substrate.\n\n--- petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; a\n�crit :\n\n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; a have a quiestion about this.. The evolution in\n&gt; this indirect method \n&gt; evolves the geometry of the connections, right? But\n&gt; even in the first \n&gt; population there may be phenotypes with millions of\n&gt; connections. Does \n&gt; this violate the third principle of NEAT, that\n&gt; initial genomes must \n&gt; be as small as possible? \n&gt; What about hidden nodes? In this approach, a set of\n&gt; nodes has to be \n&gt; chosen and the evolution then evolves only the\n&gt; connections between \n&gt; them. There are no additive mutations for nodes and\n&gt; stuff. \n&gt; I know that the inner workings of this system is\n&gt; NEAT, starting \n&gt; minimally and so on, but when we look at the actual\n&gt; phenotypes, when \n&gt; we see how they evolve, it doesn&#39;t look like NEAT\n&gt; starting from a \n&gt; minimal point and slowly adding structure.. A single\n&gt; small mutation \n&gt; in the CPPN genome changes the entire structure of\n&gt; the phenotype. Is \n&gt; this right?\n&gt; Or the comlexification here is about moving to\n&gt; higher resolutions of \n&gt; the networks? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot;\n&gt; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, as some of you know, we have been\n&gt; working for a while \n&gt; &gt; now on turning the patterns output by CPPNs into\n&gt; neural networks.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am excited to report that we have found a \n&gt; &gt; straightforward and principled approach to\n&gt; interpreting CPPN output \n&gt; &gt; as a connectivity pattern rather than a spatial\n&gt; pattern.    We are \n&gt; &gt; calling this method HyperNEAT, which stands for\n&gt; Hypercube-based \n&gt; &gt; NEAT.  With HyperNEAT, we have been able to\n&gt; produce working neural \n&gt; &gt; networks with millions of connections.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Because we have just recently had two publications\n&gt; on this method \n&gt; &gt; accepted at GECCO-2007, we can finally disclose\n&gt; our work and share \n&gt; &gt; it with others.  The publications are available on\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the &quot;Publications&quot; page at http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; They are also available through my homepage \n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications\n&gt; (under Publications, \n&gt; &gt; Conference and Symposium Papers), or directly at\n&gt; the following \n&gt; &gt; address, which I am sure yahoo is going to mangle:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\n&gt; &gt; option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=28\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The two papers, which present separate experiments\n&gt; are:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Generating Large-Scale Neural Networks Through\n&gt; Discovering \n&gt; &gt; Geometric Regularities&quot; by Jason J. Gauci and\n&gt; Kenneth O. Stanley\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploiting Neural\n&gt; Network Sensor \n&gt; &gt; and Output Geometry&quot; by David B. D&#39;Ambrosio and\n&gt; Kenneth O. Stanley\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambriosio and Jason Gauci are both Ph.D.\n&gt; students in the \n&gt; &gt; EPlex lab who did an enormous amount of work to\n&gt; make this possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT is based on a surprisingly simple\n&gt; principle: Connectivity \n&gt; &gt; patterns are actually no different from spatial\n&gt; patterns in a \n&gt; higher-\n&gt; &gt; dimensional space.  In other words, a\n&gt; 2-dimensional connectivity \n&gt; &gt; pattern is the same thing as a 4-dimensional\n&gt; spatial pattern.  (The \n&gt; &gt; technical term is that they are &quot;isomorphic.&quot;) \n&gt; Therefore, if we \n&gt; &gt; simply produce spatial patterns within a 4D\n&gt; hypercube instead of a \n&gt; &gt; 2D plane, they can be mapped directly to\n&gt; connectivity patterns with \n&gt; &gt; all the nice properties that we have seen from\n&gt; CPPNs.  Thus, they \n&gt; &gt; require no special &quot;image recognition&quot; type\n&gt; tricks.  The mapping is \n&gt; &gt; perfectly isomorphic.  We are calling these 4D\n&gt; CPPNs &quot;connective \n&gt; &gt; CPPNs&quot; since they are interpreted as connectivity\n&gt; patterns.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This insight yields a handful of unprecedented\n&gt; capabilities.  For \n&gt; &gt; example, with connective CPPNs, you can recreate\n&gt; the same solution \n&gt; &gt; network at a different resolution without further\n&gt; evolution!  You \n&gt; &gt; can also place inputs and outputs in meaningful\n&gt; geometric \n&gt; &gt; configurations that HyperNEAT can exploit for\n&gt; symmetries and \n&gt; &gt; regularities.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case, I am excited about this new advance\n&gt; and these papers \n&gt; &gt; are a first step in exploring the new approach.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n_______________________________\nMarmakoide aka Alexandre Devert \n_______________________________\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________________________ \nD�couvrez une nouvelle fa�on d&#39;obtenir des r�ponses � toutes vos questions ! \nProfitez des connaissances, des opinions et des exp�riences des internautes sur Yahoo!
