The closer the angle and distance to 0 the greater the fitness.\n\nIt should be easy enough for NEAT to find a solution I think.\n\n\n&gt; Currently, we&#39;re running the simulation in realtime (couldn&#39;t figure out a simple way to\n&gt; speed up game time on server end:S) with 10 players (the population) in the sim. Each is\n&gt; oblivious to the other, as the only objective is to close in on the ball.\n\nThe realtime limit is unfortunate, but then the subtask of moving to\nthe ball should be straightforward for NEAT - depending on how the\nagent moves around I suppose.\n\n\n\n&gt; Every 100ms (once again, a realtime server limitation) for each of the networks we set\n&gt; inputs and get outputs and perform the decided action.\n&gt; We repeat the above NumActions times in EvalPop summing the fitness from each trial.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now for the questions:\n&gt; 1. On each subsequent call to EvalPop, should we reset the positions (random positions\n&gt; far from ball) and stats of the networks.\n\nYeh I think you need some degree of randomness in there otherwise you\nwill probably just find a solution that only deals with attacking the\nball from a certain angle or some other limited subset of possible\nscenarios. The prey capture experiment you mention actually tests each\ngenome 100(I think) times per evaluation, each from a different random\nstarting point, roughly equidistant from the prey.\n\nI would suggest you need to activate for a number of timesteps until\n(A) The ball is reached or (B) a max number of timesteps is reached.\nYou can then assign fitness as something like  (CONST_MAX_FITNESS -\ndistance - timesteps_took). The constant term in there is required\nbecause SharpNeat can only maximise a fitness score right now, not\nminimise. So as the distance falls you want the fitness to go up.\n\n\n&gt; 3. Why does the GenomeList.Count vary? I noticed the same thing in preycapture. On\n&gt; the 2nd call to eval pop the count will be 1 extra, and a few hundred gens later it reduced\n&gt; to 1 less than the specified count. How can I disable this?\n\nIt&#39;s a side effect of the fitness sharing technique in SharpNEAT -\neach species is assigned a new size based on it&#39;s fitness in the last\ngeneration. That new size is based on a species&#39; proportion of the\ntotal population size - and in calculating each species&#39; size rounding\noccurs. So if the allocation was 6.5 the species actually gets 7\ngenomes. Thus you can expect at maximum 1 extra genome per species (I\nthink). I suppose you could disable speciation by setting the target\nspecies sizes to 0 (this might break the code but you can try it) and\nalso setting a high initial comparison threshold value.\n\nAlternatively you could ignore any excess genomes by assigning them a\nzero fitness. It means you will miss the occasional good genome, but\nit&#39;s not the end of the world.\n\nGood Luck,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
