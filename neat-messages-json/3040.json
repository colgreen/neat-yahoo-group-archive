The evolution in this indirect method =\r\n\nevolves the geometry of the connections, right? But even in the first \npop=\r\nulation there may be phenotypes with millions of connections. Does \nthis vi=\r\nolate the third principle of NEAT, that initial genomes must \nbe as small a=\r\ns possible? \nWhat about hidden nodes? In this approach, a set of nodes has =\r\nto be \nchosen and the evolution then evolves only the connections between \n=\r\nthem. There are no additive mutations for nodes and stuff. \nI know that the=\r\n inner workings of this system is NEAT, starting \nminimally and so on, but =\r\nwhen we look at the actual phenotypes, when \nwe see how they evolve, it doe=\r\nsn&#39;t look like NEAT starting from a \nminimal point and slowly adding struct=\r\nure.. A single small mutation \nin the CPPN genome changes the entire struct=\r\nure of the phenotype. Is \nthis right?\nOr the comlexification here is about =\r\nmoving to higher resolutions of \nthe networks? \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone, as some =\r\nof you know, we have been working for a while \n&gt; now on turning the pattern=\r\ns output by CPPNs into neural networks.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I am excited to report that =\r\nwe have found a \n&gt; straightforward and principled approach to interpreting =\r\nCPPN output \n&gt; as a connectivity pattern rather than a spatial pattern.    =\r\nWe are \n&gt; calling this method HyperNEAT, which stands for Hypercube-based \n=\r\n&gt; NEAT.  With HyperNEAT, we have been able to produce working neural \n&gt; net=\r\nworks with millions of connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; Because we have just recently had =\r\ntwo publications on this method \n&gt; accepted at GECCO-2007, we can finally d=\r\nisclose our work and share \n&gt; it with others.  The publications are availab=\r\nle on \n&gt; the &quot;Publications&quot; page at http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu \n&gt; \n&gt; They are =\r\nalso available through my homepage \n&gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publ=\r\nications (under Publications, \n&gt; Conference and Symposium Papers), or direc=\r\ntly at the following \n&gt; address, which I am sure yahoo is going to mangle:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\n&gt; option=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&=\r\nid=3D14&Itemid=3D28\n&gt; \n&gt; The two papers, which present separate experiments=\r\n are:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Generating Large-Scale Neural Networks Through Discovering \n&gt; G=\r\neometric Regularities&quot; by Jason J. Gauci and Kenneth O. Stanley\n&gt; \n&gt; and \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &quot;A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploiting Neural Network Sensor \n&gt; an=\r\nd Output Geometry&quot; by David B. D&#39;Ambrosio and Kenneth O. Stanley\n&gt; \n&gt; David=\r\n D&#39;Ambriosio and Jason Gauci are both Ph.D. students in the \n&gt; EPlex lab wh=\r\no did an enormous amount of work to make this possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; HyperNEAT is b=\r\nased on a surprisingly simple principle: Connectivity \n&gt; patterns are actua=\r\nlly no different from spatial patterns in a \nhigher-\n&gt; dimensional space.  =\r\nIn other words, a 2-dimensional connectivity \n&gt; pattern is the same thing a=\r\ns a 4-dimensional spatial pattern.  (The \n&gt; technical term is that they are=\r\n &quot;isomorphic.&quot;)  Therefore, if we \n&gt; simply produce spatial patterns within=\r\n a 4D hypercube instead of a \n&gt; 2D plane, they can be mapped directly to co=\r\nnnectivity patterns with \n&gt; all the nice properties that we have seen from =\r\nCPPNs.  Thus, they \n&gt; require no special &quot;image recognition&quot; type tricks.  =\r\nThe mapping is \n&gt; perfectly isomorphic.  We are calling these 4D CPPNs &quot;con=\r\nnective \n&gt; CPPNs&quot; since they are interpreted as connectivity patterns.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n This insight yields a handful of unprecedented capabilities.  For \n&gt; examp=\r\nle, with connective CPPNs, you can recreate the same solution \n&gt; network at=\r\n a different resolution without further evolution!  You \n&gt; can also place i=\r\nnputs and outputs in meaningful geometric \n&gt; configurations that HyperNEAT =\r\ncan exploit for symmetries and \n&gt; regularities.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I am ex=\r\ncited about this new advance and these papers \n&gt; are a first step in explor=\r\ning the new approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
