I believe thi=\r\ns presentation is \napplicable to NEAT user&#39;s not based upon the subject MDO=\r\n task, but \nrather based upon the experience-based observations regarding t=\r\nhe \nimportance of maintaining history (see pages 9, 20, 39, 40 and 92). \nTh=\r\neir conclusion was that the implementation of a history block reduced \ncomp=\r\nutational requirements by a factor of (10). This is consistent with \nmy own=\r\n experiences with NEAT, in instances in which the fitness \nevaluation was c=\r\nomputationally non-trivial (i.e. most useful real-world \nproblems).\n\nPrior =\r\nposts have outlined various useful libraries applicable to \nimplementation =\r\nof a history functionality w/ NEAT.\n\n\n\n"}}
