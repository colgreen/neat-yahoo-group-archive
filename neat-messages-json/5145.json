The 2010 IEEE Conference on Computational\nIntelligence and Games aims to bring together leading researchers and\npractitioners from academia and industry alike to share the latest\nadvances in computational intelligence as applied to games.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n    * Learning in games\n    * Coevolution in games\n    * Neural-based approaches for games\n    * Fuzzy-based approaches for games\n    * Player/Opponent modeling in games\n    * CI/AI-based game design\n    * Multi-agent and multi-strategy learning\n    * Applications of game theory\n    * Procedural content generation\n    * CI for Player Affective Modeling\n    * Intelligent Interactive Narrative\n    * Imperfect information and non-deterministic games\n    * Player satisfaction and experience in games\n    * Theoretical or empirical analysis of CI techniques for games\n    * Comparative studies and game-based benchmarking\n    * Computational and artificial intelligence in:\n          o Video games\n          o Board and card games\n          o Economic or mathematical games\n          o Serious games\n          o Augmented and mixed-reality games\n          o Games for mobile platforms\n\nThe conference will consist of a single track of oral presentations,\ntutorial and special sessions, and live competitions. The\nproceedings will be placed in IEEE Xplore, and made freely available\non the conference website after the conference.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n===============\n\nPaper submission deadline: March 15, 2010\nDecision Notification:       May 15, 2010\nCamera-ready Submission:    June 15, 2010\nConference starts:        August 18, 2010\n\nIEEE CIG 2010 ORGANISING COMMITTEE\n==================================\n\nGeneral Chairs:\nGeorgios N.
