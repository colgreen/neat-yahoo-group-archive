While this worked well and could be used for evolving substrate confi=\r\ngurations right away, there was still a problem about deciding the right nu=\r\nmber of nodes for particular individuals. With GNG, it is more like a probl=\r\nem of deciding when to stop development or approximation of the CPPN pictur=\r\ne. \n\nWhen we discussed the issue some time ago, I had the idea that CPPN co=\r\nmplexity can be directly linked to substrate density. More complex CPPN =3D=\r\n more dense substrate. This seems like a solution but it I think it is actu=\r\nally a bad idea. A CPPN containing many nodes and links does not always pro=\r\nduce a complex pattern in space. It can be an entirely white or black pictu=\r\nre, due to genetic defects. Plus, it is not sure that the problem requires =\r\nthat many nodes to be solved - the CPPN may have enormous complexity but pr=\r\noducing a simple well-shaped picture that solves it. \n\nSo what I think now =\r\nis, that substrate density should be related to fitness instead. How exactl=\r\ny? Well here is my idea. \n\nAll individuals start with a minimal number of n=\r\nodes in the substrate, say 50. There will be a mutation increasing the numb=\r\ner of nodes with about 0%-10% or decreasing with 0%-10%. The mutation rate =\r\nwill vary across species. Species that are stagnating for too long time wil=\r\nl have the probability of this mutation increased - because they may just l=\r\nack the number of nodes to solve the problem. Or have too many nodes. \n\nYou=\r\n know, there is a problem with having the number of nodes increasing and th=\r\nis is the over saturation of the sigmoid. Increasing the density with 2x wi=\r\nll have very big impact if the weights are not altered, especially in case =\r\nrecurrence is present. How can we cope with that? \n\nI don&#39;t have any experi=\r\nmental data yet, I am too busy programming some bullshit but please tell me=\r\n if this ideas make sense to you. \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
