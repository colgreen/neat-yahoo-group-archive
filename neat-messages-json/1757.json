Hmm...\n&gt; \n&gt; Do any of you know if the activate function in the JNeat version \nis \n&gt; different than activate in Ken&#39;s C++ version? In some places in \nthe \n&gt; JNeat version, activate is called for 1+networkDepth times. Does \n&gt; activate in Ken&#39;s version propagate new vals all the way from \ninput to \n&gt; output?\n&gt; \n\nThe activation should be the same, but you should check to make sure \nthat the sigmoid in mine (fsigmoid) and JNEAT are the same.  But the \nway activation works should be that a single activation causes the \nsignal to travel only the length of a single connection.  The reason \nJNEAT activates 1+networkDepth times is that it is doing \nclassification problems.  For continuous control problems, it \nusually is only activated once per timestep.\n\nYou may want to check that you have the right genome file for single \npole balancing.  It does sound like something is wrong if you are \ngetting stuck on such an easy problem.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
