I would not dismiss the idea that there is the possibility\n&gt;  that a classifier could evolve that detects something surprising\n&gt;  about aesthetic value and thereby filters the search for interesting\n&gt;  images. It is an intoxicating idea and I would love to hear about\n&gt;  and see the results of any such attempt.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Yet let me give you an idea about the origin of my skepticism.\n[snip]\n\nI have to agree, you are right.  The tendency to take a short-cut can\nbe a problem.  That is why I was so excited by the study I saw done\nwhere a network was explicitly punished for doing so.  The results in\nthat case were nothing short of stunning.\n\nBut I wasn&#39;t proposing to evolve the controller using published images\nfrom PicBreeder.  I was proposing that it be trained to judge between\ncrops of real images, crops that have aesthetically pleasing\nqualities, and randomly generated images of various kinds.  That\nshould be a fairly simple, straight forward exercise.  It should learn\nto detect &#39;signal&#39; vs. noise, a simple mathematical function, right?\nAs it plateaus at that task, start throwing more and more &#39;orderly&#39;\nnoise at it, and/or noise of different kinds.  That is, GUIDE the\nevolution.  As it learns to tell the difference between &#39;normal&#39; and\n&#39;noise&#39; images, start varying the parameters of the &#39;noise.&#39;  Over\ntime, if the path that the &#39;noise&#39; images takes is controlled, you\nshould be able to lead the network TOWARDS the &#39;deeper&#39; function that\nit is meant to learn.  Maybe something like this:\n\n* First learn to distinguish between image and a uniform field of one\ncolor.  It&#39;ll probably cheat on this task, but that&#39;s okay.\n* Then between image and nearly uniform, with, say, 1% pixel noise.\n* As it gets better at dealing with the pixel noise, increase the\npixel noise levels\n* When it can deal with large pixel noise, start varying the size of\nthe pixels.  Add the &#39;noise&#39; by adding &#39;circles&#39; from 1-n pixels in\ndiameter.  As the value of n increases, the &#39;orderliness&#39; of the\n&#39;random&#39; image increases, making it harder and harder to tell the\ndifference based on a &#39;short-cut&#39; and forcing a successful network to\nevolve a more intelligent solution, though not necessarily a solution\nthat gives us what we want, just yet.\n* When it can do that, start mixing circles of various sizes with\nlines of various thicknesses and lengths.\n* As we do this, we continue to include the solid-color and various\nlevels of pixel noise test samples in the test, so that the network is\nexpected to remember how to do what it has done before\n* When the noise reaches a certain level, we start taking the &#39;nice&#39;\npictures, and applying noise to them.  The successful network will\nhave learned to tell what is noise and what is not, and will be able\nto rate the non-noisy version of an image higher than the version that\nhas had noise added to it.\n\nUp to this point, the jumps are all pretty easy, and it should be\ndoable.  Making the final jump is harder.  We don&#39;t KNOW necessarily\nwhat makes for an &#39;aesthetically pleasing&#39; image, we just know that it\nmust have some kind of &#39;structure&#39; to it, which we have been teaching\nthe network to find.\n\nBut it is not just structure, it must have some certain\ncharacteristics to that structure in order to be pleasing.  There must\nbe a counter-example to learn to distinguish between.  This is where\nthe process starts to get difficult...\n\nAnd it&#39;s late.  If I come up with an elegant way to make that jump,\nI&#39;ll let you know! :)\n\n-- \nJohn Arrowwood\nJohn (at) Hanlons Razor (dot) com\nJohn (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n--\nhttp://arrowwood.blogspot.com\n\n"}}
