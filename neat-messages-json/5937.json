I want to find out why.\n&gt; &gt;Here are some pos=\r\nsilbility I am thinking of. Can anyone give me any hints and comments.\n&gt; &gt;T=\r\nhe first possibility I thought is the weak ability of the initial populatio=\r\nn, since there are no hidden nodes, the neural network can not approximate =\r\nthe value function well. In my experiment, it can not achieve the top after=\r\n 10000 steps. \n&gt; &gt;Another reason I considered is the initial weights of the=\r\n neural network, learning rate and so on, these parameters should be set ca=\r\nrefully, but it takes me a long time, and I haven&#39;t found a better setting.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;I also think the mutation rate is an important factor.If I set a small =\r\nmutation rate, it may take a longer time to envolve. If I set a bigger valu=\r\ne, does this lead to divergence?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Any feedback is appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
