Or do you plan to write your own?\n\nThere are now multiple implementations of NEAT\navailable in different languages, and as I mentioned\nin my introduction, Philip and I are nearly finished\nwith a Java implementation, which we plan to\nopen-source.\n\nThose of you who have implemented your own version of\nNEAT...why did you choose the particular language or\nplatform that you did?  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
