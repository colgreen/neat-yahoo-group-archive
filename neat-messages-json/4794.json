Any chance for that feature in SN2?\n\nWesley\n\nQuoting Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;:\n\n&gt; 2009/7/27 Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reading Jean-Baptiste&#39;s response got me thinking that there&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; broader question here about the elimintation of connections with low\n&gt; &gt;&gt; weight (e.g.+-0.2). The &#39;pure&#39; approach is to leave them in, the\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; While I agree that there could be a performance boost for very large and\n&gt; &gt; sparse networks by eliminating links, I do not think the current code base\n&gt; &gt; gets any performance boost from &#39;missing&#39; links, because the links are\n&gt; still\n&gt; &gt; there and are just set to 0.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I&#39;m remembering right, if the links are still there then there is\n&gt; no need to apply the +-0.2 cut-off. The only purpose of the cut-off is\n&gt; to restrict the number of connections in the resulting ANN that must\n&gt; be simulated.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;However\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there may be better alternatives:\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) Use HybrID to refine *all* of the weights over their full range,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regardles of whether they were eliminated during the HyperNEAT phase.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I understand you correctly, this is what we did in the paper.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This then raises the question of how much HybrID&#39;s performance is down\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to this effect.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do not understand what you mean by this comment. Can you expand it a bit?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sure. Assuming you did use a cut-off of +-0.2 (or so) then I&#39;m\n&gt; suggesting that this may be a disadvantage to HyperNeat because it\n&gt; cannot express connection weights in the +-0.2 range - because they\n&gt; get zeroed. If it is a significant disadvantage then perhaps some of\n&gt; the advantage of HybrID is due to it&#39;s adjusting some of the\n&gt; connections weights (zeroed or otherwise) into the +-0.2 range.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Even more broadly, given the potentially huge resource cost of ANNs\n&gt; &gt;&gt; generated by CPPNs perhaps we should consider factoring that cost into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the fitness functions. That way we allow evolution to find the sweet\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spot between good performance on the objective function and lousy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; resource utilisation (which slows down search speed and thus the power\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the overall search method)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is a cool idea. It would be cool to see someone try it.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s trivially simple to add a genome size punishment factor into the\n&gt; fitness function, just use something like:\n&gt;\n&gt;      fitness = fitness / (connectionCount + C)\n&gt;\n&gt; and maybe scale the fitness back up with some fixed multiple, so:\n&gt;\n&gt;   fitness = (fitness * A) / (connectionCount + C)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve also used this approach to limit overfitting of target data, put\n&gt; simply, smaller ANNs are less likely to specialize and overfit than\n&gt; larger ones. I guess you could say it&#39;s a form of regularization.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
