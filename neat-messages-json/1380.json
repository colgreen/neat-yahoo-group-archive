Hence your result of the \nnetworks just evolving to return zero.\n\nIf you still want to evolve an averaging network then maybe you need to \nsupply non-normalised data.  Otherwise, especially in the case where you \nare doing (1,1) - (9,9) then zero will always be a good guess.  I know \naveraging is only a step on the way to enlargement and you may be dropping \nthat step, but if you were pursuing averaging then this might be a good idea.\n\nTo put this in a different context, you already use rotated, mirrored and \ninverted versions of each image.  Inversion changes the individual \nbrighnesses but does not move the average any further from zero.  Maybe \ntransformation of the images average brightness is another feature which \nyou would want the networks behaviour to be invariant under...\n\nFurther to my previous post, however, the multiplexing part of the network \nmust involve at least 100 neurones, maybe evolving that should be your \nfirst step?  OTOH, is multiplexing actually required as part of the \nproblem, or did you just introduce it as part of your experimental \nsetup.  Did those other papers you mentioned use coordinate inputs?  If \nnot, then I&#39;d strongly recommend some discussion of whether the experiment \ncan be rephrased to avoid evolving this complex sub-network, such as fixing \nan &quot;eye&quot; size and scanning the eye over the whole image...\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
