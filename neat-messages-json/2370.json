Howeve=\r\nr, not being perfect at Othello leaves a lot of \nroom for notable achieveme=\r\nnt.  The problem with TTT is that it&#39;s so \nsimple that we know everythign a=\r\nbout what it should be doing.  Othello \nis far more complex.\n\nIn fact, have=\r\n you guys seen this paper on discovering the mobility \nstrategy in Othello =\r\nusing neuroevolution from 1995? :\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?REC=\r\nORD_KEY(Pubs)=3DPubID&PubID(Pubs)\n=3D87\n\nIt&#39;s pre-NEAT, but it&#39;s quite inte=\r\nresting that the NN learned an \nadvanced strategy that had only recently be=\r\nen discovered by humans.\n\nHowever, even with these results, I&#39;m still skept=\r\nical about our \nability to make close to human-level progress in board game=\r\ns with the \ncurrent NE technology.
