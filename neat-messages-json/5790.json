For each intersection on the game boa=\r\nrd I want ES-HyperNEAT to be able to discover a hidden node that is associa=\r\nted with only that intersection.  I also want it to be able to discover oth=\r\ner nodes with multiple intersection associations. So, I need to choose a qu=\r\nadtree resolution that will allow that.  If I apply ES-HyperNEAT to the app=\r\nroach in the scalable Go paper, which rescales the Go board to a distance o=\r\nf 2/18 between intersections (cells) so that a 19x19 board will fit the CPP=\r\nN input range from -1 to 1, then I&#39;m thinking the quadtree resolution would=\r\n need to allow a node to be expressed that is less than 1/18 from a board i=\r\nntersection, say 1/36.\nThis would potentially allow 3277 nodes in the hidde=\r\nn layer for a 19x19 board, but hopefully pruning from the evolution of lowe=\r\nr board sizes will keep the number significantly lower.  If not, I need a m=\r\nore powerful computer.\n\nTony\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Sebastian Risi &lt;=\r\nsebastian.risi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Tony,\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you still define the pos=\r\nition of the input nodes and ES-HyperNEAT\n&gt; starts to discover the hidden n=\r\nodes from there, you can still have input\n&gt; nodes at the borders. The one t=\r\nhing that&#39;s a little trickier is getting\n&gt; hidden nodes directly at the bou=\r\nndaries (e.g. x=3D-1), because the location\n&gt; of a new hidden node is deter=\r\nmined by the center of quadtree square. The\n&gt; initial square used for the q=\r\nuadtree extraction\n&gt; normally spans the space from (-1, -1) to (1, 1), so s=\r\nimilarly to what you\n&gt; suggested you could have an initial square that e.g.=\r\n spans the space from\n&gt; (-1.2, -1.2)  to (1.2, 1.2). This way you could hav=\r\ne hidden nodes expressed\n&gt; closer to e.g. x=3D-1. However, I&#39;m not sure how=\r\n important it is to be able\n&gt; to express hidden nodes at exactly those loca=\r\ntions and I believe it\n&gt; probably doesn&#39;t hurt the algorithm that the hidde=\r\nn node might be expressed\n&gt; at a slightly different location (e.g. -0.9).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; One thing that would be different from previously published ES-HyperNEA=\r\nT\n&gt; experiments with a domain like Go is that you have a grid-like setup of=\r\n\n&gt; input nodes instead of having inputs in a horizontal line (e.g. at y=3D-=\r\n1). A\n&gt; typical setup for HyperNEAT for these kind of domains uses multiple=\r\n\n&gt; different two-dimensional layers of neurons. An example can be found in\n=\r\n&gt; this paper: http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/gauci_ppsn10.pdf (figure 1)\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; For ES-HyperNEAT it would probably make sense to give the CPPN an\n&gt; addi=\r\ntional input (instead of an additional output as in the HyperNEAT\n&gt; paper),=\r\n which would determine if you query connections from the input to\n&gt; the hid=\r\nden layer or from the hidden layer to the output layer. This way the\n&gt; ES-H=\r\nyperNEAT algorithm could just be applied to the one weight output\n&gt; pattern=\r\n, as in the previously published experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know if th=\r\nis helps or if you have any other questions about\n&gt; ES-HyperNEAT. We will a=\r\nlso release an updated version of ES-HyperNEAT\n&gt; implemented in C# soon.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Sebastian\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Apr 11, 2012 at 12:29 AM, wilsontg80 &lt;wilsontg@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On second thought, if I&#39;m evolving a 5x=\r\n5 board evaluator and treat it as\n&gt; &gt; if it is 7x7, then band pruning will =\r\nremove the excess edge nodes without\n&gt; &gt; automatically clobbering the 5x5 e=\r\ndge nodes.

However, it&#39;s possible t=\r\nhat I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; misunderstanding the question, in which case please let me know=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the quote that says, &quot;the CPPN speaks a languag=\r\ne through its\n&gt; &gt; pattern,&quot; this idea conveys that of course there is more =\r\nthan one way to\n&gt; &gt; interpret the patterns output by CPPNs for this purpose=\r\n, and any such\n&gt; &gt; method of interpretation is a kind of language. In other=\r\n words, there might\n&gt; &gt; be other perfectly legitimate ways of deciding whic=\r\nh connections to express\n&gt; &gt; from an infinite-resolution pattern that are d=\r\nifferent from the method in\n&gt; &gt; the paper (i.e. those would be different &quot;l=\r\nanguages&quot; for the CPPN to\n&gt; &gt; express what it wants).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, the &quot;language&quot; suggested in the paper is nice in the sense\n&gt; &gt; that it =\r\nallows the CPPN to express one type of connection without being\n&gt; &gt; forced =\r\nto express another at the same time - that&#39;s what the band pruning\n&gt; &gt; achi=\r\neves. Otherwise you&#39;d get points chosen on both sides of a sharp\n&gt; &gt; border=\r\n, forcing connections often to be chosen in pairs (which seems an\n&gt; &gt; undes=\r\nirable tendency).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;wilsontg80&quot; &lt;wilsontg@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am pu=\r\nzzled by the result of band pruning in Figure 3: Example\n&gt; &gt; point selectio=\r\nn in two dimensions, from Evolving the Placement and Density\n&gt; &gt; of Neurons=\r\n in the HyperNEAT Substrate.
