We have a few\n&gt; regulars who tend to produce a number of pictures in bursts and then\n&gt; return a few days or weeks later, and we also have a steady stream of\n&gt; new people who tend to come in, publish a few pictures, and then never\n&gt; publish anything again.  In terms of actual numbers, maybe about 10-25\n&gt; pictures are published each day.  There are almost 6,000 total\n&gt; published images after 1.5 years, so that gives you a sense of\n&gt; activity overall.  Daily activity has increased over that time, but\n&gt; not by that much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another interesting thing is that many more people visit and browse\n&gt; the site than actually publish something.  Another chunk of visitors\n&gt; save images privately but never publish them publicly (we can see how\n&gt; many images are saved that are not published).  It seems many people\n&gt; take public publishing seriously.\n&gt; \n&gt; Branching does seem to lead to better images in people&#39;s opinion.\n&gt; Only 1.87% of the 482 top-rated images were evolved within 20\n&gt; generations.  So that would suggest that some level of complexity is\n&gt; correlated to quality.  However, it is also evident that some\n&gt; relatively simple pictures are quite appealing.  You can now look at\n&gt; complexity levels (in terms of nodes and connections) in the detailed\n&gt; view.  It is clear that some of the top-rated images are relatively\n&gt; the most complex.  For example this &quot;planet&quot; has almost 500\n&gt; connections: http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=5776\n&gt; \n&gt; I think what people appreciate is (1) being able to recognize the\n&gt; image as something familiar, (2) complexity, (3) regularity.\n&gt; Interestingly, 2 and 3 are in conflict, which means you don&#39;t want too\n&gt; much of either (e.g. total irregularity means high complexity).  So I\n&gt; would say that there is some minimum level of complexity when things\n&gt; become compelling, and that beyond that other factors come into play.\n&gt;  Still, we may see a new order of complexity evolve if we wait long\n&gt; enough that is even more impressive.\n&gt; \n&gt; About the custom products: This option is not popular at all.  People\n&gt; are simply not buying products based on these images.  That&#39;s okay to\n&gt; me because I like to show people the custom products option more\n&gt; because of the *ideas* it generates rather than to make money: People\n&gt; start to see the commercial potential of interactive evolution.  But\n&gt; the use of the option itself has been disappointing so far.  We do not\n&gt; know why that is.  Perhaps people don&#39;t realize it&#39;s available, or\n&gt; perhaps they are concerned with quality like you.  Or maybe they are\n&gt; waiting for the holidays :)  But I do think it&#39;s important to think\n&gt; about what it would take to get people to buy evolved products.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did buy a shirt and a mug myself with Picbreeder images on them\n&gt; before we made the custom products option available to see what it\n&gt; would be like.  The quality was good in my opinion.  Zazzle gets\n&gt; ultra-high-resolution versions of the images (because CPPNs are in\n&gt; effect infinite resolution we can send them to Zazzle at any\n&gt; resolution) so they come out nice.  The images were properly\n&gt; integrated with the materials and haven&#39;t faded.  I am thinking of\n&gt; buying other stuff too.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jeffreyclune&quot; &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hi Ken-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, how is the picbreeder site coming? It appears to\n&gt; me that there is a\n&gt;&gt; sustained level of activity, but I was wondering if you guys have\n&gt; looked at the stats lately.\n&gt;&gt; Do you know about how many people actively use the site on a daily\n&gt; basis? Is use of the\n&gt;&gt; site growing, steady, or did it see and early spike and is now\n&gt; trailing off?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I also recall that in early discussions of this site, you were\n&gt; curious to see if pictures would\n&gt;&gt; become much better as the complexity of the networks grew due to the\n&gt; many increased \n&gt;&gt; generations that would be made possible by an active user base. Have\n&gt; you found that \n&gt;&gt; there is, say, a correlation between genome complexity and some\n&gt; success criteria (e.g.\n&gt;&gt; rank or num_branches)?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The ability to purchase images on stuff like shirts and mugs is also\n&gt; cool. Have you found\n&gt;&gt; that a lot of people are doing that? Also, I am thinking of doing so\n&gt; myself. Is the quality\n&gt;&gt; pretty high? For example, does your firefly look good on a mug?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The reason I am asking is mostly curiosity. I am interested to know\n&gt; how much the general\n&gt;&gt; public gets...and stays...engaged in these types of very cool,\n&gt; social, web 2.0 experiments.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
