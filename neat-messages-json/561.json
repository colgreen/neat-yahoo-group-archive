I think you have a major advance here.\n\nI have a couple of suggestions.  In line with the excellent idea of \nletting the &quot;eye&quot; rotate itself, you can add one more decision, and \nlet the eye perform an out-of-plane 180 degree &quot;flip&quot;.  This would be \nfor right/left symetry which is also possesed by the playing field.  \nTo express it another way, the game initially has 8-fold symetry.  \nRotation in the plane captures only 4-fold symetry.  When you look at \na go board you can imagine viewing it from any of the four sides, but \nyou can also flip it upside down in your mind.  Your roving eye could \ndo the same thing.\n\nAnother suggestion is to add a slight degree of randomness to GnuGo.\nMany Faces, another well-known Go program has it.  All it takes is, \nwhen there are multiple moves with almost the same value, you pick \none at random, perhaps with higher probability for the best one, if \nthere is a unique best one.   \n\nBTW, GnuGo 3.5.4 is available now, and is considerably stronger than \n3.2.\n\nOnce your program gets about as good as GnuGo, you will have to have \nit play against people, or do a tournament, or both.  Of course, you \ndon&#39;t have to wait until then.\n\n\n"}}
