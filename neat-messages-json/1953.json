I&#39;m surprised you&#39;ve only found journals\nor conferences accepting up to 4 pages.  What journals and conferences\nwere you looking at?\n\nAs far as I know, almost every journal and/or conference I&#39;ve seen\naccepts longer papers than that.  Most conferences, such as GECCO\naccept 8 page two-column formatted papers.  Journals usually accept\npapers up to 40 or so pages long.  For example, your topic would go\nnicely in Evolutionary Computation journal, Artificial Life journal,\nor IEEE Transactions in Evolutionary Computation.  It may also fit in\nmore general ML journals such as JRML.  There should be plenty of\nvenues to which you can submit.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Chris Christenson &lt;cpchristenson@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve recently completed my Master&#39;s Thesis on the\n&gt; evolution of learning neural networks.  I am currently\n&gt; searching for a journal or conference to submit it to.\n&gt;  The problem is that I can&#39;t seem to find journals\n&gt; that accept papers longer than 4 pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone heard of any journals or conferences\n&gt; accepting long papers?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -Chris Christenson\n\n\n\n"}}
