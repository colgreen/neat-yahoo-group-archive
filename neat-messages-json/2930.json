They would a=\r\nll do nothing and get zero fitness, \nwasting a generation.  So certainly pe=\r\nrturb the weights of the \ninitial generation before starting evolution.\n\nke=\r\nn\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stevewaits&quot; &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) As I under=\r\nstand it, (fully connected) NEAT starts out with \n&gt; &gt; just one bias node - =\r\n is that right?\n&gt; \n&gt; NEAT only ever uses one bias node.  There&#39;s no point i=\r\nn having \nmore \n&gt; than one.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Would there be any advantage in addin=\r\ng a feature where NEAT\n&gt; &gt; could mutate node types from hidden to bias - i.=\r\ne. to increase \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  overall chances of more links from bias nodes bein=\r\ng created ?\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know, but I doubt, you&#39;d find any advantage in evo=\r\nlving \nnode \n&gt; types in that manner.  It seems destructive to the network.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;d like to increase the chance of more links from the bias \n&gt; no=\r\nde, then you can simply do that in your mutation code.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)Lastly, (th=\r\nere may be no right answer to this one, but if \nthere \n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; conventio=\r\nn in NEAT I would like to follow it) If I start with an\n&gt; &gt; initial  popula=\r\ntion of genomes, each fully connected to the \noutputs,\n&gt; &gt; then perturb the=\r\n weights, before dong any crosssover/mutations - \nis\n&gt; &gt; that population at=\r\n that stage referred to as generation zero or\n&gt; &gt; generation one?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nah.=\r\n.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about this in your implementation.  There \nare \n&gt; consi=\r\nderably more difficult problems to solve.  For example, I&#39;m \n&gt; finding that=\r\n Ken&#39;s papers leave out quite a few implementation \n&gt; details, and that ult=\r\nimately you&#39;ll have to look at his code to \n&gt; derive the entire algorithm.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; NEAT is a wonderful invention - it&#39;s just not completely \ndocumented. =\r\n \n&gt; I&#39;m working toward that documentation goal myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
