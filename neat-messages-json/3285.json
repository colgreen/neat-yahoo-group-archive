The\n&gt; first dimension is the =\r\nround, the second dimension is the player \nwho took\n&gt; the action, and the 3=\r\nrd dimension is the action taken (bet/fold)\n&gt; b) The output is the cell in =\r\nthe second substrate for the player \nand round\n&gt; that we&#39;re interested in t=\r\nhat has the highest activation\n&gt; c) The hypercube inputs would be the coord=\r\ninates of each substrate. \nMaybe we\n&gt; use 10 inputs in total (2 from, 2 t f=\r\nor the first substrate, 3 \nfrom, 3 to\n&gt; for the second substrate).\n&gt; d) The=\r\n output is interpreted as you said: the weight of the \nconnection\n&gt; between=\r\n the substrate nodes specified in the input\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that this is just one=\r\n possibility of how to set this up.

Inputs: The cards you can \nsee,\n&gt; &gt; and the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; player actions you observe. Outputs: The action you want to \ntake in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding placing the card inputs &quot;behin=\r\nd&quot; the action inputs: I \nwas\n&gt; &gt; thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about maybe doing something=\r\n like putting the cards at some layer\n&gt; &gt; that would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a 0 coordin=\r\nate and the actions at some layer that would \nhave a\n&gt; &gt; 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinate=\r\n to facilitate a kind of &quot;one-hot&quot; encoding in the \nCPPN.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The o=\r\nther alternative I was thinking about was placing it in a\n&gt; &gt; completely\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; different coordinate space. That is, let&#39;s say that the cards \nare\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nplaced on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a 2D substrate. Normally, that would mean two inputs and tw=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; outputs for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CPPN. In this case, I was thinking about two se=\r\nparate \nsubstrates,\n&gt; &gt; which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would mean a 4-input, 4-output CPPN. Of=\r\n those 4 inputs, only 2\n&gt; &gt; would be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; active for each substrate, and o=\r\nnly two of the outputs would be\n&gt; &gt; respected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (although I suppose you=\r\n could loosen that restriction).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On 5/15/07, afcarl2 &lt;a.carl@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To facilitate the responses to this question, could =\r\nyou give \nan\n&gt; &gt; example\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with more specific definition as to the su=\r\nbstrate and \nhypercube\n&gt; &gt; inputs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and outputs?
