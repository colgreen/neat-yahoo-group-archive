I am not sure if that is bad or good. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In a generational novelty search in particular, it may be =\r\nwise to reduce selection pressure or increase the number of nearest neighbo=\r\nrs considered in calculated novelty. The reason is that unlike in the stead=\r\ny state variation, where the novelty of an individual will smoothly vary ov=\r\ner time (as individuals are replaced individually), in a generational model=\r\n, the novelty of an individual can change abruptly over generations (what i=\r\ns novel one generation may not be novel even the next generation). To provi=\r\nde a smoother gradient, it may thus be important to reduce novelty pressure=\r\n (e.g. by decreasing the greediness of the search through the survival thre=\r\nshold or however you are applying pressure, or by increasing the size of th=\r\ne neighborhood considered for calculating novelty, which may also smooth no=\r\nvelty calculations).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I hope you find this response info=\r\nrmative, while novelty search is viable whether it is generational or stead=\r\ny-state, there are some factors that may increase its performance when spec=\r\nializing the algorithm to generational or steady-state evolutionary algorit=\r\nhms in particular.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Joel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.cole=\r\nman@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I have a question about implementing novelty search in a generational=\r\n GA.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In &quot;Abandoning Objectives: Evolution through the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Search for Novelty Alone&quot; (Lehman and Stanley, 2011, pg 13=\r\n), it suggests&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that it&#39;s necessary (or at least a good id=\r\nea) to determine the novelty of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; an individual against the arc=\r\nhive and the (entire) current population.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#3=\r\n9;m wondering why this is better than the following approach:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n for (individual I in population)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   N =3D novelty of I measur=\r\ned against archive&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   if (N &gt; threshold)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\nadd I to archive&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is, if you iterate throu=\r\ngh the population, adding individuals to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; archive as you g=\r\no, then is this equivalent (or a reasonable approximation)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to=\r\n checking each individual against the entire population and the archive?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If not, why not?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance=\r\n for any assistance! :)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nOliver&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt; T: 0421 972 953 | E: oliver.colem=\r\nan@ | W: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://ojcoleman.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://ojcolema=\r\nn.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n =\r\n   &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(255,255,255);min-height:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b5d57c85460e204ded4ac7d--\r\n\n"}}
