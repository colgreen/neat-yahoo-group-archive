It has some relation to Evolution Strategies \n(popular in Germany)=\r\n that customarily evolve a mutations parameter \nwith each gene.  That appar=\r\nently has shown some benefit, but I don&#39;t \nthink it&#39;s been a panacea.  The =\r\nmeta-ness of the approach seems to \ncancel out somewhat the benefits of all=\r\nowing evolution to figure out \nwhere the flexible bits are.  But I have to =\r\nagree with the sentiment \nthat as networks get bigger and bigger, the idea =\r\nof perturbing all \nthe weights little random amounts seems to make less sen=\r\nse.  \n\nThere is no better illustration of this phenomenon than Mattias&#39; \nGe=\r\nnetic Art program.  At first, when you click on simple pictures \nyou get ch=\r\nildren that largely look similar.  But then, many \ngenerations later when c=\r\nomplex networks are generating the pictures, \nyou&#39;re lucky to get one child=\r\n that looks reminiscent of its \nparents.  That just goes to show, something=\r\n is going very wrong with \nthe mutation scheme on those complex networks.  =\r\n\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi=\r\n Mattias,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mattias Fagerlund wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;For Delphi Neat, I used a=\r\nn &quot;optimized&quot; version of exp, because it \nwas\n&gt; &gt;significantly faster. What=\r\n I didn&#39;t know was that it wasn&#39;t as \naccurate.\n&gt; &gt;That exp function totall=\r\ny killed the effectiveness of NEAT, and \nit took me\n&gt; &gt;days before I realiz=\r\ned it was the exp function that was causing \nthe\n&gt; &gt;problems...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Yeh and the more complex a system becomes the more difficult it is \nto \n&gt; =\r\nfind bugs. Extra complexity also affects readability and \nmaintainability \n=\r\n&gt; of code, which is bad if like me you want others to re-use and \npossibly =\r\n\n&gt; build on your code. It&#39;s not all doom and gloom though, often you \ncan \n=\r\n&gt; seperate out complex bits of code and place them in their own \nclass or \n=\r\n&gt; whatever, I think this know as the strategy pattern these days. I \noften =\r\n\n&gt; adopt this approach starting out with a slow but simple class and \n&gt; swa=\r\npping in something better later, that way you have the option \nof \n&gt; switch=\r\ning back to the simple class if things start going wrong!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nHence my train of thought moves \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to hebbian learning based algorithms -=\r\n the idea of connection \nhardness \n&gt; &gt;&gt;gives us something like that. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n   \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hardness, is that resistance to mutation, like preventing w=\r\neight \nmutation\n&gt; &gt;and connection splitting?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not referring to any=\r\n specific piece of research here, I&#39;m just \n&gt; thinking vaguely about the id=\r\nea of connections of varying \nhardness, but \n&gt; yes, resistance to weight mu=\r\ntation, deletion, splitting (actually \nI \n&gt; hadn&#39;t thought of that one) is =\r\nthe sort of thing I&#39;m thinking \nabout.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could see potential benefit=\r\ns to that. Would\n&gt; &gt;hardness be related to connection age, or evolved as a =\r\nseparate \nvalue,\n&gt; &gt;along with the connection weight? \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Both of =\r\nthese seem sensible approaches to me at this point in \ntime. I \n&gt; did a lit=\r\ntle bit of experimentation when I did my phased search \n&gt; experiments, Shar=\r\npNEAT has a check box that signals NEAT to fix \nall \n&gt; current connections =\r\nfollowing a pruning phase, which is closest to \nthe \n&gt; idea of age based ha=\r\nrdness (inconclusive results BTW). A third \npossible \n&gt; way is to adjust ha=\r\nrdness of connections in a genome based upon \nthe \n&gt; fitness scores achieve=\r\nd by that genome, so poor genomes actually \nget \n&gt; their connections soften=\r\ned, this is more like hebbian learning. \nDon&#39;t \n&gt; ask me how this would wor=\r\nk, I haven&#39;t though through the details \nyet!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;One interesting solutio=\r\nn would be to initialize all new \nconnections with a\n&gt; &gt;hardness of zero, t=\r\nhen let the hardness evolve freely. Evolution \nshould\n&gt; &gt;make essential con=\r\nnection hardened because mutations to them would\n&gt; &gt;decrease the survivabil=\r\nity of the species/individual...\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Actually this idea has been ba=\r\nnded around before. The idea of  \nmeta-data \n&gt; in the genome that controls =\r\nrates of crossover, mutation, etc. It \ncould \n&gt; work but I think it expands=\r\n the search space complexity \n(dimensionailty) \n&gt; and thus makes it harder =\r\nto search. Worth thinking about again \nthough.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Today, evolution fumbl=\r\nes blindly, changing everything \naround &quot;trying&quot; to\n&gt; &gt;make improvements in=\r\nstead of focusing on the weak parts of the \ncurrent\n&gt; &gt;network. Perhaps har=\r\ndness would be a way around that?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Indeed. I&#39;m not sure about ot=\r\nher&#39;s NEAT implementations but \nsharpneat \n&gt; has a type of mutation whereby=\r\n all of the weights in a genome are \n&gt; perturbed by a small amount. This se=\r\nems a bit crude to me, \nespecially as \n&gt; genomes increase in size. I think =\r\nmulti-connection mutations are \nuseful \n&gt; but this seems a little extreme, =\r\nso maybe as you say we can foxus \nin on \n&gt; certain connections.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve =\r\noften wondered what would happen if you &quot;locked&quot; nodes and\n&gt; &gt;connections a=\r\nfter they reached a certain age, focusing evolution \non coming\n&gt; &gt;up with n=\r\new structures to tweak old behaviours instead of \nevolving all of it. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; As I said I actually tried this briefly, but I didn&#39;t get too \ndeep=\r\nly \n&gt; into it. Probably because the results weren&#39;t very good, but that \n&gt; =\r\ndoesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth investigating, especially since I \nfixed some \n=\r\n&gt; major bugs since then!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Is there any research on these topics that I=\r\n could look at?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I personally haven&#39;t really looked around yet. =\r\nAnyone got any \npointers?\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
