Specifically, people wanted a page that would point to papers\nand sourcecode for GDS work, so that others could begin to play with\nthis technology themselves. The hope is that will generate more GDS\nsubmissions, particularly at GECCO 2011.\n\nI am please to announce that we have the seed of such a page here:\n\nhttp://gds.wikispot.org/\n\nPlease check it out and add to it. Hopefully with the help of the\ncommunity it will turn into an even more valuable resource.\n\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow\nHod Lipson&#39;s Computational Synthesis Laboratory\nCornell University\njeffclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n"}}
