One concern I&#39;ve\n&gt; had with SharpNEAT \n&gt; so far is that it takes far more generations to\n&gt; solve XOR (on average) \n&gt; when compared to the figures reported by others.\n&gt; Therefore I wanted to \n&gt; see if this could be attributed to a poor choice of\n&gt; parameters on my \n&gt; part or whether it might be something more\n&gt; fundamental.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far I have found a set of parameters that find a\n&gt; solution about twice \n&gt; as fast as before. So the # of gens required has\n&gt; gone from about 280 to \n&gt; about 150. This is still high compared to other&#39;s\n&gt; reports, but it does \n&gt; demonstrate that the meta-algorithm is working to\n&gt; some degree.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also wrapped up the meta-algorithm work in a\n&gt; rudimentary GUI that \n&gt; can be used to track progress, select which\n&gt; parameters you wish to \n&gt; search and define a seed NeatParameters object that\n&gt; acts as the starting \n&gt; point for the search.\n&gt; \n&gt; To keep it simple I have so far only searched on one\n&gt; parameter at a \n&gt; time, the theory being that with such a simple\n&gt; search space I can keep \n&gt; the population size low - thus keeping duration of\n&gt; searches down. Some \n&gt; parameters can also effect evaluation duration a\n&gt; lot, so I have avoided \n&gt; these so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; So basically it&#39;s so far so good. I don&#39;t expect the\n&gt; parameters that are \n&gt; found for XOR to be applicable to most other\n&gt; problems, since XOR is an \n&gt; artificially small and simple problem to solve, but\n&gt; it will still be \n&gt; interesting to see how much certain parameters\n&gt; effect a search. So far I \n&gt; have found that the rate of asexual reproduction\n&gt; works best at about 90% \n&gt; (50/50 before), and that the weight range is best at\n&gt; +-7.5 (+-5 before) \n&gt; this latter figure also effects the range of values\n&gt; used when creating \n&gt; new connections and also the initial population,\n&gt; therefore by increasing \n&gt; the range while keepig the same activation function,\n&gt; the function has \n&gt; effectively been steepened towards being a step\n&gt; function.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
