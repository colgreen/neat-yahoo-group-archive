It uses a far \n&gt;simpler body model that what we&#39;re looking at here, but the method goes \n&gt;something like this; the entire body has a central sine wave, each body \n&gt;part decides what motor action to take from that one sine wave.

I think NaturalMotion are probably doing \nsomething like this in conjunction with an initial NN that has been \nmanually created as a good starting point - that would explain why the \nlegs are flailing as they are in generation 0. This would also tie in \nwith what Mitchell was saying about the &quot;rigged&quot; physical model - it&#39;s \nnot rigged as such it&#39;s just a simplified/artificial physical model is \nmore conducive to evolving a walker.\n\nAlso this phrase on the web site...\n\n&quot;implant an appropriate brain structure (usually a neural network), and \nuse optimisation techniques (such as artificial evolution) to create the \ndesired behaviour.&quot;\n\n...suggests that they use a fixed NN structure and &#39;optimize&#39; (search \nthrough) the connection weights only.\n\nAnyway all of these &quot;short-cuts&quot; combined makes for very good results in \na relatively small number of generations.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
