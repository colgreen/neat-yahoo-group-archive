The candidate node/edge is selected with an\nuniform probability in the set of the nodes/edges that\ndon&#39;t violate the topologic constraints fixed by the\nuser (like a &quot;no cycle&quot; constraints), after mutation. \n\nSo my implementation works as you in your suggestion.\n\n--- Sandor Murakozi &lt;smurakozi@...&gt; a �crit :\n\n&gt; Hi Alex,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a guess why your implementation likes to\n&gt; create scale-free networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just checked the wikipedia page for scale-free\n&gt; networks, and found this\n&gt; section interesting:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...The mostly widely known generative model for a\n&gt; subset of scale-free\n&gt; networks is Barab�si and Albert&#39;s (1999) *rich get\n&gt; richer* generative model\n&gt; in which each new Web page creates links to existent\n&gt; Web pages with a\n&gt; probability distribution which is not uniform, but\n&gt; proportional to the\n&gt; current in-degree of Web pages. This model was\n&gt; originally discovered by Derek\n&gt; J. de Solla Price\n&gt;\n&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price&gt;\n&gt; in\n&gt; 1965 under the term *cumulative advantage*, but did\n&gt; not reach popularity\n&gt; until Barab�si rediscovered the results under its\n&gt; current name (BA\n&gt; Model&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA_Model&gt;).\n&gt; According to this process, a page with many in-links\n&gt; will attract more\n&gt; in-links than a regular page...&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If your splitting operation is applied on each\n&gt; connections with equal\n&gt; probability, then you will have exactly this\n&gt; phenomenon: nodes which already\n&gt; have a bit more connections will have a greater\n&gt; prob. to get even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; E.g. say you have some nodes and pick 2 of them. The\n&gt; first have 2\n&gt; connections (1 incoming and 1 outgoing), while the\n&gt; other has 4. Now if you\n&gt; have a 0.04 probability of splitting for each\n&gt; connection, then the first one\n&gt; will have about 0.08 prob. to get a new connection,\n&gt; while the other one will\n&gt; have about 0.16, so it will be quite likely that\n&gt; this node will grow\n&gt; connections faster (and faster).\n&gt; \n&gt; Result: nodes already having a bit more connections\n&gt; will have even more and\n&gt; you will get a scale free network quite soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you really have this situation then it is quite\n&gt; easy to avoid it: apply\n&gt; the split mutation on the network with X\n&gt; probability, and in case of\n&gt; mutation just pick one random connection.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this will help you to solve your problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; don\n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/4/07, Alex &lt;marmakoide@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I use my own implementation of NEAT integrated\n&gt; the Open Beagle\n&gt; &gt; framework.
