It still fits\nwithin my numbering scheme.\n \n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s say we use the six card deck describe above.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For each of the six positions we have 5 binary\n&gt; inputs.\n&gt; &gt; One input is for whether there is a card there or\n&gt; not.\n&gt; &gt; Another if or whether the card is face down or\n&gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; If there is a card and its face up, then the other\n&gt; &gt; three inputs are for its identity, 1, 2 or 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; So in this case, your net has 30 input nodes?  Just\n&gt; thinking back to \n&gt; our discussion of Darren Izzard&#39;s shape recognizer,\n&gt; and possible ways \n&gt; to input board states of games like Tic-Tac-Toe, it\n&gt; might be more \n&gt; efficient to only have two sets of inputs, in this\n&gt; case 10 inputs, \n&gt; only for the cards being &quot;looked at&quot; each turn.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps you could have the outputs be the X and Y\n&gt; coordinates of the \n&gt; next two choices, and those outputs could have\n&gt; connections that feed \n&gt; directly back into the input of the net (it might be\n&gt; very interesting \n&gt; to start without these connections and see if and/or\n&gt; how long it \n&gt; takes for them to develop).\n&gt; \n&gt; This would probably be a more efficient\n&gt; representation, since the net \n&gt; would only look at two positions each turn, instead\n&gt; of looking at \n&gt; every position each turn. \n\nIf possible, I don&#39;t want to build any game strategy\ninto the players.  If I told them which cards were\nworth looking at, that would be game strategy.\nNow If I&#39;m unable to evolve an ANN that can play the\ngame, then I might try to be less &quot;pure&quot; and give it\nsome help.\n \n&gt; &gt; I could reduce the number of inputs to three by\n&gt; using\n&gt; &gt; binary coding: 000 no card, 111 face down, 001\n&gt; ace,\n&gt; &gt; 010 deuce, 100 trey.  I would like to hear\n&gt; opinions\n&gt; &gt; about whether that&#39;s a good idea.  If this works\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; makes it easier to enlarge the deck.\n&gt; \n&gt; My instinct would be to not combine the nodes that\n&gt; identify the cards \n&gt; with the ones that indicate its up/down state, but\n&gt; I&#39;m admittedly not \n&gt; very experienced.  I&#39;d probably have a dedicated\n&gt; node that indicates \n&gt; card state, and have separate input nodes for the\n&gt; identity.\n\nYou may be right.  I will try different things.  I\nmight use one line for no card, one line for face\ndown, and three lines for up to 8 kinds of cards.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
