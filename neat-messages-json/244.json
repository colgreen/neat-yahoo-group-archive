I was referring to the\n&gt; &gt; phenomenon of gender, whereby the population of one\n&gt; &gt; species is divided into two groups, and mating can\n&gt; &gt; only be with an individual from the other group. \n&gt; &gt; Also, each individual carries a pair of homologous\n&gt; &gt; chromosomes, one of which came from the father and the\n&gt; &gt; other from the mother.  The phenotype depends on both\n&gt; &gt; chromosomes in a complicated way. (And of course there\n&gt; &gt; are multiple pairs of chromosomes in most species.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a good idea to define terminology fairly precisely, since the \n&gt; GA literature borrows from biology, but there isn&#39;t always a nice \n&gt; conceptual fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was referring to sexual reproduction as a mode of reproduction \n&gt; that requires two parents whose offspring are genetically composed \n&gt; of traits from both parents.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most important distinction I&#39;d make between a sexual model and \n&gt; an asexual one is that the first model employs both mutation and \n&gt; crossover, while the second uses only mutation as the primary means \n&gt; for traversing a given search space.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t put the constraints of dimorphism or gender-distinct \n&gt; organs on the definition of sexual reproduction, and I&#39;m not sure \n&gt; most biologists would either.  In fact, yeast and algae reproduce \n&gt; both asexually and sexually, do they not?  And not all sexually-\n&gt; reproducing organisms do so under the conditions you outline above, \n&gt; such as polyploidy. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; NEAT doesn&#39;t model any of that, or did I miss that in\n&gt; &gt; my reading?  \n&gt; \n&gt; NEAT does model the production of offspring from two parents, \n&gt; comprising traits inherited from both.  Topology is dominant based \n&gt; on fitness, and crossover occurs in matching genes.  I think this \n&gt; model is much more accurately described as sexual than as asexual \n&gt; (which I would be more likely to ascribe to GAs in which offspring \n&gt; are cloned from the fittest, then simply mutated to some degree).  \n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t you agree?\n\nOnly partially.  Perhaps the phrase &quot;gender based reproduction&quot; would \nbe more descriptive of what GA and NEAT do not have.  Until we are \nready to model two genders and meiosis, we should imitate successful \norganisms that reproduce with mechanisms similar to GA.  Here is \nwhere someone who knows a lot of microbiology can help us.  My \ninformation is sketchy, but I believe bacteria are reasonably close \nto GA, although with many extra complexities.  I guess the problem is \nto indentify organisms whose reproduction is fairly similar to GA.\n\nm\n\n\n"}}
