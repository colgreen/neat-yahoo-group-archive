This\nallows =\r\nvariations on an image to be generated, e.g. variations on a\nboy sucking hi=\r\ns thumb. This of course could form the basis of a\nCAPTCHA system with a dat=\r\nabase of networks each representing some\nthing (boy, girl, car, plane, etc.=\r\n) and the CAPTCHA system creating\nvariations on each of these images by twe=\r\naking the networks.\n\nIt wouldn&#39;t always work because sometimes small variat=\r\nions in a\nnetwork&#39;s inputs can result in wildly different images, such netw=\r\norks\ncan be filtered out automatically with a little thought.\n\nI&#39;m guessing=\r\n though that a Restricted Boltmann Machine could be\ntrained to associated &#39;=\r\nboy&#39; with all of the variations. After all the\nconcept &#39;boy&#39; exists in a hi=\r\ngh dimension space represened by an ANN\nand it&#39;s inputs. RBM&#39;s have been de=\r\nmonstrated to characterise high\nlevel features from sets of images exhibiti=\r\nng variations on a\ntheme/concept, such as a face or handwritten letters and=\r\n digits.\n\nInteresting idea though to use tagged images instead of warped wo=\r\nrds.\nYou could even tailor the images to a specific demographic in an\nattem=\r\npt to thwart those indian captcha companies. E.g. images of\nnational celebr=\r\nities not well known outside the US, car models, brand\nlogos (change the wo=\r\nrds but keep the font/style).\n\n--------------------\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
