I can introduce individuals one at a time \n&gt;and assign then to species.  I can spawn new species when an individual is \n&gt;too different from any existing species...\n&gt;\n&gt;\tBut the one question that is not answered is: Who dies?\n&gt;\n&gt;\tAt present I kill the least-fit member of the population.  But what is \n&gt;suited when their are species.  I see three plans:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) kill the population loser\n&gt;2) kill the species loser in the species getting the offspring\n&gt;3) kill the species loser in a random species\n&gt;4) (FOUR plans, I said FOUR) kill a completely random individual\n&gt;\n&gt;\tWhat do people think?  Ken, I&#39;m particularly interested in your take on \n&gt;this because you must have just done something similar for NERO...?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe main thing to keep in mind here is that the size of species should \nadapt to the relative fitness of the species. Now, most offspring will \nend up in one of their parent&#39;s species (or its single parent&#39;s species \nfor asexual repro), so the more parents you select from that species the \nmore offspring will end up in that species.\n\nSo what happens given each of your options:\n\n1) kill the population loser\n\nIf you kill the population loser you will probably end up killing off \nindividuals from the same [poor] species every time, which is bad.\n\n2) kill the species loser in the species getting the offspring\n\nIf you do a 1-to1 replace within species then their size will never grow \nor shrink. doh!\n\n3) kill the species loser in a random species\n\nThis may work, but it is a very indirect/rough way of maintaining species sizes and as such you may end up killing off good species if the number if there aren&#39;t many individuals within the species.\n\n4) kill a completely random individual\n\nBiased towards the removing individuals from the fittest species - which contains the lions share of the individuals.\n\n\nWhat I did in my non-continuous scheme was to calculate a target-size for each species at each generation. If you did the same then you can implement (2) but only kill the species loser of you go over the target size. Now you can also trim the species back to the target size of you want, but their size should (I think) atrophy naturally because on the whole parents are selected from the fitter species - and most offspring end up in their parent&#39;s species.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
