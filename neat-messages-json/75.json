Were they\n&gt;entirely simulated, or were you emulating robots that\n&gt;had physical counterparts (like Kheperas) that the\n&gt;neural nets could be uploaded into and tested in\n&gt;real-world environments?\n\nThe robots had hardware counterparts. The simulation of robots was \nmade by some friends in Chalmers, Sweden.\nSince, we did not have the funds to make our own robots, we could not \ntest our findings on the hardware. Also, \nsince most of our behaviors require big numbers of robots, it was not \nfeasible to make as many robots for them as well :).\n\n&gt;This is exactly the set-up Philip and I intend to use\n&gt;when we begin tackling Go.  Did you modify Ken&#39;s C++\n&gt;implementation or write one of your own from scratch?\n\nAs far as the NEAT part of the project, on a single machine goes, it \nwas mostly Ken&#39;s C++ implementation. \nBut, in order to distribute the load around on different machines, we \nhad to make modifications in the working of the algorithm as well. \nBut, the basic structure was copy-pasted from Ken&#39;s implementation.\n\n&gt;Does this mean that you used the same neural net in\n&gt;all the robots in a given population?\n\nFor &quot;homogenous beaviors&quot; (gathering, flocking, search light), all \nthe robots had the same neural nets.\nBut, for &quot;heterogenous behaviors&quot; (follow leader, predator-prey), two \nsets of neural nets evolved against each other.\n\n&gt;Good luck. :)\nThanks!! :)\n\nRegards,\n- Umer\n\n\n\n"}}
