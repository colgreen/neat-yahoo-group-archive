You should prevent that. Your initial population should not \nmutate tha=\r\nt genome when it is spawned. I mean the weights must they \nthe same as they=\r\n are loaded. Make the initial weight mutation power \nequal to 0. I think th=\r\nere is a constructor with a parameter where you \ncan specify this.
