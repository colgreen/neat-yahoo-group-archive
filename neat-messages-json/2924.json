My own regular NEAT code will have some \nproblems si=\r\nnce it was not set up to retain disconnected structure \nfrom one generation=\r\n to the next.  But the rtNEAT release contains a \nfix for that.\n\nIn any cas=\r\ne, it&#39;s fairly easy to implement in any version of NEAT.\n\n--- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Just star=\r\nt your evolution with many inputs disconnected.
