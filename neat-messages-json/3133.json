Let&#39;s assume \nthat the=\r\n way you run the sequence another time is to process all the \nrules.\n\nLet&#39;s=\r\n set the input node to 1.0 and the rest to 0.0 to start.  Assume \nthat all =\r\nthe links have a weight of &#39;1&#39;.\n\nNow, you run your sequence, we should get:=\r\n\n\nInput: 1.0\nH0: 1.0\nH1: 1.0\nO: 2.0\n\nAs you mentioned, we haven&#39;t used the =\r\nrecurrent link yet, because H1 \nwas initialize to 0.0\n\nAt this point you wo=\r\nuld apply a sigmoid activation function, but \nlet&#39;s ignore that because I d=\r\non&#39;t need it to make my point.  Now, we \nneed to run the sequence a second =\r\ntime to use the recurrent link.  \nRunning the sequence a second time gives:=\r\n\n\nInput: 1.0\nH0: 2.0\nH1: 1.0\nO: 3.0\n\nRunning the sequence a third time give=\r\ns:\n\nInput: 1.0\nH0: 3.0\nH1: 1.0\nO: 4.0\n\n\nAs you see, the number of times tha=\r\nt you run the sequence matters.\n\nIf the weights are all &#39;1&#39; for the network=\r\n you described, the \nrecurrent link works like an &quot;amplifier&quot; which makes t=\r\nhe signal \nstronger the more times it&#39;s used.\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason Gauci wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the e=\r\nxample you provided, there is only one update. As you\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, I should =\r\nhave said to imagine running that sequence a second \nor \n&gt; third time, upon=\r\n which you should see the recurrent link working \n&gt; properly, as expected. =\r\n Of course, the first time through, the \nrecurrent \n&gt; link has no influence=\r\n (since the node behind it is initially \ninactive).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, even using y=\r\nour method, you have to decide how many times you\n&gt; &gt; would like to update =\r\nthe network, and that number will change the\n&gt; &gt; value of the output.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNot really.  Using my method you only update it once, regardless.  \nYes, \n&gt;=\r\n there are cases where it will treat recurrency slightly \ndifferently.  In =\r\n\n&gt; my admittedly trivial example network, though, I don&#39;t see any \ndifferen=\r\nce.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Ken pointed out, it&#39;s just a different way of doing the update.=\r\n  \nI \n&gt; like it because it&#39;s very simple, and obviously faster than \nupdati=\r\nng a \n&gt; network multiple times.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not come from the world of Academ=\r\nia, and hadn&#39;t realized, as \nKen \n&gt; said, that the [update in arbitrary ord=\r\ner until stable] update \nmethod \n&gt; was more common.  My world is one of rea=\r\nl-time interactivity \n(console \n&gt; video games), to give you an idea of my f=\r\nrame of mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s assume we can poll a particular wireless controlle=\r\nr device at \n&gt; around 50Hz, in hopes of recognizing some physical gestures.=\r\n  You \ncan \n&gt; see then where doing a single update per sample is considerab=\r\nly \nmore \n&gt; attractive.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
