The point of having separate networks is to be able to\n&gt;  have a fixed number of inputs, which wouldn&#39;t be possible otherwise\n&gt;  due to variations in the betting rounds and the number of cards on the\n&gt;  board.\n&gt;\n\nI&#39;m not sure I completely agree with the assumption that we should be\nrepresenting the table &quot;literally&quot;.  I feel like there&#39;s simply too\nmuch information there.  Again, if we can come up with a way to\n&quot;decompose&quot; the table into meaningful vectors, I think we gain a lot\nof ground.  In short, I think the set of all data available may be\noverkill.  Has anyone really solved any problems of this magnitude?\nNot to be completely skeptical but I feel like people are\nunderestimating the amount of data available at any given moment in a\npoker game.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  I am really excited about the idea of parallelizing NEAT as a first\n&gt;  step, actually.  The downside here might be that we would be cutting\n&gt;  it close for the competition deadline.  However, I think we can work\n&gt;  on the two at the same time by using a serial implementation and then\n&gt;  later converting it over (which should be seamless).\n&gt;\n\nI should be very happy if we had something for the 2010 competition.\n\n&gt;  The first step for the poker code would probably be to get a\n&gt;  simulation engine that we can all agree is sufficient.  Most of my\n&gt;  code is psuedo-windows proprietary.  It was written with the idea of\n&gt;  scraping a poker table&#39;s screen and composing a game state from that,\n&gt;  and I didn&#39;t lay out the headers very well, so there&#39;s a couple of\n\ncome again?\n\n&gt;  things that won&#39;t compile on linux.  However, I used only STL\n&gt;  containers, so the logic should compile fine.  If you guys wanted to\n&gt;  use mine (at least as a quick and dirty implementation), I&#39;ll see if I\n&gt;  can refactor the code this weekend and upload it somewhere.  I&#39;d\n&gt;  certainly be open to a different (likely better) engine if there&#39;s one\n&gt;  freely available in C++.  Either way, please let me know.\n&gt;\n\nAs far as pure simulation of the game, it sounds fine.  Again, I don&#39;t\nthink running the game itself is the problem.  It&#39;s everything else\nthat needs to be fast (although, obviously it wouldn&#39;t hurt).\n\nregards,\n\njeff\n\n\n\n-- \n...imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &#39;This is an\ninteresting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself\nin, fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly\nwell, must have been made to have me in it!&#39; This is such a powerful\nidea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as,\ngradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#39;s still frantically\nhanging on to the notion that everything&#39;s going to be alright,\nbecause this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him\nin it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I\nthink this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.\n\n-- Douglas Adams\n\n"}}
