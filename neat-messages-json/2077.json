But it&#39;s a heck of a lot of work.\n:)  And there=\r\n are already some very good implementations of NEAT ready\nto just have fitn=\r\ness functions coded for them.\n\nI&#39;d like to make another pitch for ANJI, sin=\r\nce we&#39;re planning on doing\nanother release very soon (within the next 2-3 w=\r\neeks).  If you haven&#39;t\nvisited the site, have a look, and at least browse t=\r\nhrough the\njavadocs:\n\nhttp://anji.sourceforge.net/index.html\n\nAs Colin ment=\r\nioned, it&#39;s nice to have an IDE, and we use Eclipse,\nwhich is well-supporte=\r\nd and very powerful.\n\nAnyway, the upcoming release will have all the double=\r\n pole balancing\nexperiments, as well as all of our active vision stuff.\n\nDe=\r\nrek\n\nOn 7/13/05, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ian Badcoe wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt;       Is there any advice people have to offer if I&#39;m goi=\r\nng to start some\n&gt; &gt;serious NEAT coding?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       I want to work i=\r\nn C++ on Windows, but I&#39;ll probably want to stay away from\n&gt; &gt;platform spec=\r\nific issues like user interfaces and graphics output, so I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt;pretty conf=\r\nident I can keep away from nasty build problems and suchlike\n&gt; &gt;arising fro=\r\nm those.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Ok I&#39;m going to put in my 2cents worth on  Java/.Net  no=\r\nw so some may\n&gt; want to tune to another station for 5 mins :)\n&gt; \n&gt; A few ke=\r\ny points then:\n&gt; 1) C++, Java and C# are syntactially almost identical. If =\r\nyou can code\n&gt; in C++ you can do the other two. C# even has pointers.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n2) Nasty build problems are largely elminated by Java/.Net - if you get\n&gt; t=\r\nhe correct JDK/framework version you&#39;re almost there. In fact with\n&gt; SharpN=\r\nEAT there are no external dependencies outside of the cour\n&gt; library. I&#39;m n=\r\not 100% sure if this is true of the Java NEATs, but I\n&gt; don&#39;t recall having=\r\n any problem building ANJI a while back.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) .Net is language agnostic =\r\nand there exist, amongst many others,\n&gt; compilers for Java, C++ and C# that=\r\n target the .Net CLR (The equivalent\n&gt; of the Java Virtual Machine). Classe=\r\ns can be definend in one language,\n&gt; sub-classed in another and instantiate=\r\nd in yet another, it&#39;s so easy I\n&gt; felt like crying when I first used it, s=\r\nurely it must be a trick? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; So you could write an experiment in C++ a=\r\nnd plug it into SharpNEAT. On\n&gt; the other hand with a few minor syntactic a=\r\nlterations your C++ will\n&gt; compile as Java and you can plug it into ANJI - =\r\nobviously how you attach\n&gt; an experiment to our frameworks differs a bit, b=\r\nut not by much I would\n&gt; expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;       My coding style tends towards=\r\n object-based approaches, templated\n&gt; &gt;utilities, small classes, inheritanc=\r\ne only for clearly defined interfaces,\n&gt; &gt;STL containers (but not generally=\r\n streams), lots of asserts and code\n&gt; &gt;designed to crash rather than vaguel=\r\ny paper over errors....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Java has an assert keyword, .Net just has=\r\n a Debug.Assert method in the\n&gt; framework. But since they run in managed ru=\r\nntime environments you won&#39;t\n&gt; get any nasty pointer errors, corruption of =\r\nmemory or anything like that\n&gt; anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; OTOH, I would be quite happy =\r\nto start with a written\n&gt; &gt;specification and write it myself.  I find this =\r\nis usually the fastest way\n&gt; &gt;to get into understanding all the dirty detai=\r\nls...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Yeh, absolutely agree there.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;       What do people re=\r\ncommend?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Well obviously I&#39;m biased so all I will say is that if y=\r\nou do want to\n&gt; try out SharpNEAT then all you need is the SDK from microso=\r\nft (free\n&gt; download). On top of that you really want a nice IDE and SharpDe=\r\nvelop\n&gt; should do nicely there(again, free) - it has support for C++ coding=\r\n as\n&gt; well as C# and others. The only other issue is that there has been\n&gt; =\r\nanother code re-org since the version on sourceforge and I&#39;ve been\n&gt; handin=\r\ng out versions to people as and when requested until I get round\n&gt; to doing=\r\n a proper release. The re-org was specifically done to support\n&gt; co-ev expe=\r\nriments!\n&gt; \n&gt; For ANJI you need the Java SDK (free!) and for a free IDE I w=\r\nould\n&gt; suggest IBM Eclipse. Actually Eclipse has support for and is integra=\r\nted\n&gt; with all kinds of systems these days, e.g. I strongly suspect you cou=\r\nld\n&gt; use it for developing in C++ and C# as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
