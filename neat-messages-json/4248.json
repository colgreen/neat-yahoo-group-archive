An outsider might think our ultimate goal is to create a French\nfla=\r\ng!  I think it would be great to see such benchmarking of\nartificial embryo=\r\ngeny, as things seem to be about the same as when Ken\nwrote his paper: ever=\r\nyone is just trying stuff with their own system,\nwithout any regard to the =\r\nother systems out there.\n\nKen and I did try to do something like (although =\r\nnot as indepth as his\npaper suggests) with my 2007 HyperNEAT paper&#39;s result=\r\ns.  I built a\nprogram that let me look at the Hypercube patterns and we wer=\r\ne able to\nlearn a lot about HyperNEAT by watching how the patterns changed =\r\nover\nevolution, and were able to isolate modules that contributed to things=\r\n\nlike symmetry.  We have a forthcoming journal publication about\nHyperNEAT =\r\nin general that talks a bit about this.\n\nDavid\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Derek James&quot; &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Seeing Peter Krcah&#39;s stuff (http://=\r\nero.matfyz.cz/) at GECCO this year\n&gt; got me re-interested in artificial emb=\r\nryogeny. I went back and reread\n&gt; Ken&#39;s paper &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Em=\r\nbryogeny&quot;\n&gt; (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D121), which is a =\r\nvery nice\n&gt; paper. I was specifically wondering about the suggestions at th=\r\ne end\n&gt; of the paper, regarding benchmarks for AE systems, such as:\n&gt; \n&gt; Ev=\r\nolution of:\n&gt; \n&gt; --Pure symmetry (e.g. bilateral symmetry)\n&gt; --Specific sha=\r\npes (e.g. rings, stars, and trees)\n&gt; --Specific connectivity patterns (e.g.=\r\n for neural networks)\n&gt; --Simple controllers (e.g. for double pole balancin=\r\ng)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken goes on to say:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Such benchmark comparisons will eventuall=\r\ny make it possible to\n&gt; predict the performance\n&gt; of AE systems based on th=\r\neir location in the taxonomy. For example, one\n&gt; benchmark might be to evol=\r\nve a five-pointed star. This benchmark can\n&gt; be attempted\n&gt; with a system i=\r\nn which all the dimensions of development are fixed\n&gt; except the cell\n&gt; fat=\r\ne dimension. That dimension can vary from using only prepatterning\n&gt; to usi=\r\nng every\n&gt; conceivable form of fate determination, from stochastic\n&gt; self-o=\r\nrganization to signaling,\n&gt; migration, and proliferation. The results can b=\r\ne measured using\n&gt; several criteria: How\n&gt; fast does the objective shape ev=\r\nolve? How often and how many genes\nare reused by\n&gt; the solution genome? Is =\r\nsymmetry used, or is each point in the star\n&gt; specified by a separate\n&gt; sec=\r\ntion of genetic code=97that is, is there emergent modularity? For\n&gt; every p=\r\nossible\n&gt; setting on the varying dimension (e.g., cell fate determination),=\r\n data\n&gt; will be available\n&gt; for comparison.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds like a great =\r\nidea. I&#39;m wondering, though...what kind of\n&gt; response has this generated? H=\r\nave there been any follow up papers on\n&gt; AE systems that have tried to appl=\r\ny such benchmarks in a systematic\n&gt; way?\n&gt; \n&gt; Have these types of benchmark=\r\ns been systematically applied to the 2D\n&gt; representations evolved using Hyp=\r\nerNEAT?\n&gt; \n&gt; I also noticed rereading Sims 1994 paper that he displays hand=\r\n-coded\n&gt; examples of recognizable morphologies such as a primate hand, a\n&gt; =\r\nhumanoid form, and a tree structure. But I&#39;m wondering if and/or how\n&gt; easy=\r\n such structures arise using his encoding when starting from a\n&gt; simple cor=\r\ne structure and either using artificial selection or a\n&gt; fitness function t=\r\nailored to evoke similar structures.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
