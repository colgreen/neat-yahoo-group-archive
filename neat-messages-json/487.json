From our experience, they can be pretty\nopen about\n&gt; sharing.\n&gt;     For our virtual reality emergency department\n(www.imedi.org/edx.htm),\n&gt; after a short pitch about our project, ID said they were open to the\nidea of\n&gt; giving us their latest graphical engine (which at the time was Quake\n3 and\n&gt; cost $300,000) to build our system for free.  Ultimately, Alan\nFischer, our\n&gt; chief technical lead, decided to build his own system which is what\nyou see\n&gt; on the page.\n&gt;     Keep in mind also that previous iterations of ID software cost\nless\n&gt; (though still expensive.)  If I recall, it was $100,000 for Quake\n2, and\n&gt; $10,000 for Quake 1.  But, at least at the time, if you go three\ngenerations\n&gt; back, they release the code for free.  Given that Doom 3 is coming\nout soon,\n&gt; Quake or Quake 2 code might soon be available for free.\n&gt; \n&gt;     While I am posting to the group, I might also mention that\nanyone who\n&gt; would like to apply neuroevolution to evolving effective robotic\nnavigation\n&gt; in hospitals or using them to predict which patients might be about\nto die\n&gt; or who shouldn&#39;t be sent home, we would love to hear project\nproposals at\n&gt; the Medical Media Lab.  We fund grants and research externships\n(food,\n&gt; lodging, salary) in Washington D.C.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Mike\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Michael Gillam, MD\n&gt; Informatics Director, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare\n&gt; Division of Emergency Medicine\n&gt; \n&gt; Director, Institute for Medical Informatics Media Lab\n(www.imedi.org)\n&gt; Director of Research, National Center for Emergency Medicine\nInformatics\n&gt; (www.ncemi.org)\n&gt; Washington D.C.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chair, Web Educator&#39;s Interest Group\n&gt; Society for Academic Emergency Medicine\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
