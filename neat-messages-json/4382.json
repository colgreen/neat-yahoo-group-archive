Thanks for adding this new feature. Now it is easier to \nanalyze ge=\r\nnome complexity vs. phenotype complexity. I know Picbreeder \nis generally i=\r\nntended to be a place for fun, but adding such features \nalso helps researc=\r\nhers to understand the workings of CPPNs. You know, \nit would be cool that =\r\na whole section for research purposes to exist. \nIt may contain graphical v=\r\nisualization of the CPPNs and that thing \nwith the intermediate pictures at=\r\n each hidden node. And the God mode \nfrom DelphiNEAT&#39;s genetic art program,=\r\n too. Well it is only a \nsuggestion, in general researchers can write their=\r\n own tools, but \nPicbreeder has already a huge database of interactively ev=\r\nolved \npictures, so it would be good to be able to use that. \n\nPeter\n\n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I know =\r\nsome people have been interested in knowing the complexity of\n&gt; CPPNs that =\r\nproduce different patterns on Picbreeder.  To address \nthis\n&gt; question, Pic=\r\nbreeder now displays the number of nodes and number of\n&gt; connections in eve=\r\nry published CPPN on the site.  The detailed \ndisplay\n&gt; of any image (i.e. =\r\nwhen you click on images that are in lists) shows\n&gt; information right above=\r\n the enlarged image.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The most connections I&#39;ve seen just browsing ar=\r\nound is around 500. \n&gt; For example, &quot;Habitable Earth&quot; takes 477 connections=\r\n to represent: \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D5776\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; However, some interesting images take a lot less.  The &quot;butterfly,&quot;\n&gt; fo=\r\nr example, takes just 108: \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?s=\r\nid=3D4376\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who don&#39;t know about Picbreeder, it&#39;s front page i=\r\ns at\n&gt; http://picbreeder.org\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
