But let me first point out the different topics that h=\r\nave been discussed before because I am afraid that the arguments you brough=\r\nt forward could be assigned to the wrong topics ;)\n\nI think there are sever=\r\nal questions (or topics of interest) that are discussed here. \n\nRelated to =\r\nJeffs Paper:\na) Does connection cost represent a natural bias necessary for=\r\n the emergence of modules?\n\nI think this question is hard to answer and rem=\r\nains controversial ;) Prior beliefs can lead us to experiments that can sup=\r\nport or refuse this theory.\n\nb) When someone wants to show that connection =\r\ncosts leads to modularity, does it matter whether a bias is implemented in =\r\nthe fitness function or in the encoding *given the currently known techniqu=\r\nes in both domains*?\n\nMy impression is, that Jeff and Stef mostly address t=\r\nhis question and understand Ken&#39;s arguments as a response to this question,=\r\n while Ken argues and understands Jeffs and Stefs arguments as a response t=\r\no the question:\n\nc) How does a biological plausible mechanism for any bias =\r\nlook like? \n\nI think Ken&#39;s long answer here is a strong statement for encod=\r\nings that are able to canalize (and abandon) certain design principles and =\r\nI mostly agree with Ken&#39;s opinion related to question c. However, I don&#39;t t=\r\nhink that an artificial encoding with such good canalizing properties alrea=\r\ndy exist. So you are more arguing for spending more time in developing such=\r\n an encoding instead of investigating the influence of a bias on network fu=\r\nnction / architecture with available means. Because, when we have such an e=\r\nncoding, it might help to understand how strong a certain bias (like connec=\r\ntion cost) in parts of the evolutionary process actually is and to which ex=\r\ntent we can find modularity in the network. \n\nSo, as far as I got it, Ken d=\r\noes not say: =84use the encoding instead of the fitness function to bias th=\r\ne search towards modularity&quot; (as previous postings suggested it) but rather=\r\n: =84An encoding with certain properties (e.g. canalization) would allow us=\r\n to reassess the value of concepts like =84connection cost&quot; and =84modulari=\r\nty&quot; &quot; !?\n\n\nAnd in direct response to Ken&#39;s posting some random thoughts: \n\n=\r\nI also think that open-ended evolution is driven by a canalizable encoding,=\r\n and I think one can come up with many detailed properties that the encodin=\r\ng has to fullfill in order to be regarded as canalizable. The challenge is =\r\nnow: how to develop such an encoding given the fact that all these properti=\r\nes are emergent properties of the encoding and therefore don&#39;t lead in a de=\r\nductive manner to the particular form of the encoding? I think, we face her=\r\ne similar problems than in the lower abstraction levels. \n\nMy first idea wa=\r\ns:  let&#39;s apply evolutionary algorithms on encodings to find the best encod=\r\ning (something similar exist already for L-Systems), but how would such a m=\r\neta-language look like? \n\nI think that the idea of CPPNs represents already=\r\n a good starting point for canalizable encodings but its implementation in =\r\nHyperNEAT seems to me not to be consequent enough and looses a lot of robus=\r\ntness as for example self-organizing mechanisms (like structural plasticity=\r\n) are not implemented.  Of course, it is always easier to provide critique =\r\nthan to suggest a better solution ;-). I wished I would have more time to w=\r\nork on these things on my own. \n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n\n"}}
