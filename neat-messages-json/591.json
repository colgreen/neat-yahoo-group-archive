I want to implement a system \nlike this with NEAT.  Of course there are logistical questions about \nputting NEAT inside such a system, because Hayek wants control of \nwho gets to reproduce but so does NEAT..so it would have to be \nresolved.\n\nOne thing I wonder is how the system deals with bidding \ninconsistency.  The function that is used to determine the bid value \nis potentially quite complex, meaning that a bidder that makes \nseveral rational bids can later make a totally crazy bid that makes \nno sense.  Thus, such a system can be noisy and constantly needing \nto reorganize.  How serious do you see this problem?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; At 00:11 25/03/2004 +0000, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;Ian, this is definitely an interesting topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since my interest already leant in the direction of:\n&gt; 1) how to form a system form multiple evolving components\n&gt; 2) how to structure that system for maximum evolvability\n&gt; I found Hayek very interesting.  It has a couple of holes in it, \nbut I \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t want _all_ the good work to be already done :)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   In the Hayek system, is\n&gt; &gt;there a difference between training and testing?  The way you\n&gt; &gt;described it, it sounds like it i always training, so there is \nalways\n&gt; &gt;a chance of a mutant making a bid.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s no probability in the decision to make a bid, it&#39;s a \ndeterministic \n&gt; outcome of the individuals response to its input.  The authors \nreport on \n&gt; systems using the bids to form a probability distribution with \npoor results.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the examples that they&#39;ve documented bidding mostly (if not \nalways) \n&gt; takes the form of a yes/no decision whether to make a fixed bid.  \nThe bid \n&gt; size is a simple mutatable property of the individual.  The \ndecision \n&gt; whether to bid or not tends to be from quite simple forms of \npattern matching.\n&gt; \n&gt; Neither the fixed bid, nor the pattern matching is part of the \nbasic \n&gt; concept, however.  I think they were just simple approaches taken \nbecause \n&gt; they suited the problems studied.  I have been assuming that when \nI get \n&gt; around to try a similar approach, I will treat the bid as a \ngeneral output \n&gt; from the individual (I&#39;m starting with GP, but ultimately I plan \nto support \n&gt; GP and ANN individuals in the same system, so this output might be \nderived \n&gt; internally in a few different ways).\n&gt; \n&gt; Since learning only occurs via the creation and destruction of \nindividuals, \n&gt; training can be halted merely by suppressing these activities.  \nBids would \n&gt; still act to select the next active individual, but there would be \nno need \n&gt; to actually transfer the funds (although if you did, it might form \nuseful \n&gt; performance tracking data).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Or does the probability go down\n&gt; &gt;for some reason?  I guess I should go read the paper...\n&gt; \n&gt; They&#39;re not too long and easy to read....\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian Badcoe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n"}}
