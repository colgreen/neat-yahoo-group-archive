I say \nthis because networks usually do not utilize the full precision of \nthe continuum from 0 to 1 on the outputs.  For example, in robot \nduel most of the output was either 1 or 0.  When something in the \nmiddle was output it tended not to be precise.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kalmantech&quot; &lt;kalmantech@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Has any research on NEAT performance verse float precision\n&gt; been done?
