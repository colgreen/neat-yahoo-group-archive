We have a graphical game engine that is working for us\nfor now, but we are starting to think more long-term about the right\nengine for the future.  I wonder if anyone here knows any way to \nlicense or obtain an RTS-style game engine from any company or\norganization?  There are several first-person-shooter style engines\navailable, but it&#39;s much harder to find an RTS engine.  Any\nsuggestions would be apprecated!\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
