But several years ago I was asked\n&gt;whether NEAT could run in a world with no overseer.  In other words,\n&gt;does NEAT require a &quot;global observer&quot; on top the the system to make\n&gt;sure everything happens correctly.  An example of a world without an\n&gt;observer is one with a bunch of autonomous robots, each with their\n&gt;own genome and NN, but nothing else to decide anything about who\n&gt;should mate with whom, how many offspring, etc..\n&gt;\n&gt;Obviously, a world like that would not allow the usual NEAT\n&gt;algorithm, or even rtNEAT, but the question was really about\n&gt;historical markings.  The person was making the point that the\n&gt;historical markings would totally fail in that scenario, because\n&gt;there can be no global counters.  So the bots couldn&#39;t even mate\n&gt;with a NEAT-like crossover.\n&gt;\n&gt;But we noticed that there is a simple solution to that problem: Just\n&gt;assign totally random innovation numbers from a large range.  The\n&gt;chances that two genes get the same random number is low enough that\n&gt;it shouldn&#39;t be disruptive.  Genes could still be lined up by their\n&gt;innovation numbers even though the numbers would no longer reflect\n&gt;historical order.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, the reason I mention it is because *that* system is what I&#39;d\n&gt;really call &quot;arbitrary&quot; labeling.  I don&#39;t think it buys anything\n&gt;useful in a normal global-observer scenario though.\n\nThis is actually what I originally intended arbitrary labelling for.\n\nIn more advanced cases the distinction between the label on the gene \n(innovation num) and the data it read/writes (SLEAT-style fID) can get a \nbit blurred anyway...  e.g. if Gene A wants to read &quot;output from any gene \nof type XXX&quot; then functionally, that might equate to &quot;any data labelled \nXXX&quot; or it might not...\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
