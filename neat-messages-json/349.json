If you took this definition\nliterally, you wouldn&#39;t say a toy poodle is a result\nof evolution.\n\nIt&#39;s best to look for definitions in actual biology\ntexts (like Campbell&#39;s).  It&#39;s a pretty complex\nconcept, and most dictionaries have done a poor job\ndefining it.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s a trivial point, but is random selection still\n&gt; selection?  Is there any\n&gt; difference between not having a fitness function,\n&gt; and having a random fitness function?\n\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s a trivial point...I think it&#39;s a\ngood one.  In fact, the word &quot;selection&quot; is probably\nan unfortunate choice, since it connotes intent.\n\nI think the important distinction to be made is that\nwith natural selection, some individuals survive\nbecause they&#39;re better suited to the\nenvironment...there&#39;s a correlation between some\ninherent property of the individual and its survival. \nBut if survival is purely random, there&#39;s no\ncorrelation between life/death and any inherent\nproperties of the individual.  I wouldn&#39;t call that\n&quot;selection&quot; (since no attributes are being selected\nfor...I&#39;d guess philosophers and philologists could\nargue about this all day, though), and I wouldn&#39;t call\nit a &quot;fitness function&quot; (because there&#39;s absolutely no\ncorrelation between survival and fitness).\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
