Are you hinting at some higher\n&gt;level representation of the game where rotation is factored out.\n&gt;Interesting, but if I have to construct complex representation models\n&gt;for every problem I approach, then that takes a lot of the fun out of\n&gt;the idea that I can just throw together a reasonably simple/sensible\n&gt;model and go do something else while NEAT does the hard work for me!\n\nSort of.  All I really mean is that all rotations and transforms of a board \nare actually identical and have the same correct move.  So there is no need \nfor your net to learn them each separately.  I&#39;ve need doing to analysis of \nTTT and to avoid processing identical boards twice I&#39;ve simply:\n\n1) define each board as a base-3 code number (top-left is first digit, \ntop-middle is second..., empty = 0, cross = 1, naught = 2)\n2) when a board appears calculate than number for each of its 8 transforms\n3) then file and process the board only under the _lowest_ of those codes\n\nSo the simplest way I would remove mirroring and rotation from a network&#39;s \nconsideration would be just to do the same thing.  Always transform the \nboard to its lowest coded variant before showing it to the network.  Of \ncourse, this is assuming your networks are state-driven off only the \ncurrent board and don&#39;t remember their previous moves...\n\n&gt; &gt;Damn, you motivated me, I want to work on this now!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Sorry.\n\nThat&#39;s not a bad thing :)\n\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;d like to work in C++, what NEAT version would be best.  Just scanning\n&gt; &gt;the list there&#39;s Ken&#39;s and Mat&#39;s.  I&#39;m generally on Windows, OTOH I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;especially care about graphics for this, so....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;Hey look, I just spent a day of my life chasing correct combinations of\n&gt;unix packages to build mono, which just re-affirms my faith in Java and\n&gt;.Net - you can actually get on and do what you want to do, instead of\n&gt;scanning google for references to some obscure error from a makefile or\n&gt;config script! [takes deep breath... and relax]  ;)\n\nNot sure I follow you here.  But C++ is my language and if I were to switch \nto another I would probably want something really different like python or \nlisp....\n\n[...]\n\nAnother angle is that my (brief) studies show only 746 unique boards that \ncan come up in TTT.  135 of them are winning positions and 3 are stalemates \n(that seems low, I&#39;ll check it later) so that leaves only 608 that the \nnetwork needs to generate a move for.  And there is one or more correct \nanswer(s) for each (at least if we include &quot;resign&quot; for those where we know \nwe already lost).  So how about ordering those 608 in reverse order of how \n&quot;simple&quot; they are to answer and then just testing the network against each \nof those in order, the score being the number of boards the network gets \nthrough before giving a wrong answer.\n\nI know this may not seem in the spirit of what you&#39;re after.  e.g. just \nchasing the perfect game and ignoring any question of alternative \nstrategies along the way, but the fact that it would be possible to chase \nthe perfect game in this way might suggest that there may be no alternative \nstrategies to find.  e.g. that the game is too simple...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
