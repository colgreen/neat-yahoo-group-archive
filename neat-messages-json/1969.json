It went very well indeed and I&#39;ve put it online now\ns=\r\no anyone who is interested can check it out at:\n\nhttp://www.redcrocodile.ne=\r\nt/source/\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated, but don&#39;t forget that=\r\n I&#39;m\nstill relatively new to the field of NE :)\n\n(2) Right, so after this l=\r\nast 3 months of work (and ~6 months of\nresearch) I am seriously thinking ab=\r\nout continuing on studying\ncomputational neuroscience and the many topics t=\r\nhat Ken and his\ncolleagues have been working on: intelligent systems, NE, A=\r\nE, plastic\nsynapses, and modular NN design along with heterogeneous NN desi=\r\ngns\nsuch as gas nets (which I know very little about at the moment).  The\nw=\r\nork/research that I would do would be applied to autonomous agents\nusing en=\r\nvironments/scenarios from video games as testbeds.  The entire\nfield fascin=\r\nates me and has done so for a significant amount of time.\n The reasons behi=\r\nnd such contemplations are numerous and well thought\nout, but I won&#39;t dwell=\r\n on them any further for the moment.\n\nSo, now that I have a BSc (Hons) in C=\r\nomputer Games Technology, my\nquestion to the group is where I should go fro=\r\nm here.  If I continue\nwith education, the goal at the end of the journey w=\r\nill be a PhD.  No\ndoubt about it.  I read Julian&#39;s post about the Universit=\r\ny of Sussex\nand that appears to be a MARVELOUS institute for such studies, =\r\nbut I\nam curious to know if anyone else has any recommendations.  Quick\ninf=\r\no: Canadian student willing to study anywhere (on a reasonable\nbudget).  Ad=\r\nditionally, I should be receiving a first class degree\n(knock on wood).\n\n(3=\r\n) I am unsure as to whether or not it is necessary to get an MSc\nbefore get=\r\nting a PhD.  I am 27 now (took several years off to work\nbefore going to Un=\r\niversity) and would rather not spend a year doing an\nMSc if it is not neces=\r\nsary.  Then again, I know very little about this\nissue.  What are people&#39;s =\r\nopinions about this?\n\n(4) I am not rich.  Any universities that offer the p=\r\notential for paid\ndiscussion/assistant positions while studying are going t=\r\no have to be\ntops on my list.  Is this something that I might expect from\nU=\r\nniversities or not?\n\nAgain, I am very na=EFve when it comes to post graduat=\r\ne studies so any\ninformation that anyone may offer would be greatly appreci=\r\nated.\n\nThanks so much for all your help so far and I look forward to readin=\r\ng\nyour responses to this post.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Frayn\n\n\n\n\n"}}
