Anybody have any feedback?\n&gt;\n&gt;First, I can settle for a fixed-enlargement scale.  I didn&#39;t want to,\n&gt;but I really want a better enlargement method, even if it isn&#39;t able\n&gt;to do arbitrary scale.  Now, having fixed-position outputs, the\n&gt;problem is reduced to a classification problem.  &quot;Should this pixel be\n&gt;above or below the center?&quot;  Easily solved, except for the BILLIONS of\n&gt;training samples...\n\nI can&#39;t work out what you meant by &quot;above or below the center&quot;?  Surely \nit&#39;s not classification, it&#39;s function fitting?  Unless it&#39;s in black and \nwhite?\n\n&gt;Second, to get an idea of how many hidden nodes I will need, I can\n&gt;evolve for the normal input nodes, but with only one output node.\n&gt;However many hidden nodes it takes for one, that&#39;s how many I start\n&gt;with for trying to evolve the final solution.\n\nI think you need to give a brief summary of what experiment you&#39;re \nimagining now, because I cannot follow you.  Surely there&#39;s only ever one \noutput node (because you run the network once for each pixel you are asking \nabout...)\n\n&gt;Third, this is not a controller, it is a classification problem.  So,\n&gt;I can (perhaps) take some shortcuts where connectivity is concerned.\n&gt;Instead of splitting one connection and then adding more connections\n&gt;later, I can add a node that is pre-connected to all inputs and all\n&gt;outputs, but with nearly 0 weights.  Then, it only has to optimize the\n&gt;weights.  Except then I have to decide if a new node adds to the first\n&gt;hidden layer or a second (or a third).  Hmm...\n\nExcept for connections between hidden nodes?\n\n&gt;Any other ideas?\n\nI need a bit more explanation, I think.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re still going on \nwith it, however.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
