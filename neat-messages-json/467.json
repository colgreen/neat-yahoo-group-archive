That is, if I am\nunderstanding correctly, your code on its own does evaluations until\nit establishes that there have been enough to send the resulting\nfitness values to NEAT to create the next generation.  Is this the\nright idea?\n\nSo the point of the algorithm below is just to make sure evaluation\nhas stabilized after some # of iterations, at which point you would\nput on the breaks and send it to NEAT, right?\n\nI think the idea makes sense...assuming that noise in the statistics\ndoes not make this methodology return misleading results.  For\nexample, a network might get the first 10 right and the remaining\n10,000 wrong, whereas its peers may get the first 10 wrong and the\nremaining 10,000 right, in which case, if say 5 iterations of no\nchange was your stopping criteria, you would assess the significantly\nworse network as better.\n\nken\n\n&gt; \n&gt; count = 0;\n&gt; for_each_species...\n&gt; {\n&gt;   sort_by_fitness( species );\n&gt;   breeders = breed-percent * species.members.count;\n&gt;   for ( i = 0 ; i &lt; species.members.count ; i++ )\n&gt;   {\n&gt;     if ( i &lt; breeders )\n&gt;     {\n&gt;         if ( ! member.will_breed )\n&gt;         {\n&gt;            member.will_breed = TRUE;\n&gt;            count++;\n&gt;         }\n&gt;     }\n&gt;     else\n&gt;       if ( member.will_breed )\n&gt;       {\n&gt;         member.will_breed = FALSE;\n&gt;         count++;\n&gt;       }\n&gt;   }\n&gt; }\n&gt; return count;  // count will be 0 if nothing has changed...\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
