But \nI guess you still need a stopping criterion in case the network \nnever says it&#39;s ready.  Also, the complexity of representing what it \nmeans to be &quot;ready&quot; may be almost as difficult to discover as the \nsolution itself, in which case its value would be questionable.  But \nI don&#39;t know that to be the case so it&#39;s definitely worth trying.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zenguyuno&quot; &lt;zenguyuno@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robert Winkel&quot; &lt;robert_winkel@h...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I don&#39;t stabilize, should I at least activate the network a \nset\n&gt; &gt; number of times?  If I only activate the network once, then\n&gt; &gt; the mapping of current input to current output can only be\n&gt; &gt; very simple.  What I am thinking is that I pick a number of\n&gt; &gt; activations that corresponds to the approximate memory\n&gt; &gt; size that I am after, so that if I would like the network to\n&gt; &gt; remember the last 5 states, then I will relax the network by\n&gt; &gt; activating it 5 times for each input.  What&#39;s your opinion on\n&gt; &gt; this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I really think I have the answer you need, which is to let the \n&gt; network tell you when its done &quot;thinking&quot;.   You do this by having \n&gt; one additional output which is designated as a &quot;ready&quot; line.\n&gt; \n&gt; You start with all outputs at zero.  As soon as the &quot;ready&quot; output \nis \n&gt; high, then you are done, and you take all of the other outputs as \n&gt; your result.  High could be defined as &gt; .5.  I think this is a \n&gt; general approach that applies to many problems.  Essentially, you \nare \n&gt; letting the nework tell you when it is done processing.  I have \nused \n&gt; this approach in two programs, and it worked perfectly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mitchell Timin \n&gt; http:&#92;&#92;annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n"}}
