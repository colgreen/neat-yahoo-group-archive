I see this as trimming back the &#39;tentacles&#39; that \nhave been followed within the search space. When the search mode \nswitches back to normal the search can begin to &#39;grow&#39; tentacles in new \ndirections. I see this as distinct from a search that contains add and \ndelete mutations at every generation. Just an idea.\n\nI look forward to reading the paper.\n\nColin\n\nDerek James wrote:\n\n&gt;--- Colin Green &lt;cgreen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I had been thinking about adding in extra types of\n&gt;&gt;mutation e.g. remove \n&gt;&gt;connection/node, but not using them in the main\n&gt;&gt;search. Instead I was \n&gt;&gt;thinking of periodically trimming back the\n&gt;&gt;population&#39;s complexity by \n&gt;&gt;only allowing these types of mutation (deletion) and\n&gt;&gt;running the search \n&gt;&gt;algorithm as normal, this should work because the\n&gt;&gt;search is elitist and \n&gt;&gt;therefore we will never loose the good networks we\n&gt;&gt;have evolved so far. \n&gt;&gt;I was initially intending to do this to trim back\n&gt;&gt;unecessary clutter in \n&gt;&gt;good networks prior to performing any visualization,\n&gt;&gt;but I think it may \n&gt;&gt;be useful as part of the search itself.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Philip and I are working on a late-breaking paper for\n&gt;the GECCO conference on this very subject.\n&gt;\n&gt;Per your approach, I&#39;ve seen some use in the\n&gt;literature of networks trained with backprop then\n&gt;being pruned with a GA, and there have been at least a\n&gt;couple of neuroevolutionary techniques (including\n&gt;Yao&#39;s EPNet) that use additive and subtractive\n&gt;mutations in the search.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not to jump the gun on conclusions yet (we&#39;re in the\n&gt;middle of running experiments), but it seems that\n&gt;including subtractive mutations in the search makes\n&gt;for a slightly less efficient search, but\n&gt;significantly more efficient solutions.\n&gt;\n&gt;As others have done, we&#39;ll post the paper once it&#39;s\n&gt;complete and on its way to GECCO, probably mid-May.\n&gt;\n&gt;Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
