For example, by providing\n&gt; distance to the CPPN in the boxes domain, you get an almost instant solution, but without that it takes\n&gt; maybe a few hundred generations. So it still solves it, but it just takes longer.  But is that a good or bad\n&gt; thing? It&#39;s hard to say.\n\nI&#39;d say that the choice of coordinate system (and/or what pre-computed\nmetrics you provide) effects the quality of the discovered solutions.\nSo in the boxes domain, if we provide a length input then the search\n&#39;falls&#39; into the easy part of the fitness landscape and that also\nhappens to be a good quality solution. But if the solution is fighting\nagainst a coordinate system that isn&#39;t suited to the task then you may\nget odd or hacky solutions that don&#39;t generalise.\n\nNow you might say that a hack or cheat solution is still a solution,\nhowever, the boxes domain gives us an easy way of testing the quality\nof a solution, which is to apply genomes evolved at 11x11 resolution\non a higher resolution. If the solution has generalised it will still\nwork well, if not it will probably fail badly.\n\nHere are two screen shots of two such genomes which pass the 11x11\ntest perfectly applied to a 55x55 visual field. Orange squares\nrepresent the edges of the boxes, the red pixel is the one with\nhighest activation and the pixels shown are the output activation\nlevels.\n\nWith length input:\nhttp://imgur.com/CfjuZ.png\n\nWithout length input:\nhttp://imgur.com/CfjuZ&ot9BLl\n\nThe first solution has gone worng but we can see it&#39;s working as we\nwould expect (connect up nearby pixels) and is therefore in the right\nsolution space and probably just needs a bit more training at the\nhigher resolution to improve substantially. The second solution is\naccumulating a signal from top to bottom (if I move the large box\naround the &#39;wavefront&#39; follows it). This one is a novel solution that\nquite probably only worked because of the limited resolution it was\ntrained in.\n\nI was thinking though that the main issue here isn&#39;t ability to\nperform multiplication and comparison but choice of coordinate system.\nA better choice may have been to use polar coordinates for the\nconnection target node  (relative to the connection source node),\nwhich of course provides a length input and two angles (in this case\nof a 3D substrate). And the angles aren&#39;t strictly required to find a\nsolution for boxes of course.\n\nOr you could stick with cartesian coords but again make the target\ncoord relative to the source - this would alleviate the need to\nperform comparison (x1-x2, y1-y2, etc) to calculate connection length.\nAnd at the very least we can then solve the problem trivially with\nmanhattan distance.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
