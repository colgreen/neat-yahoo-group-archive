It is about using CPPNs to grow \nphysic=\r\nal or basically any kind of objects over time. \n\nThe problem involved when =\r\nusing a CPPN to describe a material, \nphysical objects is this. There is no=\r\n constraint in the matter that \nis available to build an object. One CPPN c=\r\nan output 100000000000 \nparts and another just one. All in the same genome =\r\ncomplexity. \nInverted &quot;images&quot; of the CPPN output can lead to infinite buil=\r\nding of \nparts. And more, most objects may just be too bizzare, like a patt=\r\nern \nof concentric circles. The search practitioner has to decide and \ndeve=\r\nlop too hard things. Like the Alife domain, where you should \ndiscard indiv=\r\niduals that do not meet the requirements for something \nthat is meanigful. =\r\n\n\nThe idea I propose is that the phenotype can be built without \nquieriyng =\r\nat each possible coordinate. The CPPN does not have to be a \nsnapshot, &quot;pri=\r\nnting&quot; an image on the phenotype surface. \n\nConsider a 2D grid where you ha=\r\nve one cell (which I call &quot;the seed&quot;) \nat coordinate 0,0. The CPPN is then =\r\nasked what to do with that cell. \nShould it divide, or change type/color/wh=\r\natever? The CPPN is provided \nwith geometric data, of course, that is the c=\r\noordinates of the \nparticular cell that is asked and the time step of devel=\r\nopment time. \nAfter that, the CPPN is asked again, but for those 2 cells, i=\r\nf the \nfirst one divides. And then for four. And eight. etc... \n\nIn effect,=\r\n the CPPN instructs a mass of cells over time (TIME IS RE-\nINTRODUCED!) of =\r\nhow to develop. A cell divides in this way. If it is \nnot completely suroun=\r\nded by other cells, choose randomly a place \nwhere to put a new cell. The p=\r\narent cell still retains its position. \nThe CPPN has the input of the curre=\r\nnt cell&#39;s position and time until \nend of development. The development of t=\r\nhe phenotype happens in \ndiscrete time steps where all the cells are checke=\r\nd at once and then \nthe phenotype is replaced. \n\nDuring development time, o=\r\nbjects of cells appear. I can confirm that \nthese objects&#39;s shapes are dire=\r\nctly related to the functions used in \nthe CPPNs. In fact, when I use sin(x=\r\n) and sin(y) for inputs, they are \nso.. cool! Like flowers and any kind of =\r\nshapes. \n\nBesides, there are no empty holes, and there is no shit like if y=\r\nou&#39;d \ntry it with the snapshot approach. All objects are just made \nof &quot;mat=\r\nter&quot;. They can be directly moved over a physical simulation or \nsomething l=\r\nike this. \n\nThis in fact brings the CPPN theory more closely to engeneering=\r\n \napplications and stuff. Also in Artificial Life. In fact my project \nis d=\r\nedicated to Alife mostly. \n\nPeter Chervenski \n\n\n"}}
