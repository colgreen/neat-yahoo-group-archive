I let NEAT\n&gt; see a picture (7 x 14 pixels) of a letter and let it choose which letter\n&gt; it thinks it is (out of 26 letters). Thus, I have 7*14=98 inputs + 1\n&gt; bias. And I have 26 outputs. Creating a connection from every input to\n&gt; every output leads to 99*26 = 2574 connections per network.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, I&#39;ve tried a method where I add X random connections instead of the\n&gt; full 2574 connections, but so far, the results are depressing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have an idea for a better method?\n\nHi Mattias,\n\nI am working on a method that incorporates NEAT but allows for reuse of\nsub-networks in constructing the solution networks. It is specifically\ntargetted to deal with some of the situations in which NEAT performs\npoorly (decision tasks with large input/output spaces, etc). While it is\nmore useful for processing tasks that can be parallelized in the input or\noutput space, it may be useful in an OCR type situation as well (which\nrelies more on combining data from disparate parts of the input space).\n\nModular NEAT starts out similar to how you describe with X random\nconnections, but these connections actually represet modules that can\nexpand in complexity and be reused across the space of the solution\nnetwork. The network grows new connections as needed and the optimal\ncombination of what modules where is worked out during evolution.\n\nI&#39;ve done some tests with board games of sizes 7x7 (full NEAT: 2401\nconnections) and 10x10 (full NEAT: 10000 connections) and the results\nappear promising.\n\nThe code is very very rough (nowhere near as documented as NEAT) but if\nit sounds interesting to you, let me know.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
