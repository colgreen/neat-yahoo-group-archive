There is a kind of &quot;law of deterministic \ngeneral=\r\nization&quot; that is useful to keep in mind:\n\n&quot;If the easiest way to solve a pr=\r\noblem is the most general way, then \ntraining determistically will lead to =\r\nthe most general solution \nwithout the need for randomness.&quot;\n\nIn other wors=\r\nds, in *some* problems, it is easier to learn a general \ntechnique than it =\r\nis to memorize a trial-specific heuristic.  Easier \nmeans basically that th=\r\ne general solution is simpler.  In that case, \neven a deterministic trainin=\r\ng regimen will lead to the general \nsolution because it is the easiest way =\r\nto solve the problem \nregardless.  That means that in such a problem you *s=\r\nhould* train \ndeterministically (or almost so) because the only thing rando=\r\nmness \ncan do is add noise to the evaluation, which disrupts evolution.  \n\n=\r\nSo it&#39;s very important not to introduce any more randomness than \nabsolutel=\r\ny necessary.  Of course, in some domains, it is perhaps \nnecessary.  Howeve=\r\nr, it is quite difficult to determine when it is \ntruly necessary because m=\r\nany times a set of deterministic trials that \nare carefully arranged to rep=\r\nresent the space of possible situations \ncan be a sufficient substitute for=\r\n randomization.  If that is the \ncase, the set of deterministic trials once=\r\n again are preferable.  \nRandomness is never a good thing unless absolutely=\r\n necessary.\n\nIn the case of learning to go to a target, it is sufficiently =\r\neasy \nthat it will probably work either way.  It is probably easier for the=\r\n \nexperimenter to do it with some randomness simply because that way we \ndo=\r\nn&#39;t have to introduce a bunch tedious hand-designed trials.  \nHowever, too =\r\nmuch randomness will indeed ruin the results because \nindividuals may just =\r\nhappen to be near the target when they are born \nor when items on the field=\r\n are scrambled, though they deserve no \ncredit.  \n\nI would set it up someth=\r\ning like NERO:  Have a location where \nindividuals are dropped onto the fie=\r\nld at random orientations yet far \naway from the ball.  Then keep the ball =\r\nfar away from where \nindividuals start.  After a certain time period on the=\r\n field, an \nindividual should be sent back to the starting point.  That way=\r\n, \nnobody can hog the ball just by sitting next to it.\n\nken\n\n\nIn neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; On 09/01/2008=\r\n, Faisal Abidi &lt;fabidi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we&#39;re trying to teach the ne=\r\ntworks is to get closer to the \nball. robocup soccer server\n&gt; &gt; (rcss) allo=\r\nws our agents to have access to relative distance and \nangle (relative to t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; player&#39;s facing) of the ball.\n&gt; &gt; With these as the inputs we want t=\r\nhe network to minimize the \nangle (0 means dead-on)\n&gt; &gt; and the distance. T=\r\nhe closer the angle and distance to 0 the \ngreater the fitness.\n&gt; \n&gt; It sho=\r\nuld be easy enough for NEAT to find a solution I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Currently=\r\n, we&#39;re running the simulation in realtime (couldn&#39;t \nfigure out a simple w=\r\nay to\n&gt; &gt; speed up game time on server end:S) with 10 players (the \npopulat=\r\nion) in the sim. Each is\n&gt; &gt; oblivious to the other, as the only objective =\r\nis to close in on \nthe ball.\n&gt; \n&gt; The realtime limit is unfortunate, but th=\r\nen the subtask of moving to\n&gt; the ball should be straightforward for NEAT -=\r\n depending on how the\n&gt; agent moves around I suppose.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every 10=\r\n0ms (once again, a realtime server limitation) for each \nof the networks we=\r\n set\n&gt; &gt; inputs and get outputs and perform the decided action.\n&gt; &gt; We repe=\r\nat the above NumActions times in EvalPop summing the \nfitness from each tri=\r\nal.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now for the questions:\n&gt; &gt; 1. On each subsequent call to EvalPo=\r\np, should we reset the \npositions (random positions\n&gt; &gt; far from ball) and =\r\nstats of the networks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeh I think you need some degree of randomness =\r\nin there otherwise \nyou\n&gt; will probably just find a solution that only deal=\r\ns with attacking \nthe\n&gt; ball from a certain angle or some other limited sub=\r\nset of possible\n&gt; scenarios. The prey capture experiment you mention actual=\r\nly tests \neach\n&gt; genome 100(I think) times per evaluation, each from a diff=\r\nerent \nrandom\n&gt; starting point, roughly equidistant from the prey.\n&gt; \n&gt; I w=\r\nould suggest you need to activate for a number of timesteps until\n&gt; (A) The=\r\n ball is reached or (B) a max number of timesteps is reached.\n&gt; You can the=\r\nn assign fitness as something like  (CONST_MAX_FITNESS -\n&gt; distance - times=\r\nteps_took). The constant term in there is required\n&gt; because SharpNeat can =\r\nonly maximise a fitness score right now, not\n&gt; minimise. So as the distance=\r\n falls you want the fitness to go up.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Why does the GenomeList.=\r\nCount vary? I noticed the same thing \nin preycapture. On\n&gt; &gt; the 2nd call t=\r\no eval pop the count will be 1 extra, and a few \nhundred gens later it redu=\r\nced\n&gt; &gt; to 1 less than the specified count. How can I disable this?\n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n&#39;s a side effect of the fitness sharing technique in SharpNEAT -\n&gt; each spe=\r\ncies is assigned a new size based on it&#39;s fitness in the \nlast\n&gt; generation=\r\n. That new size is based on a species&#39; proportion of the\n&gt; total population=\r\n size - and in calculating each species&#39; size \nrounding\n&gt; occurs. So if the=\r\n allocation was 6.5 the species actually gets 7\n&gt; genomes. Thus you can exp=\r\nect at maximum 1 extra genome per species \n(I\n&gt; think). I suppose you could=\r\n disable speciation by setting the target\n&gt; species sizes to 0 (this might =\r\nbreak the code but you can try it) \nand\n&gt; also setting a high initial compa=\r\nrison threshold value.\n&gt; \n&gt; Alternatively you could ignore any excess genom=\r\nes by assigning them \na\n&gt; zero fitness. It means you will miss the occasion=\r\nal good genome, but\n&gt; it&#39;s not the end of the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Luck,\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nolin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
