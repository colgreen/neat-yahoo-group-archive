Are you working on this in your spare time, or\n&gt;is this what you do for a living?\n\nI have done some game AI work in the for-cash sense - for instance, earlier\nthis year I had to write an agent to play any level of a GBA shoot-em-up\nautomatically, including solving the puzzles required to open doors - but\nnothing with NEAT so far.\n\n&gt;Did you attend the AI in Games Conference in Austin\n&gt;this past weekend?\n\nThat would have been a bit of a long way for me since I&#39;m in the UK!\n\n&gt;And are there any specific game domains you&#39;re\n&gt;particularly interested in?\n\nNothing specific. Each game presents its own challenges and often I think,\n&quot;this would be an interesting task for a network to learn.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt;The NEAT experiments mostly concerned recognising\n&gt;&gt;shapes.\n&gt;You say your results were interesting...what sort of\n&gt;results did you get?\n\nWell, there were two varieties of experiments I tried, although I spent some\ntime fiddling with the parameters of both:-\n\n1. A discrete grid. A shape was just a bitmap on a smallish grid (about 8x8)\nand the viewing window was a 3x3 + shape. The network could move left,\nright, up and down one square at a time. It had up to 100 time steps (ie.\nloops) to decide what the shape was. This didn&#39;t have much difficulty\nevolving, even when I inadvertently turned off recurrence! However, this\nproduced a form of network memory which Kenneth seemed quite interested in,\nwhere long strings of nodes would form a kind of short-term memory rather\nthan loops.\n\n2. A continuous space. A shape was defined by a function which would return\n1 for inside and 0 for outside for any given real coordinate, and the\nviewing window (still a 3x3 +) would see an anti-aliased view of the shape.\nThat is to say, the shape was sampled at various points within each square\nin the window and the results averaged. The network could move any distance\nit wanted each step (although, curiously, the networks showed a tendency to\nevolve towards moving 1.0 units at a time). Again, delay lines seemed to\nshow up, but although extended runs over a few days reached 90% success or\nso, I never got a 100% successful network on this one.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
