First, the distribution\n&gt; &gt; of the population was heavily lo=\r\npsided. We had a population of 100\n&gt; genomes\n&gt; &gt; and 10 species, but the si=\r\nze of species 0 was usually around 80 genomes.\n&gt; &gt; Second, even accounting =\r\nfor this, we saw better performance from randomly\n&gt; &gt; selecting individuals=\r\n for subcultures.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This makes intuitive sense to me, since speciatio=\r\nn is intended for the\n&gt; &gt; opposite of what subcultures should be doing. Spe=\r\nciation is aimed at\n&gt; &gt; grouping similar individuals in genome space, there=\r\nby protecting (with\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; help of fitness sharing) innovation in the po=\r\npulation and allowing it to\n&gt; &gt; flourish. Subcultures, however, are intende=\r\nd to create diverse groups of\n&gt; &gt; individuals in phenome space and thus pro=\r\nmote the sharing of innovations\n&gt; &gt; among the population. In this light, I =\r\nthink it&#39;s clear why randomly\n&gt; &gt; composed subcultures would outperform spe=\r\ncies-based: individuals in the\n&gt; &gt; same species, with similar genomes, are =\r\nmore likely to have similar\n&gt; &gt; phenotypic behavior and observations of sim=\r\nilar individuals really won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; help social agents outside of some minor =\r\nlocal optimization on the\n&gt; &gt; sub-policies they have already discovered.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Philosophically, I think the results are actually very encouraging wh=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; applied to human society. We show that the notion of learning only f=\r\nrom\n&gt; &gt; what those in power tell you is actually a suboptimal strategy. Rat=\r\nher,\n&gt; &gt; everyone-- rich, poor, young, old, etc-- may have something to con=\r\ntribute\n&gt; &gt; and even if overall they aren&#39;t as &quot;fit&quot; as everyone else, thei=\r\nr\n&gt; individual\n&gt; &gt; actions can still have worth and add value to society.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Specifically to novelty, I believe social transmission is crucial in=\r\n\n&gt; human\n&gt; &gt; societies. Generally when biologists study learning paradigms =\r\nin nature,\n&gt; &gt; there are a few levels of cognitive ability. In our experime=\r\nnts we were\n&gt; &gt; effectively applying an emulation paradigm, where agents le=\r\narn to mimic\n&gt; &gt; exact behaviors. Humans fortunately function at a higher l=\r\nevel,\n&gt; imitation,\n&gt; &gt; because we can observe a behavior and then acquire n=\r\new skills or talents\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; combining it with other knowledge or experien=\r\nces we&#39;ve previously\n&gt; acquired,\n&gt; &gt; resulting in an entirely new behavior.=\r\n So from my perspective, social\n&gt; &gt; learning among humans is one not a thre=\r\nat to novelty, but rather one of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; greatest sources of it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSincerely,\n&gt; &gt; Wesley\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Apr 19, 2012 at 6:48 PM, Ken &lt;kstanle=\r\ny@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Wesley, congr=\r\nats on the GECCO paper and also thanks for sharing the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; software.

Obviously some of\n&gt; that is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary in society, but it raises the question of whether societies=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transmit creativity through teaching (or at least can avoid damaging=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creativity when teaching). This question is a bit abstract, but it d=\r\noes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relate to novelty search - the kind of divergent proliferation of=\r\n\n&gt; stepping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stones seen in non-objective search is potentially inhibi=\r\nted in a\n&gt; social\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning society.

Subcultures, however, are intended to create diverse groups of&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; individuals in phenome space and thus promote the sharing of innovation=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; among the population. In this light, I think it&#39;s clear why =\r\nrandomly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; composed subcultures would outperform species-based: indi=\r\nviduals in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; same species, with similar genomes, are more likely=\r\n to have similar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; phenotypic behavior and observations of similar i=\r\nndividuals really won&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; help social agents outside of some min=\r\nor local optimization on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sub-policies they have already discov=\r\nered.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Philosophically, I think the results are actually =\r\nvery encouraging when&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; applied to human society. We show that the n=\r\notion of learning only from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what those in power tell you is actual=\r\nly a suboptimal strategy. Rather,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; everyone-- rich, poor, young, ol=\r\nd, etc-- may have something to contribute&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and even if overall they=\r\n aren&#39;t as &quot;fit&quot; as everyone else, their individual&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nactions can still have worth and add value to society.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\npecifically to novelty, I believe social transmission is crucial in human&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; societies. Generally when biologists study learning paradigms in na=\r\nture,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there are a few levels of cognitive ability. In our experime=\r\nnts we were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; effectively applying  an emulation paradigm, where age=\r\nnts learn to mimic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exact behaviors. Humans fortunately function at=\r\n a higher level, imitation,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because we can observe a behavior and =\r\nthen acquire new skills or talents by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; combining it with other know=\r\nledge or experiences we&#39;ve previously acquired,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; resulting in a=\r\nn entirely new behavior. So from my perspective, social&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; learning a=\r\nmong humans is one not a threat to novelty, but rather one of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ngreatest sources of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Wesley&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; On Thu, Apr 19, 2012 at 6:48 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Wesley, congrats on the GECCO=\r\n paper and also thanks for sharing the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; software. I do have a =\r\ncouple questions/comments:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The subculture idea =\r\nis interesting but did you consider aligning the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; subcultures =\r\nwith the NEAT-determined species divisions? It seems strange&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat a &quot;subculture&quot; could cut across species, though I suppose th=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; existence of dogs and cats in human households is sort of a=\r\nnalogous. On the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; other hand when you can actually &quot;learn=\r\n&quot; to be almost identical to another&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; species (as you can =\r\nwhen you are just a neural network) maybe it doesn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; real=\r\nly matter that much what species you started from.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; On a more philosophical level, it&#39;s interesting that teaching in ge=\r\nneral&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is a kind of convergent force towards conformity. Obvio=\r\nusly some of that is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; necessary in society, but it raises the =\r\nquestion of whether societies&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transmit creativity through tea=\r\nching (or at least can avoid damaging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; creativity when teachin=\r\ng). This question is a bit abstract, but it does&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; relate to no=\r\nvelty search - the kind of divergent proliferation of stepping&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; stones seen in non-objective search is potentially inhibited in a social&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; learning society. So it raises the question of whether you ca=\r\nn actually&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have both social transmission and non-objective di=\r\nvergence together.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, human society seems to have=\r\n both ingredients working very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; effectively together.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Wesley Tansey &lt;tansey@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#3=\r\n9;m proud to announce my first GECCO paper!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Title: Accelerating Evolution via Egalitarian Social Learning&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Authors: Wesley Tansey, Eliana Feasley, and Risto Miikkulainen=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abstract:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Social =\r\nlearning is an extension to evolutionary algorithms that enables&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; agents to learn from observations of others in the population.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Historically, social learning algorithms have employed a st=\r\nudent-teacher&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model where the behavior of one or more hi=\r\ngh-fitness agents is used to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; train a subset of the remai=\r\nning agents in the population. This paper&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presents ESL, =\r\nan egalitarian model of social learning in which agents are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; not labeled as teachers or students, instead allowing any individual&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; receiving a sufficiently high reward to teach other agents=\r\n to mimic its&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recent behavior. We validate our approach =\r\nthrough a series of experiments&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a robot foraging doma=\r\nin, including comparisons of egalitarian social&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning=\r\n with baseline neuroevolution and a variant of student-teacher&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; social learning. In a complex foraging task, ESL converges to&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; near-optimal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; strategies faster than either bench=\r\nmark approach, outperforming both by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more than an order =\r\nof magnitude. The results indicate that egalitarian&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; soci=\r\nal learning is a promising new paradigm for social learning in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; intelligent agents.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Paper page=\r\n: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D127157&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D127157&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Github repository for all source code:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;https://github.com/tansey/social-learning&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tansey/social-learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A couple of things to note here that I believe will be ver=\r\ny helpful to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone using SharpNEAT in general:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - If you&#39;re looking to do Lamarckian evol=\r\nution, it turns out to be very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy: &lt;a href=3D&quot;https://=\r\ngist.github.com/2410490&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2410490&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - We implemented backpropagation =\r\nthrough time for the FastCyclicNetwork.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Using the SharpN=\r\neatV2 that is in the github repo, you can perform&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; superv=\r\nised learning on a NEAT network very easily, enabling online&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlearning&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; algorithms to be incorporated into SharpNEAT ex=\r\nperiments:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;https://gist.github.com/2410545&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://gist.github.com/2410545&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Colin, I&#39;d love if you could take a look at the backpro=\r\np implementation&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potentially integrate=\r\n it into a future release of SharpNEAT.
