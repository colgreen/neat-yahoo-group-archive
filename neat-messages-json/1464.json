It would be nice to work in \nneuro-evolution but I really don&#39;t really know who is using it that \nmight have job openings. Just from web surfing, etc. I am vaguely aware \nthat some banks have AI agents to assist with trading - but how advanced \nare they? And then there is Natural Motion Ltd that Tyler posted a link \nto a while ago (the site with the commercial &#39;walker&#39; type software), \nthey are in Oxford.\n\nAs for me, I do software development in a small financial company right \nnow. The occasional challenging project comes my way but there&#39;s been a \nfair bit of code monkey type work over the years. Actually it&#39;s a \nregular observation of mine that the less challenging the work the more \nmoney is offered :)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
