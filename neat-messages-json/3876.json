That&#39;s perfectly aligned with my view that there is\nmore yet to ac=\r\ncomplish.  \n\nLet me respond to some of your specific points below.\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The issues you ra=\r\nise, though valid, appear disingenuous for two \n&gt; reasons. First, if you ha=\r\nd reviewed the contents and capabilities of \n&gt; the Dakota toolkit, you woul=\r\nd have discovered the issues as being \n&gt; essentially addressed. Second, not=\r\n intending any disrespect, from \n&gt; external appearances, your efforts appea=\r\nr directed in other \n&gt; directions than that of addressing your self admitte=\r\nd areas of \n&gt; concern.\n&gt; \n&gt; From a review of literature on the subject, the=\r\nre is a common \n&gt; understanding that EA is computationally expensive and sl=\r\now to \n&gt; converge, but robust for global search in problem domains with \n&gt; =\r\nmultiple local minima.\n&gt; \n\nIt really just depends who you are talking about=\r\n whether there is a\n&quot;common understanding&quot; about anything in AI.  It also d=\r\nepends whether\nwe are talking about the past or the future.  \n\nFor example,=\r\n it&#39;s often said that &quot;neural networks get caught on local\noptima&quot; (and the=\r\nre is indeed a &quot;common understanding&quot; that they do)\nbut when people say tha=\r\nt they are almost always only talking about\nbackprop, which is just one sin=\r\ngle neural network learning algorithm.\n Backprop is not the only way a neur=\r\nal network can learn.\n\nThe problem is that when we talk about methods in ma=\r\nchine learning we\noften confuse whether we are talking about a *field* or a=\r\n particular\nmethod.  In the case of EAs, you seem to be talking about some\n=\r\nexisting methods that have been analyzed (often by people who are not\neven =\r\naware of the most modern approaches) in the past.   For example,\nthe old-fa=\r\nshioned bit-string based simple EA has been analyzed\nextensively.\n\nYet as a=\r\n field, EAs themselves are evolving.  Problems identified in\nthe past are a=\r\nctively being addressed in the present and future. Some\nmodern approaches c=\r\nompletely overturn the assumptions and problems of\nthe past (and of course =\r\nintroduce their own new problems).  Check out\nEstimation of Distribution Al=\r\ngorithms and the CMA-ES:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_distri=\r\nbution_algorithm\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES\n\nWhen I look at EAs, o=\r\nr any research area for that matter, I always\nthink about what they *could*=\r\n be, rather than what they are.  And as a\nresearcher, I try to make them wh=\r\nat they could be.  To me, that is the\nexciting thing about research: At its=\r\n best, it overturns dogma.  I\nlike to view a limitation as a challenge rath=\r\ner than as a brick wall.\n\n&gt; And that is from people who are working &quot;hard&quot; =\r\nproblems (i.e. multi-\n&gt; discipline, multiobjective, non-linear inequality c=\r\nonstraints, etc.), \n&gt; at government laboratories and Fortune 100 defense fi=\r\nrms. Not dancing \n&gt; rag-dolls and computer-aided art.\n&gt; \n\nFirst, while you =\r\noften cite multiobjective optimization as a &quot;hard\nproblem&quot; for EAs, in fact=\r\n some of the most effective algorithms in\nmultiobjective optimization are E=\r\nAs.  EAs are naturally suited to\nmaintaining a pareto front because a paret=\r\no front requires a\npopulation to hold it.  There is vast literature on pare=\r\nto\noptimization in EAs, both in multiobjective optimization and in\ncoevolut=\r\nion.  Here are some seminal examples:\n\nK. Deb, A. Pratap, S. Agarwal, and T=\r\n. Meyarivan. A Fast and Elitist\nMultiobjective Genetic Algorithm: NSGA-II. =\r\nIEEE Transactions on\nEvolutionary Computation, 6(2):182=96197, 2002.\nhttp:/=\r\n/citeseer.ist.psu.edu/530140.html\n\nDe Jong, E.D. (2004). The Incremental Pa=\r\nreto-Coevolution Archive.\nProceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Compu=\r\ntation Conference\nGECCO-04, pp. 525-536. \nhttp://people.cs.uu.nl/dejong/pub=\r\nlications/gecco04coev.pdf\n\nin fact, some of the most brilliant theorists in=\r\n pareto optimization\nare in evolutionary computation.\n\nAs for NEAT in gover=\r\nnment research labs on &quot;serious&quot; problems, here is\nan example:\n\nShimon Whit=\r\neson and Daniel Whiteson (2007). &quot;Stochastic Optimization\nfor Collision Sel=\r\nection in High Energy Physics&quot;. IAAI 2007:\nProceedings of the Nineteenth An=\r\nnual Innovative Applications of\nArtificial Intelligence Conference.&#8202;\n=\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-ex/pdf/0607/0607012v1.pdf\n\nThe article itself=\r\n states, &quot;These NEAT selectors are currently in use\nat FermiLab for selecti=\r\nng collisions from real data collected\nwith the Tevatron collider.&quot;  So, th=\r\nere you go, NEAT is being used at\nFermiLab itself to select which particle =\r\ncollisions are most promising.\n\nWhen you mention rag dolls and art, you&#39;re =\r\ngiving me an opportunity to\ncomment on some of our own current research.  O=\r\nur group has indeed\nrecently produced a number of works in interactive evol=\r\nution,\nincluding dance, art, music, and particle effects.  Perhaps it may\ns=\r\neem a somewhat lighthearted departure from more serious subjects.\n\nYet the =\r\nimplications of this work are as serious as any in my view. \nAll of that wo=\r\nrk is a probe of the ubiquity of patterns and\nregularities, in particular t=\r\nhrough the theory of CPPNs.  The deeper\nlesson in that body of work is that=\r\n the very same encoding is able to\nproduce patterns appropriate to what wou=\r\nld otherwise appear to be\ndisparate domains.  The idea is to develop a theo=\r\nry of generic pattern\ngeneration and to show that patterns are interchangea=\r\nble across many\ndomains.  That insight leads to the idea of HyperNEAT, whic=\r\nh takes\nagain the very same encoding that is producing art and music and us=\r\nes\nit to produce a large-scale neural pattern.  Therein it becomes\nserious,=\r\n because the hard problems you like to focus on almost always\ninvolve patte=\r\nrns and regularities.  \n\nIt is no accident that in building a theory of pat=\r\ntern generation, a\nnumber of interactive evolutionary computation experimen=\r\nts would need\nto be performed because understanding the capabilities of a p=\r\nattern\ngenerator require *exploring* the space of possibilities rather than=\r\n\nsimply optimizing, and humans are much better explorers than\ncomputers.  T=\r\nhe theory would never have gotten off the ground if we\nhad stuck to more tr=\r\naditional optimization problems.   Indeed, as\nfunny as it sounds, the whole=\r\n idea began to materialize only after I\nevolved a spaceship in Mattias Fage=\r\nrlund&#39;s DelphiNEAT.  \n\nTo put it starkly, without that exploration in genet=\r\nic art, there\nwould have been no HyperNEAT.  And in fact even more new theo=\r\nries with\npractical implications are coming (not yet published) because of\n=\r\nphenomena that became apparent through Picbreeder.  So you see, in\nbuilding=\r\n a new algorithm or a new theory with practical implications,\noften traditi=\r\nonal problems are exactly the wrong vehicle to discovery\nbecause they perpe=\r\ntuate the same dogmatic perspectives that already\npermeate the field to beg=\r\nin with and cause it to be staying in one\nplace.   Thus all of these applic=\r\nations are chosen with careful\nscrutiny with a sincere belief in their prac=\r\ntical ramifications.\n\nNot to mention the fact that interactive evolution it=\r\nself has the\npractical potential to change the way we do engineering in som=\r\ne cases.\n Can you imagine Picbreeder for furinute instead of pictures?  Or =\r\nfor\ncars?  Someday that may be how we create highly customized artifacts.\n =\r\n  In fact, some of the problems to which you are referring (highly\nnonlinea=\r\nr and multi-objective) may only be possible to solve through\ninteractive ev=\r\nolution.\n\n&gt; How many times has NEAT, as a monolithic approach, been cited a=\r\nnd \n&gt; successfully applied by government laboratories and Fortune 100 \n&gt; de=\r\nfense firms for these type of &quot;hard&quot; problems?\n&gt; \n\nYou can refer to the pap=\r\ner on high-energy physics at FermiLab if\nyou&#39;re interested, but I still thi=\r\nnk there is a bigger picture.  \n\nIn some ways, as researchers in AI, what p=\r\nractitioners are using to\nsolve hard problems is exactly what we *don&#39;t* wa=\r\nnt to use.  After\nall, how is anything ever going to become more powerful i=\r\nf we just\nlook to practitioners to show us what methods we should be using?=\r\n  As\nresearchers, it is our job to give the practitioners *new* options,\nno=\r\nt the other way around.\n\nPractitioners are often several steps behind algor=\r\nithm developers, and\nwith good reason.  They often can&#39;t afford to take big=\r\n risks and need\nsomething practical in the here and now.   You will therefo=\r\nre find\nthat most cutting-edge algorithms are not in use in industry or as\n=\r\ntools in other scientific disciplines at the very moment that they are\ncutt=\r\ning-edge.  Yet someone has to be developing the algorithms of the\nfuture.\n\n=\r\nken\n\n\n"}}
