These interpolations you have listed here are generally for\n&gt; &gt; interpolation between pixels when zooming in*.  Zooming-out most commonly\n&gt; &gt; works by averaging pixels in an area.  I would not normally think of it as\n&gt; &gt; expensive, but I guess it depends whether you have to recalculate it over\n&gt; &gt; and over...\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, &quot;zooming in&quot; and &quot;zooming out&quot; can be a little misleading...what\n&gt;we&#39;re basically doing is interpreting a 100x100 image as input for a\n&gt;5x5 retina.  Call it what you will.\n\nBilinear and bicubic are interpolation techniques for sampling _between_ \nthe original pixels.  They are not suited to what you are doing \nhere.  Nearest neighbour is again a method for sampling between pixels (it \njust picks the closest).  But it could be relevant to what you want, in as \nmuch as it says &quot;pick one pixel to represent the whole area&quot;.  In that \nsense it only differs from upper left in the choice of which pixel to use...\n\n&gt; &gt; Why is averaging too expensive?\n&gt;\n&gt;It is more expensive to average all the pixel values in a 20x20 area\n&gt;than to take, for example, the value of the upper-leftmost pixel.\n\nThis is true, but if you process one image for many networks and the \naveraged data remains the same for every run, then you only need to do it \nonce during start-up and the cost will be trivial on todays machines.\n\ne.g. if the objective is to reduce one 100x100 image into one 5x5 image, \nand then apply it to a couple of hundred networks, then you should not be \nseeing an appreciable CPU overhead for it.\n\n[[e.g. in this case, the only acceptable locations for a 20x20 square are \nmultiples of 20 : (0,20), (60, 40) etc ]]\n\nOn the other hand, if the exact location of the 20x20 region varies for \nevery sample point, then you need to calculate a different 20x20 area each \ntime, and the cost is a lot more. But the Kato/Floreano paper looks like it \nis doing the former, in which case the cost should not be a problem.\n\n&gt; &gt; Is it axis aligned?\n&gt;\n&gt;What do you mean?\n\nIs the square always aligned with one side along the X axis and the other \nalong the Y axis, or can it rotate?\n\n&gt; &gt; Counterintuitive at first, yes, but since the network is learning the\n&gt; &gt; sampling system...\n&gt;\n&gt;But what I&#39;m saying is that there are performance difference *between*\n&gt;sampling systems.  Each network is adapting to the sampling system\n&gt;used, but some are easier to learn than others, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m\n&gt;inquiring about.  I would expect that an area averaging sampling\n&gt;scheme would perform better than nearest neighbor, but that doesn&#39;t\n&gt;seem to be the case.\n\nYes I understood.  It&#39;s actually not so strange.  What you are comparing is \ntwo techniques which (when zoomed out):\n(i) supply averages of large areas of the image, or,\n(ii) supply a single sample from each wide area\n\nSo all this result indicates is that large area averages are not as useful \nas widely spaced snapshots in the zoomed-out phase of searching.  Since \nISRT your previous write-up concluded that the zoomed-out phase acted to \nlocate an area of interest for the zoomed-in processing.  This just implies \nthat too wide an average becomes to &quot;blurry&quot; to locate the\n\n&gt;Anyway, here is a graphic of an image, and how the different sampling\n&gt;schemes interpret the image:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/vwp?.dir=/&.src=gr&.dnm=Interpolation+Demo.gif&.view=t&.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/lst%3f%26.dir=/%26.src=gr%26.view=t\n\nYour nearest-neighbour technique has a grey pixel.  Generally \nnearest-neighbour wouldn&#39;t do that, can you post the actual algorithm you used?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
