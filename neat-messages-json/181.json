And as I\n&gt; myself have come across some solutions (to another\n&gt; problem posted\n&gt; earlier) that are equally as good but vary in\n&gt; network complexity\n&gt; (number of neurons and connections varied in order\n&gt; of tens), I must\n&gt; say that 44 neurons might be just one possible\n&gt; solution. And that NEAT\n&gt; might have missed a simpler solution earlier in the\n&gt; evolution process\n&gt; due to some reason. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, If my above statements are correct, then what\n&gt; could be the\n&gt; possible reasons why NEAT missed the simpler\n&gt; solution/s? Was it\n&gt; because that we complexified at a rate higher than\n&gt; we should have? or\n&gt; was it just because of the nature of evolutionary\n&gt; process itself? or\n&gt; was it due to some other reason? \n&gt; &gt; and what can we do about it?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I think in this experiment Mitchell did not use\n&gt; NEAT.  He just used a\n&gt; standard fixed-sized fully-recurrent network.  I\n&gt; think that&#39;s why he\n&gt; uploaded the code for this experiment- so that\n&gt; someone on this group\n&gt; might attempt it with NEAT.  It would definitely be\n&gt; interesting to see\n&gt; what NEAT would come up with.\n\nThat is correct.  I write my code in straight C, not\nC++.  My ANN has a fixed number of neurons during one\nrun of the program, although I can change it easily\nfor subsequent runs.  I tried fairly hard to evolve\n4-card players with 36, 38 & 40 neurons, without\nsuccess, but that does not prove its impossible.  They\nall surpassed the 85% win level.  My experience is\nthat its very hard to evolve to the 100% level with\nthis game and this ANN and this software.  Most runs\nwith 44 neurons don&#39;t get there.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
