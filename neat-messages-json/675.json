Ideally the cap would be related to the\n&gt;weight_mut_power in some way, such that there is room for several\n&gt;weight mutations in either direction.  \n&gt;\n&gt;For example, if the max linkweight is 3 and the min is -3, then the\n&gt;weight_mut_power might make sense at about 0.5, so that there is room\n&gt;for several increments or decrements in that range.  \n&gt;\n&gt;Here is some code to insert at the end of mutate_link_weights to cause\n&gt;there to be a cap:\n&gt;\n&gt;//Cap the weights at 3.0 (experimental)\n&gt;if (((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight&gt;3.0) \n&gt;     ((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight=3.0;\n&gt;else if (((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight&lt;-3.0)\n&gt;     ((*curgene)-&gt;lnk)-&gt;weight=3.0;\n&gt;\n&gt;I encourage anyone who is running more than a few hundred generations\n&gt;to install a cap like this.  That way, your link weights cannot become\n&gt;eventually so powerful that they overshadow the weights of any new\n&gt;links that might appear.  This may help a lot in some people&#39;s\n&gt;experiments that are going for thousands of generations or more.\n&gt;\n&gt;ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think there&#39;s already mention of this issue in the FAQ.  Looking at \nsome of the prey capture genomes from long runs (like 24hr/several \nthousand gens)  there don&#39;t seem to be any really big weights present, \nbut I don&#39;t see any reason why this couldn&#39;t happen and I can see that \nit would have detrimental effects on the search.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
