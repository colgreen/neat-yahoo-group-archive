So up+left was\n&gt; diagonal; up+down meant no net\n&gt; vertical motion; etc.\n\nAh...gotcha.\n\nPhilip and I were talking about this as a possible\napproach to a board-game algorithm...a neural net\nagent that scans the board the way your nets scanned\nthe grid, then suggests a move. \n\nWas there any research along these lines that you read\nbeforehand?  Or has anyone else seen this approach to\nboard analysis/game play?\n\nWe were also thinking about the movement for such an\nagent.  I like your representation, but we were\nwondering how it might compare to giving such an agent\nmore mobility to move across the grid (instead of\nmoving a space at a time, perhaps the output could be\na vector, or coordinates for another section of the\nboard).  We also discussed the idea of letting such an\nagent zoom in and out.  \n\nDid you toy around with any of these ideas before\nsettling on your approach?  \n\n&gt; Generally, iirc, they went orthogonally straight for\n&gt; a bit until they hit\n&gt; the edge of a shape, diagonally across it until they\n&gt; hit an opposite edge,\n&gt; then orthogonally again to another edge, then made\n&gt; the decision. That seemed\n&gt; to be the general way they did it.\n\nHmm...and what was their success rate in guessing the\ncorrect shape (I&#39;m assuming they eventually evolved to\nguess better than chance).\n\n&gt; Not other than here. I could send you the\n&gt; experiments.cpp file if you wanted\n&gt; to play with it a bit.\n\nSure...that&#39;d be great.  There&#39;s actually a &quot;Files&quot;\nsection on the Yahoo Groups page.  I don&#39;t know if\nthere are restrictions on the sorts of file types they\nallow you to upload, but it might be a nice idea to\ntry to upload it there first, in case anyone else is\ninterested in looking at it.  Assuming that you don&#39;t\nmind distributing it.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
