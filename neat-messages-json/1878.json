On the other hand, games can be tricky\n(did I \n&gt; ever mention I used to be Head of R&D for a games company?)\n\nI think I knew that somehow.  Actually, aren&#39;t you involved in the CIG\nconference in Essex in April?  We&#39;re actually going to be presenting\nNERO there.\n\n&gt; What platforms does it run on (e.g. Linux/Windows...)?\n&gt; \n\nTheoretically it can compile on anything, but I&#39;ve only seen it\nrunning well on Windows.\n\n&gt; I assume it&#39;s OGL graphics, are you using one of the open source \n&gt; games/graphics libraries?\n&gt; \n\nWe are not using open source, actually.  We&#39;re using Torque, for which\nwe bought a license.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ll be very keen to try that when it is ready.\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m just hoping we get it out on schedule!  I have definitely been\nlearning the &quot;tricky&quot; part of games development.  \n\nBy the way, we will also be presenting NERO next week at the GDC\nExperimental Games Workshop in San Francisco.\n\n&gt; And I&#39;ll be happy to help out if there&#39;s any way I can...\n&gt; \n&gt;          Ian\n&gt; \n\nHey, thanks!  Perhaps I&#39;ll see you in England?\n\nken\n\n&gt; At 22:36 24/02/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I haven&#39;t spoken much about NERO on here.  NERO is the novel video\n&gt; &gt;game we are developing based ona real-time version of NEAT.  NERO\n&gt; &gt;has a lot of features that are interesting even if you aren&#39;t into\n&gt; &gt;gaming:  you can basically set up neuroevolution experiments and\n&gt; &gt;change the fitness function dynamically in real-time, watch your\n&gt; &gt;whole population evolve at once, and even interact with them as\nthey\n&gt; &gt;evolve.  And you don&#39;t need to understand anything about GAs, NEAT,\n&gt; &gt;neuroevolution, or anything technical in order to play with it.  If\n&gt; &gt;you are curious about its progress, the website is being updated\nat:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;http://nerogame.org\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;There are new screenshots and movies.  You can also go directly to\n&gt; &gt;movies at movies.nerogame.org.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;We are hoping to release the game in a few months so that people\ncan\n&gt; &gt;play on the internet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
