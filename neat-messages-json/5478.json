Also fortunately, the video was recorded and =\r\njust appeared online at InfoQ, complete with slides shown in parallel in th=\r\ne same window:\n\nhttp://www.infoq.com/presentations/Searching-Without-Object=\r\nives\n\nI hope some of you will find the talk interesting; it gave me a chanc=\r\ne to connect a lot of different topics that normally don&#39;t go together in p=\r\nublications, so it provides a kind of unique perspective on some of the res=\r\nearch surrounding NEAT from the last few years.  Hopefully it will show how=\r\n some seemingly unconnected projects are actually closely related conceptua=\r\nlly.  \n\nOf course, I am happy to hear your thoughts,\n\nken\n\nPS Depending on =\r\nyour screen size, you may want to choose the &quot;horizontal&quot; viewing option in=\r\n the gray bar in the upper part of the screen to be able to see video and s=\r\nlides at the same time more easily.\n\n\n"}}
