Philip and I are planning on attending,\nand we&#39;re hoping to submit a paper for the regular paper deadline in\nmid-January.\n\nWe&#39;re working on fingerprint classification now, automatically\ncategorizing fingerprints into one of four classes: whorl, left loop,\nright loop, or arch (and for the five-class problem, tented arch). \nAutomatic classification of fingerprints is a pretty difficult\nproblem, and is hard to do quickly and accurately.\n\nWe&#39;re in the early stages of experimenting in this domain, but we&#39;ve\nalready evolved a network that can distinguish two distinct left loop\nprints from two of each of the other classes, so we&#39;re pretty\noptimistic.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
