That&#39;s interesting that you highlighted the fact\n&gt; that EASy is more interested in A-Life. I suppose my interests are\n&gt; starting to lean more towards A-Life as well... but I&#39;m not well\n&gt; versed enough in the subject matter yet to know exactly where it\n&gt; deviates significantly from &quot;adaptive neural networks&quot; research.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there other Universities that you feel are more in-line with the\n&gt; A-Life focus of the EASy programme?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You could also look at Simon Lucas&#39; or Riccardo Poli&#39;s groups at\n&gt;&gt; University of Essex:\n&gt;&gt; http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/lucas/\n&gt;&gt; http://dces.essex.ac.uk/staff/poli/\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; And I must of course also recommend the institution where me and\n&gt;&gt; Faustino Gomez currently work, IDSIA in Lugano:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.idsia.ch\n&gt;&gt; We do plenty of research in evolutionary computation and related\n&gt;&gt; fields, both in Juergen Schmidhuber&#39;s and Luca Gambardella&#39;s group.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I think you should not constrain yourself to English-speaking\n&gt;&gt; countries. Any good research lab will have a very international\n&gt;&gt; workforce and outlook, and the working language will be English.\n&gt;&gt; Myself, I speak English at work and (very bad) Italian in the\n&gt;&gt; supermarkets...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You should only look at funded PhD positions that pay you a salary you\n&gt;&gt; can live on. The way it works is that professors apply for grants for\n&gt;&gt; specific projects from funding agencies, and if they obtain their\n&gt;&gt; grant they employ the best person they can find as a PhD student or\n&gt;&gt; postdoc. Typically, it does not matter where you come from (though\n&gt;&gt; there are exceptions).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I did my MSc at Sussex as well, and while it is a good program, it is\n&gt;&gt; quite ALife-oriented.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Good luck with your studies and research!\n&gt;&gt; Julian\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 2008/8/12 Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mike,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;d guess there are others in the group with similar questions so I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; think it&#39;s probably useful to the group. (By the way, by &quot;Adaptive\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Networks,&quot; I assume you are referring to adaptive neural networks?)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, another option is the University of Texas at Austin,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which is where I did my Ph.D. under Prof. Risto Miikkulainen, who has\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a leading group in the area:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Another good lab is Prof. Jordan Pollack&#39;s DEMO Lab at Brandeis:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~pollack/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, Jordan tells me that he will be renaming and revamping his\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lab soon, so it will no longer be called &quot;DEMO.&quot; However, it is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; undoubtedly still a good place to be.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; There are some newer places too with groups led by new professors,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; including Prof. Bobby Bryant&#39;s &quot;Neuroevolution and Behavior\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Laboratory&quot; at the University of Nevada at Reno\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (http://nebl.cse.unr.edu/) and Prof. Josh Bongard&#39;s new group at the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; University of Vermont (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Prof. Hod Lipson at Cornell formerly worked with Prof. Pollack and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; runs the Cornell Computational Synthesis Lab:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, that lab is a focused on emergent phenomena in general, with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a broader scope than some of the others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; One other important group is Prof. Dario Floreano&#39;s Laboratory of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Intelligent Systems. This lab is in Switzerland, so I am not sure if\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it conducts its day-to-day work in English (it might), but in any case\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it is very prominent in the area:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://lis.epfl.ch/\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Not all these groups have an explicit focus on neural networks, but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; most have done some good work with them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that any Ph.D. program in North America should be willing to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; support you financially if you get in.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;frayn.michael&quot; &lt;frayn.michael@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am about to head over to the University of Sussex (in Brighton,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; England) to do their MSc in Evolutionary & Adaptive Systems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, as I am Canadian, the concept of doing a PhD there is a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little daunting because of the cost. Unfortunately, I am not aware of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many other Universities that would be interested in funding a PhD of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such research focuses (let alone would be able to comprehensively\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; support students along the way). This assumes, of course, that my MSc\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is wildly successful and I come up with a research question worthy of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; funding.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyhow, I was hoping that some of the members here might be able to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point out other Universities (in North America or English-speaking\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Europe) that may be appropriate to do such a PhD in. These are the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ones I&#39;m familiar with now:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; University of Edinburgh\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; University of Sussex\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; University of Central Florida\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I realize this isn&#39;t directly related to NEAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a more knowledgeable group on the subject matter a hand. If there\n&gt; is a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more appropriate group, then please just point me in the right\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; direction and I&#39;ll not post about this again here.
