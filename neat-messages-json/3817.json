When evolving artificial\nneural network=\r\ns, methods using direct encoding have genes representing\nneurons and synaps=\r\nes, while methods employing artificial ontogeny\ninterpret genomes as recipe=\r\ns for construction of phenotypes. Here, a\nneuroevolution system (NEON) is p=\r\nresented that can emulate a well\nknown neuroevolution method using direct e=\r\nncoding (NEAT), and\ntherefore can solve the same kinds of tasks. Performanc=\r\ne on\nchallenging control and memory benchmark tasks is reported. However,\nt=\r\nhe encoding used by NEON is indirect, and it is shown how\ncharacteristics o=\r\nf artificial ontogeny can be introduced incrementally\nin different phases o=\r\nf evolutionary search.\n\n\n"}}
