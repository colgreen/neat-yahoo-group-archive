Of \n&gt;course, there is a standard way I use them in my version of NEAT, \n&gt;but there are so many ways it could be done and some might actually \n&gt;be better than others.\n&gt;ken\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYeh AFAIK Ken I use the enable bit in the same way as standard NEAT. \nWhich (off the top of my head) is to disable connections that are \nreplaced when adding new neurons and then to give them a 25% chance of \nbeing re-enabled during crossover.\n\nI should stress that the graph is the result of one very short \nexperiment in one problem domain, so it is by no means conclusive! On \nthe other hand, if the enable bit was significantly beneficial then I \nfigured it would have showed up to some degree in the graph \n(http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/enableflaggraph2.png). So based on this \nthinking I have removed all trace of the enable flag from SharpNEAT, at \nleast for now, because it makes the pruning phase code a bit easier to \nget my head around - as ever it&#39;s never quite as simple as I had expected :)\n\nI also noticed in Derek & Philips Tic-Tac-Toe paper that they mentioned \nthat ANJI doesn&#39;t use the bit either. SharpNEAT now mimics ANJI in that \nwhen a new neuron is added, it replaces a connection (as normal) but the \nconnection is then deleted altogether.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
