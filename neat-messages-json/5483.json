Of course, there is probably not a st=\r\nrict &quot;pre-specified&quot; period and another strict &quot;plastic&quot; period, because in=\r\n reality they likely overlap from the very start, but the general idea that=\r\n both elements are present and that the pendulum swings gradually away from=\r\n pre-specification makes sense to me.  From a neuroevolution perspective, i=\r\nt&#39;s possible to imagine variants of adaptive HyperNEAT that exhibit more or=\r\n less of this type of dynamic.  Adaptive HyperNEAT was described in &quot;Indire=\r\nctly Encoding Neural Plasticity as a Pattern of Local Rules,&quot; which is at h=\r\nttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications/2010/risi.sab10.html .  Of course we ar=\r\ne continuing to explore these types of plastic models.\n\nAbout the junk DNA =\r\nhypothesis - it&#39;s the type of thing you can&#39;t really definitively verify as=\r\n true or false, but if some initial &quot;randomness&quot; in the brain was provided =\r\nby junk DNA it wouldn&#39;t be that surprising.  But the thing I kind of object=\r\n to in the quotations you provided is the idea that this idea is &quot;bold.&quot;  I=\r\nt doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a major problem to explain how disorganized rand=\r\nonmness can get into a system.  I mean, random initialization (which is a s=\r\ntandard part of many EAs and other learning algorithms) is generally not th=\r\ne interesting part, at least not in terms of being the part that requires g=\r\nreat intellectual effort to conceive or understand.  So if nature in fact t=\r\nook one arbitrary route to getting a little randomness into things over ano=\r\nther, it doesn&#39;t seem that impressive or fortuitous compared to how it disc=\r\novered the parts that are, in contrast, well-organized.  \n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; La=\r\nst summer I read Jeff Hawkins&#39; book On Intelligence. One of the take\n&gt; away=\r\n points for me was that the connectivity in real brains has a lot\n&gt; of regu=\r\nlar structure and order, but also some rather more messy\n&gt; connectivity. I&#39;=\r\nm going from memory here but the pictue he paints is\n&gt; one of cortical colu=\r\nmns packed together vertically, columns have\n&gt; layers (6 or so if memory se=\r\nrves) and intra-column connectivity\n&gt; appears to be fairly well understood =\r\nat a *very* broad level, that is,\n&gt; layer 1 neurons tend to connect to laye=\r\nrs 2 & 3, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the top of the columns we then see connections reach=\r\ning out over\n&gt; the tops of multiple columns, connecting up different region=\r\ns\n&gt; sometimes over very long distances - perhaps up to several\n&gt; centimeter=\r\ns. It&#39;s interesting to contemplate what processes are\n&gt; causing connections=\r\n to form over such long ranges. One explanation I\n&gt; quite like is that the =\r\nearly brain (e.g. a newborn baby) has a mass of\n&gt; connections that have *no=\r\nt* yet been guided by any learning process -\n&gt; so what is all this mass of =\r\nconnections doing? what arrangement of\n&gt; connectivity does it have and why?=\r\n I suspect that our DNA describes\n&gt; connectivity patterns in the newborn th=\r\nat are primed for learning and\n&gt; that as learning progresses some of these =\r\npre-existing connections are\n&gt; strengthened (and grow new connections local=\r\nly), and some wither away.\n&gt; I&#39;m speculating that this early connectivity p=\r\nattern includes some\n&gt; proportion of long connections acting between distan=\r\nt regions. I\n&gt; further speculate that this might be partly responsible for =\r\nthe\n&gt; various axon bundles that occur in the brain that broadly follow the\n=\r\n&gt; same path in all (most?) people (e.g. from the retina to the visual\n&gt; cor=\r\ntex) - do &#39;primer&#39; fibers grow by following a DNA blueprint during\n&gt; the ea=\r\nrly stages of brain development?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also last year I came across this art=\r\nicle that discusses work\n&gt; regarding expression of bits of DNA considered t=\r\no be junk acquired\n&gt; from ancient viruses and the like:\n&gt; \n&gt;    &quot;A special =\r\nreport on the human genome: The soul of an old machine&quot;\n&gt;    http://www.eco=\r\nnomist.com/node/16349410\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve appened some of the salient parts to =\r\nthe end of this post. This\n&gt; junk DNA appears to be expressed more in brain=\r\n tissue than elsewhere\n&gt; in the body, and so there&#39;s a question of why this=\r\n is and if it has\n&gt; any purpose. One suggested purpose is that this DNA is =\r\nused as a\n&gt; source of complexity in brain connectivity growth processes in =\r\nthe\n&gt; embryo. It&#39;s possible that the learning processes/rules in the brain\n=\r\n&gt; don&#39;t require any specific structure but do requrie some existing\n&gt; struc=\r\nture with sufficient interconnectivity and &#39;messiness&#39; to build\n&gt; upon, and=\r\n that these large sequences of &#39;junk&#39; DNA (I appreciate junk\n&gt; DNA is a loa=\r\nded term) were a convenient source of messiness or\n&gt; arbitrary complexity t=\r\nhat evolution came to utilise over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think this is possible=\r\n? Likely? or just another madcap theory? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A sp=\r\necial report on the human genome: The soul of an old machine&quot;\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &quot;...Dr Gage studies LINE-1 elements, bi=\r\nts of DNA known colloquially as\n&gt; jumping genes. These make up about 20% of=\r\n the human genome, and most\n&gt; biologists do regard them as junk=97or rather=\r\n as parasites. Their origin\n&gt; is unknown, though they may be the distant de=\r\nscendants of some type of\n&gt; retrovirus (the same class as the AIDS-causing =\r\nvirus, HIV) because\n&gt; they are able to copy themselves using a retroviral g=\r\nene called\n&gt; reverse transcriptase. Generally, this is a bad thing for thei=\r\nr hosts.\n&gt; If nothing else, it wastes resources. And if an element happens =\r\nto\n&gt; copy itself into the wrong place it can cause an existing gene to\n&gt; ma=\r\nlfunction.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; Five years ago he showed that LINE-1 elements are much=\r\n more active in\n&gt; the brains of mice than in their other tissues. And in 20=\r\n09 he and a\n&gt; colleague, Nicole Coufal, showed the same is true in people. =\r\nUsing\n&gt; sensitive sequencing methods they discovered that human brain cells=\r\n\n&gt; have around 100 more LINE-1 elements in them than tissues such as the\n&gt; =\r\nheart or the liver. That means the elements are multiplying during the\n&gt; pr=\r\nocess of brain formation.\n&gt; [...]\n&gt; Why that is remains an unanswered quest=\r\nion. But one possible\n&gt; explanation is this. Each new brain develops by a p=\r\nrocess akin to\n&gt; natural selection. Nerve cells grow and develop lots of co=\r\nnnections\n&gt; with each other, and then most of those connections and many of=\r\n the\n&gt; cells themselves die. Only the fittest cells and connections survive=\r\n,\n&gt; leaving a working network.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this context a way of generating var=\r\niations on which selection can\n&gt; operate may actually result in better netw=\r\norks and thus brains. The\n&gt; random changes brought about by LINE-1 elements=\r\n jumping around the\n&gt; genomes of nerve cells can yield such variation. It i=\r\ns a daring\n&gt; hypothesis. But there is at least one other part of the body=\r\n=97the\n&gt; immune system=97that relies on the internal mutability of the DNA =\r\nto\n&gt; generate the variety needed for it to recognise all the pathogens that=\r\n\n&gt; nature can throw at a body. Though the immune system has come up with\n&gt; =\r\na different solution in detail (particular cassettes of DNA have\n&gt; evolved =\r\nto shuffle round at this one place in the genome), the general\n&gt; principle =\r\nis the same.&quot;\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
