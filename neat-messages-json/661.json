In=\r\n\nsome domains that can encourage more fine tuning.\n\n-The dropoff_age could =\r\nbe a lot higher, like 150, or even 500, to give\neach species more time befo=\r\nre they get purged for being stuck.\n\nAs far as what they need to sense, I w=\r\nould suggest they need to have\nsome sense of the location of their center o=\r\nf mass relative to the\nground, and also the velocity of their center of mas=\r\ns relative to the\nground.  Since I think only the vertical dimension matter=\r\ns for this,\nyou could just tell it the vertical component of both of these.=\r\n \nHowever, perhaps also the horizontal component can be helpful, if you\ncou=\r\nld in some way express how the horizontal alignment of the center\nof mass r=\r\nelative to the body (for example, if your legs are both to\none side of the =\r\nCOM, you probably need to shift your weight).\n\nIt does seem to me very diff=\r\nicult to balance if you have no idea how\nyour overall center is positioned.=\r\n\n\nI don&#39;t think you really need body part positions...angles should be\nsuff=\r\nicient since evolution can learn the relationship between joint\nangles and =\r\nchanges in the center of mass.  \n\nA really interesting question is how you =\r\ncan encourage walking one\nstep at a time, as opposed to the two-foot hoppin=\r\ng I saw on your web\npage.

First, I tried\n&gt; inputting the angles of each joint in =\r\nthe body.  That\n&gt; way, they have some sense of their body&#39;s\n&gt; pose/gesture.=\r\n  Lately I have been thinking of the\n&gt; following options for neural net inp=\r\nuts:\n&gt; \n&gt; * joint angles\n&gt; * joint velocities\n&gt; * body part positions (glob=\r\nal coordinates or maybe\n&gt; offset from the center of mass)\n&gt; * overall cente=\r\nr of mass\n&gt; * forces on body parts\n&gt; \n&gt; They need to have enough informatio=\r\nn to be able to\n&gt; perform a complex sequence of actions (e.g. walking). \n&gt; =\r\nAny thought on these ideas for inputs or have other\n&gt; ideas?  Do you think =\r\nsome are more or less important?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tyler\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; _=\r\n_________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
