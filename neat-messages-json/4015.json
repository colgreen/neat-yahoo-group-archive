And I have \n&gt; &gt; openly stated as much on more than one occasion. But=\r\n as I am sure \n&gt; &gt; that you are aware, a concept once let loose, is free to=\r\n become \nmore \n&gt; &gt; that what may have been originally envisioned. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I am indeed aware of the work involved in using NEAT for everyday \n&gt; &gt; eng=\r\nineering tasks, and making substantial upgrades to the source \ncode \n&gt; &gt; in=\r\nfrastructure to unlock its potential (i.e. greater than a man-\nyear).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m confident in the statement that each proposed update \nsuggested to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; date has already been accomplished (on NEAT, not HyperNEAT). It \nwould=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; be an error to assume otherwise. So I have more than a concept of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; whats involved.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The problem, if you want to characterize it as s=\r\nuch, is that my \n&gt; &gt; efforts are directed towards everyday engineering task=\r\ns which are \nnot \n&gt; &gt; public in nature, and the burden of writing papers is=\r\n \nsubstantially \n&gt; &gt; greater than just the writing. The experiments are the=\r\n everyday \njobs \n&gt; &gt; that need to get done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your efforts are not u=\r\nnappreciated. But when you put something \n&gt; &gt; forward with associated claim=\r\ns, its reasonable to assume that you \n&gt; &gt; have done your homework and are i=\r\nn a position to answer \nreasonable \n&gt; &gt; questions as they relate to your cl=\r\naims.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Asking questions such as:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) What benchmarks agains=\r\nt known quantities, have you made \n&gt; &gt; comparisons against your claims, to =\r\nhelp us understand where in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; AI landscape we should place your cla=\r\nims,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) What computational cost comparisons have you performed aga=\r\ninst \n&gt; &gt; other known quantities, to help us understand what the costs of \n=\r\nyour \n&gt; &gt; claims are.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These are not adversarial questions. They ar=\r\ne the normal types of \n&gt; &gt; questions that are routinely addressed in the bo=\r\ndy of a technical \n&gt; &gt; paper or presentation making various claims.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If you fail to answer the questions up front in the technical \n&gt; &gt; presen=\r\ntation/paper itself, it is reasonable to expect follow-on \n&gt; &gt; questions in=\r\n an attempt to nail these issues down. If you neglect \nto \n&gt; &gt; answer these=\r\n questions, it is also a reasonable expectation \nothers \n&gt; &gt; will wonder wh=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my opinion that the concept of NEAT has so much more \npot=\r\nential \n&gt; &gt; than you have exercised publically to date. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For whate=\r\nver your reasons are, perhaps as simple as alignment \nwith \n&gt; &gt; research in=\r\nterests, you have left a lot on the table. And that is \n&gt; &gt; your right. It =\r\nwould just be more helpful to all if you would be \nmore \n&gt; &gt; forthcoming in=\r\n regards to the bounds of your agenda, and provide \n&gt; &gt; reasonable answers =\r\nto questions related to your claims and \n&gt; &gt; presentations, so that they ma=\r\ny be promptly and properly \nclassified, \n&gt; &gt; rather than discovering them a=\r\nfter the fact in a protracted \nmanner.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nobody said being the big d=\r\nog was easy!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; &gt; Andy Carl\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lack o=\r\nf scientific/methodical approach in demonstrating \n&gt; &gt; ability \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\ndiscover patterns, a priori known patterns, before \nattempting \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; demonstrate a &quot;killer-application&quot;, for which there is no \nknown \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; figure of merit to compare &quot;ability to discover patterns&quot;, is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndisturbing, and expecting an inordinate level of faith on the \n&gt; &gt; part of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reader.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The lack of any comparative computati=\r\nonal cost data is \nequally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disturbing, and begs the question, espe=\r\ncially since there \nappears \n&gt; &gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a growing body of user expe=\r\nrience that the computational \ncost \n&gt; &gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steep.

Yet you take the attitude that someone is \n&gt; &gt; hid=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something from you and you are therefore &quot;disturbed.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; You should change your tone.  Instead of attacking the source \nfor \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; having answered every question that you have and performed every=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment that you personally believe we should ever perform, \nwhy =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; put it more like, &quot;It would be interesting to see if...&quot;  \no=\r\nr &quot;One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;d like to perform is...&quot;  or &quot;An interesting \nque=\r\nstion \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whether...&quot; In other words, what is accomplished by you=\r\nr \naggressive,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember hear=\r\ning once, though I do not remember the source, an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting quote o=\r\nn scientific research.  To paraphrase: &quot;Good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research answ=\r\ners hard questions.  However, the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific research raises ent=\r\nirely new questions that we never \n&gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have even asked before.&quot;=\r\n  Think of quantum physics.  The \nuncertainty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; principle has led to en=\r\ndless discussion of paradoxes and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impossibilities, with no end in sig=\r\nht, but we do not see people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accusing Heisenberg of trying to hide th=\r\ne &quot;truth.&quot;  Instead, it \nis a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; credit to his discovery that we are now=\r\n asking such profound \n&gt; &gt; questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So let me suggest to you=\r\n that you change your tone and drop the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confrontational demeanor.
