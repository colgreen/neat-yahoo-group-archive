If so then won&#39;t the overall score be &gt;1 for a \nperfect player (total or average score for all moves).\n\nI reckon this is a step in the right direction re the need for some kind \nof universal evaluation scheme. Not sure about the evaluation of \nperformance against poor players aspect. If we are evaluating against \nevery board state then surely some of those states could only have been \nobtained by poor/illogical play (or what we would consider to be poor \nplay under normal circumstances) and therefore we *are* evaluating \nperformance against some poor players, aren&#39;t we?\n\nI suppose a truly universal evaluation scheme would evaluate a player&#39;s \nability to learn how other players play and thus exploit their \nweaknesses, but do you give each player an ID so we know which players \nwe are playing against or do you leave it to the algorithm to analyse \nthe style of play and to adjust it&#39;s playing strategy accordingly? \nConsider that I&#39;m a human playing TTT with an anonymous player over the \ninternet, do I try some silly moves in an attenpt to find weaknesses or \ndo I play primarily defensively and only offensively as a secondary \nstrategy. I do the later but I do take advantage of any silly moves the \nopponent makes,  but if my defensive style of play doesn&#39;t expose the \nopponents silly moves then I never discover them. \n\nSo what we are proposing is evaluation assuming a reasonably competent \nopponent and a fixed (non-adapting) strategy.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
