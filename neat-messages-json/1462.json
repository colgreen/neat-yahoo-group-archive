It seems like this is a\n&gt; promising research direction.  Some things I&#39;m wondering...How many\n&gt; generations does it take to get the &quot;A&quot; discriminator eye?  \n\nWe&#39;ve been trying a bunch of ad hoc experiments, with all sorts of\nparameters, so it&#39;s difficult to generalize at this point.  But in the\nmore successful runs, we usually reach 85-95% fitness within around\n100 generations, and it normally plateaus out from there.  We&#39;ve done\nup to 500 generations, but we&#39;ve seen little improvement past the\nfirst 100 or so.\n\n&gt; How much\n&gt; CPU time does it require? \n\nOne of our parameters is how much time we give the network based on\nits efficiency.  It also depends on the evaluation set of images. \nCurrently each network looks at and evaluates 50 images, 25 randomized\nA&#39;s and 1 of each other letter in the alphabet.  For a population size\nof 100, each generation takes about 2 minutes.  I&#39;d say our runs for\n100 generations are about 3-4 hours.\n\n&gt; How complex is the network?\n\nAgain, this varies widely, since we&#39;re trying all sorts of parameters.\n It seems as if, so far, changing the resolution of the eye (e.g. from\n4x4 pixels to 10x10) doesn&#39;t seem to have a huge impact on evolving\nfitness.  We have 5 output nodes, so a fully-connected initial\ntopology for a 4x4 eye is 131 genes and one for a 10x10 eye is 635\ngenes.  We&#39;re doing blended runs with different mutation settings as\nwell.  So far we&#39;ve had very good performers with relatively small\ntopologies (under a hundred genes).\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
