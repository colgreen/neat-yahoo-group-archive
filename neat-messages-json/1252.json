Either assign it a random value at\n&gt; &gt; the beginning of an each activation, or have its value change every time\n&gt; &gt; it is read.  The network will, of course, evolve to minimize the weights\n&gt; &gt; to the random node.  But the presence of random fluctuations in the\n&gt; &gt; environment will force it to adopt a different strategy of execution.\n&gt;\n&gt;We tried this with our tic-tac-toe player and it didn&#39;t seem to make\n&gt;much difference.\n\nI wouldn&#39;t expect it to make a difference for games.  I would only expect it \nto help for a controller.\n\n&gt;The concept does seem like it could be beneficial to\n&gt;me, though, especially in domains where the ability to generate\n&gt;randomness has a clear fitness advantage.  We had thought about using\n&gt;that if we ever tackle poker.  Even something simpler like prisoner&#39;s\n&gt;dilemma might benefit from a random input node.  It&#39;s kind of like\n&gt;giving the net some dice to roll.\n\nIt&#39;s also like putting the walker in a room with a gravel floor.  The floor \nis uneven.  It has to learn to walk anyway.  It can&#39;t take advantage of a \nperfectly smooth floor.  It can&#39;t rely on every step being performed exactly \nthe same way giving exactly the same results.  So it must learn to take \nfeedback from its environment, and adapt to those signals.\n\n&gt;You mentioned an oscillating input node.  That might be useful for\n&gt;giving the net the concept of the passage of time without giving it an\n&gt;absolute time input.\n\nYes, that is precisely what I figured it would be useful for.  However, I \ndon&#39;t know how important that is for most things we would want to evolve.  \nArtificial life is another story, however.\n\nThe variable speed oscillating hidden node could prove useful in other ways. \n  Like redirecting conscious attention, setting up a sense of rhythm that \ncan be harmonized with the environment to help produce smoother motion, or \nwho knows what evolution might find it useful for.\n\n-- John\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
