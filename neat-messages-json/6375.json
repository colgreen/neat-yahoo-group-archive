When considering evolutionary\nrobotics as black-box optimization, the selective pressure is mainly\ndriven by a user-defined, black-box fitness function, and a\ndomain-independent selection procedure. However, most evolutionary\nrobotics experiments face similar challenges in similar setups: the\nselective pressure, and, in particular, the fitness function, is not a\npure user-defined black box. The present review shows that, because\nevolutionary robotics experiments share common features, selective\npressures for evolutionary robotics are a subject of research on their\nown. The literature has been split into two categories: goal refiners,\naimed at changing the definition of a good solution, and process\nhelpers, designed to help the search process. Two sub-categories are\nfurther considered: task-specific approaches, which require knowledge on\nhow to solve the task and task-agnostic ones, which do not need it.\nBesides highlighting the diversity of the approaches and their\nrespective goals, the present review shows that many task-agnostic\nprocess helpers have been proposed during the last years, thus bringing\nus closer to the goal of a fully automated robot behavior design process.\n\n\nBest,\n\nS.
