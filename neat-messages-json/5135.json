There is a lot going on here,\nbut I think I can state the problem simply without getting into the details\nof the JNeat code.\n\nKen&#39;s paper describes speciation as occuring every generation.  Speciation\nentails iterating over the population, and performing some rudimentary\nclustering using a compatibility function and threshhold.  Pretty\nstraightforward.\n\nIndeed, this algorithm is implemented in JNeat as the speciate() method, but\nits only invoked at the beginning of evolution and never again!  The growth\nand death of species afterwards is determined by some code in the epoch()\nmethod that does not appear to resemble NEAT speciation.  I&#39;m concerned that\nwhatever JNeat is doing, it isn&#39;t what Ken had in mind, and it leads to some\nstrange behavior.  Attached is a graph showing how the number of species\ngrows during a run of the XOR experiment.  With a population size of 500, it\nincreases almost monotonically to 400 before leveling off after 40\ngenerations.\n\nShouldn&#39;t the speciate() method be called after ever generation/epoch?\n Isn&#39;t this way too many species?  Approximately how many species would you\nexpect for the XOR experiment with 500 individuals?\n\n\nRegards,\nDaniel\n\r\n--000e0cd25ac2839b5e0481285ae9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHello,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My refactoring of JNeat has brought me to the spe=\r\nciation code, and I&#39;m finding it tricky to reconcile the JNeat speciati=\r\non code with descriptions in NEAT papers and discussion in this forum. =A0T=\r\nhere is a lot going on here, but I think I can state the problem simply wit=\r\nhout getting into the details of the JNeat code. =A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Ken&#39;s paper describes speciation as occuring every generation. =A0=\r\nSpeciation entails iterating over the population, and performing some rudim=\r\nentary clustering using a compatibility function and threshhold. =A0Pretty =\r\nstraightforward.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Indeed, this algorithm is imple=\r\nmented in JNeat as the speciate() method, but its only invoked at the begin=\r\nning of evolution and never again! =A0The growth and death of species after=\r\nwards is determined by some code in the epoch() method that does not appear=\r\n to resemble NEAT speciation. =A0I&#39;m concerned that whatever JNeat is d=\r\noing, it isn&#39;t what Ken had in mind, and it leads to some strange behav=\r\nior. =A0Attached is a graph showing how the number of species grows during =\r\na run of the XOR experiment. =A0With a population size of 500, it increases=\r\n almost monotonically to 400 before leveling off after 40 generations. =A0&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shouldn&#39;t the speciate() method be called af=\r\nter ever generation/epoch? =A0Isn&#39;t this way too many species? =A0Appro=\r\nximately how many species would you expect for the XOR experiment with 500 =\r\nindividuals?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regards,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;D=\r\naniel&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25ac2839b5e0481285ae9--\r\n\n\r\n--000e0cd25ac2839b6a0481285aeb\r\nContent-Type: image/png; name=&quot;species_v_epoch.PNG&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;species_v_epoch.PNG&quot;\r\nX-Attachment-Id: f_g6gwydzj0\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--000e0cd25ac2839b6a0481285aeb--\r\n\n"}}
