I have been doing grad research in evolutionary\ncomputati=\r\non\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for three and a half years now at MSU on the Avida system. I have\nw=\r\norked\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with alife and GAs but have not yet done any real work in neural=\r\n\nnets. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would like to use generative representations (e.g. L-systems)=\r\n to\nevolve\n&gt; &gt;&gt; neural nets for my dissertation, however, so I need to ramp=\r\n up on\nneural\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nets.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; For the next three weeks I will be in A=\r\nfrica and would like to\nuse any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; free\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time there to learn as much =\r\nas I can about neural nets. Is there\nany book\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that you recommend I tak=\r\ne? I won&#39;t have nearly any internet\naccess, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; often not ha=\r\nve my computer, so it would be good if the book does not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; require\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\neither of those.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I also think better in sentences than equations=\r\n, so a book that\nemphasizes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more of an intuitive logical explanation r=\r\nather than mathematical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; formulation (when possible) would be ideal.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; And, of course, I have put off buying this to the last second so\nI=\r\n don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have time to order it online...but do have a Borders nearby and=\r\n\nthe many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; University book shops.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Given all those qualificat=\r\nions, I&#39;m probably out of luck. But I\nfigured if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there was something g=\r\nood out there this group would know of it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any recommendations y=\r\nou have would be much appreciated.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@... &lt;jclune%40msu.edu&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 517.214=\r\n.1060 (cell)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
