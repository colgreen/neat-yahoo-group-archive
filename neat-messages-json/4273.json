(By the way, by &quot;Adaptive\n&gt; Networks,&quot; I assume y=\r\nou are referring to adaptive neural networks?)\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, another op=\r\ntion is the University of Texas at Austin,\n&gt; which is where I did my Ph.D. =\r\nunder Prof. Risto Miikkulainen, who has\n&gt; a leading group in the area:\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n http://nn.cs.utexas.edu\n&gt; \n&gt; Another good lab is Prof. Jordan Pollack&#39;s DE=\r\nMO Lab at Brandeis:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/\n&gt; http://www.cs.b=\r\nrandeis.edu/~pollack/\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Jordan tells me that he will be renamin=\r\ng and revamping his\n&gt; lab soon, so it will no longer be called &quot;DEMO.&quot;  How=\r\never, it is\n&gt; undoubtedly still a good place to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are some new=\r\ner places too with groups led by new professors,\n&gt; including Prof. Bobby Br=\r\nyant&#39;s &quot;Neuroevolution and Behavior\n&gt; Laboratory&quot; at the University of Neva=\r\nda at Reno\n&gt; (http://nebl.cse.unr.edu/) and Prof. Josh Bongard&#39;s new group =\r\nat the\n&gt; University of Vermont (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/).\n&gt; \n&gt; Pro=\r\nf. Hod Lipson at Cornell formerly worked with Prof. Pollack and\n&gt; runs the =\r\nCornell Computational Synthesis Lab:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n However, that lab is a focused on emergent phenomena in general, with\n&gt; a =\r\nbroader scope than some of the others.\n&gt; \n&gt; One other important group is Pr=\r\nof. Dario Floreano&#39;s Laboratory of\n&gt; Intelligent Systems.  This lab is in S=\r\nwitzerland, so I am not sure if\n&gt; it conducts its day-to-day work in Englis=\r\nh (it might), but in any case\n&gt; it is very prominent in the area:\n&gt; \n&gt; http=\r\n://lis.epfl.ch/\n&gt; \n&gt; Not all these groups have an explicit focus on neural =\r\nnetworks, but\n&gt; most have done some good work with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that any=\r\n Ph.D. program in North America should be willing to\n&gt; support you financia=\r\nlly if you get in.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nfrayn.michael&quot; &lt;frayn.michael@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I a=\r\nm about to head over to the University of Sussex (in Brighton,\n&gt; &gt; England)=\r\n to do their MSc in Evolutionary & Adaptive Systems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, as I=\r\n am Canadian, the concept of doing a PhD there is a\n&gt; &gt; little daunting bec=\r\nause of the cost. Unfortunately, I am not aware of\n&gt; &gt; many other Universit=\r\nies that would be interested in funding a PhD of\n&gt; &gt; such research focuses =\r\n(let alone would be able to comprehensively\n&gt; &gt; support students along the =\r\nway). This assumes, of course, that my MSc\n&gt; &gt; is wildly successful and I c=\r\nome up with a research question worthy of\n&gt; &gt; funding.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyhow, I w=\r\nas hoping that some of the members here might be able to\n&gt; &gt; point out othe=\r\nr Universities (in North America or English-speaking\n&gt; &gt; Europe) that may b=\r\ne appropriate to do such a PhD in. These are the\n&gt; &gt; ones I&#39;m familiar with=\r\n now:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; University of Edinburgh\n&gt; &gt; University of Sussex\n&gt; &gt; Univers=\r\nity of Central Florida\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I realize this isn&#39;t directly related to NE=\r\nAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\n&gt; &gt; a more knowledgeable group on the subject ma=\r\ntter a hand. If there is a\n&gt; &gt; more appropriate group, then please just poi=\r\nnt me in the right\n&gt; &gt; direction and I&#39;ll not post about this again here. A=\r\npologies if it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; too off-topic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
