We all agree that our field is inspired\n&gt; by, and largely patterned after, what we know about\n&gt; biology.  When thinking about this we often think\n&gt; about the creatures we are most familiar with,\n&gt; namely,homo sapiens.  \n&gt; In my opinion it is more fruitful to\n&gt; think about much simpler organisms, such as\n&gt; bacteria,\n&gt; yeast, algae, etc.  Even those are much more\n&gt; complicated than our models, but they are closer,\n&gt; since we don&#39;t have sexual reproduction, nor many\n&gt; other genetic & developmental phenomena found in\n&gt; nature.  So I think we should model our work after\n&gt; the\n&gt; simplest organisms that we know something about.\n\nWell, but NEAT does employ sexual reproduction, albeit\na very simplified representation of it, which is\nobviously a more complicated mode of reproduction than\nasexual reproduction.\n\nIf we only used the simplest models from nature, then\nwe would be potentially excluding some of the most\neffective evolutionary features.\n\nYou&#39;re right that we should keep in mind that our\nmodels are nowhere near the complexity of biological\nones, and so analogy with real-world organisms\nsometimes breaks down.  But if we&#39;re modeling sexual\nreproduction, obviously we need to draw analogies from\norganisms that actually reproduce that way.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
