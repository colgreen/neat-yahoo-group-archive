Although I&#39;m actually a bit shocked it \ntook  \n&gt; me as long to=\r\n find NEAT as it did, as it&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;ve  \n&gt; been quite interes=\r\nted in for years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rather, it took until I came to write a proposal for=\r\n an honours \nyear  \n&gt; project, when a potential supervisor pointed me towar=\r\nds NEAT after \nI  \n&gt; spent a few minutes ranting at them about the kind of =\r\nthings I \nwas  \n&gt; interested in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, now I&#39;m hopefully going to be=\r\n able to spend my year doing  \n&gt; NEAT related things.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the moment, I=\r\n&#39;ve yet to get the original NEAT package to  \n&gt; compile... Because I&#39;m tryi=\r\nng to do so under OS X... Since while \nit  \n&gt; would be possible to use Linu=\r\nx all year, I&#39;d *vastly* prefer to \nsit  \n&gt; in front of a mac.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far,=\r\n I think I&#39;ve got everything I need via fink and I&#39;ve \nchanged  \n&gt; paths in=\r\n the Makefile appropriately, but just compilation of  \n&gt; networks.cpp throw=\r\ns the to-be-expected screens and screens of \nerrors...\n&gt; \n&gt; Searching the l=\r\nist archive suggests I&#39;m out of luck as far as \nfinding  \n&gt; an empathetic e=\r\nar is concerned, but I just thought before I spend  \n&gt; hours trying to get =\r\nthis thing to work, I&#39;d see if anyone else \nhas  \n&gt; had any luck? =3D)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt;   Adam Wright  &lt;zeno@...&gt;\n&gt;   University Website Office,=\r\n The University of Western Australia\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
