Is there anything\n&gt; you know that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;might be causing this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Erm, no, I can&#39;t think what that might do that. \n&gt; It&#39;s only the \n&gt; &gt; simplest thing using some crude GDI graphics to\n&gt; display the number \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; jobs it has and a simple scrolling graph of\n&gt; best-fitness, \n&gt; &gt; average-fitness and average-size.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Are you sure you set up the working directory\n&gt; correctly?  I think \n&gt; &gt; there would be no graphics if there were no jobs\n&gt; at all...  You \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; easily tell because it will have created the\n&gt; &quot;todo&quot;, &quot;current_SS&quot; \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &quot;done&quot; directories in it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a log file (master.log or master_SS.log,\n&gt; depending \n&gt; whether \n&gt; &gt; you took it before or after I updated it) which\n&gt; may reveal \n&gt; something...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Was it using CPU?  You can tell because if you\n&gt; have the task-\n&gt; manager \n&gt; &gt; &quot;performance&quot; tab open when the screensaver\n&gt; starts, you can look \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; the history graph when the screensaver closes...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Otherwise, what OS are you on?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does this mean you are considering giving it some\n&gt; serious CPU?  Or \n&gt; &gt; were you just looking.  If you are going to give\n&gt; it some CPU then \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll send you some job files ;-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was considering better graphics, e.g. a\n&gt; continuous shown TTT \n&gt; game \n&gt; &gt; between the current champion and some sort of \n&gt; &gt; semi-random/semi-perfect player, but since I only\n&gt; got the one \n&gt; &gt; volunteer and he isn&#39;t using the graphical\n&gt; version...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;          Ian\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
