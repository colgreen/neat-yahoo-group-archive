Then every network generated as a result of\nthat run could contain either an attribute or tag with\nthat timestamp as well, as a way of correlating the\ntwo.\n\nRight now, the neat-run-output.xml that Colin&#39;s put\nout there can contain all the individuals and all of\ntheir specific information, but I think we&#39;d prefer to\nstore the XML for individuals as separate files, while\nusing the run XML as an index.\n \n&gt; If you see \n&gt; that there was a network that did something\n&gt; anomalous in the run, can you \n&gt; identify the xml of the network in question?  \n\nSure, every network was an id.  But it&#39;s not unique\nacross all runs.  So, as I suggest above, a timestamp\nwould probably be the best way to correlate a network\nand a run.  So, for example, we could talk about\n&quot;network #432 from the run started on\n2004-04-01@9:00:00&quot;, or something similar.\n\nIf individuals are loaded up for use in the initial\npopulation of a second or third run, that information\nshould be added to the XML as well.\n\nThe network XML that I posted should be considered a\nstarting point...I hope.  For instance, currently it\ndoesn&#39;t contain any information about the activation\nfunction of nodes, which we would most likely want to\ninclude.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
