It is probably true that there are some more complex behav=\r\niors that could be learned that way than with the current setup.  However, =\r\nthe cost would be slower learning and since the current setup is sufficient=\r\n for the Keepaway task, it may not be really important for that task.  Howe=\r\nver, if the task was made more complex, it could become necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not=\r\ne that even if the substrate was not allowed to evolve, we could still inse=\r\nrt the hidden layer at a fixed resolution.  We could also allow the hidden =\r\nlayer node placement to evolve as well.  It&#39;s difficult to say the impact o=\r\nf that idea on this domain since the evolvable substrate (ES-HyperNEAT) is =\r\nsuch a new approach, but I would guess again that the current task setup wo=\r\nuld not really need it, though it might be useful as it gets more complex.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;v.vassiliades&quot; &lt;vassilisvas@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all and Happy Easter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I liked the ideas in y=\r\nour new papers:\n&gt; &gt; - Evolving the Placement and Density of Neurons in the =\r\nHyperNEAT Substrate\n&gt; &gt; - Transfer Learning through Indirect Encodng\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I was wondering whether you had any thoughts about combining them.
