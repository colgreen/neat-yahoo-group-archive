This would mean, I\nthink, that you don&#39;t hav=\r\ne to keep a per-generation list of structural\nmutations, but the historical=\r\n markers for matching structural\nmutations will always be the same, across =\r\nall generations.\n\nIs there some benefit to the approach described in the NE=\r\nAT\npublications that I&#39;m missing, or should this work fine?\n\nOne difference=\r\n is that you can&#39;t differentiate between disjoint and\nexcess genes, and so =\r\nlose one of the c1,c2 hyperparameters =97 is this\nimportant?\n\n"}}
