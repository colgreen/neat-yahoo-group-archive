Sorry about that. If however I understand co=\r\nrrectly what you did, it is not exactly a random search. You write that you=\r\n run NEAT with randomly assigned fitness. In such search there should be si=\r\ngnificant correlations between the tested individuals, since despite the ra=\r\nndom selection, much of the genetic material is inherited from past individ=\r\nuals. This is not at all what we would want in a random search. Additionall=\r\ny you would get genomes becoming larger with time(probably much faster than=\r\n we would want in a random search).\nI would expect these deviations from a =\r\nrandom search to cause an uneven exploration of the genotype space. Thus th=\r\ne resulting performance should be worse than that of a random search. I don=\r\n&#39;t know however if the difference will be significant (It depends on the sp=\r\necifics of the evolutionary algorithm).\n\nI agree that it seems that novelty=\r\n search will spend less time on degenerate behaviors than a random search. =\r\nAny ideas on how to quantify this difference?\n\n\n"}}
