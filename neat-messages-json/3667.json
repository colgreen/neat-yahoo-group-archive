Perhaps they could modulate the speed of motions.=\r\n  However, \na lot of the literature on leaky integrators focuses on interna=\r\nl \npattern generation. I&#39;m not sure if that would be useful in this \ndomain=\r\n since the pattern is so focused on the music itself, which is \nbeing input=\r\n.  However, the motion collibration could turn out to \nlook nice.  It would=\r\n be interesting to look at.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski=\r\n&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Ken, it is really fun thing =\r\nto play with :) What about \n&gt; using LIs (leaky integrators) to produce smoo=\r\nther movements and \n&gt; stuff? I think this could make it more realistic.. If=\r\n I have the \n&gt; time, I can do (implement) this myself, but I think it is a =\r\ngood \n&gt; idea, especially for those ragdolls.. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve released exe=\r\ncutables and source code for Dance Evolution, \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; allows you to i=\r\nnteractively evolve dancers to any MIDI song:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.=\r\nedu/dance_evolution/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The dancers are controlled by ANNs that evolv=\r\ne and complexify \n&gt; through \n&gt; &gt; NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve heard there might be =\r\nsome installation problems on some \n&gt; Windows \n&gt; &gt; computers, although it s=\r\neems to work on most.
