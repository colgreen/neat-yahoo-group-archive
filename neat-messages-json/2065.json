But I have actually done length changing experiments myself \nthat haven&#39;t been published.  I found I could get to the first \nincrement in length without needing incremental evolution in NEAT.  I \nthink it took several hundred generations, and actually the network \nwas significantly more complex than the usual DPB network (which may \neven have zero hidden nodes).  In fact, you&#39;ve all probably seen this \nnetwork before.  Can you guess where?\n\nHere&#39;s the answer: It&#39;s the network in the picture that&#39;s been on top \nof the NEAT Users Page for years :)\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kstanley/neat.html\n\nThat&#39;s actually a network that can handle poles closer in length.  And \nthat&#39;s about the complexity level I got every time I tried to solve \nthat problem.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
