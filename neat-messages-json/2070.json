I&#39;m aware \nthat two C++ NEAT implementations exist, but I&#39;ve no information to choose \nbetween them.  OTOH, I would be quite happy to start with a written \nspecification and write it myself.  I find this is usually the fastest way \nto get into understanding all the dirty details...\n\n\tWhat do people recommend?  Currently I favour starting from scratch, both \nbecause it will give me a deeper understanding, and also because there have \nbeen some many interesting new twists and features in recent years.  So if \nI were starting from scratch, I would make sure to update the spec with \nsome of the best new innovations, as well as leaving scope for extensions \nwith others...\n\n\tWhat do people recommend?\n\n\tWhich version, if any should I start with?\n\n\tOr which statement of the original idea would you take (I know there are \nseveral ambiguities in the original paper that come up over and again)?\n\n\tAnd which new innovations would you build in (not necessarily as \n_obligatory_ features)?\n\n\tIan &quot;itching to code&quot; Badcoe\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
