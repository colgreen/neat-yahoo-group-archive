So basically I think I would be\n&gt; looking at making a \n&gt; port of Ken&#39;s neural network code into an minimal\n&gt; implementaion that is \n&gt; written in raw Java. Which at first sounds easy but\n&gt; then think about the \n&gt; lack of the Math functions! I don&#39;t know, maybe\n&gt; there IS a basic library \n&gt; of essentials that I didn&#39;t pick up on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway your quest for an environment brings me back\n&gt; to one of my \n&gt; original points which is - wouldnlt it be nice to\n&gt; have a central \n&gt; repository of environment code. Prefereably modified\n&gt; to expose a \n&gt; standard interface (or one of a set of interfaces)\n&gt; that we define for \n&gt; use in EANN/GA type projects.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
