It is possible that=\r\n you *do* want those larger values.  They may indicate that a particular fe=\r\nature (or set of features) are specifically higher in priority.  And the el=\r\nevated weight values are a way for that node (or set of nodes) to drown out=\r\n noise to refine the &quot;abstraction&quot;.\n\nNow what this *might* mean is that the=\r\n other weights would be useful to &quot;remove&quot; so there is less need for the we=\r\night (or subset of weights) to have their particular values advance so high=\r\n to compensate for the noise.\n\nIf the value range of the weights is clamped=\r\n, it could produce a less efficient search.  When the weight that would jus=\r\nt keep &quot;elevating&quot; hits the cap, to keep it&#39;s relative value to the other w=\r\neights feeding the node, all the other weights would need to go down propor=\r\ntionally at the same time.  However, the odds of that happening are just ab=\r\nout nil.  As such, I sense that that node will start to lose efficacy and t=\r\nhe search will wander away from what might have been a &quot;key abstraction&quot; or=\r\n &quot;feature discovery&quot;.\n\nI cannot prove any of this.  I am just using my intu=\r\nition here.\n\n\nJim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.\n\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From:=\r\n Kenneth Stanley \n  To: neat@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, April 26, 200=\r\n4 2:58 PM\n  Subject: [neat] Re: Warning: Capping the maximum and minimum li=\r\nnk weight may be important!\n\n\n  Yuri, I think the problem with large connec=\r\ntion weights is not so much\n  &quot;instability&quot; as saturation.
