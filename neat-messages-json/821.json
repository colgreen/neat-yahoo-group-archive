Mine is\n&gt; clear\n&gt; &gt;and simple, to demonstrate that a recurrent neural\n&gt; &gt;network can do what animals frequently do, which is\n&gt; &gt;remember a sequence of patterns, and then recall\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt;in order.  The telephone dialing task is an easy to\n&gt; &gt;understand example of this.  (and most people can\n&gt; hear\n&gt; &gt;a 7 digit number and immediately dial it, showing\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;they remembered it at least briefly.)  Animals do\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt;when they remember a route and then find their way\n&gt; &gt;back.  I&#39;m not aware that this has been done by any\n&gt; &gt;ANN researcher.  I plan to do it after my next two\n&gt; &gt;releases, so It&#39;s likely to be in the early fall. \n&gt; One\n&gt; &gt;of you NEAT people could beat me to it if you got\n&gt; &gt;crackin&#39;. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Can we have a bit more detail?\n&gt; \n&gt; What will your inputs and outputs be?\n&gt; How many symbols and how will you distinguish\n&gt; presenting the symbols from \n&gt; retrieving them?\n&gt; Will the sequence be temporal or spatial?\n\nThe inputs will be a sequence of N random binary\npatterns of M bits each.  N & M will be parameters and\nwe will begin with very small values, then raise them.\n The patterns will be presented sequentially, i.e.,\nnot simultaneously.  There is at least one additional\ninput which is a control input to let the net know\nthat the sequence has ended.  Hence there are M+1\nbinary inputs.  After the sequence has ended then the\nnet is expected to repeat it.  Don&#39;t forget that a\nrecurrent ANN can be a signal generator; that&#39;s what\nis supposed to happen here.  The ANN will generate a\nsequence of outputs that is supposed to reproduce the\ninput sequence.\n\nThere are also M+1 outputs.  M of these are supposed\nto replicate one of the input patterns during the\n&quot;recall&quot; phase.  The other output is a &quot;ready&quot; line\nindicating that the output is valid or that the net\nhas completed its processing.  During the initial\npresentation of the sequence the ready output is used\nto indicate that the net is ready to accept the next\npattern.  The other outputs are ignored during this\nphase.  In the second, or &quot;recall&quot; phase, the ready\noutput signals that the pattern is ready to be read\nfrom the pattern outputs.\n\nThis is very similar to what is done by my 4Play\nprogram, except 4Play did more complex logic than just\nrepeating memorize values.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
