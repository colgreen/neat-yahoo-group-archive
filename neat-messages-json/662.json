All of\nthe inputs that you mentioned are important, but not\nequally so.  If you can handle all of those inputs I\nthink you should use them.  If not, IMO the most\nimportant would be these:\n\n* joint angles\n* forces on body parts\n\nThose are the things that an actual human being is\nable to sense directly.\n\n* overall center of mass\n\nA human does not directly sense this, but can estimate\nit from what he sees.  It is likely that he estimates\nits velocity more quickly and accurately than its\nposition.\n\n* body part positions (global coordinates or maybe\noffset from the center of mass)\n\nThose are estimated from the joint angles by the human\nbrain, and to some extent by what it sees.\n\n* joint velocities\n\nIf you use NEAT, or another recurrent ANN, then these\ncould be deduced from rate-of-change of the joint\nangles.  That is probably what the brain does.\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
