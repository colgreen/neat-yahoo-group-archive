I&#39;ve devoted a large portion of=\r\n my life to poker\nas well, and have had less-than-stellar results in terms =\r\nof a full-out\nneural network player.\n\nI did some experiments with EC and ne=\r\nural networks which played\npush/fold in 10-person sit-n-go&#39;s (much like the=\r\n tournaments\nPartyPoker had until about a year ago) against each other (whe=\r\nre the\ninputs were the hole cards, relative position, players left, pot odd=\r\ns,\nrelative chip stack, and whether or not someone else was already\nall-in)=\r\n and had very promising results.  In fact, I would argue that\nthe final net=\r\nwork was close to optimal.\n\nHowever, when I tried to apply the same general=\r\n concept to a full-out\nlimit 6-max bot, my excitement was quickly checked.\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, I would love to see someone pull of a neural network th=\r\nat\n&gt; learns to play poker well, even if it also uses a set of rules to get =\r\nit\n&gt; within range of great play. Most of the people I know who work on\npoke=\r\nr AI\n&gt; can&#39;t even get complicated expert systems/rule engines to play poker=\r\n\nwell.\n\nI&#39;ve felt this pain too.  My initial goal was to create a rule-base=\r\nd\nbot to play online poker.  I went through all the work of hacking a\ncoupl=\r\ne of different websites&#39; GUIs and made an entire framework \n(~100,000 lines=\r\n of code) for automated online play.  Then I proceeded\nto write another ~20=\r\n,000 lines of rules, attempting to enumerate every\npossible situation.\n\nI p=\r\nlayed around with different bots a lot.  I played my limit ring\ngame bot at=\r\n $2/$4 for a while and lost around 3BB/100 over a small\nsample size.  Then =\r\nI played a threshold push/fold sit-n-go bot at the\n$6 and $11 tables, and a=\r\nctually did surprisingly well.  In the end I\nwould say I broke even over ar=\r\nound ~100 tourneys, though I didn&#39;t keep\nan exact tally.\n\n\n&gt; I myself tried=\r\n some machine learning techniques and found\n&gt; it very hard to find a good r=\r\nepresentation of an individual hand of\nbetting\n&gt; history, let alone variabl=\r\ne size windows into previous hands.\n&gt; \n\nThe key here I think is to focus on=\r\n the attributes of a betting\nhistory rather than the explicit statements.  =\r\nFor instance, if you\nwant to tell the network that the previous round when\n=\r\ncheck-bet-raise-call, you could try to figure out a way to encode each\nof t=\r\nhose actions into their own history neuron.  However, you run into\nthe prob=\r\nlem of a fixed number of inputs for a dynamic number of\nbetting actions.  A=\r\n more accurate way might be to describe it in terms\nof bet level (2 in this=\r\n case) and if you were the aggressor (which\nwould be true for first positio=\r\nn and false for second position in this\ncase).  From this, and the knowledg=\r\ne of your position (in a heads-up\ngame, which is what the AAAI competition =\r\nfocuses on), you can derive\nexactly the same information since there is onl=\r\ny 1 possible betting\nsequence to match your &lt;bet level, aggressor, position=\r\n&gt; tuple.\n\nAs for representing an entire hand or series of hands, I&#39;m going =\r\nto\njust use common heuristics like post-flop aggression factor,\nvoluntarily=\r\n put $ into the pot preflop %, etc.  I&#39;ll let the network\n(hopefully) figur=\r\ne out what it all means.\n\n&gt; Do you know of other papers where NNs learned t=\r\no play decent\n&gt; poker?\n\nNot off-hand.  If anyone else knows of some related=\r\n work I should look\ninto (I&#39;m familiar with most of the UoA work, though if=\r\n I have\nforgotten something, please remind me), I&#39;d appreciate a link.\n\nAny=\r\nway, if anyone is interested in collaborating on the project with\nme, that&#39;=\r\nd be great.  I&#39;m having trouble finding people at Virginia\nTech who are bot=\r\nh up to speed on AI and interested in poker.  I have a\nC++ framework for po=\r\nker playing already built which provides most of\nthe statistics I&#39;ve mentio=\r\nned so far, as well as convenient hand\nlogging features.  I don&#39;t however h=\r\nave much experience using any of\nthe NEAT libraries, though I understand th=\r\ne concepts thoroughly.\n\n\nWesley\n\n\n"}}
