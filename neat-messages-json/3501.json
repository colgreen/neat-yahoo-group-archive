The technology behind Picbreeder is a novel NEAT-based \nGenetic\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nArt applet that is integrated into a massive growing &quot;tree of \nlife&quot;\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat never ends. Anyone who evolves a picture they like can \npublish\n&gt; &gt; it t=\r\no the world and thereby permanently add their creations to the\n&gt; &gt; ever-exp=\r\nanding tree of life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What makes Picbreeder particularly powerful a=\r\nnd unique is that you\n&gt; &gt; can *branch* from the published work of any other=\r\n user that has \ncome\n&gt; &gt; before.  In other words, you do not have to begin =\r\nfrom scratch.\n&gt; &gt; Instead, for example, if you want to a evolve a face, you=\r\n can \nbranch\n&gt; &gt; from one of the many published faces and explore an infini=\r\nte \nnumber\n&gt; &gt; of variations from that starting point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Perhaps mos=\r\nt intriguing is that we do not know what is possible to\n&gt; &gt; evolve.  As lin=\r\neages are built upon lineages, complexification in\n&gt; &gt; NEAT means that imag=\r\nes can theoretically become more and more\n&gt; &gt; complex.  Thus, in theory, an=\r\nything is possible.  In this sense\n&gt; &gt; Picbreeder&#39;s users are pioneers, exp=\r\nloring collectively a space \nthat\n&gt; &gt; has never been exhaustively explored =\r\nand discovering together\n&gt; &gt; creations that no one of us could have discove=\r\nred alone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope that you will decide to join us on Picbreeder as=\r\n we explore\n&gt; &gt; this space.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
