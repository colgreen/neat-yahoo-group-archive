I have not heard\nof any nerves in the joints that directly sense joint\nrotation, although they might exist.  So it seems that\nthe kinesthetic sense involves neural processing of\nthe raw muscle contraction data, the result being\nknowledge of where the body parts are.  I suppose we\ndon&#39;t know if that processing is wired in, or is\nlearned.  I suspect it is mostly wired in.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
