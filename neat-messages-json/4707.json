I did it saving the serializ=\r\nation of the population object. The evolution starts and moves through epoc=\r\nhs. Unfortunately I&#39;m experiencing a problem in the NEATSpecieManager class=\r\n. From line 49:\n&gt; \n&gt; if (applicantGenes[applicantIdx] instanceof NEATLinkGe=\r\nne) {\n&gt; \tweightDiffTotal +=3D (((NEATLinkGene)applicantGenes[applicantIdx])=\r\n.getWeight() - ((NEATLinkGene)repGenes[repIdx]).getWeight());\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; The =\r\nsum of weightDiffTotal at line 50 looks at the weight property of NEATLinkG=\r\nene or NEATNodeGene, because Genes can be both Links and Nodes. \n&gt; Unfortun=\r\nately, for some reason, sometimes, I get a ClassCastException because it ca=\r\nsts the object to a Link even if it&#39;s a Node.\n&gt; The applicantIdx as a certa=\r\nin value... let&#39;s say, 80, while repIdx is 1.\n&gt; To solve this I simply catc=\r\nh the exception and skip the instruction... and I know that this is bad! Th=\r\nat&#39;s why I&#39;m here.\n&gt; Should i change the cast and comprare Links with Nodes=\r\n? To be honest... i&#39;m not really sure of what&#39;s going on here.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope =\r\nyou can help me. Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
