It also includes an extensive analysis of=\r\n how exactly novelty search exploits the search space more effectively in t=\r\nhe T-Maze based on a Sammon&#39;s Mapping visualization technique that projects=\r\n the search space into two dimensions.  Other domains tested include the Do=\r\nuble T-Maze and also the Bee Domain.  We believe this work is helpful to th=\r\ne growing field of evolving plastic ANNs because such experiments are often=\r\n thwarted by deception, which novelty search can help to mitigate.\n\nIn a la=\r\nrger context, this paper adds to the growing body of evidence that novelty =\r\nsearch often does outperform objective search in nontrivial domains.  Of co=\r\nurse, that does not mean it will always work best, but it does mean that th=\r\ne objective-based paradigm is significantly more brittle than once thought,=\r\n considering that an approach that does not even know what the objective is=\r\n so often outperforms it.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
