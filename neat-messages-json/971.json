If the useless appendages hinder the\n&gt; &gt; organism or require a significant resources to grow and/or maintain then\n&gt; &gt; individuals with these characteristics will be selected against over\n&gt; &gt; time. But if the appendages aren&#39;t too expensive and aren&#39;t getting in\n&gt; &gt; the way then they can indeed stick around. One that comes to mind is the\n&gt; &gt; human appendix, and I&#39;ve never found my little toe to be all that\n&gt; &gt; useful. Well Ok you did say &#39;generally&#39; - these &#39;extras&#39; are mostly\n&gt; &gt; special cases. I agree with the general priniciple that organisms don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; carry around loads of  appendages in the hope that one might become\n&gt; &gt; useful, like some biological equivalent of a swiss army knife :)\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, I said &quot;generally&quot;, but I also said &quot;lots&quot;.  Of course there are\n&gt;instances of vestigial organs, but they are often small, withered, and\n&gt;negligible.  They are not doing enough harm to the organism to be\n&gt;strongly selected against, and the likelihood they they will become\n&gt;adaptive again at some later stage of evolution is remote.\n\nHowever, an appendix isn&#39;t a neuron.  The likelihood of a neuron being able \nto be coopted into useful service is much higher than the chances of finding \na use for the appendix.  So the analogy doesn&#39;t quite hold.\n\n\n\n"}}
