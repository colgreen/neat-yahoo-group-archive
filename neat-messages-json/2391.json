So the ANN is mapping x directly to y.\n\nI decided to experiment with an alternative technique whereby there is \nno input and I use the ANN as a sort of wave generator. I activate the \nnetwork and take a reading and repeat this as many times as I want. I \ncan then match the outputs against an expected output and hopefully \nevolve ANNs that can generate a continuous wave form.\n\nThis does seem to work to some extent, e.g. I can evolve sine wave \ngenerators easily enough, and a square wave approximation has a lot of \nrough edges and noise but the overall shape is there. So I decided to \ntry something a bit more challenging, specifically the Mackey-Glass \nseries, which can be made to generate a chaotic waveform. Here&#39;s were I \nnoticed the first problem.\n\nIf I use a low sampling rate then the output from the series rises and \nfalls within just a few activations of my ANN&#39;s and they can do a \nreasonably good job of tracking the function over short periods (I \nhaven&#39;t tried anything too long yet). If however I increase the sampling \nrate then there may be many activations between rises and falls, but the \nkind of small networks that I start out with when I initiase a run have \na very fast oscilaltion rate (or high natural frequency) due to their \nsmall size and compact interconnections. I suppose I could try and start \nwith a population of pre-built networks with a lower oscillation rate, \nbut I don&#39;t think this is a solution for the general case where a \nfunction may have many different harmonics.\n\nAnyway to give you an idea of the kind of results I&#39;ve been getting \nhere&#39;s a link to a graph showing a short section of a mackey-glass \nwaveform in black and an approximation in red. The training data is \nshown on the first third of the graph up until the black line drops to \nzero, the remaining two thirds show the network&#39;s response beyond the \ntraining data.\n\nhttp://tinypic.com/fdhssg.png\n\nThe graph shows the network generating a fairly regular output that \nroughly matches the black line, but there is no or very little matching \nof the subtle variations. The low-res approximations I tried were \ngenerally better matching waveforms.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
