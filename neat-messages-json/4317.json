I found that \nwriti=\r\nng a conversion routine (CPPN snapshot -&gt; object in world) is \nvery challen=\r\nging and prone to many bugs and artifacts. I realized that \nobject building=\r\n has to be done in another way - and I came up with \nthis simple idea. Supp=\r\nose you have a set of small sticky cubes and you \nwant to build a house, a =\r\nrobot or whatever your imagination has. You \ncan do it like this - place on=\r\ne cube and fix its position in space. \nSee how it looks like and stick one =\r\nmore cube to it (where you want). \nSee how the 2 cubes look like and then s=\r\ntick a third one. You can \nstick the cubes along the exposed sides of the f=\r\nixed construction. \nIterate this for enough time and you have the object. N=\r\no separate \nparts, everything rock-solid (although empty spaces can be cons=\r\ntructed \ninside), but has internal structure with regularities, and the obj=\r\nect \nitself may be symmetric, segmented, or perhaps just a shitty blob. \nTh=\r\nese appear often. \n\nSo let me answer to your question about what kinds of s=\r\nhapes appear. I \nactually saw all of the biological development patterns, s=\r\nymmetry, \nimperfect symmetry, repetition and repetition with variation. In =\r\n\nparticular, the most interesting objects were created when I used \nsin(x) =\r\nand sin(y) waves as input instead of the raw Cartesian \ncoordinate frames. =\r\nThey were segmented and remarkably similar to \nbiological ones. \n\nThe imple=\r\nmentation I uploaded currently &quot;divides&quot; cells, placing a \nrandom new cell =\r\nin the neighborhood of the cell of consideration. A \nbetter solution is to =\r\niterate over the exposed surfaces and place new \ncells if the CPPN says so.=\r\n \n\nThere are several issues about this idea. First of all, there is a \nprob=\r\nlem with the coordinates. We had a discussion with David about \nthem, and I=\r\n agree that I should just use the range of [-1 .. 1] for my \nsubstrate spac=\r\ne. But the objects grow. So I have to either leave my \nsubstrate to [-infin=\r\nite .. +infinite] or shrink the object every time \nit gets larger. Both doe=\r\nsn&#39;t work well, as too many garbage blobs \nappear (is it normal?), so I am =\r\ntrying to find out an alternative. One \nis that instead of inputting coordi=\r\nnates to the CPPN, only time can be \nused as input and possibly other infor=\r\nmation. I am thinking about this \none in particular:\n\nConsider this situati=\r\non, you are about to build something with the \nsticky cubes. You start mini=\r\nmally and incrementally add structure. It \nis an iterative process, in whic=\r\nh you first look at the intermediate \nconstruction, then *decide* what is m=\r\nissing and place the missing \npart. Then repeat this again until you run ou=\r\nt of cubes. Like in NEAT, \nbut there is nothing else in common. I know that=\r\n it looks like a \nprocess of exploration, but consider this.. You don&#39;t kno=\r\nw how to \nbuild make the final phenotype, but have a clear knowledge of the=\r\n \nexact *path* to building it, the sense where things belong as you \nbuild =\r\nit? My idea is, that every future state of the object can be \nviewed as a f=\r\nunction of time and the current state of the object. \nKinda confusing, isn&#39;=\r\nt it? \n\nOK let&#39;s say that an object A turns into an object B after addition=\r\n of \none structural component, which requires 1 time step. Then B =3D f(A).=\r\n \nHere is how you will produce the next object C: C =3D f(B). Then D =3D \nf=\r\n(C). And so on.. \n\nSo the CPPN can take the role of that function f(x). The=\r\n same CPPN can \nbe re-queried over and over again in time, producing a fina=\r\nl phenotype \nthat is a function of time or just all of its intermediate for=\r\nms \nbefore. The challenge is how to input the object&#39;s state in a \nmeaningf=\r\nul manner. Because the CPPN takes coordinate frames as inputs \nand outputs =\r\npoint intensity, how a whole object can be input into it? \nOr is that a CPP=\r\nN at all? Is that just a form of recurrence without \nfuture? I don&#39;t know. =\r\n\n\nBut really, when you look at a sequence of photos of developing embryo \n,=\r\n you actually see something remarkably similar to complexifying \nevolution =\r\nof CPPNs. But instead of a genetic lineage through \ncrossovers and mutation=\r\ns, this is one single phenotype developing from \na single cell to a mature =\r\nform. I believe that CPPNs and even just \nregular ANNs can abstract the tra=\r\nnsitions from one object state to \nanother very compactly. Because it is on=\r\nly adding structure, the \nphenotype increases in complexity over time even =\r\nwithout having to \ncomplexify the CPPN itself. It only has to see what it d=\r\nid so far and \ndecide what to do next. It is a hypothetical idea, I haven&#39;t=\r\n even \ntried to implement such a thing, I actually just talk about it, ther=\r\ne \nare many challenges, perhaps it is totally stupid, but I believe that \ni=\r\nt may be a path to an incredible AE capable of creating highly \ncomplex phe=\r\nnotypes from very compact genomes. What do you think about \nit? \n\nPeter C\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pe=\r\nter, you make a good point that there is a challenge in \ninterpreting\n&gt; arb=\r\nitrary CPPN patterns as distinct physical objects.  I think ideas\n&gt; like yo=\r\nurs are indeed important to explore to potentially address \nthe\n&gt; issue, an=\r\nd I found your shape-evolving novelty search program along\n&gt; those lines ve=\r\nry interesting.  Since you have most experience with \nthe\n&gt; idea, I am curi=\r\nous, do you get the sense after playing with it a lot\n&gt; that the patterns t=\r\nhat come out are indeed sufficiently diverse and\n&gt; regular to potentially r=\r\nepresent animal morphologies?  Or does there\n&gt; seem to be anything lacking =\r\nfrom the output of such systems?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d like to point =\r\nout that CPPNs can be combined effectively with \n&gt; &gt; cellular growth models=\r\n. Because the cells need the answer to the \n&gt; &gt; question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, the C=\r\nPPN can provide that info without any \n&gt; &gt; interaction between cells. It ca=\r\nn also provide instructions about, \nfor \n&gt; &gt; example &quot;Should I divide or no=\r\nt? Should I change my type?&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; While it seems like an overkill, because=\r\n CPPNs already abstract \nthis \n&gt; &gt; away without having to introduce time fo=\r\nr development, the \npatterns \n&gt; &gt; generated are hard to interpret as distin=\r\nct physical objects. \n&gt; &gt; Especially in cases of repeating patterns. But ob=\r\njects generated \nwith \n&gt; &gt; cellular growth instructed by CPPNs produce only=\r\n a single object, \nall \n&gt; &gt; with its distinct parts and regularities. And n=\r\not ripped apart \nwith \n&gt; &gt; artifacts as it would be after converting it fro=\r\nm a CPPN snapshot \n&gt; &gt; image. One might say that such objects can still be =\r\ninfinte in \nsize, \n&gt; &gt; but it is easy to put a limitation on the number of =\r\ncells or cell \n&gt; &gt; divisions. It is also possible to make the limit dynamic=\r\n, more \ncomplex \n&gt; &gt; CPPNs producing phenotypes with more cells.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P=\r\neter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alexandre, thank you for bringing up reaction-diffusion sy=\r\nstems.  \n&gt; &gt; You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make a good point- my statement was too broad, in pa=\r\nrt because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;cellular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that ca=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; potentially refer to many types of systems.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to =\r\nclarify my statement, I was responding the line of \n&gt; &gt; discussion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wi=\r\nth Peter about encodings that actually create distinct bodily \n&gt; &gt; shapes\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; that are self-contained and have clear structural boundaries \n(which\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reaction-diffusion systems tend not to produce; rather they \nproduce\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; wallpaper-like patterns).
