In the code there\nappears to be several different stopping conditions \nsome of which are commented out.  I&#39;m trying to see if\nmy implementation at least produces comparable \nresults.  \n\nIf the condition is:\n\noutput for [0,0] &lt; 0.5\noutput for [1,0] &gt;= 0.5\noutput for [0,1] &gt;= 0.5\noutput for [1,1] &lt; 0.5\n\nThen I am getting reasonably comparable results.  I \nhaven&#39;t collected statistics yet but it seems to \nevolve a successful net in 15-40 generations \n(population size 100) on average.\n\nI&#39;m almost positvie I haven&#39;t implemented all the \ndifferent routines/options for generating a new \npopulation.  Am I cheating by doing (approximately) \nthis:\n\n0. Number of children for each species determined by \nspecies average fitness\n\n1. Direct copy species champ for any species that is\ndesignated to get at least 1 child.\n\n2.  70% chance for child by crossover of parents \nselected from species.  Selection is biased by \nindividual fitness within species.  Weights can be\nperturbed by a small amount\n\n3. 3% chance for child created adding node by \nmutation. Selection of individual to mutate is biased \nby individual fitness within species\n\n4. 4% chance for child created adding connection by \nmutation. Selection of individual to mutate is biased \nby individual fitness within species\n\nAfter I feel a little more comfortable with my code,\nI&#39;ll make it available if anyone wants.  Its fairly slow.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger.\nhttp://messenger.yahoo.com/ \n\n"}}
