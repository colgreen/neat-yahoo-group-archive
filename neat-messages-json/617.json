Some sets of distances are \ninherently inconsistent (e.g. if A&lt;-&gt;B = 1 and B&lt;-&gt;C = 1 and A&lt;-&gt;C = 3 -- I \nbelieve with complex ordinates you can cover this...?).  Others can only be \nguaranteed to lay out in N - 1 dimensions.\n\nThat need not be too much of a problem, you could usually get a \n&quot;reasonable&quot; layout, and your original expression in terms of attractions \nand repulsions, rather than distances, already acknowledges this, however:\n\n2) topological problems can wipe you out -- e.g. it can easily be the case \nthat the required topology of connections, if squashed into 2D, contains so \nmany unavoidable line-crossings that it breaks the diagram.  In this case \nwhat you see is two unconnected groups of nodes get forced into close \nproximity because (i) some edge in group1 has cross an edge in group 2, but \n(ii) the radii of the two groups are too large for them to be kept apart if \nboth those edges are present\n\n3) initial layout can be irresolvable --  if A is attracted to B but is \ninitially positioned on the far side of some heavily-interconnected block \nof nodes, then the attractive force of A and B may be unable to force A to \npass through the block (or worse enough to drag it into the block but not \nout the far side)\n\nYou can play with the relative force strengths to improve this a bit, but \ngenerally it can only go so far because as a technique it&#39;s not really \nconsidering the factors a human wants in the diagram.  It works really well if:\n\n1) fairly few edges\n2) topology fits in 2D\n3) can start with a layout which respects topology\n\nAnd to answer the question in another post, yes it can be CPU \nintensive.  There&#39;s a dependence on M (number of edges) and N^2 (number of \nnodes, squared) but worse, walking such a system down hill can require \nmillions of iterations (better optimization routines can be used, but can \nget unstable on steep hillsides).  A Monte Carlo approach might be better \nable to step out of start-up glitches -- you almost need a GA to do the \nlayout...\n\nThe basic force-field approach can be worth experimenting with, but it&#39;s \nnot a &quot;magic&quot; fix, and tinkering with it can eat up days of programmer time...\n\n\tIan B\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
