Beer.\nhttp://www.ifi.unizh.ch/ailab/teaching/NN2007/misc/Beer_CTRNNDynamics_1995.pdf\n\nAnd for a classical example about evolving oscillating behaviors with\nleaky integrators:\nhttp://birg2.epfl.ch/publications/fulltext/ijspeert01.pdf\nBy A. J. Ijspeert.\n\nBtw, about the current debate, I think that giving a sinusoid as one\nof the input simplifies a lot the task.\nMore precisely :\n\n - an oscillating network has to be recurrent, that&#39;s a substantially\n larger search space than feed-forward networks ;\n\n - it&#39;s easy but not immediate to get a sinusoid using leaky\n integrators; as a consequence, you need first to obtain stable\n oscillating behaviors (and reward it using your fitness) before\n having a setup somehow similar to the sinusoid one.\n\n - using a sinusoid, the only knowledge to be found is the correct\n delays between each moto-neuron and the input sinusoid; it&#39;s easier\n than finding a robust oscillating pattern correctly linked to each\n moto-neuron.\n\nBut, using leaky integrators is more interesting because:\n - a network of leaky integrators is a &quot;universal temporal\n approximator&quot;, so, theoretically, you could get oscillating but\n non-sinusoidal patterns (actually, it&#39;s a lot harder than evolving a\n sinusoidal pattern) ;\n\n - the properties of leaky integrators oscillators make possible to\n obtain non-linear oscillators, which have a lot of synchronization\n properties (more later);\n\n - you could create tunable oscillators that adapts the locomotion\n  pattern with respect to the sensor data (see Ijspeert&#39;s paper).\n\nHaving worked a lot with leaky integrators for locomotion, I\nthink you should use non-linear oscillators instead of them. These\noscillators have most of the properties of synchronization of\nbiological oscillators and are simpler to use since they have all the\ngood properties from scratch.\n\nFor quadruped locomotion, you can read :\n\n- Adaptive dynamic walking of a quadruped robot on irregular terrain\n by using neural system model\nH Kimura, Y Fukuoka, Y Hada, K Takase - A]. IEEE/RSJ. Intelligent\nRobots and Systems, 2000\n\nwith the videos on this page:\nhttp://robotics.mech.kit.ac.jp/research/photo-movie-UEC-e.html (see\nTekken 2 & Tekken 4)\n(note that this behavior is not evolved but it&#39;s neuron-based).\n\n-  From Swimming to Walking with a Salamander Robot Driven by a Spinal\n  Cord Model\n  AJ Ijspeert, A Crespi, D Ryczko, JM Cabelguen - Science, 2007\n(again, no evolution but you can find some papers combining evolution\n  & non-linear oscillators).\n\nLast, about commercial/military applications, I&#39;m sure you all have\nseen the impressive Big Dog video...\n\nI will present two papers at CEC, we will probably meet there.\n\nBest regards,\n--\nJean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\ntel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n3 ((4&({*.(=+/))++/=3:)@([:,/0&,^:(i.3)@|:&quot;2^:2))&.&gt;@]^:(i.@[) &lt;#:3 6\n2\n\n\n"}}
