The game\n&gt;&gt; domain allowed even larger input/output spaces (i.e. the kind of problem\n&gt;&gt; MNEAT could excel at), but performance could be evaluated after letting\n&gt;&gt; the network play a few games.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I suspect the same problem is still present in game playing since you\n&gt; can only evaluate a small proportion of the possible paths in the game -\n&gt; usually determined by the opponents you are playing against. In fact\n&gt; with co-evolution the networks will normally (I think) end up playing\n&gt; within a very narrow range of game strategies - which means they perform\n&gt; poorly when played against humans or even simple algorithmic strategies\n&gt; they have never encountered before. Although I&#39;m happy to be proved\n&gt; wrong on this, that partly my experience so in some limited Tic-Tac-Toe\n&gt; co-evolution experiments I&#39;ve been working on (more on those another time).\n\nIn general yes, this is a /huge/ problem, but for the benchmark we avoided \nthis by making the game single player. We also used very simple criterion \nfor determining score, and limited the number of initial configurations \narbitrarily.  From this we have several nice properties:\n\n1) deterministic evaluation\n2) the ability to recognize networks that played perfectly from the \nscore.\n3) relatively quick evaluation (because we limit the # of initial \nconfigurations). Note that this does not make the game any easier, it just \nremoves a bunch of redundant test configurations.\n\nSo basically we got all of the nice properties of board games (huge search \nspace, high branching factor, etc) without all of the properties that make \nboard games such a challenge in general.\n\n&gt; NEAT Benchmarking can/could be useful for:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Comparing various NEAT implementations&#39; relative strengths / \n&gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; 2) Tracking the effects of any given change to a NEAT based algorithm.\n\nI&#39;m /very/ interested in seeing results in this area, as it would \nelucidate further the effects of various NEAT optimizations, and parameter \ntweaking, as well as help determine how robust NEAT is as an algorithm.\n\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
