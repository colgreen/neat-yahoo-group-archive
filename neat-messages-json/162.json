Prefereably\n&gt; modified to expose a \n&gt; &gt; standard interface (or one of a set of interfaces)\n&gt; that we define for \n&gt; &gt; use in EANN/GA type projects.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree that having a central repository is a really\n&gt; good idea for\n&gt; neuroevolution.  Does anyone want to run such a\n&gt; repository?  I could\n&gt; point the neuroevolution.com domain to it.  I guess\n&gt; it would be some\n&gt; kind of web page that can accept uploads.\n&gt; \n&gt; Our Files section on this group is turning into a\n&gt; kind of repository,\n&gt; but it would be nice to have one generally available\n&gt; to the public,\n&gt; inclding people not interested in NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
