I\n&gt; also agree with yo=\r\nur argument that a lot of the low-level phenomena we see\n&gt; may be a result =\r\nof implementation with particular physical systems (and I\n&gt; would add perha=\r\nps as a result of evolutionary happenstance). The CPPN is a\n&gt; particularly =\r\ncompelling example of significant abstraction of developmental\n&gt; processes,=\r\n producing many of the same features of the end result of\n&gt; developmental p=\r\nrocesses. One thing it does abstract away, in the context of\n&gt; plastic netw=\r\norks, is the effect of external input on the developmental\n&gt; process (which=\r\n may or may not be an issue depending on details of\n&gt; implementation, probl=\r\nem domain, etc...).\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps we could also assume that, rather than som=\r\ne specific set of\n&gt; functions being the only workable set, what matters is =\r\nhaving a workable\n&gt; combination of functions, and that there are many possi=\r\nble combinations\n&gt; that would work equally well. In this framework we could=\r\n assume that\n&gt; biological neural networks represent at least a reasonably g=\r\nood combination\n&gt; of low-level functions, and so we could use this combinat=\r\nion as a guide\n&gt; (but of course this doesn&#39;t answer what functions in this =\r\ncombination are\n&gt; actually important, or what things can be abstracted away=\r\n). Also, some\n&gt; combinations may be workable, but are far harder to evolve =\r\nsolutions with,\n&gt; or require much larger networks, etc (eg evolving network=\r\ns incorporating\n&gt; neuromodulation of synaptic plasticity can be much easier=\r\n for some tasks\n&gt; than for those without this type of neuromodulation).\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I&#39;m intending to run some experiments to explore these questions (which\n&gt;=\r\n phenomena are important, acceptable level of abstraction, etc), but of\n&gt; c=\r\nourse to try and thoroughly explore all of these functions in many\n&gt; combin=\r\nations would be a massive undertaking, and is not my main interest,\n&gt; so at=\r\n some point I will have to pick a model and run with it after only a\n&gt; few,=\r\n hopefully well chosen, experiments... Perhaps one approach is to\n&gt; create =\r\nflexible parameterised versions of these functions, and let\n&gt; evolution det=\r\nermine what combination is right (like your approach described\n&gt; in &quot;Evolvi=\r\nng adaptive neural networks with and without adaptive synapses&quot;,\n&gt; but perh=\r\naps more flexible and applied to more functions).\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you mind if I pos=\r\nt/quote some/all of this discussion in the comments of\n&gt; my blog post?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
