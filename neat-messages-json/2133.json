The longer a species &quot;inhabits&quot; an\narea of the search space, the more poisoned it becomes. (With a decay\nfactor, of course.)  Poinsoned areas could decrease inhabitants\nfitness, motivating them to leave.  Agents with a high enough fitness\nwould not be affected.  \n\nSimilar effects could be attained by genes each consuming a resource\nof some sort.  Members of a species would consume a similar set of\nresources.  If you limit the resources, you limit the size of a\nspecies&#39; population, and how many agents can search an area of the\nspace.  This is also another way for species to compete and cooperate\nin complex ways, especially if agents are able to produce resources.\n(Possibly linked to their fitness evaluation.)\n\nGreG\n\n\n\n\n"}}
