For a 7x7 input and a 8x8 output, they (who did \nthis before using back propagation) required about 30-40 hidden nodes in \norder to do 4x enlargement.  That&#39;s a lot of topology, and it takes a while \nto evolve a lot of topology.  What I&#39;m asking it to do is even more \ncomplicated, which means it will probably require even more topology.  So I \nimagine I should expect it to take a while to evolve.\n\nThis project might be a prime example of where modularity is required.  I \nneed one network to form a model of the input pixels, and another to \nfacilitate querying that model.  Trying to evolve them together might be a \nlosing proposition, because there isn&#39;t a smooth fitness hill to climb.\n\nMaybe I could ask it to JUST recreate its pixel inputs without recreating \nanything in between.  That way the network is forced to evolve such that it \ncan accept those four inputs and make something of them.  From there, there \nmight be a smooth evolutionary path to enlargement.\n\nI think I will go ahead and try giving every node a connection to the BIAS \ninput and see what kind of difference that makes, too...  Seems like it \nwould never hurt, it could only help.\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
