I renamed\nit from Autonomous Virtual Humans to Verve.  Verve\nwill be an Open Source tool, mainly for game\ndevelopers.  The goal is to let game developers train\nneural nets to control their characters (humans,\nanimals, monsters, robots, vehicles, etc.) to perform\nany desired behavior, then use these &quot;behavior\ncontrollers&quot; in a game instead of using scripted\nanimation sequences.\n\nI still need to make a lot of improvements before this\ntool will be usable, but I&#39;m making progress.  I&#39;ve\nposted more info on the Verve website -\nwww.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/verve/main.html,\nincluding two new videos that show a biped character\nstarting to walk.\n\nAny comments are welcome.\n\nTyler Streeter\n\nP.S.  I&#39;ve been keeping up with the news on this group\nover the past several months.  I especially like what\nJohn Arrowwood has done to distribute the CPU load\nduring evolution.  I might spend some time in the\nfuture trying to do something similar.\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
