We are using different functions!\nYou are=\r\n using 1/(1+ exp(-4.9x)) and I am using 1/(1 + exp(-x)). If you\nset the par=\r\nameter aResponse =3D 1/4.9 when you call the poly function it\nwill produce =\r\nthe same curve and values as you have been seeing. The\nconstant 4.9 you are=\r\n using just scales the input and is variable in\nthe code I am using. In oth=\r\ner words it evolves to different values so\nit is not constant at 4.9. If yo=\r\nu look at the poly function&#39;s\nsignature you&#39;ll see that there is two input =\r\nparameters. aNetinput and\naResponse and x=3D aNetInput/aResponse within the=\r\n function body.\n\n--Shane\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;ste=\r\nve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Apr 20, 2007, at 5:58 AM, shanemcdonaldryan wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think you are looking at too narrow a range of values (-1 to 1).\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do you think that?
