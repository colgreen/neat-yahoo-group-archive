These interpolations you have listed here are generally for\n&gt; interpolation between pixels when zooming in*.  Zooming-out most commonly\n&gt; works by averaging pixels in an area.  I would not normally think of it as\n&gt; expensive, but I guess it depends whether you have to recalculate it over\n&gt; and over...\n\nAll of our scale transformations are zooming out.  And, we do have to\ncalculate it over and over since the eye is constantly able to move,\nrotate, and zoom.  Area averaging winds up taking about twice as long\nas bilinear, but bilinear is very choppy and loses a lot of\ninformation.  I think our networks are each performing somewhere on\nthe order of 100-200 steps per image and about 20 images per\ngeneration (is that right, Derek?)\n\n&gt; How about providing the net with Min(area) and Max(area)?  When you get\n&gt; down to a single pixel, they are the same.  \n\nIt does have a min zoom factor.  It can not zoom out any farther than\nit taked to see the entire surface.  So, for example, if the eye size\nis 5x5 and the surface size is 50x50, the zoom factor will be between\n100% (zoomed all the way in, it sees a 5x5 area of the raw surface)\nand 10% (zoomed all the way out, it sees a &quot;blurred&quot; 50x50 area).\n\n&gt; Is the area always square?  (and it so, why? :)  \n\nSquare is all we&#39;ve done so far, but it should support rectangular areas.  \n\n&gt; Is it axis aligned?\n\nWhat do you mean by &quot;axis aligned&quot;?.  We allow rotations in increments\nsmaller than 90 degrees, if that&#39;s what you mean.\n\n"}}
