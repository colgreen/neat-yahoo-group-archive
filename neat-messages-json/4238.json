On t=\r\nhe\nsame day I found HyperNeat. And as I am a c# developer I want to use\nHyp=\r\nerSharpNeat.\n\nRegarding this one I have some initial questions. Maybe someb=\r\nody has\ntime to answer some of these questions.\n\n1) To create a new experim=\r\nent I only need to implement classes with\nthe interfaces IExperiment, INetw=\r\norkEvaluator,\nMultiThreadedPopulationEvaluator (here I can just use the bas=\r\ne method\nas demonstrated in Skirmish experiment). Am I right?\nCan I also us=\r\ne the base Substrate class or will I need to create my\nown? I want to give =\r\nmy networks the possibilities to use different\nactivation functions. That&#39;s=\r\n what the substrate class is for, am I right?\n\n2) Calling MultipleSteps(n).=\r\n Let&#39;s say I have a network with 1 input,\n1 output and 2 hidden layers. Cal=\r\nling SingleStep / MultipleSteps(1) I\nasume, that the values from the input =\r\nlayer will be propagated to the\nfirst hidden layer. The values from the fir=\r\nst hidden layer to the\nsecond and the second hidden layer values to the out=\r\nput layer. So I\nwould need to call MultipleSteps(3) / MultipleSteps(1+\nNumb=\r\nerOfHiddenLayers) till the input values reached the output. Is\nthis correct=\r\n? Why is there a need to set this value. Is it not\npossible to just do so m=\r\nany steps till the input reached the output?\nMaybe I am also misunderstandi=\r\nng things here.\n\n3) Activation functions: I want to give the network all ac=\r\ntivation\nfunctions that are possible so it has more to choose from. Hyperbo=\r\nlic\ntangent is one mainly used activation function used in normal\nperceptio=\r\nn networks. Is there a reason that it is not available. Or is\nit obsolete d=\r\nue to an other function that is taking this place? Or\nshall I add it? \n\n4) =\r\nMaybe you can also help me out on this, too. I have much binary\ninputs and =\r\noutputs. Should I just use (0 / 1) or convert it to (0 /\n0.5) or\n(-0.5 / 0.=\r\n5). Do you have experiences on here?\n\nThank you very much for your answers =\r\nin advance!\n\nKind regards,\n\nChristian\n\n\n"}}
