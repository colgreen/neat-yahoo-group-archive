This is a \nvery complex =\r\nproblem. The problem is not that every GA is evolving to \na predefined targ=\r\net and easily skips promising genomes. The problem \nis the difference betwe=\r\nen the GAs and nature. In nature, there is no \nsomebody like God who says &quot;=\r\nYou&#39;re good and you deserve to mate, and \nyou will die&quot;. The organisms are =\r\nchoosing their mates. So, a very \ngood genome will not survive just because=\r\n its phenotype can eat a lot \nor live longer.. In fact, the phenotypes them=\r\nselves tell which is \ngood, very indirectly. This kind of indirection need =\r\nto be \nabstracted. If we want to achieve a lot of complexity that was never=\r\n \ndiscovered by humans, we have to give the individuals the power of... \nSa=\r\ny, it&#39;s like democracy in human society. \nWhat I see in Picbreeder and IEC =\r\nat all, is that the human takes the \nrole of each indivudual, when he sees =\r\none. As I run my view through \nthese 15 images, for each one I am thinking =\r\nof the image as it was \nme. I say &quot;I&#39;m looking fine!&quot;, or &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so ugly!=\r\n&quot;. \nSo, the way to automate this kind of process is to find a way to let \nt=\r\nhe individuals express themselves. The human designer sets up the \nenvironm=\r\nent, of course, but everything else should happen \nautomatically. The selec=\r\ntion method must be very very different than \nthe usual, I guess. \nHow we c=\r\nan put this into something practical? I have some \nsuggestions, but it turn=\r\ns out to be a kind of Alife stuff. Well, I \ncannot even express myself! :) =\r\n\nDoes somebody have any ideas? \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
