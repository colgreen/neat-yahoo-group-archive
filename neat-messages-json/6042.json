I think you raise a very interesting\n&gt; question about the degree of regularity in these creatures. Of course, I\n&gt; don&#39;t speak for the authors but one thing I&#39;m sure you also noticed is the\n&gt; completely disorganized and amorphous directly-encoded individual in figure\n&gt; 7. Compared to that, it&#39;s clear even here the CPPNs are having a\n&gt; significant organizing effect on these overall morphologies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, I noticed the very disorganized phenotype that resulted from direct\nencoding, but is the linkage between direct/indirect encodings and\nregularity maybe not that tightly coupled? Just to be clear, we&#39;re defining\ndirect encodings as 1 gene -&gt; 1 trait, and indirect encodings as a 1 gene\n-&gt; multiple traits, right? In that case, you could certainly come up with\ndirect encodings that exhibit a high degree of regularity, as well as\nindirect encodings that don&#39;t. I certainly see how an indirect encoding\n*can* buy you more regularity, but whether or not that&#39;s the case seems\nhighly dependent on the specifics of the encoding.\n\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, it&#39;s still an interesting question why these creatures\n&gt; aren&#39;t even more regular, so I wanted to throw out a hypothesis: It&#39;s\n&gt; speculation at this point, but I would guess part of the effect seen here\n&gt; is the &quot;objective paradox&quot; caused by rewarding them only for walking\n&gt; farther. That kind of very explicit objective encourages piecewise kind of\n&gt; improvement, i.e. if I add some idiosyncratic element to my body and it\n&gt; makes me just a bit faster, that element will get rewarded and tacked on to\n&gt; my lineage forever. In addition, if I discover some kind of overarching\n&gt; regularity like bilateral symmetry, it will not be retained unless it\n&gt; immediately significantly improves my gait. So I&#39;d speculate that you&#39;d see\n&gt; more regularity with some kind of behavioral and/or morphological diversity\n&gt; pressure (like novelty search, novelty search with local competition, or\n&gt; some kind of multiobjectivization like MOLE) rather than just pushing only\n&gt; for faster and faster walkers, because diversity pressures can reward and\n&gt; hold onto overall changes in organization even if they don&#39;t immediately\n&gt; lead to improvements in ambulation. Of course, the authors acknowledge this\n&gt; issue themselves in their discussion as well, so it&#39;s clearly already on\n&gt; their minds, but certainly interesting to look at in the future.\n&gt;\nThat certainly makes sense. It raises the question of how bilateral\nsymmetry arose in biological organisms. Maybe this has been brought up on\nthe list before, but is there a good source to paleontology studies that\nestimates when bilateral symmetry arose and whether or not it might have\nbeen a result of piecewise improvement (i.e. gradualism) or some dramatic\njump in the search space (i.e. punctuated equilibrium)? Maybe this just\nisn&#39;t well understood. I don&#39;t know the literature on this at all.\n\nAlso, if we&#39;re explicitly evolving walkers/crawlers/swimmers is it really\nmuch of a cheat to go ahead and enforce a high degree of bilateral symmetry\nin the phenotypes, since we know from biological organisms all the benefits\nthat come with it? It would seem fine to do that if our goal is just to\nevolve really fast, really efficient movers.\n\r\n--047d7bdca2a266042304da55c786\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Sat, Apr 13, 2013 at 4:00 PM, Ken &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt=\r\n;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:kstanley@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kstanley@...=\r\nexas.edu&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\ngmail_quote&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;=\r\nborder-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;&lt;div style&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nHi Derek, nice to see you back.
