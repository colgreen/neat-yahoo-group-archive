However, in general, as lon=\r\ng as your domain is deterministic and your fitness function is static, ther=\r\ne is nothing wrong with only updating the new genomes&#39; fitness values.   Ho=\r\nwever, there are many situations where you would want to reevaluate all gen=\r\nomes during every generation.  This post: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/neat/message/4956 contains an example of one, basically you should reeval=\r\nuate everyone if there is any chance that you will get a different fitness =\r\nvalue by doing so.\n\nDavid D&#39;Ambrosio\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rvonwah=\r\nlde&quot; &lt;rvonwahlde@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In Bucklands Windows NEAT, the fittest gen=\r\nomes in each species are kept from the previous generation (elitism). These=\r\n are not mutated.  Therefore, is it correct that there should be no reason =\r\nto update their fitness scores?\n&gt; \n&gt; My NEAT application uses the neural ne=\r\nts in a simulation.  An unmutated neural net will return the same output an=\r\nd therefore fitness each time.\n&gt; \n&gt; To save run time, I only update newly m=\r\nutated or crossovered genomes.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
