We =\r\nare also hosting an official GAR server with high capacity because of our f=\r\nast connection at UCF.\n&gt; \n&gt; This project was very complex, in effect involv=\r\ning the implementation of not just a game, but an online service and a nove=\r\nl evolutionary algorithm, so there could be a few unanticipated hiccups in =\r\nthe first release, but I think you will find it entertaining and interestin=\r\ng.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
