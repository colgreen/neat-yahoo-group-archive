What did\n&gt; you think of it?\n&gt; \n\nYes I did read it, though I wasn&#39;t an official reviewer.  In general,\nthe official reviewers are anonymous.  But I read it since I know\nEdwin de Jong and he sent me a copy, and I sent him back a lot of\ncomments.  I thought it was a very good paper.  It really gives you a\nbroad general sense of what it takes to become good at a particular\ngame, and a theoretical sense of how challenging that really is. \nBecause of this, I am not certain that the current form of the\nalgorithm is really that practical, since it is based on creating a\ntheoretically optimal competition.  The problem is that in practice,\nit is probably too computationally expensive to do that.  (That is,\nhaving all the players play all the test cases would just take too\nlong in any serious game.)  I spoke briefly to de Jong about this and\nhe agreed at the time that some kind of sampling (i.e. not doing all\nthe comparisons) might be necessary in some domains, and I kind of\nhave the feeling that the &quot;next generation&quot; of this algorithm would\ninclude a principled sampling component.  That, I believe, would make\na really good competitive coevolution methodology, and probably would\nreplace what I consider the current best practical method (Rosin and\nBelew 1997).\n\n&gt; I found some of the ideas interesting, though I didn&#39;t\n&gt; understand some, and I wasn&#39;t especially clear on the\n&gt; experimental setup.\n&gt; \n&gt; I like the idea of Multi-Objective Optimization and of\n&gt; specifying a population of Evaluators that test\n&gt; Learners on specific objectives, though I don&#39;t admit\n&gt; to understanding how this actually works in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve already found in some informal experimentation\n&gt; with unspeciated NEAT applied to Tic-Tac-Toe that\n&gt; populations evolved directly against random movers\n&gt; learn how to complete 2-in-a-row to get to a\n&gt; 3-in-a-row win, and that those evolved directly\n&gt; against perfect players learn how to block opponent&#39;s\n&gt; winning moves but perform poorly against random movers\n&gt; because they never learn how to complete winning moves\n&gt; (a perfect player never allows this situation).\n&gt; \n&gt; Can these two behavioral traits (completing winning\n&gt; moves and blocking opponent&#39;s winning moves) be viewed\n&gt; as discrete objectives?  And then both of these types\n&gt; of Evaluators (one that allows completions of winning\n&gt; moves and one that makes winning moves to be blocked)\n&gt; would have to evolve in de Jong and Pollack&#39;s DELPHI\n&gt; paradigm, in order to test Learners against?\n&gt; \n\nYes I think you make a good conceptual anology.  Your two ways of\nevaluating tic tac toe are roughly two objectives.  What would happen\nin practice with the DELPHI algorithm is that a whole lot other\nobjectives would be revealed and you would be able to construct a\n&quot;front&quot; that represented that various ways that players could be good.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m just not clear on how Evaluators are chosen to be\n&gt; representatives of specific objectives and how DELPHI\n&gt; would work in practice with a game domain, even a\n&gt; simple one such as Tic-Tac-Toe.\n&gt; \n\nMy guess would be it actually could work well with Tic-Tac-Toe, since\nTic-Tac-Toe is such a computationally inexpensive game.  The\ncomputational power is probably there to totally apply the DELPHI\nmethodology and get really good results.  Of course all this assumes\nthat the other parts of your evolutionary algorithm work well too.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
