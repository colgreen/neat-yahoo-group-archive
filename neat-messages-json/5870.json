Some of\n&gt; Khan and Miller&#39;s work evolves neural networks=\r\n that must self-organise due\n&gt; to starting out with random structures at th=\r\ne start of every life-time. So\n&gt; it&#39;s great to have a paper that describes =\r\na neural network model that can\n&gt; learn via an explicit self-organising pro=\r\ncess.\n\nHi Oliver,\n\ncan you tell me, which paper you mean? I also think that=\r\n self-organizing mechanisms that are influenced by input from the environme=\r\nnt are an important ingredient for the emergence of functions. I think the =\r\npapers that I mentioned in this post\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ne=\r\nat/message/5849\n\npoint to interesting concepts (e.g. self-stabilizing mecha=\r\nnisms in neurons) that should be further investigated in simulations.\n\nI al=\r\nso enjoyed very much this paper &quot;Evolution of declarative memory&quot;\n\nhttp://w=\r\nww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16881079\n\nwhich makes the point that the anatomy=\r\n of the hippocampus (and therefore probably its function) is very well cons=\r\nerved across mammals but depending on the neocortex to which it is attached=\r\n (e.g. in the fruit bat or chinchilla) the observable properties change. So=\r\n the behavioral function of a matured neural network should be distinguishe=\r\nd from the properties of the network independent from its environment.\n\nBes=\r\nt,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
