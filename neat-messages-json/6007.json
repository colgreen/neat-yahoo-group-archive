From this perspective, your paper=\r\n would state\n&gt; that modules can arise without any definition of modules in =\r\nthe genetic\n&gt; code (arguing against global pattern formation as the driving=\r\n factor for\n&gt; the evolutionary origin of modules). However, I think you reg=\r\nard the number\n&gt; of connections (and possibly the targets of connections) a=\r\ns part of the\n&gt; genetic code (as you do it in your simulations). In this ca=\r\nse, connection\n&gt; cost influences the genetic code towards lower connections=\r\n and thereby\n&gt; producing an encoding for modules.\n&gt;\n&gt; This leads to the que=\r\nstion, how much depends the number of connections in\n&gt; a neural network on =\r\nthe encoding (and how much just on environmental\n&gt; factors / physical laws)=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Clearly influenced by the cited articles, my humble and unp=\r\nroven\n&gt; opinion is that modularity emerges as a side-effect of the fact tha=\r\nt\n&gt; sensors and motors already represent something like modules and that\n&gt; =\r\nself-organizing mechanisms and mechanisms to evolve and alter global\n&gt; patt=\r\nerns contribute to the elaboration of these modules.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The br=\r\nain is a huge collection of 100 trillion connections and billions\n&gt; of neur=\r\nons=85very few of those directly connect to external sensors and\n&gt; actuator=\r\ns.
