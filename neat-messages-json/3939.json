I&#39;ve been looking at the food gathering experiment\n&gt; discussed=\r\n in the paper  &quot;A Novel Generative Encoding for Exploiting\n&gt; Neural Network=\r\n Sensor and Output Geometry,&quot; and would love to have the\n&gt; source code for =\r\nit because i plan on doing a similar experiment. I\n&gt; downloaded the  HyperN=\r\neat v 1.0 source code and it included some\n&gt; experiments, but not that one.=\r\n Could anyone send me that code or point\n&gt; me to a download? Thanks!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
