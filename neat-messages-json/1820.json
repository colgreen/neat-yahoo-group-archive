The\noutputs of this ANN would be the inputs to the main\nANN that is being evolved.\n\nFor example, consider a board game played on a\nrectangular board of NxN squares.  The initial ANN\nreceives all the inputs but maps them into a set of\noutputs that is equivalent to a rotation of the board\nso that most of the pieces are in the lower left\ncorner.  This pre-processing does not have to be done\nby an ANN, but it could be.  The net effect would be\nas if the player viewed the board from various\npositions until he found the one with the pieces\narranged most toward the lower left.  This greatly\nreduces the variety of configurations that must be\nconsidered, although they are still considerable. \nThis might allow tic-tac-toe to be solved by\nneuroevolution.\n\nI hope I have not been too laconic; I will expand if\nasked.\n\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
