In every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except the very simplest, NEAT takes up a tiny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fraction of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computation time.  It&#39;s the evaluations that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expensive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Each evaluation requires the operation (or\n&gt; &gt;computation) of the neural net itself, i.e., giving it\n&gt; &gt;some inputs, and progagating the signals through the\n&gt; &gt;network.  When you studied the time required for\n&gt; &gt;evaluation did you separate it into time for\n&gt; &gt;problem-specific code vs. neural net computation code?\n&gt; &gt;  For a complex network with many connections that\n&gt; &gt;might be substantial.\n&gt; \n&gt; How would that distinction be helpful?  Are you thinking that \nthere might be \n&gt; ways of optimizing the network computation step?  And you want to \nknow \n&gt; whether the effort is worthwhile?  For some domains, it would be...\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m also not totally sure what Mitchell is getting at with this \ndistinction, but what I can say is that it depends a lot on the \nproblem domain.  If you are doing realistic physical simulations, \nmost likely the neural network activation is a negligable expense \ncompared to the simulation itself.  On the other hand if you are \ndoing something that only takes one or two activations to complete \nan evaluation on preprocessed inputs, like XOR, then the activation \nis most of the expense.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
