There is\ndefinitely r=\r\noom for innovation on the way that most NEAT\nimplementations (including my =\r\nown) currently partition species, which\nis not very sophisticated.  \n\nMy im=\r\nplementation currently chooses a single representative of each\nspecies and =\r\nnew individuals in the population are compared with the\nlist of representat=\r\nives in order.  The new individual is placed in the\nfirst species with a re=\r\npresentative that is within the compatibility\ndistance.  \n\nOne other thing =\r\nsome people don&#39;t realize is that my implementation\nsorts the genomes in ea=\r\nch species in order of their fitness, which\nmeans ultimately that the repre=\r\nsentative becomes the individual with\nhighest fitness.\n\nI bring that up bec=\r\nause I think it&#39;s an interesting question whether a\nspecies should be &quot;anch=\r\nored&quot; to one of its earliest exemplars, or\nwhether it should be centered ar=\r\nound its most fit member.  \n\nIntuitively, the idea that individuals are par=\r\ntitioned into species\nbased on a principled clustering algorithm seems bett=\r\ner than simply\nplacing them into the species with the first matching repres=\r\nentative\n(it may be worth checking the clustering algorithms that are out\nt=\r\nhere).  The &quot;borders&quot; of species would be less overlapping with the\ncluster=\r\ning approach.  \n\nHowever, I feel less certain about the idea of anchoring s=\r\npecies.  In\nnature, species certainly are free to drift in character.  Of c=\r\nourse,\nwe don&#39;t have to do things like nature and should not take it as a\nr=\r\nule, but it does raise why anchoring should help?  The alternative in\nwhich=\r\n species are centered around their most fit individual (who can\nchange) see=\r\nms potentially superior.  What do you think, Colin?  After\nall, I would rat=\r\nher have a species defined by a competent member than\nthe first barely-func=\r\ntional pioneer who happened to come on the scene.\n\nSo I like the clustering=\r\n idea, but I am not sure about the anchoring\naspect.\n\nFinally, the idea of =\r\nkeeping a queue of old species and keeping\nevolution away from those areas =\r\nis also interesting.  However, I am\nnot sure that it would have much effect=\r\n because it seems unlikely that\nevolution would end up back in an old part =\r\nof *genotypic* space (which\nis what speciation measures), considering that =\r\ngenomes are changing in\ntopology.  To get back to an old topology from a lo=\r\nng time ago seems\nunlikely.  So while it shouldn&#39;t hurt, it is an interesti=\r\nng question\nwhether the old queue will get used very often.\n\nBy the way, ju=\r\nst for definitional clarification, keeping a queue of\nold species differs f=\r\nrom the &quot;novelty search&quot; that Joel Lehman and I\nhave been working on, becau=\r\nse our approach focuses on novel behaviors,\nnot novel genotypes (and it ign=\r\nores fitness).  A novelty search\nthrough the space of genotypes is more lik=\r\ne an exhaustive enumeration,\nsince any given genotype can be explored simpl=\r\ny by setting its genes\nto the desired parameters.  In behavior space, in co=\r\nntrast, you cannot\nsimply get to a new behavior by specifying that behavior=\r\n.  You have to\nfind it.\n\nOverall, I am glad to see an exploration of more s=\r\nophisticated\nspeciation strategies.  I think the coolest thing would be for=\r\n the\nuser to be able to select the way speciation works from among several\n=\r\noptions. I am looking forward to seeing your new version of SharpNEAT!\n\nken=\r\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Here are some thoughts on speciation that probably don&#39;t warrant a\n&gt; deep =\r\ndiscussion but I post them for the record.\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently sharpneat takes a=\r\n casual approach to speciation and I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering if there are improvement=\r\ns to be had. This ties in with my\n&gt; recent post about genome compatibilty m=\r\netrics and euclidean/manhattan\n&gt; distance.\n&gt; \n&gt; In sharpneat v2 I&#39;m trying =\r\nto make the code base more abstract and\n&gt; re-usable, e.g. I&#39;m separating th=\r\ne NeatGenome and EvolutionAlgorithm\n&gt; classes from being dependent on each =\r\nother and also using generics so\n&gt; that we can plug in new genomes or algor=\r\nithms with minimum effort.\n&gt; Thus my previous discussion resulted in my cre=\r\nating an\n&gt; ICompatibilityMetric&lt;TGenome&gt; interface which can be plugged in =\r\nto the\n&gt; NeatEvolutionAlgorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking at speciation again I see tha=\r\nt at the outset I simply assign\n&gt; genomes to species if they are within som=\r\ne distance and if not then I\n&gt; place the new genome in its own species. Ind=\r\nependent of this I also\n&gt; adjust the compatibility threshold once per gener=\r\nation in an attempt\n&gt; to keep the species count between some limits (which =\r\nhas its own\n&gt; problems and is another email in the making). A possible prob=\r\nlem with\n&gt; this approach is that the first attempt at speciation will proba=\r\nbly\n&gt; just assign the first N genomes in the population as being the first\n=\r\n&gt; genome in each species - these genomes then become [temporary]\n&gt; exemplar=\r\ns for the species, that is, the remaining genomes are compared\n&gt; against th=\r\nem and if they are close enough to an exemplar they are\n&gt; assigned to that =\r\nspecies.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an alternative approach I was thinking of taking the discu=\r\nssion\n&gt; about compatibility (or distance) metrics a step further and actual=\r\nly\n&gt; explicitly representing where genomes are in the encoding space with\n&gt;=\r\n something like an IEncodingSpace interface, the idea being that I take\n&gt; t=\r\nhe total number of unique connection IDs in the whole population as\n&gt; being=\r\n the number of spacial dimensions, I then define the location of\n&gt; each gen=\r\nome in each dimension as being the connection weight for that\n&gt; ID (using 0=\r\n if a genome doesn&#39;t have a connection for agiven ID). From\n&gt; here I can fi=\r\nnd the range/limits of locations (weights) in each\n&gt; dimension, which effec=\r\ntively defines an enclosing hypercube that the\n&gt; current population is insi=\r\nde. I can now divide up the hypercube into\n&gt; equally sized sub-cubes in ord=\r\ner to find clusters of genomes that are\n&gt; close together and use this as th=\r\ne basis of my initial set of species.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to all that I suspec=\r\nt it makes sense to keep the exemplar\n&gt; for each species consistent through=\r\nout the life of the species - so a\n&gt; genome (representing a point in space)=\r\n we keep to one side, that may\n&gt; have been removed from the population long=\r\n ago. This keeps each\n&gt; species &#39;anchored&#39; in space and prevents it from dr=\r\nifting. We then\n&gt; have the choice of keeping a FIFO buffer of dead species =\r\nas an\n&gt; indicator of parts of the search space that have recently been\n&gt; se=\r\narched - avoiding these spaces when creating new genomes. This is an\n&gt; idea=\r\n I raised a few years ago and which I think is known as novelty\n&gt; search.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
