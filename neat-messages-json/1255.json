Read up on \n&gt; Stephen Thaler and his Creativity Machine.  \n&gt; http://www.imagination-engines.com/thaler.htm\n\nI remember hearing about this &quot;Creativity Machine&quot; a\nwhile ago.  I was just reading some things on his\nsite.  He seems to think that his Creative Machine\nparadigm is the ultimate solution for everything under\nthe sun.  It sounds like a lot of hype, but I guess\ntime will tell.  He does have some recent applications\nthat sound pretty good.\n\nIn a few places he talks about the inferiority of GAs\nto his technique, usually worded in annoying ways. \nHere&#39;s a sample:\n\n&quot;In contrast, a genetic algorithm would require months\nor even years to build as programmers capture all of\nthe implicit constraints that qualify a pattern of\npixels as a face. When finally run, the GA would\ninevitably require years of run time, on the fastest\ncomputers in the world to build a single coherent\nface. ...That&#39;s why the Creativity [Machine] has been\nheralded by top NASA officials as AI&#39;s best bet and\nthe primary tool for building the AI predicted by\nKurzweil and others in 30 years, now!&quot;\n\nSo far I haven&#39;t found any good methods for robot\ncontrol that are as &quot;self-training&quot; as a GA since the\nfeedback is just so sparse, but apparently Thaler&#39;s\nmethod has been used to train robots.  I guess I&#39;m\nopen to new ideas...\n\nI&#39;m wondering if anyone has any more info on this. \nI&#39;d like to get some info from an unbiased source\n(i.e. not the super-hyped stuff from the Imagination\nEngines website).\n\nTyler\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
