That has recently popped up in ES as well,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;though the math behind it is not simple at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;But that is a step away from the basis of an evolutionary search and\n&gt; &gt;towards a gradient-based method.  Gradient-based methods are\n&gt; &gt;well-established and the choice for many problems, but they have certain\n&gt; &gt;weaknesses which evolutionary methods address... IMHO, that is.\n&gt;\n&gt;Basically, I was saying what you were saying...that this takes us one\n&gt;step closer to back-propagation / gradient-based methods.\n&gt;\n&gt;And that perhaps we might learn from both the successes and failures\n&gt;of that technique.  But that we would do well do do so conscientiously\n&gt;as opposed to re-inventing it in an effort to make improvements to our\n&gt;current approach.  Make sense?\n\nAh!  Yes I get you now.  This is a very good idea.\n\nI think that only that one angle of the discussion directly relates to \nback-prop however.  The more-general point, about including parameters for \nmutation rate in the genome has less to do with it.  Although I suppose \nthat when you have a mutability on every gene you kind-of have an unsigned \n&quot;gradient&quot; parameter.  Intuitively I feel that if the mutabilities are \nrandomly evolving it is a more-robust search technique than if we were \ntrying to calculate them from a single point on the fitness surface (or \neven a historical path across it).\n\nI did see one study where what they did was:\n\n1) maintain an evolving population (fixed topology)\n2) before evaluating the fitness of each individual, train it with back-prop\n         (they actually did it as a basic weight with a learned modifier \nadded on, but that was just to help with analysis)\n\n-what they were looking at was the Baldwin effect, which is where a \nproperty is initially learned, but over a longer-time gets transferred into \nthe genome (because individuals who learn it faster are fitter, and \neventually do not need to learn it at all...)\n\nI can find the reference if you need it...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
