It seems like never changing the novel=\r\nty\nscores would create attractors around old behaviors instead of new ones.=\r\n \n\nFor example, imagine an individual that reaches a new area in\nbehavioral=\r\n space. It is assigned a high novelty score. Several new\nindividuals arrive=\r\n in the same area, and get lower novelty scores (the\nfirst one maintains it=\r\ns high score). What we want is to explore the\nindividuals on the &#39;fringe&#39; o=\r\nf this new area, in hopes of finding\nfurther areas of novetly. However, wit=\r\nh constant novelty scores, the\nbias will be to investigate the area in the =\r\nproximity of the first\nindividual, even though the ones on the fringe may b=\r\ne more promising.\n\nIf you consistently get better performance with constant=\r\n novelty\nscores over a variety of maps perhaps it is worth looking into mor=\r\ne.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski=\r\n@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joel,\n&gt; \n&gt; Novelty search is one really inspiring idea.=\r\n \n&gt; It is interesting to note that when I added the dynamic adjustment of \n=\r\n&gt; the sparseness/novelty score, the performance was actually worse than \n&gt; =\r\nwithout adjusting the novelty score, i.e. an individual always stays \n&gt; wit=\r\nh the novelty score it was born with. \n&gt; I hypothesize that this is because=\r\n it encourages such species that \n&gt; produce more novel behaviors frequently=\r\n. But I guess that the best \n&gt; way is to recompute the novelty scores at re=\r\ngular intervals.. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;=\r\nlehman.154@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Glad to hear that you are in=\r\nterested in the method, and that you&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; been able to implement it.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You are correct, the novelty of each individual is calculated with\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n respect to the current population and the archive.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, sparsenes=\r\ns in the behavioral space around an individual is\n&gt; &gt; equated with novelty,=\r\n which is used for the fitness of the \n&gt; individual.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ideally, nove=\r\nlty would recomputed for each individual in the current\n&gt; &gt; generation afte=\r\nr each evaluation. In our implementation it is \n&gt; allowed\n&gt; &gt; to get stale =\r\nfor a few evaluations (in the same frequency that\n&gt; &gt; individuals are respe=\r\nciated according to rtNEAT). In our \n&gt; experiments,\n&gt; &gt; allowing for a bit =\r\nstaleness did not effect the results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually, in the scenario yo=\r\nu describe, each of the individuals \n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; now have a lower novelty, =\r\nthe original individual included. This\n&gt; &gt; reflects that the area around th=\r\nese individuals in behavior space is\n&gt; &gt; more dense than it previously was.=\r\n As more individuals come into a\n&gt; &gt; particular area, the novelty of all of=\r\n them drops, and provides\n&gt; &gt; pressure for individuals to do something new =\r\nin order to be seen as \n&gt; novel.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me know if you have any more =\r\nimplementation questions, I&#39;ll be\n&gt; &gt; releasing my source based off the rtN=\r\nEAT package in the next few \n&gt; weeks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Joel \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I implemented novelty search and the maze navigation=\r\n task (it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; works! :)), but I need to ask you about something. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So when a new individual is spawned from the population, its \n&gt; nove=\r\nlty is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; computed based on the domain-specific distance measure to all=\r\n \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; behaviors in the population and the archive, right. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But what about the population itself, should every individual \n&gt; th=\r\nere \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recompute its sparseness on every evaluation, based on the new \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask this because when I observe the sp=\r\narseness (I assume \n&gt; sparseness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; equals fitness) of the individuals,=\r\n say one happens to be in a \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sparse area so it receives a hig=\r\nh fitness score. But then a \n&gt; couple of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other individuals come into=\r\n this area, so it becomes more dense. \n&gt; But \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that first individual s=\r\ntill has a high fitness score?
