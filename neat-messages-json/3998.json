I feel like\n&gt;  that&#39;s more the long view of reinforcement learning (RL) than\n&gt;  neuroevolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;  In NE, our long view seems more to be about harnessing the power of\n&gt;  evolution, and evolutionary &quot;learning&quot; is quite different and quite a\n&gt;  bit less general than human learning.\n\nThe way I think of the distinction is between:\n\nphylogenetic (evolutionary) learning: weights are &quot;hard-wired&quot; and\nadjusted by evolution\nontogenetic (lifetime) learning: weights are modified by experience\nduring lifespan\n\nThese types of learning obviously aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. I think\nin many organisms, such as insects, their behavior is predominantly a\nresult of phylogenetic learning. Even so, such behaviors can be\nincredibly flexible and complex. But the evolution of the neocortex\nwas a major shift in evolution, usurping most brain functions with a\nvery uniform, generic computing structure, and so ontogenetic learning\noutstripped phlylogenetic learning.\n\nI think evolutionary algorithms have a place in developing hard-wired\nsolutions to difficult problems. There are many problems for which you\nwouldn&#39;t necessarily want a generic learner, which is going to require\nextensive training. I also think that evolutionary algorithms will be\nuseful in optimizing the parameters of a uniform, generic computing\nstructure, such as an artificial neocortex. Obviously, such an\napproach would need to be coupled with learning algorithms, e.g.\nHebbian-like learning modulated by a reward signal (RL).\n\n&gt;  In RL, in contrast, the long view is almost the opposite: They want to\n&gt;  remove all constraints and still learn nevertheless.\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by this, Ken. Could you elaborate a little?\n\n&gt; My aim is to design an\n&gt;  algorithm that will output a brain, not to design the brain itself.\n\nBut what kind of brain are you wanting to output?\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
