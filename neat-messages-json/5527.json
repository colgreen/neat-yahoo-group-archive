In fact =\r\nboth our introductory papers on novelty search (ALIFE-08 and ECJ 11) includ=\r\ne sections that explicitly cite prior work in open-ended evolution as an in=\r\nspiration for novelty search.  There is no doubt that they share many princ=\r\niples.\n\n\n\nCreative systems such as interactive evolution also share many pr=\r\ninciples with novelty search, which is the inspiration for the publication =\r\nat the root of this discussion thread.  So certainly we don&#39;t want to imply=\r\n that novelty search is the first to explore open-endedness or creativity i=\r\nn evolution (much of my own work is even in creative evolutionary systems o=\r\nutside novelty search).  In fact, we view novelty search as a complement to=\r\n the work in this area.  Diversity-preservation-mechanisms (such as speciat=\r\nion) and coevolution also relate to novelty search in various ways.\n\n\n\nHowe=\r\nver, novelty search is the only generic (i.e. domain-general) evolutionary =\r\nalgorithm we know of that explicitly rewards phenotypic novelty and only no=\r\nvelty with no other criteria and no awareness of the objective whatsoever (=\r\nmany such prior algorithms combine objective criteria with a drive towards =\r\ndiversity).  To our knowledge it is also the first time that such an open-e=\r\nnded approach was used to show that many problems considered objective can =\r\nbe transformed into non-objective problems that are actually solved better =\r\nwithout an objective (which remains a controversial yet useful discussion p=\r\noint).  \n\n\n\nIf you would like to share another algorithm that is similar th=\r\nen that&#39;s great (the book you cited is a survey of many systems, and I don&#39;=\r\nt know of a specific example in that book that works like novelty search). =\r\n Of course, after four years of publication reviews I would be surprised to=\r\n see something with the same exact mechanism that our reviewers did not cat=\r\nch, but it&#39;s a big world and you never know.  However, I would not be surpr=\r\nised to see many related ideas - of course open-ended evolution and creativ=\r\ne evolutionary systems share much of the same inspiration as novelty search=\r\n.  Our hope was in effect to distill the core essence of such systems into =\r\nthe simplest possible heuristic to make its study and applicability as easy=\r\n and universal as possible.\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s probably also useful to note that the m=\r\notivation for starting this discussion for me was not to argue that novelty=\r\n search is &quot;superior.&quot;  Rather I think its generality and simplicity make i=\r\nt a useful device for investigating the impact of our field&#39;s longstanding =\r\nloyalty to objective-driven algorithms and evaluation standards, in particu=\r\nlar in domains that are considered &quot;objective.&quot;  If other approaches also c=\r\nontribute to that discussion then all the better!\n\n\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Gene Merdock &lt;genemerdock@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Hello Ken,\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n But these open ended evolution algorithms have been applied to &quot;wherever y=\r\nou want&quot; outside\n\n&gt;  alife, for a long time now[1].

Considerably\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nore organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive - so the natural\n\n&gt; \n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; world does try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; generation at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring with v=\r\nariations on\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; those poor strategies in the hope of findin=\r\ng something better. What\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; does happen though is that stra=\r\ngies are so complex (for creatures with\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; large brains any=\r\nway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nod) and yet waste much time on poor sub-strategies (effectively\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; stragey efficiency).

In fact both our introductory =\r\npapers on novelty search (ALIFE-08 and ECJ 11) include sections that explic=\r\nitly cite prior work in open-ended evolution as an inspiration for novelty =\r\nsearch.  There is no doubt that they share many principles.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCreati=\r\nve systems such as interactive evolution also share many principles with no=\r\nvelty search, which is the inspiration for the publication at the root of t=\r\nhis discussion thread.  So certainly we don&#39;t want to imply that novelty se=\r\narch is the first to explore open-endedness or creativity in evolution (muc=\r\nh of my own work is even in creative evolutionary systems outside novelty s=\r\nearch).  In fact, we view novelty search as a complement to the work in thi=\r\ns area.  Diversity-preservation-mechanisms (such as speciation) and coevolu=\r\ntion also relate to novelty search in various ways.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, novel=\r\nty search is the only generic (i.e. domain-general) evolutionary algorithm =\r\nwe know of that explicitly rewards phenotypic novelty and only novelty with=\r\n no other criteria and no awareness of the objective whatsoever (many such =\r\nprior algorithms combine objective criteria with a drive towards diversity)=\r\n.  To our knowledge it is also the first time that such an open-ended appro=\r\nach was used to show that many problems considered objective can be transfo=\r\nrmed into non-objective problems that are actually solved better without an=\r\n objective (which remains a controversial yet useful discussion point).  &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you would like to share another algorithm that is similar then t=\r\nhat&#39;s great (the book you cited is a survey of many systems, and I don&#39;t kn=\r\now of a specific example in that book that works like novelty search).  Of =\r\ncourse, after four years of publication reviews I would be surprised to see=\r\n something with the same exact mechanism that our reviewers did not catch, =\r\nbut it&#39;s a big world and you never know.  However, I would not be surprised=\r\n to see many related ideas - of course open-ended evolution and creative ev=\r\nolutionary systems share much of the same inspiration as novelty search.  O=\r\nur hope was in effect to distill the core essence of such systems into the =\r\nsimplest possible heuristic to make its study and applicability as easy and=\r\n universal as possible.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt&#39;s probably also useful to note that the=\r\n motivation for starting this discussion for me was not to argue that novel=\r\nty search is &quot;superior.&quot;  Rather I think its generality and simplicity make=\r\n it a useful device for investigating the impact of our field&#39;s longstandin=\r\ng loyalty to objective-driven algorithms and evaluation standards, in parti=\r\ncular in domains that are considered &quot;objective.&quot;  If other approaches also=\r\n contribute to that discussion then all the better!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nken&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n-=\r\n-- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Gene Merdock &lt;geneme=\r\nrdock@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hello Ken,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But th=\r\nese open ended evolution algorithms have been applied to &quot;wherever you want=\r\n&quot; outside&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  alife, for a long time now[1].

For open-ended alife, you have to create a competitive=\r\n simulated world and see what happens within it. With novelty search you ca=\r\nn get open-ended dynamics wherever you want, without needing to define an a=\r\nlife scenario.

To my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mind nature has found complex /strate=\r\ngies/ for survival because:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A) Vastly more computat=\r\nional resource (or equivalent) [per unit time].&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; B) Vastly more time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; C) Vastly more complex domain.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;=\r\ns this latter point that I feel has tended to be overlooked. If you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; consider every living thing alive=\r\n today and trace back through all of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; their ancestors, then every single one of those zillions of orga=\r\nnisms&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; executed a successfu=\r\nl strategy that lead to survival. Considerably&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; more organisms not on that family tree didn&#39;t survive =\r\n- so the natural&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; world doe=\r\ns try out unsuccessful strategies, but only for one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; generation at a time, it doesn&#39;t create offspring=\r\n with variations on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; those =\r\npoor strategies in the hope of finding something better. What&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; does happen though is that stragies are=\r\n so complex (for creatures with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; large brains anyway) that they can incorporate successful parts (find=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; food) and yet waste much =\r\ntime on poor sub-strategies (effectively&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stragey efficiency). Evolution will select for efficiency bu=\r\nt unlike&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; survival it&#39;s not=\r\n a binary yes/no thing, it&#39;s more probabilistic, so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; more like the small low scoring species in NEAT (=\r\nfrom fitness&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sharing).&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s perhaps those poor side strategies that fit your =\r\nidea of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; searching with no =\r\nobjective, they piggy back on for the ride and very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; occasionally become useful. Where EC tends to fal=\r\nl short IMO is that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the do=\r\nmain complexity is vastly lower than the natural world so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; there&#39;s less opportunty for exploring varia=\r\ntions in strategy -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; branch=\r\ning off into multiple successful branches and sub-branches&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; without a major loss in fitness on the obj=\r\nective. Put another way, the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; natural world&#39;s fitness landscape is dominated by smooth undulations&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in all dimensions, whereas EC=\r\n objectives tend to have a few&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; sharp/steep local maxima.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nature also provides=\r\n a gentle selection pressure towards complex&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strategies by providing resources that require increasin=\r\ngly complex&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strategies to =\r\nreach - you can&#39;t eat those land plants until you evolve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; legs ang lungs.
