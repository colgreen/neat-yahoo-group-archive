They are quite a bit different inte=\r\nrnally. The docs seem to match the zip file version.\n\nWhich one is the pref=\r\nerred one? Can or should they be merged? I know\nthe project is kind of old,=\r\n but it looks like it&#39;s a stable well-documented code base.\n\nRegards,\n\nRon\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
