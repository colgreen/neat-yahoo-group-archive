There is a lot of \nwork right now going into ways to make sure progress is real \nprogress and not just going in circles or going off in bizarre \ntangents in the strategy space.  This problem seems likely to happen \nin board games where the initial strategies will be quite alien, so \nthe improvements you get will be geared toward beating aliens.  It \nseems less of a problem in for example control domains like Robot \nDuel where it&#39;s hard to really have an &quot;alien&quot; strategy.  In any \ncase, the mathematics behind tracking progress or ensuring progress \nhave to do with game theory and Pareto optimality, and were \ndiscussed extensively at the Coevolution workshop this year at GECCO \n(where I was on the panel).  I would suggest reading papers by Edwin \nDe Jong, Sevan Ficici, and Anthony Bucci.  Paul Wiegand also has a \nlot of cooperative coevolution issues.  Anyway, these guys (most \nalumni of the DEMO lab at Brandeis) are really moving towards \ntheoretically founded theory of coevolution, which is quite \ninteresting and deep.\n\nOn the other hand, none of their stuff says anything about \nrepresentation, which is where NEAT comes in.  The complexification \nof the genome seems to go hand in hand with the coevolutionary \ndynamic.  But it is not necessarily enough to know whether progress \nis really happening or not.  That requires some kind of theory of \nprogress.  Note a lot of progress has been made in this area in the \nlast few years, so it&#39;s no longer just speculative.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; This graph:\n&gt; \n&gt; \nhttp://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/tmp/TicTacToe_SimpleDominanceChain.pn\ng\n&gt; \n&gt; shows progress so far using evaluation against a dominance chain. \n(BTW \n&gt; it&#39;s worth noting the sudden jump in fitness in the center of the \ngraph, \n&gt; just after a pruning phase has started)\n&gt; \n&gt; Fitness against a random player has actually fallen slightly today \nand \n&gt; with the graph plateuing out to some degree I think this \ndemonstrates \n&gt; that this specific experiment isn&#39;t working that well, especially \nif we \n&gt; factor in that the graph shows fitness vs generations - and that \nthe \n&gt; search speed has now dropped off considerably.\n&gt; \n&gt; So more work required, but an interesting first stab at co-ev \n&gt; Tic-Tac-Toe with NEAT.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n"}}
