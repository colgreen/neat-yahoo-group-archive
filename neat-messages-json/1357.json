I see some code \n&gt; readability to using unique id numbers, but I don&#39;t understand what \n&gt; innovation #s are for. I was reading postings about remembering all \n&gt; the innovations. what benifit does this have?\n\n\nHi Chad, it&#39;s probably best if you read one Ken&#39;s papers to get a \ngrounding on this sort of stuff, but I will try and summarise. It&#39;s \neasisest for me to discuss the workings of SharpNEAT, but most of the \nfundamental workings are shared with Ken&#39;s and other implementations.\n\nGenomes can be compared with each other and a compatibility number \ngenerated. NEAT defines a compatibility threshold number so that genomes \nthat are closeley matched (compatible) will be placed into the same \nspecies. To do a comparison though would normally require us to compare \nthe two genome&#39;s topology - which is difficult to do and expensive. So \nin order to eliminate the need for topology matching every gene is \nallocated a unique innovation ID, this ID is passed on when genomes \nspawn offspring via asexual reproduction and crossover, etc. So now we \ncan compare two genomes by matching up genes with the same innovation ID.\n\nNow, in SharpNEAT genomes are made up from NeuronGenes and \nConnectionGenes and both types have an innovation ID allocated. The \ngenome comparison algorithm though only looks at ConnectionGenes because \nthey describe the topology perfectly well without the NeuronGenes. The \nNeuronGene innovation ID therefore isn&#39;t actually used as an innovation \nID, the ID is just a convienient number that we can use within the \nConnectionGene to describe which two neurons are being connected.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; genotype vs phenotype: I know there has been a lot of talk and \n&gt; interest in modular structures, where the phenotype is not a direct \n&gt; mapping of the genotype, but if ( as in with NEAT ) the phenotype IS a \n&gt; direct map, wouldn&#39;t it be simpler not to seperate the two? \n\nI think there is a performance benefit in merging the two since this \nwould eliminate the need to &#39;decode&#39; the genome into a network. I took \nthe decision to keep them seperate because I plan to experiment with \ndifferent genome encodings - and anyway IMO it&#39;s good programming \npractice to keep the two concepts decoupled as much as possible.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; species: can speciation be summarized as method of evolving multiple \n&gt; populations simultaniously, or is there too much mixing between \n&gt; species? I havn&#39;t read too deep into the speciation code. I don&#39;t \n&gt; really grasp what it&#39;s supposed to accomplish. Windows NEAT \n&gt; essentially seems to use the species class as a simple container with \n&gt; accessors. Is that it?\n\nThere is more to it than that. New species are spawned when offspring \nare sufficiently different to not fit into the parent species. Also, \nsome implementations have a dynamic compatibility threshold - when this \nchanges (in sharpNEAT) the population is re-speciated. Also note that a \nsmall amount of cross-species reproduction occurs in some implementations.\n\nIt&#39;s all covered in various papers. The concept is a simple one but very \neffective.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
