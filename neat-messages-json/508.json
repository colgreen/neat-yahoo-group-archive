(ie. Each training run would involve a vehicle\nwith slightly different acceleration, or maybe a wheel not working, or\nsomething like that.) That way, the network would evolve to have a degree of\nflexibility, and determine its capabilities from its sensory feedback. In\nfact, if you slightly randomised your physical laws too, this might allow\nthe network to better deal with the inevitable differences between the\nsimulation and the real world, when it was placed into the vehicle.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
