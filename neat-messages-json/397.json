Now, you can achieve the same results (e.g the LI you \ndescibed) without connections going back to the input &#39;layer&#39; - you just \nperform the inhibition feedback in the first hidden layer. You can \nactually think of the input nodes as not actually being nodes, just \nconnection points that the real nodes connect to to obtain input signals.\n\nMy own feelings on this are that it&#39;s far more natural to *not* \ndistinguish between input, hidden and outputs nodes. This is how my \ncurrent NN implementation is arranged. Each node holds a collection of  \nConnection objects that point to the source of an input signal - that \nsource can be another node or an element in an input signal array. By \nrelying on a layer of hidden nodes to substitute for the fact that input \nnodes cannot receive connections I think we are effectively errecting an \nartifical barrier for the topology search process.\n\nKen, I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts on this one while I&#39;m still at \nthe early stages of development.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
