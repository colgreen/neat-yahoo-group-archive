It is possible to do anything you want based \n&gt;on the compatibility function, and using it as a basis for deciding \n&gt;which interspecies matings are tolerable is certainly feasible.\n\nno. I mean what if two mutations are identical but were inovated\nseperatly, so that that they are rated as less compatable. In the early\npart of a search, the ratio of members in a population may be comparable\nto the possible number of node insertion points. So if in the second\ngeneration, the same mutation occured as had occured in the first\ngeneration, it would be described as a different gene.
