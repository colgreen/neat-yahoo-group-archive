I think it would be interesting (and revealing)\n&gt; to be able to see how the roving eye moves around the image during a\n&gt; recognition. Apart from being cool to look at (would make a nice\n&gt; demonstration) it might give some indication of the strategy the eye is\n&gt; using to distinguish between characters.\n\nYup...we&#39;ve got a utility that displays the eye location in one frame\nand what it&#39;s seeing each time step in the second.  It&#39;s been a pretty\nuseful diagnostic tool, and we&#39;ll probably use something like it if we\never do a presentation on this stuff.\n\n&gt; The long search durations are a bit of a concern going forward, but not\n&gt; unexpected given the complexity of the tasks. What sort of hardware was\n&gt; the search running on BTW?\n\nA standard desktop PC (2.6 GHz/768 MB).  Jim has worked on a\ndistributed framework for his runs, and that&#39;s definitely something\nwe&#39;d like to integrate into ANJI at some point.  There are probably\nstill a number of optimizations to the code we could make as well.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
