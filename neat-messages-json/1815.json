In that case, maybe if you looked at the \ndistribution of profit/loss across the whole of the data in some manner.  e.g.\n\n1) maybe striking out the top 5 profits before calculating an average\n\n2) or, classify periods as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and award a fitness \nbased on only the number in each category.  So an extreme profit is still \nonly a &quot;good&quot; and the best individual is the one with the most goods...\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
