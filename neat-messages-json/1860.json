This follows one of Kens papers, but extends it into \nmore complex networks.  The general problem area is, as suggested \npreviously, aircraft control.  The idea is to maintain level, constant \nspeed flight of the aircraft as environmental and/or aircraft \ncharacteristics change.  This could mean the engine losing power, a \nwing losing lift or control ability, wind changes, etc. Regarding this, \nIm looking for any recommendations for papers to look at, and ideas on \nwhat kinds of things to toss into the experimental environment.  The \ntentative plan now is to run the aircraft through a number of random \nenvironments with different changes or combinations of changes, and \ncalculate fitness based off of a deviation from the original path as \ncompared to the deviation of an aircraft that&#39;s done nothing.\n\nThe area I could use some help in is with some modifications to the \noriginal neat code.  Since the aircraft control is fairly complex, I&#39;ve \nbeen working at making neat parallel to cut down the time it takes to \nrun all this.  Mostly, since this is running on an openmosix cluster, \nthis means forking complex procedures that are called from inside a \nloop.  Any other potential locations for speedups?  I&#39;ve also been \nre-implementing the front end in KDE, since that&#39;s usually the \nenvironment Im working under.  From those who have done re-writes of \nneat before, is there anything in particular I should be especially \ncareful of?  Now, where I need help is with implementing plastic \nsynapses.  Since I will be comparing this with Ken&#39;s original results, \nI&#39;d like to implement them in a manner similar to what Ken had for his \nfood foraging experiments.  A rough outline of the implementation, or \nbetter yet, source code, would be appreciated.\n\nMark Ahlstrom\n\n\n"}}
