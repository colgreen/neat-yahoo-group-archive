The\nfile is called graphingTools.zip, and it contains:\n\n --XmlConverter.java  (the source for the Java command\n line utility I wrote to convert genomes into our\n format for network.xml)\n --XmlConverter.class (the compiled Java utility)\n --kens_genome.txt (just a text file containing the\n genome in Ken&#39;s format)\n --format.xsl (an XSL style sheet that converts our\n network.xml into a layer-based network.xml for\n drawing)\n --draw.xsl (an XSL style sheet that takes the\n formatted xml and produces an SVG document)\n --draw.bat (a .bat file that takes an xml file and\n automatically parses it with both format.xsl and\n draw.xsl, producing network.svg)\n\nYou&#39;ll need to have a JRE installed to run the\nXmlConverter.  But these tools should be usable by\nanyone who is using Ken&#39;s original implementation and\nwould like an alternative visual layout option.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to use any of\nthese files, just let me know.\n\nThanks,\nDerek\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
