Thanks for the\n&gt; pointer.  \n\nNo problem.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d be more than happy to discuss ideas and such.  Be\n&gt; warned I&#39;m not much of a trained researcher more of an\n&gt; interested hobbiest.\n\nWell, neither are Philip and I.  We both work day jobs (Philip&#39;s a\nJava developer and I design web-based training) and do this stuff in\nour spare time.  So no worries there.\n\nWe&#39;re also not experts in any particular domain.  Billings and\nDavidson obviously know quite a lot about poker.  I know enough to\nimplement a tournament framework and take some reasonable stabs at a\ngood fitness function, but I&#39;m a pretty poor player.  Likewise with\nGo.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
