(=\r\nFrom Ken Stanley&#39;s &quot;Abandoning objectives: evolution through the search for=\r\n novelty alone&quot; paper, abstract: in &quot;biped walking tasks.. novelty search s=\r\nignificantly outperforms objective-based search...&quot;).\n\nWould Novelty search=\r\n be easy to add to SharpNeat or would it require significant structural cha=\r\nnges to SharpNEAT to get going? Assuming the use of an existing fast Key/Va=\r\nlue store nosql DB for behaviour storage and KNN lookups, similar to this o=\r\nne:\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/Articles/316816/RaptorDB-The-Key-Value-Store=\r\n-V2\n\nI only ask as I am curious to try novelty search out for a while on so=\r\nme of the existing SharpNEAT example projects (but as yet have not found th=\r\ne time to look into it).\n\nRegards,\nKeith Nelson\n\n--- In neat@...=\r\nm, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\r\n=3DKMy2zRN4d38\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope to check the code into SVN soon, there are also =\r\na few fixes\n&gt; that have been submitted to the SVN repository recently, some=\r\n fairly\n&gt; significant, e.g. the prey capture domain was effectively complet=\r\nely\n&gt; broken (it works a lot better now!). Will aim to make package up a ne=\r\nw\n&gt; SharpNEAT release 7zip soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the walker, any advice on i=\r\nmproving the fitness function?\n&gt; This one has stop conditions for when one =\r\nor both of the feet are too\n&gt; high, the torso height goes below a threshold=\r\n or any of the the joint\n&gt; angles go beyond 90 degrees. Ideally I&#39;d like to=\r\n avoid these and make\n&gt; it more open ended (and punish for applied torque t=\r\no get efficient\n&gt; walkers) but the reality was that that didn&#39;t seem to wor=\r\nk very well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
