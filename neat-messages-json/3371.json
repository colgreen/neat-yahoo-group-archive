Reil and Husbands did go on to found \nNatural=\r\nMotion.  I agree with you that there is a nice new opportunity \nwith applyi=\r\nng CPPNs to CTRNNs.  I look forward to seeing how your \nproject goes.\n\nken\n=\r\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken, I have to mention that Tyler was inspired by Torsten Reil and=\r\n \n&gt; Phil Husbands about their work on the same stuff. They used fully \n&gt; co=\r\nnnected CTRNNs. No crossover and fixed genome size. Well, it is \n&gt; just lik=\r\ne the opposite to the NEAT philosophy about the problem. I \n&gt; examined his =\r\n.ne file, and he made the add_link and add_node \n&gt; probabilities to 0.00. :=\r\n) \n&gt; Well this is NEAT in the weight-range sense only :)  \n&gt; What about top=\r\nology? That was not mentioned anywhere. \n&gt; In fact, Reil and Husbands are t=\r\nhe people founded NaturalMotion? :) \n&gt; I know that a CTRNN can generate any=\r\n dynamic behaviour, but putting \n&gt; it into HyperNEAT&#39;s hands is changing th=\r\ne whole thing! Now I can \n&gt; specify any time constant range and so on. I do=\r\nn&#39;t care about \n&gt; mutation powers anymore. This is handled by the activatio=\r\nn \nfunctions \n&gt; and the scale factor I specify. \n&gt; The power of this indire=\r\nction is getting to our view. I see that \n&gt; CTRNN networks exhibit patterns=\r\n as complex as their CPPN is. Well, \n&gt; this is cool! \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pet=\r\ner and Steve, the way I would approach this problem is to \nstart \n&gt; &gt; with =\r\nthe simplest possible model and get it working before moving \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; mor=\r\ne complex or biologically plausible ones.  It&#39;s interesting to \n&gt; &gt; note th=\r\nat Tyler Streeter evolved his biped with no inputs!  He \nwas \n&gt; &gt; trying to=\r\n see if a fully recurrent network on its own with no \n&gt; inputs \n&gt; &gt; could p=\r\nroduce a temporal walking pattern.  Of course that makes \nthe \n&gt; &gt; problem =\r\nquite difficult, and giving some feedback (i.e. inputs) \n&gt; makes \n&gt; &gt; the p=\r\nroblem easier.  However, too many inputs could tip the \n&gt; &gt; difficulty back=\r\n in the other direction.  In any case, my approach \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; a hard proble=\r\nm is always to first see if I can do the easiest \n&gt; version \n&gt; &gt; of it.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; By the way, about Natural Motion, most of their current stuff \n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nobably is mainly hand-coded.  They started out using CTRNNs but \n&gt; &gt; they m=\r\noved on the scripting and other things as Peter mentioned.  \n&gt; So \n&gt; &gt; they=\r\n are a very difficult target to match with evolution alone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the=\r\n way, thanks for the encouraging words on NEAT and \nHyperNEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_cherv=\r\nenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is really a prototype, Steve. I am trying to =\r\ntest the \nlearning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; algorithm on it. You see that the legs, arms and =\r\nthe torso are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cubic.. eh.. what was that word.. they have edges! It =\r\ngives \nmore \n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. The guys at NaturalMotion have their own model=\r\ns, \ntaken \n&gt; &gt; from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; biometric data.. And more, they have modeled ela=\r\nstic muscles \nand \n&gt; so \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on... It&#39;s just a prototype to test HyperNEA=\r\nT.
