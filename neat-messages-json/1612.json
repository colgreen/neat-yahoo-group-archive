I never expected a \n&gt;potential integer based neural approach to be developed - let alone \n&gt;tested - when I raised the double vs single float question.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell I&#39;ve been thinking about the idea for a while, I just never got \nround to developing it.\n\n&gt;What code base would you recommend starting with to performance \n&gt;profile a NEAT engine on a Blackfin?  Note the Blackfin supports a 32 \n&gt;bit multiply instruction but no divide.  The 32 bit mulitply is a \n&gt;multi-clock instruction.  Preliminary testing yields little \n&gt;difference in timing between 16 bit and 32 bit multiples for simple \n&gt;operations.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs it happens the network code I wrote doesn&#39;t use division, I seem to \nremember Ian saying that division was quite an expensive operation so I \nensured that all divisions in the code were powers of 2 which can be \ndone with the far cheaper/faster shift-right operation.\n\nI&#39;m not sure you really need to run an actual NEAT engine on the \nblackfin, you probably want to evolve a network on a desktop PC and then \ntransfer the resulting network onto the Blackfin for actual operational \nuse. To do this you just need to port the neural net code into C++ or \nwhatever you&#39;re using - which should be straightforward, since there&#39;s \nvery little actual code.\n\nAnother important point that I was reminded of recently is that my \nFastConcurrent network class is really a general purpose neural net that \nactivates each neuron in distinct timesteps, that is, at each timestep \nevery single neuron calculates it&#39;s output signal for the next timestep. \nThis approach allows us to support recursive connections while keeping \nthe code simple. There are however, faster ways of activating a network, \nespecially if you will be working with feed-forward only nets. I think \nDerek and Philip (on this list) are using an alternative approach, and I \nunderstand Emyr is looking into this area too. Even so, the techniques \ndescribed in the write-up are still applicable, it&#39;s just you might be \nable to get even beter performance with a different activation technique \nthan the one I&#39;m using.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
