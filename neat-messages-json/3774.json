Therefore, my original code would \njust end up throwing away most=\r\n of the nodes if you tried to start \nwith some of them disconnected.\n\nThe r=\r\ntNEAT release repairs this problem- it actually transfers \ndisconnected nod=\r\nes from parents ot children.  That way, you can \nsafely begin with some inp=\r\nuts disconnected, and evolution can decide \nwhether/how to connect them.\n\nW=\r\nhen I noted on the NEAT Users Page that rtNEAT supports FS-NEAT, \nthat is t=\r\nhe issue I was referring to.\n\nken\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;zinoo4&quot; =\r\n&lt;zinoo4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,everyone & happy new year!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using nea=\r\nt for my project\n&gt; and that&#39;s wonderful & very useful \n&gt; \n&gt; I have used rt-=\r\nneat until now,\n&gt; and now I want to use fs(feature selective) neat\n&gt; and i =\r\nhave heard rt-neat support it\n&gt; \n&gt; How it support fs-neat?\n&gt; I have found n=\r\next params\n&gt; \n&gt;     mutate_toggle_enable_prob \n&gt;     mutate_gene_reenable_p=\r\nrob \n&gt;     mutate_rem_link_prob \n&gt;     mutate_rem_link_percent \n&gt; in the rt=\r\n-neat&#39;s parameter file(param.ini)\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder if  it is related to the FS=\r\n-NEAT capability,\n&gt;  and then if it is related,  how much figure(or range) =\r\nis properly \n&gt; needed for params?\n&gt; \n&gt; for example, \n&gt; mutate_toggle_enable=\r\n_prob 0.2\n&gt; mutate_gene_reenable_prob 0.05\n&gt; mutate_rem_link_prob  0.1\n&gt; mu=\r\ntate_rem_link_percent 0.1\n&gt; \n&gt; I really need your knowledge and advice.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; And, if above parameter value is not related to fs-neat, \n&gt; i wonder what=\r\n pamameter is related to fs-neat capability.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please give answers, t=\r\nhank you for reading.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
