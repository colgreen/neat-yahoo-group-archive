There are a few issues raised and =\r\nI&#39;ll\ntry to cover all of them. Apologies for the length of the post.\n\nFirst=\r\nly I did of course mean tabu search - easily confused terms I\nthink you&#39;ll =\r\nagree.\n\nSome general themes then:\n\n1) Speciating by comparing new genomes (=\r\nI call them offspring from\nhere) with each species in turn.\n\nGenerally I li=\r\nke this, but there are some potential side effects I&#39;m\nunsure about. e.g. i=\r\nf the species overlap in the encoding space then\nany offspring that exist i=\r\nn an overlapping region will always get\nassigned to the species that comes =\r\nfirst, this leaves an empty bite\nshaped region (a crecent shape in 2D space=\r\n) in the second species.\nUltimately you might end up where the two regions =\r\nare almost exactly\nthe same (the exemplars are very close) and so the genom=\r\nes in the\nsecond species are all in a very thin cresent formation. In fact =\r\nyou\nmight have several species where each one is a cresent shape on the\nedg=\r\ne of the previous one.\n\nThis in turn might affect some of our other mechani=\r\nsms. e.g. if\nspecies number 2&#39;s genomes are as fit as number 1&#39;s then we ex=\r\npect\nthem to contain about the same number of genomes (through fitness\nshar=\r\ning), but in fact most of species 2&#39;s offspring end up in the\nfirst species=\r\n. Later on (in sharpneat at least) we might take N% of\nthe best genomes in =\r\neach species as the parents for the next\ngeneration, but because the total =\r\nnumber in each species has been\ndistorted, that N% is similarly distorted -=\r\n thus species 2 is\npotentially (depending how you make the calculations)\nun=\r\nder-represented as a parent for the next generation of offspring.\n\nThe expl=\r\nicit clustering algorithm I described is in fact called\nk-means clustering.=\r\n So if we use k-means (or some other standard\napproach) as a way of dividin=\r\ng our genomes into clusters before we\nstart the main NEAT loop running we l=\r\nessen the problem of overlapping\nregions between species. We can still use =\r\nthe same speciation\ntechnique in the main loop and perhaps periodically re-=\r\nspeciate using\nk-means if we think overlap is occuring, if there is some ea=\r\nsy way of\ndetecting the amount of overlap.\n\n2) In sharpneat v1 I actually t=\r\nest offspring against their parent\nspecies first (note. there are two paren=\r\nt species in cross species\nbreeding, but normally only one), and *then* tes=\r\nt against every other\nspecies in turn. I didn&#39;t properly consider what this=\r\n means when I\nwrote the code. Firstly it means performance is improved beca=\r\nuse most\noffspring will in fact be placed in their parent&#39;s species, thus n=\r\no\nfurther comparisons are necessary. However it introduces the\npossibility =\r\n(likelihood?) of species overlapping to a large degree,\nthey could even rep=\r\nresent the exact same region in the encoding space.\nUltimately they may dri=\r\nft apart but in the mean time they are both\nsearching the same fitness spac=\r\ne which is precisely what speciation is\ntrying to avoid.  Potentially all s=\r\npecies could all get stuck on some\nlocal maximum (=3D bad).\n\n\nSo at this po=\r\nint a better strategy than both mine and Ken&#39;s is to use\nKen&#39;s approach of =\r\ncomparing species in turn (with the species in a\nfixed order between genera=\r\ntions) but to avoid cresent shaped species\n(if indeed that is what happens)=\r\n by using k-means at the outset and\nperiodically, e.g. when the species cou=\r\nnt goes outside of some limits\nor every N generations.\n\n3) Petar, regarding=\r\n your suggestion about creating a representative\ngenome for each species. T=\r\nhis is potentially equivalent to calculating\nthe center center of the regio=\r\nn in space defined by the genomes, in\nfact if you average the weight of con=\r\nnections with the same ID you\ncalculate the center of mass of the genomes. =\r\nSo in 2D the exemplar is\ncurrently in the center of a circle, but the bulk =\r\nof the other genomes\nmay be clustered around one edge of the circle (becaus=\r\ne of some local\nmaximum say), thus the center of &#39;mass&#39; is in fact not in t=\r\nhe center\nbut somewhere towards (or within) the cluster. So ff we did ancho=\r\nr our\nspecies for their lifetime this would become far more likely.\n\nBTW th=\r\nis center of mass of genomes is effectively what k-means\nclustering is doin=\r\ng, we calculate the average distance from each\ngenome in a cluster; for eac=\r\nh cluster; and assign a genome to the\ncluster it is nearest to - that is, i=\r\nt gets assigned to the cluster\nwhose *center of mass* is closest. We could =\r\ncalculate the center of\nmass directly to reduce the number of comparisons w=\r\ne make, but there\nare some reasons not to - (A) Whenever we re-assign a gen=\r\nome from one\ncluster to another we move the center of mass of both of those=\r\n\nclusters, thus they would need recalculating (although you could avoid\nrec=\r\nalculating right way). And (B) Calculating the center of mass\nrequires us t=\r\no to define a coordinate system, which admitedly would be\neasy, it&#39;s just a=\r\nn array of numbers. But it&#39;s even easier to plug in a\nfunction that take tw=\r\no genomes and returns the distance between them\nas a single number. The fun=\r\nction effectively defines a distance metric\nand we can plug in and try alte=\r\nrnative distance metrics (euclidean,\nmanhattan, kens original [I&#39;m calling =\r\nit ken&#39;s canonical distance\nmetric :) ] )\n\n4) Anchoring of species. I think=\r\n if we were to try tabu search we\nwould need to anchor the species. Otherwi=\r\nse if a species drifts then\nwe have only partially searched some regions an=\r\nd we need some means of\nrecording that information. What you end of with is=\r\n a sort of density\nmap of the search space where density represents how muc=\r\nh searching\nhas occured in a given region. It&#39;s just a lot simpler if the s=\r\nearch\nregions are fixed/distinct chunks of space that we flag as being\nsear=\r\nch or not searched (not exhaustively searched, but enough that we\ndecided t=\r\no move on). There is still a problem in that as the compat.\nthreshold varie=\r\ns the radius of each species/region is changing - so\nthey&#39;re not actually f=\r\nixed chunks but varying in size.\n\nI can see the pros of allowing species to=\r\n drift; following the species\nchamp. But maybe it&#39;s not so bad to acnhor. W=\r\nhat might happen is that\nas genome smove towards some fitter space they end=\r\n up on the edge of\nthe species/region they are in. Now their offspring are =\r\noutside the\nregion, they form a new species because they are not close enou=\r\ngh to\nan existing one.  If we now re-speciate using k-means (rather than th=\r\ne\ncurrent approach of increasing the compat. threshold) then the new/fit\ncl=\r\nuster will form a new species with a new anchor, the old\nspecies/regions ar=\r\ne thrown away completely. \n\nThe idea needs a bit of work/thought but I thin=\r\nk it might work. So in\nconclusion k-means clustering potentially gives you =\r\nless species\noverlap (in sharpneat&#39;s case) or less cresent shaped species w=\r\nith a\ndistorted size relative to their fitness (in Ken&#39;s case). And along\nw=\r\nith anchored species exemplars it gives you an easy(er) way if doing\ntabu s=\r\nearch.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
