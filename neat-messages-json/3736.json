Once DNA\nis transcribed to RNA, RNA is processed and can result in mul=\r\ntiple\nvariants which can then lead to subtle differences in the translated\n=\r\nproteins.  An example is the Retinoid X Receptors.  On particular\nsubset, i=\r\n.e. RXR-alpha, has one gene but multiple isoforms resulting\nfrom RNA varian=\r\nts.  Each of these has subtly different activities with\nrespect to retinoid=\r\n binding, DNA specificity, transcriptional control,\netc.  This effectively =\r\namplifies the number of apparent genes we have.\n\nAlso, not all genes are ex=\r\npressed in all cells.  Cells have somewhat\nspecific controls over what gene=\r\ns are expressed, to what level they\nare expressed, and when they are expres=\r\nsed.  This gives each cell type\na different proteome that specifies that ce=\r\nlls behavior and function.  \n\nJust to add to the complexity, proteins will =\r\nbe influenced by the\nmilieu in which the are present.  For example, tamoxif=\r\nen has been\ncommonly used as an anti-breast cancer agent due to its ability=\r\n to\nantagonize the estrogen receptor, which is required for growth of some\n=\r\nbreast cancer tumors.  In cervical cells, however, tamoxifen acts as\nan AGO=\r\nNIST.  Based upon the cellular context in which the receptor is\npresent, ta=\r\nmoxifen exhibited different roles.\n\nThe fractal analogy used in one of the =\r\nreplies is somewhat applicable\nand I would extend this to an analogy with S=\r\nteering Behaviors (as\nexemplified by Craig Reynolds).  In both these system=\r\ns you have a very\nsimple set of rules leading to very complex behaviors.  G=\r\niven the\ncomplexity of protein expression and its role in determining cell\n=\r\nbehavior, the resulting set of highly complex rules provides a medium\nin wh=\r\nich emergence of brain and mind can occur.\n\n-Kirk\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Daniel Tuohy&quot; &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, the answers were=\r\n indeed lacking. By the way, notice also how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they ignored the second =\r\npart of my question: &quot;How can evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; search a space of such astron=\r\nomical complexity?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this question was at least partially addre=\r\nssed.  Dawkins seems\n&gt; to suggest that the genome specifies mechanisms for =\r\nbuilding the\n&gt; structure of the brain, and not the structure of the brain i=\r\ntself.  If\n&gt; that&#39;s the case, then it isn&#39;t neccessary to search the space =\r\nof\n&gt; possible structures, correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; That said, I&#39;ve thought the same ab=\r\nout the space defined by the genome\n&gt; itself.  30,000 genes is 30,000 dimen=\r\nsions, and 4 billion years seems\n&gt; like scant time to search it.  Two point=\r\ns which I rely on are (1)\n&gt; Generations were occuring much more rapidly for=\r\n microorganisms (and on\n&gt; a much smaller genome), so a billion years is a l=\r\nong time and (2) The\n&gt; search space isn&#39;t being searched for, say, a human-=\r\nlike solution all\n&gt; at once.  Rather, it is searched through gradual comple=\r\nxification, so\n&gt; that by the time humans are about to emerge, things like l=\r\negs, lungs,\n&gt; and circulatory systems have already been sorted out.
