The &quot;mirror effect,&quot; which can \nalso \nbe descri=\r\nbed as fractal self-similarity, is theoretically possible to \nachieve, and =\r\nthat kind of connective self-similarity may be useful in \nsome kinds of cog=\r\nnitive tasks.  \n\nNote however that getting it to work in the right way is a=\r\n challenge, \nand finding an appropriate task is a challenge as well.  Both =\r\nrequire \nserious consideration and justification before going this route \nb=\r\necause if applied in the wrong context, recurrence can produce \npatterns th=\r\nat appear noisy and disorganized (i.e. chaotic).
