I Just have a couple of points/thoughts...\n\n\n&gt;\t  &quot;Theorum #1&quot; -- a single species that is making progress (becoming \n&gt;fitter) at some reasonable rate, needs no extra-species interaction \n&gt;(splitting, merging or cross-breeding).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHmm maybe, but. If it is fitter it will take up a larger proportion of \nthe population, some poor niche species will die out and the dominant \nspecies will be split to bring the # of species back to normal. That \nlatter speciation is therefore based upon smaller differences between \ngenomes within the dominant species (This is all assuming fitness \nsharing and a dynamic compatibility threshold of course). This all means \nthat your species may actually be quite compatible, compatible enough \nthat interspecies mating is beneficial.\n\nHmm which makes me wonder if interspecies reproduction should be \nincreased between more similar species, which sort of ties in with the \nnext bit...\n\n&gt;\tAnd &quot;Theorum #2&quot; -- that the only purpose of a second (or more) \n&gt;species, is if it (i) replaces, or (ii) contributes genetic \n&gt;information to the mainstream.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\nTraditionally we tend to think of just (i), but (ii) may be happening I \nsuppose. Or could be made more likely to occur. [Side though] tracking \nthe history of mutations and reproductions migth be a good way of \nidentifying what dynamics are actually driving progress. In a past \nproject I store what the very last operation was on a genome (was it the \nproduct of weight mutation, add node, crossover, etc) along with it&#39;s \nparent(s) fitnesses. This means that when you evaluate, if the fitenss \nis better than your parent(s) then you can increment a counter based on \nteh type of genetic operator that was used to create the genome. So as a \nsearch progresses you can look at ths stats and say - of x many \nmutations y% were good, and crossover was no use... etc.\n\nYes I know, it&#39;s come up before and maybe you could use these stats to \nalter the search parameters. I&#39;ll get my coat shall I.\n\n\n&gt;\t((Obviously it can try to do that, fail and be made extinct, but its \n&gt;objective must be to do one of those two.))\n&gt;\n&gt;\tOK, so types of speciation:\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;Bottleneck Speciation\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nPoints noted, also refer back to &#39;extinct event&#39; discussion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;Side-step Speciation\n&gt;\n&gt;--\n&gt;\n&gt;Try-again Speciation\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI think of both of these as ways of doing a sort of wide or splatter \nsearch of the fitness space in the area around a genome/species. The \nside shift looks at the area a bit further than normal mutation, and \ntry-again actually takes some large leaps out in all directions. At this \npoint I&#39;d like to re-raise my idea of ring-fencing areas of the fitness \nspace as off limits, thus preventing individuals from regrouping around \na local maxima (*). If it is a big maxima then they may form smaller \ngroups around the edge of the mountain side ring fence (or think of \nvolcano shape if of you prefer). This hopefully has the long term effect \nof causing more search space to be covered, away from tried and \ntested(failed) areas of the search space. But the space is approached \nmore slowly than side-step, and probably even try-again.\n\n    (*) I recently discovered that this general approach is in fact \ncalled a Tabu Search - which is a phrase I&#39;d heard/read but I didn&#39;t \nknow what is was. (see wikipedia!)\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\t[[I am also interested in using &quot;type zero&quot; as the form of parallel \n&gt;processing that I think I mentioned late last year, where you branch \n&gt;the population into N copies with different random number seeds (e.g. \n&gt;on remote machines) and after M generations select the fittest \n&gt;version and discard the others.]]\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI currently have a discussion going off-list about distributed \nprocessing. I&#39;ll try and coax it onto the group. My preference is for an \n&#39;island&#39; model, rather than a centrally controlled &#39;star&#39; model. Island \nseems  simpler and more scalable, in fact it can be made to be \ninfinitely scalable.\n\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
