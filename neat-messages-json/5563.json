Fitness sharing is a form local competition and\nthis i=\r\ndea is already explored to some (considerable?) degree in the EA\nliterature=\r\n. A distinction is made between implicit and explicit\nfitness sharing (perh=\r\naps a slightly poor choice of terminology, but\nI&#39;ll let that slide for now)=\r\n. Implicit =3D fitness sharing based on\nphenotype similarity, explicit =3D =\r\nfitness sharing based on genotype\nsimilarity. For NEAT the genotype/phenoty=\r\npe distinction is moot on\naccount of being a direct encoding. I did however=\r\n encounter one paper\nthat looked at using a combination of implicit *and* e=\r\nxplicit based\nfitness sharing to overcome the problem of distinct genomes e=\r\nncoding\nthe same or similar phenotypes (and possibly distinct phenotypes\nha=\r\nving similar genotypes - e.g. if the encoding is indirect and\npowerful and =\r\ntherefore small changes in the genetic space potentially\ncause big changes =\r\nin phenotype).\n\n   &quot;A Multi-Niching Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for S=\r\nolving\nComplex Multimodal Problems&quot;,\n   S. L. Avila (*), L. Kr=E4henb=FChl =\r\n(*), B. Sareni (**)\n    http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/39/86/60/PD=\r\nF/OIPE2006_Avila-Sareni.pdf\n\nI believe the scheme I outlined adds another t=\r\nype of similarity space\nconceptually one level higher than phenotype and wh=\r\nat I would call\n/strategy/ space (very similar or perhaps the same concept =\r\nas novelty\nspace). I also wonder if it&#39;s the case that this strategy space =\r\nis the\nspace we are actually interested in when trying to maintain diverse\n=\r\npopulations, and if so this would imply that the genotype and\nphenotype spa=\r\nces are actually just proxies for this strategy space -\nand perhaps ineffic=\r\nient ones at that. I&#39;m just throwing ideas around\nat this stage.\n\nI&#39;m tryin=\r\ng to clarify/condense my thoughts on this subject into a\nshort article/pape=\r\nr, but the way things are going it&#39;s looking like it\nmight take a while to =\r\nsettle on a clear idea of what it is I&#39;m\nactually trying to describe/solve,=\r\n and to determine if I&#39;m just\nretreading old ground in the EA literature - =\r\nI don&#39;t think so from\nwhat I&#39;ve seen so far.\n\nWe also seem to have corrupte=\r\nd the notion of pareto fronts in\nmulti-objective functions, Joel and Ken by=\r\n having a novelty objective\nthat doesn&#39;t have a good&lt;--&gt;bad direction to it=\r\n - everywhere is\nequally good. And me by placign two objective functions on=\r\n the same\naxis - again ending up with an axis with no good&lt;--&gt;bad direction=\r\n.\nMaybe pareto fronts are not relevant, but they seem to be in very\nsimilar=\r\n territory.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
