I&#39;m not coming only from an ANN angle, but I&#39;m very interested \n&gt; in approaches for combining multiple entities of any evolving/learning type \n&gt; (ANN, GP, GA, ...) into coherent wholes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIt&#39;s a complex area and not hugely reported in the existing literature.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI&#39;ve found two existing approaches exist:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) those variations on the &quot;classifier system&quot; approach which use the \n&gt; output form the whole population.  Typically this seems to be achieved by \n&gt; letting the fittest individual process all those cases it can before \n&gt; passing any remaining cases to the next fittest.  Obviously for \n&gt; classification you can do this because the discrete &quot;cases&quot; are separate \n&gt; and can be seen to be handled or not.  This is harder to apply to other \n&gt; scenarios (hence your need for &quot;confidence&quot;).  It&#39;s also necessary to be \n&gt; able to assess an individual in the absence of the others, which also may \n&gt; not apply for a complex situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) The &quot;Hayek&quot; approach of Eric Baum \n&gt; (http://www.whatisthought.com/eric.html).  This uses economics to control \n&gt; the confidence in each individual.  Individuals in each tick, analyse the \n&gt; situation and bid an amount of money to be the dominant controller (Eric \n&gt; phrases this &quot;bidding to own the world&quot;).  The winner pays its bid to the \n&gt; previous successful bidder (&quot;buying the world form the previous owner&quot;, \n&gt; which may be itself) and then takes control for one tick.  Any improvement \n&gt; in the value of the world after the individual&#39;s actions are credited to \n&gt; it, as well as the money from the individual buying control in the next tick.\n&gt; \n&gt; This system works because it forces individuals to evolve an accurate \n&gt; measure of their own confidence.  Any individual which overbids will make a \n&gt; loss, go bankrupt and be killed.  Any which underbids will never get \n&gt; control, make no profit, and the systems often include a fixed or \n&gt; size-related &quot;tax&quot; which in time bankrupts these individuals as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m cautiously keen on the Hayek approach, although it has at least one \n&gt; pretty serious weakness: in a generation, a mutant high-bidding individual \n&gt; can grab control and deflect the whole system from profitability (say by \n&gt; ramming a boulder head-on).  Existing Hayek implementations handle this \n&gt; because any runs in which the system as a whole is unprofitable are taken \n&gt; back and the offending individual eliminated (or to put it another way, \n&gt; deals involving individuals who &quot;default&quot; on their bids are unwound back to \n&gt; a previous state).  This is a fine strategy as long as the world \n&gt; (simulation) the system lives in is cheap (because it has to be unwound as \n&gt; well) but impractical for (i) complex simulations, (ii) simulations \n&gt; inhabited by more than one Hayek system, or (iii) physically implemented \n&gt; worlds (like real motorbikes in real deserts, for example).\n&gt; \n&gt; But you can easily imagine using Hayek in this situation, feeding money \n&gt; into the system for either forwards motion or reaching the end (either has \n&gt; been seen to work).  Giving each ANN an output for bid (confidence) in \n&gt; addition to its control outputs.  And there would be no concerns with using \n&gt; several different types of ANN in the population...\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan Badcoe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
