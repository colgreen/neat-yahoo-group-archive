Of \ncourse, there is a standard way I use them in my version of NEAT, \nbut there are so many ways it could be done and some might actually \nbe better than others.\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I spotted a bug whereby when I reset the enabled flag on an new \ngenome&#39;s \n&gt; connection I also reset it on the parent! This most likely had a \n&gt; detrimental effect on searching and in fact my update of \nyesterday&#39;s \n&gt; graph indicates that this might have been the case:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/enablebitgraph2.png\n&gt; \n&gt; The two experimetents (with and without the enable bit) are now \nmuch \n&gt; more in-line with each other, whereas enablebitgraph.png showed \nslightly \n&gt; better results without the enable bit. I had put this difference \ndown to \n&gt; not avergaing over enough runs, which could still be the case, but \nthe \n&gt; new graph does show four very well matched lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Maybe some of you will find this of interest...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;As a precursor to my phased searching work I thought about \nsimplfying \n&gt; &gt;the NEAT genome ever so slightly by eliminating the &#39;enable&#39; flag \non a \n&gt; &gt;connection gene. I just ran a experiment using my new OCR code \nand, \n&gt; &gt;although it&#39;s not the most thorough scientific analysis it does \nseem to \n&gt; &gt;hint that the enable bit isn&#39;t all that beneficial.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I ran the same search 10 times, 5 with the enable bit, 5 without. \nEach \n&gt; &gt;run was 1000 generations. I have produced a graph that shows the \naverage \n&gt; &gt;of the runs here:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/enablebitgraph.png\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Colin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
