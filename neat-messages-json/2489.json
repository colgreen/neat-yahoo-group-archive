The one that doesn&#39;t do it is \nrecessive.  Thus if you have two recessives, neither works, so you \nget the recessive phenotype.  But if either gene is dominant, it \nworks, and you get the dominant phenotype.\n\n\tIn some cases you can use a lot of some gene&#39;s product, and the \ndouble dominant phenotype is different from the dominant/recessive \nheterozygote.  And in other cases, the alternative alleles are not as \nsimple as &quot;works&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t work&quot; and you get more complex genetics.\n\n\tExamples are sickle-cell anemia (where two defective haemoglobin \ngenes give you _much_ stronger symptoms) and the ABO blood groups \n(where A and B are both &quot;dominant&quot; and the AB blood group is where \nyou have one of each...)\n\n\tDunno whether this affects your musing...\n\n\tIan\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
