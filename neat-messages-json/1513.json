Most approaches to GP, for \nexample, don&#39;t have any way of doing this, they just cross random nodes \nwith other random nodes.  This leads to terrible performance as soon as you \nget away from the arena of &quot;trivial&quot; problems.  One of the best things \nabout NEAT (IMHO) is that innovation numbers are a really direct solution \nto this.\n\n&gt;   However, I question whether this is really\n&gt;a major problem in nature or NEAT?  Since crossover for the most\n&gt;part takes place in a single species, and two organisms in the same\n&gt;species more or less have the same set of genes, the issue of\n&gt;different building blocks being broken apart from the parents to the\n&gt;offspring seems overblown.  Of course, if a duck mated with a pig,\n&gt;it would be a huge problem to make sure the duck genes largely stuck\n&gt;together.  However, why is this such a concern when a duck mates\n&gt;with a duck?\n\nIn nature, I think the idea is that over very long periods of time (e.g. \nperiods where we can watch 1/2 dozen new species arise), then the genome \ndoes get shuffled appreciably, and over these long periods, putting \nfunctionally related genes together is useful.\n\n((Another angle is that some of these groups of functional genes descend \nfrom a single ancestral gene, so they may be together, merely because they \nnever moved apart...))\n\nFor NEAT, I don&#39;t think that Colin or I were suggesting any failing the way \ninnovation numbers already cover this.  I think we were just toying with \nthe idea that if you were working on a problem that could be separated into \ndiscrete &quot;modules&quot;, then somehow arranging for a module to be (mostly) \ninherited as a single unit might be useful.  E.g. so that if several rival \nversions of the module were in play, they could be readily shuffled \nthroughout the population and tested in the context of all available \ngenomes, without being disrupted by every crossover.\n\nIt is a sobering thought, that nature does seem to do a lot of \noptimizations which only make sense in terms of having &quot;evolved to evolve&quot; \n(e2e).  And many of the more interesting advances that we are easing up to \n(modules, indirect representations...) are starting to look like e2e.  If \nevolving to solve a problem domain is slow, then features evolving to aid \nthe evolution (such as moving or relabelling blocks of genes) must be \nmeta-slow.  Now where did I put that peta-flop processor...\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
