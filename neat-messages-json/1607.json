I think the \nconcept has been mentioned on the list in relation to other problem \ndomains and  I recon it&#39;s an important idea in general although I&#39;ve yet \nto use it myself in any experiments.\n\n&gt;&gt;OK well fire away if you have any questions on the C#.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m already working my way through SharpNEAT (lovely job, by the way).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThanks!\n\n&gt;I think the sensible approach is to build the model around your code\n&gt;to start with and consider my wackier ideas later once that&#39;s all\n&gt;running.\n&gt;\nHopefully you have found the interface between SharpNEAT &#39;core&#39; and the \nexperiment/evaluation code. I tried to make this minimalistic and simple \nto use, the incremental evolution stuff is perhaps not intuitive to a \nnewcomer and to be honest I&#39;ve only used it in the prey capture domain \nso far, I think it&#39;s useful enough an idea to keep around though.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve followed the optimisation threads with great interest\n&gt;(and learned a lot) - have you come across ArithEMITic\n&gt;(http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard/archive/2004/01/24/742.aspx)? It&#39;s\n&gt;an approach that uses Reflection.Emit to compile the\n&gt;performance-optimised code for a network on the fly.\n&gt;\nSounds similar to John Arrowood&#39;s approach for his IEX work. John&#39;s code \nemits C/C++ that can then be compiled with gcc. Thanks for the link, \nI&#39;ll read this later.\n\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t claim to\n&gt;understand it, and I don&#39;t suppose it would enhance something like\n&gt;XOR, but larger models might benefit. Just in case you were suffering\n&gt;from an excess of spare time...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI tend to think that the optimised neural net code that was cooked up \nhere on the list isn&#39;t going to be bettered to much, if at all. But I&#39;m \nalways interested in investigating possibilities. My concern with this \nsort of approach is that as the networks grow in size, the size of the \ncode will also grow and will therefore take longer to compile. So then \nyou have to balance that compile time against expected gains at run time \n- so it depends on how many network activations you expect to do per \nevaluation as to whether the approach is beneficial or not. It&#39;s \npossible juggle some of the interfaces around a bit in SharpNEAT so that \nthe genome decoder routines are passed the expected number of \nactivations, they can then decide on the best decode routine and type of \nnetwork to decode to.  In fact I already use a similar and very simple \nheuristic in the optimised routine I provided in the last release.\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
