Balance for bipedal\n&gt; walkers is\n&gt; incredibly difficult...are you averse to putting any\n&gt; kind of external\n&gt; helper in place?  I thought I heard you mention that\n&gt; you had done some\n&gt; of this.\n\nI&#39;m using an incremental fitness function.  I use\ntraining wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\ncenter of mass moves too far) at first until they\nlearn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\nremove this external help, seed a new population with\nthe champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\nto help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n(first oscillate legs, then worry about\nbalancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\nteach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n\n&gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt; block torso seems to\n&gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt; does the ANN\n&gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt; joint (which\n&gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt; stop)?\n\nThe ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\nthe thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\nrotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\nfrom the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\njust the two hip joints.\n\nMy ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\nmodified PID (proportional integral derivative)\ncontroller to calculate the torque necessary to\nachieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\nhigher-level control system: the brain has desired\nangles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\nmuch force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\nthe same type of controller but just have a constant\ndesired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\nangle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\nswing freely.  \n\nTyler\n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
