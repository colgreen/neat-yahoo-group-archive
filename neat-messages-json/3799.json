It&#39;s interesting but certainly\n=\r\n&gt; not revolutionary. After all it&#39;s just a simplified version of\n&gt; gene-reg=\r\nulation in real biological system. Some stats shows it is as\n&gt; robust as Ne=\r\nat. (Probably not tested against HyperNeat)\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you had any experienc=\r\ne with it?\n&gt;\n\nI have no experience with Mattiussi&#39;s Analog Genetic Encoding=\r\n aside \nfrom reading about it myself.\n\nIt is similar in a way to Joseph Rei=\r\nsinger&#39;s work with evolving a GRN-\nbased encoding with NEAT, as Joe mention=\r\ns in his response to your \npost.\n\nIt is interesting as an abstraction of  d=\r\nevelopmental encoding in \nnature.  In particular, it broadens our perspecti=\r\nve on how such \nabstractions can work and from which aspects of development=\r\n they can \ndraw.  The abstraction seems fairly high-level, i.e. it abstract=\r\ns \naway such details as chemical diffusion and growth from an embryo.  \nIn =\r\nthat way, it has some similarities to HyperNEAT.  \n\nThe main question it br=\r\nings to my mind is what exactly recommends \nthis particular abstraction ove=\r\nr any other.  Although the authors \nnote that it allows a large variety of =\r\ngenetic operations, aside from \nthat, it is unclear what the main principle=\r\n is that supports the \napproach, i.e. why we should prefer it to any other =\r\nindirect \nencoding.  \n\nOf course, as a proponent of CPPNs and HyperNEAT, I =\r\nthink that one \nimportant ingredient for a developmental encoding is the ab=\r\nility to \ncreate patterns as a function of the domain geometry (as in the \n=\r\nsubstrate in HyperNEAT).  AGE does not have such a capability.  Its \nintera=\r\nctions are detached from the geometry of the ultimate network \nit encodes, =\r\nwhich suggests to me that it may fare worse in domains \nwith a geometric ba=\r\nsis, especially those with high \nresolution/granularity.  \n\nI also wonder w=\r\nhy connection-centric parameters (such as weights) \nshould be derived throu=\r\ngh a matching scheme like sequence alignment \n(which is one way AGE sets up=\r\n its &quot;device interaction map.&quot;)  This \nidea seems to be taken from biology =\r\nsimply for the sake of doing \nsomething similarly to biology.  Yet such mat=\r\nching schemes are ad hoc \nbecause they do not relate to anything extrinsic =\r\nto the genome.  \nHyperNEAT relates its connection weights to the outside wo=\r\nrld by \ncomputing them as a function of the locations of nodes.\n\nAs for com=\r\nparisons with NEAT, I do believe that indirect encodings, \nincluding AGE, s=\r\nhould generally be superior to direct encodings in \ntasks that involve mode=\r\nrate-sized patterns.  \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
