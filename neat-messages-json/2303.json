Hearing a talk on neural network\n&gt;ensembles at this year&#39;s GECCO, though related to a control task, I\n&gt;could see how it could easily be mapped onto a game domain.  If you\n&gt;evolve a number of different &quot;specialists&quot;, and then in a secondary\n&gt;phase, evolve a &quot;coach&quot; (called a &quot;gating network&quot; in Pardoe&#39;s paper)\n&gt;which decides at a given point in time which of the specialists should\n&gt;be making the current move, you can have adaptive behavior even\n&gt;without plasticity in the connection weights.  This approach would\n&gt;work better in longer games, or in the case of Tic-Tac-Toe or\n&gt;Roshambo, iterated games, which would give the coach network ample\n&gt;time to assess patterns in game play of the opponent.\n\nHow do you evolve the specialists?  Do you have to write custom fitness \nfunctions for them?\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nTo help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
