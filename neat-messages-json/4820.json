You are asking whether the substrate would still be called an AN=\r\nN if it contained non-sigmoidal nodes.  I believe no one has evolved such s=\r\nubstrates (i.e. with different activation functions), so I think it is a th=\r\neoretical question, but I think what you are saying is probably correct.  T=\r\nhe substrate does not need to be an ANN.  Of course, some ANNs do not use s=\r\nigmoids (such as RBF networks), so just because the nodes are not sigmoids =\r\ndoes not guarantee that it is not an ANN, but in some cases I would agree i=\r\nt is not an ANN.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be careful with the term &quot;tree&quot; because mos=\r\nt graphs are not &quot;trees,&quot; so I would not call it an &quot;expression tree&quot; unles=\r\ns it really was somehow forced to produce trees or somehow output a tree as=\r\n the optimal result.  Whether it would be called &quot;simple&quot; is also probably =\r\na matter of opinion.  Generally, if there are many connections it may not r=\r\neally be simple, but it may be simple if the connection weights of those co=\r\nnnections adhere to a simple underlying pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this answer he=\r\nlps clarify some of your questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nikolai, you have th=\r\ne main idea right but the one aspect of your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; description that I woul=\r\nd correct is the idea that the substrate must\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be a perceptron.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; thanks Ken, as I understood, you call &#39;substrate&#39; a final ANN that evalu=\r\nates the solution to the problem activating each node one by one where each=\r\n node uses the same activation function.\n&gt; &gt; In a paper about CPPNs you say=\r\n that CPPN is not an ANN and this is why it is called &#39;CPPN&#39;, i agree. But =\r\nwhen a CPPN produces weights for an ANN, the result (substrate) must be an =\r\nANN. If each node of the substrate is not perceptron type (i.e does not hav=\r\ne a sigmoid activation function), then we can not call it an ANN, right ? I=\r\nt could be called as some sort of an &quot;expression tree&quot;? And if it does not =\r\nhave many hidden layers, it would represent a simple (repetitive, symmetric=\r\nal, etc) expression. A &#39;simple expression at large scale&#39; if it is dealing =\r\nwith large number of connections. \n&gt; &gt; Please correct me if i am missing so=\r\nmething.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Nikolai\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
