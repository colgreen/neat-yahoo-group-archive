I let\nNEAT \n&gt; see a picture (7 x 14 pixels) of a letter and let it choose which\nletter \n&gt; it thinks it is (out of 26 letters). Thus, I have 7*14=98 inputs +\n1 \n&gt; bias. And I have 26 outputs. Creating a connection from every input\nto \n&gt; every output leads to 99*26 = 2574 connections per network. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I&#39;ve tried a method where I add X random connections instead of\nthe \n&gt; full 2574 connections, but so far, the results are depressing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have an idea for a better method?\n&gt; \n\nShimon Whiteson here at UT has been working on a method of feature\nselection that slowly adds new inputs over the course of the run and\nhas had some initial success.  You might want to try this with your\nhigh-input domain as well.  He generally found it beneficial to start\nout with very few inputs attached and let NEAT attach inputs randomly\nthrough a special mutation that connects a disconnected input to all\nthe outputs.  The rate of that mutation is somewhere between 0.05 and\n0.2 in his experiments but it&#39;s still an empirical question what&#39;s\nbest.  It would be interesting to see if it helps in OCR.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
