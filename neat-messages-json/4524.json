I wonder if this is \nsimilar=\r\n to Novelty Search, where you can choose to have L1 or L2 or \nwhatever dist=\r\nance between phenotype behavior data. \n\nBut in NS usually the behavior data=\r\n is a fixed space. At the genetic \nlevel, the genotype space is unconstrain=\r\ned. Calculating distance \nbetween points that lie in different spaces is a =\r\nchallenge. I even \nwonder if this is possible at all.. \n\nTake 2 random indi=\r\nviduals from the first generation of a typical NEAT \nevolution and they are=\r\n all in the same space. Easy to compare. But \ntake 2 from the same populati=\r\non 1000 generations later and you will \nfind out they are in completely dif=\r\nferent spaces. They may all branch \nfrom the initial minimal space, but the=\r\n virtual coordinate frame that \nshould be able to describe all possible ind=\r\nividuals does not really \nexist. Or does it? \n\nIn fact I guess it does. I c=\r\nan have a 100000+ neurons fully \ninterconnected network and pretend it is t=\r\nhe one ultimate space that \nNEAT can search. Then I can assign coordinates =\r\nto genomes based on \nthat space. But this is misleading because NEAT effect=\r\nively discovers \nnew spaces during evolution.\n\nSo it is a process guided by=\r\n discovery. Then I guess that genotypic \ndistance cannot be calculated more=\r\n effectively than comparing the \ncounts of excess/disjoint genes with respe=\r\nct of genomes. Assigning \nzeroes to missing links (assuming they exist with=\r\n 0 weight) means that \nthese individuals also share genetic history, but th=\r\ney don&#39;t. \n\nPeter \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;colin.green=\r\n1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t address this point:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2008/12/22 petar_cherve=\r\nnski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;:\n&gt; &gt; Suppose that 2 genomes have many disjoint =\r\ngenes with respect\n&gt; &gt; to each other, if they are both represented as zeroe=\r\ns, this would \nmean\n&gt; &gt; they are closer in space?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes that&#39;s right. An=\r\nd this is effectively why I backtracked and\n&gt; hypothesised that the L1/manh=\r\nattan distance (which is what we are\n&gt; effectively using currently) is bett=\r\ner than the L2/Euclidean \ndistance.\n&gt; I think it would be an interesting ex=\r\nperiment to try out thse\n&gt; different distance metrics and see some experime=\r\nntal data to back up\n&gt; the hypothesis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
