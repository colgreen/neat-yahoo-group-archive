I didn&#39;t offer any input at the time since I wasn&#39;t\ncurrently involved in it, but I had done stock market predictions before\nthat discussion, and I&#39;m trying it out again.\n\nI&#39;d like to ask what came of your experiments? What indicators did you\nfind useful? Did you ever find consistent out of bounds performers? What\nfitness functions did you try out? \n\nFinding a strategy that doubles or even quadruples your money on the\ntraining set it is as trivial as it is useless, unless it performs well\nout of bounds - which is much harder. And in my experience, strategies\nrarely do. Or they perform well for one out of bounds period (say 2003)\nbut poorly for another (say 2004).\n\nAs for my own experiments, I don&#39;t use a list of trading data for a given\nstock, instead I input a number of running averages. For instance, I\nmight\ninput the following indicators (all calculated the day before the market\nday that we&#39;re predicting);\n\nCloseRate, CloseRateAvg7, CloseRateAvg14, HighestRate, HighestRateAvg7,\nHighestRateAvg14 etc.\n\nAll values are normalized by dividing by CloseRateAvg200. Inputing price\ninformation for the last X days might work, but it seems extremely short\nterm and volatile. I&#39;ve found in previous experiments that using too many\ninputs can lead to overfitting, where the strategy simply identifies a\nnumber of instances in the training set where it&#39;s good to buy stock.\nThose instances are never repeated out of bounds and the strategy is\nuseless. \n\nTechnical Analyzis introduces a wide range of indicators, most of which\nhave worked poorly in my experiments. Possibly the simplest TA strategy\nis\nto buy when the short term average is higher than the long term average,\nbecause that indicates that the stock is moving up, and to sell on the\nopposite.\n\nI&#39;m hoping to open up the discussion again and see if there are any new\ncool ideas floating around. The two indicators CloseRateAvg7,\nCloseRateAvg14 open up for this type of strategy.\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
