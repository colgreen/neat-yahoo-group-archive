When I \nwatch \n&gt; &gt; an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nanimaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it looks \n&gt; &gt; like it=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; exibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be described as a \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; mexican \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wave travelling across the hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As the CPP=\r\nNs complexify, so do the activity patterns exibited. \n&gt; &gt; When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; using=\r\n regular NEAT for the problem of keeping the humanoid \nmodel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; balance=\r\nd, it has moslty erratic behaviour, and the lucky ones \n&gt; &gt; (with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hi=\r\ngh fitness) usually find a way to trick the system and stay \nin \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n balanced position forever, without moving at all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But when HyperNEA=\r\nT is used for this, it looks really \ninteresting \n&gt; &gt; and.. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; natural!=\r\n The model is trying to balance using its arms, and it \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; moving.. =\r\nIt looks like a drunk guy, but you note the \ndifference. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve arrang=\r\ned the nodes in a geometric way.. Let me explain - \nthe \n&gt; &gt; left \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd right arm&#39;s outputs are separated in the left and right in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsubstrate space, and close to each other. So do the legs. The \n&gt; &gt; hidden \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nodes are in the center in a star/cirlular shape. I also \nincluded \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inputs (head velocity) in the center around 0.0, but with \nsmal=\r\nler \n&gt; &gt; &gt; radius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
