As Dr. Jones stated up front, \nno one knows the full answer, and that&#39;s absolutely true. What I was \nmore interested in was how the leaders in these areas of biology \nthink about this issue, which I see as one of the most profound \npuzzles at the core of evolution, whether natural or artificial. \nThus, it is intriguing to learn the depth of insight that they can \ndraw from their respective realms of expertise.\n\nSo when I express disappointment over the answers, it is not because \nthey failed to solve the entire problem. Rather, it is that the \nanswers were mainly superficial and perhaps even touching on the \nobvious (of course to a GECCO audience what is obvious is quite \ndifferent than to a normal audience). It left me feeling that, at \nleast within their spheres of research, the puzzles of complexity are \nseen more as peripheral curiosities than paradigm-defining problems. \nWhile it is certainly possible that they have deeper insights than \nthose they offered, it seems a bit strange that they would fail to \nshare them at a debate headlined as &quot;evolution and complexity&quot; in \nfront of an audience of Ph.D. scientists. So it&#39;s not unreasonable \nto conclude they don&#39;t have a lot to say on the subject that is \nparticularly groundbreaking.\n\nIf that is true, my view is that it is somewhat unfortunate for \nbiology. So while their answers perhaps reflect the best the field \nhas to offer (as Thomas speculates may be the case), the field in \nthat case must bear the burden of ignoring such important issues. By \nthe way, I know that some biologists such as Raff and Meinhardt probe \nthese issues much deeper than this panel did, so I would not naively \nendict the entire field. But the mainstream seems a bit off the \ntrack. \n\nWhat&#39;s really interesting about all this, from a GECCO point of view, \nis that it may be that evolutionary computation, rather than biology, \nis where some of the most powerful secrets of evolution are beginning \nto fall out. Who would have thought? \n\nMost people at GECCO who I spoke to after the debate echoed the \nsentiment that they hadn&#39;t really learned much, and in fact, had \nheard deeper insights on evolution and complexity during GDS-track \n(Generative and Developmental Systems, a track at GECCO) paper talks \nthan during the keynote event.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Thomas\nJohnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.johnson@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; These people must have email addresses, why not follow up with them \nthat\n&gt; way? If they care about the question at all, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll give \na more\n&gt; thoughtful response via email. If they don&#39;t care, well, then \nthat&#39;s why you\n&gt; got such bad answers in the first place :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, maybe you got bad answers because the answers actually reflect \nthe\n&gt; current best guesses in their fields. In that case, the answers \naren&#39;t\n&gt; really bad, it&#39;s just that people in other fields haven&#39;t been \nfocusing\n&gt; their attention on this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 4, 2008 12:09 AM, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, the answers were indeed lacking. By the way, notice also \nhow\n&gt; &gt; they ignored the second part of my question: &quot;How can evolution\n&gt; &gt; search a space of such astronomical complexity?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was really disappointed that they didn&#39;t even venture into that\n&gt; &gt; issue, because that&#39;s the really interesting question. Of course \nyou\n&gt; &gt; can always speculate on how a little can be converted to a lot by\n&gt; &gt; talking about fractals and subroutines (after all, that&#39;s just\n&gt; &gt; compression), but when you realize that we are talking about\n&gt; &gt; *searching* a space of such mappings, it becomes far more \ncomplicated\n&gt; &gt; and profound. The problem then becomes compounded by the fact that\n&gt; &gt; not only must the representation be efficient but it must also \nwarp\n&gt; &gt; in meaningful ways, e.g. a biped should have biped children. How\n&gt; &gt; does natural evolution manage to induce such a nicely structured\n&gt; &gt; search space? Not a word was said on the matter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com &lt;neat%\n40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, after I saw the video..

I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoyed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having the opportunity to ask my question to such \nillustrious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientists, but like you, I was kind of disappointed with \ntheir\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answers. Like you said, they sort of answered accurately, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was no real insight or thoughtfulness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s interesting that you point out this exchange because I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; highlights a weakness in how biologists have been dealing \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question of complexity. It&#39;s such a fundamental question \nyet it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t really received the treatment it deserves, even from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field&#39;s luminaries. I think part of the problem is that a\n&gt; &gt; genuine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treatment requires a kind of algorithmic and \nrepresentational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theory,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is perhaps better attacked from a computational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; putting evolutionary computation researchers at an advantage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we think about search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; routinely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I think you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably come at \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem from an angle that might be more productive, but I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially disappointed in Wolpert, who was the main voice for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developmental biology on the panel. Your question gets to \nissues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a developmental biologist should primarily be interested in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have specific insights related to the\n&gt; &gt; development\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the human brain, he should have been able to give other \nexamples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which he was more familiar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A small\n&gt; &gt; step\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of \nneocortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.scienced &lt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?&gt;\nirect.com/science?\n_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T0V-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3Y6PFXS-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n1P&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4eba37dec70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e43\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The more than 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface \nwithout a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comparable increase in its thickness during mammalian \nevolution is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explained in the context of the radial-unit hypothesis of \ncortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; development. According to the proposed model, cortical \nexpansion\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the result of changes in proliferation kinetics that increase \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; number of radial columnar units without changing the number of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neurons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within each unit significantly. Thus, mutation of a regulatory\n&gt; &gt; gene\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (s)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that controls the timing and ratio of symmetric and asymmetric\n&gt; &gt; modes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of cell divisions in the proliferative zone, coupled with \nradial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints in the distribution of migrating neurons, could\n&gt; &gt; create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expanded cortical plate with enhanced capacity for \nestablishing\n&gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns of connectivity that are validated through natural\n&gt; &gt; &gt; selection.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m personally working under the assumption that the cortical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minicolumn is the primary module, that repeatable bit of code \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dawkins talked about, and there are a number of good work by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; biologists out there, including Rakic, who give support to \nsuch an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps they were just being curt or did not take the \naudience\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously enough to elaborate their thoughts. Yet I find \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanation doubtful given that we were after all at\n&gt; &gt; a &quot;debate&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and complexity, which is precisely the substance \nof\n&gt; &gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. I also agree that Dawkins seemed closest to really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins would be very\n&gt; &gt; interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our area of EC if only there was an opportunity to tell him\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great deal of experience \nwith it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess you didn&#39;t have a chance to corner him and talk things\n&gt; &gt; over?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :) Dawkins does seem like he would be interested in a lot of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being presented at GECCO.

As Dr. Jones stated up front, &lt;BR&gt;no one \n  knows the full answer, and =\r\nthat&#39;s absolutely true. What I was &lt;BR&gt;more \n  interested in was how the le=\r\naders in these areas of biology &lt;BR&gt;think about \n  this issue, which I see =\r\nas one of the most profound &lt;BR&gt;puzzles at the core of \n  evolution, whethe=\r\nr natural or artificial. &lt;BR&gt;Thus, it is intriguing to learn \n  the depth o=\r\nf insight that they can &lt;BR&gt;draw from their respective realms of \n  experti=\r\nse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So when I express disappointment over the answers, it is not \n  =\r\nbecause &lt;BR&gt;they failed to solve the entire problem. Rather, it is that the=\r\n \n  &lt;BR&gt;answers were mainly superficial and perhaps even touching on the \n =\r\n &lt;BR&gt;obvious (of course to a GECCO audience what is obvious is quite \n  &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;different than to a normal audience). It left me feeling that, at \n  &lt;BR&gt;l=\r\neast within their spheres of research, the puzzles of complexity are \n  &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;seen more as peripheral curiosities than paradigm-defining problems. \n  &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;While it is certainly possible that they have deeper insights than \n  &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;those they offered, it seems a bit strange that they would fail to \n  &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nshare them at a debate headlined as &quot;evolution and complexity&quot; in \n  &lt;BR&gt;fr=\r\nont of an audience of Ph.D. scientists. So it&#39;s not unreasonable &lt;BR&gt;to \n  =\r\nconclude they don&#39;t have a lot to say on the subject that is &lt;BR&gt;particular=\r\nly \n  groundbreaking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If that is true, my view is that it is somewha=\r\nt \n  unfortunate for &lt;BR&gt;biology. So while their answers perhaps reflect th=\r\ne best \n  the field &lt;BR&gt;has to offer (as Thomas speculates may be the case)=\r\n, the field \n  in &lt;BR&gt;that case must bear the burden of ignoring such impor=\r\ntant issues. By \n  &lt;BR&gt;the way, I know that some biologists such as Raff an=\r\nd Meinhardt probe \n  &lt;BR&gt;these issues much deeper than this panel did, so I=\r\n would not naively \n  &lt;BR&gt;endict the entire field. But the mainstream seems=\r\n a bit off the &lt;BR&gt;track. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What&#39;s really interesting about all th=\r\nis, from a GECCO point of view, \n  &lt;BR&gt;is that it may be that evolutionary =\r\ncomputation, rather than biology, \n  &lt;BR&gt;is where some of the most powerful=\r\n secrets of evolution are beginning \n  &lt;BR&gt;to fall out. Who would have thou=\r\nght? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most people at GECCO who I \n  spoke to after the debate echoed=\r\n the &lt;BR&gt;sentiment that they hadn&#39;t really \n  learned much, and in fact, ha=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;heard deeper insights on evolution and \n  complexity during GDS-track=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;(Generative and Developmental Systems, a track \n  at GECCO) paper talk=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;than during the keynote event.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;ken&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- \n  In &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;neat@yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, \n  &quot;Thomas J=\r\nohnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.johnson@&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  The=\r\nse people must have email addresses, why not follow up with them \n  &lt;BR&gt;tha=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; way?

Yet I find &lt;BR&gt;that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  explanation doubtful given that we were after all a=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a \n  &quot;debate&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; evolution and \n  complexity, which is precisely the substance &lt;BR&gt;of&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question. I also agree that =\r\nDawkins seemed closest to \n  really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking ab=\r\nout it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins \n  would be very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; interested&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; our area of EC if only there=\r\n was an opportunity to tell him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great \n  deal of experience &lt;BR&gt;with =\r\nit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond his old \n  Blind Watchmaker demo.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess \n  you didn&#39;t have a cha=\r\nnce to corner him and talk things&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  over?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; :) Dawkins does seem like he would be interested \n  in a lot of &lt;BR&gt;the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; work&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being \n  presented at GECCO.=\r\n Did he just show up for the panel, &lt;BR&gt;or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the conference at \n  all?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was also thought the \n  other really =\r\ninteresting exchange was &lt;BR&gt;at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 33:45&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; in the video, when the question of whether or not you \n  could&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; evolve a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mouse with feathered wings \n  came =\r\nup, and Wolpert and Jones both&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  =\r\nno, while Dawkins seemed to say probably not, but not for any &lt;BR&gt;of&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \n  &gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasons the other guys came up with.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --Derek&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005C_01C85363.7B1E2520--\r\n\n"}}
