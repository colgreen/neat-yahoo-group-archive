(Get it...NEAT\n&gt; without the N is EAT?..ok maybe we need a better acronym!)  Anyway, it\n&gt; is in principle a general topology building algorithm, so it could be\n&gt; interesting in other domains.\n\nWhen I was writing that modularity overview, I thought it might be nice to\nuse something along the lines of NEAT to evolve genotype-phenotype maps.\nI cited a paper by Kvasnicka where they describe a method in which g-p\nmaps evolve and modularize forming solutions to the NK function. It might\nbeneat to utilize NEAT there (get it), although I&#39;m not sure what\ncomplexification in the g-p mapping would be defined as.\n\nIn general using NEAT to evolve developmental systems would be\ninteresting.\n\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
