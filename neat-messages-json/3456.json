I tried \nto keep the initial release very focused on how Colin implemented \nSharpNEAT, and I think that creating a distributed experiment which can \nrun on multiple nodes should be fairly straight-forward if you&#39;re \nfamiliar with SharpNEAT.  Additionally, I&#39;ve provided a distributed \nversion of the Max Experiment to help people figure out the differences.\n\nThe logic from an experiment-creator&#39;s viewpoint is 99% the same.  The \nonly thing that is really necessary now is that rather than creating one \nof the standard IPopulationEvaluator classes, you create an instance of \nthe new DistributedPopulationEvaluator; also, instead of having your \nnetwork evaluator implement INetworkEvaluator, it must now derive \nRemoteNetworkEvaluator.  Conceptually, that&#39;s all that you need to know!\n\nI provided a nice little GUI for a worker node to select which network \nevaluator to run.  I wasn&#39;t a big fan of how the plug-in architecture \nwas implemented in SharpNEAT, so I implemented what I think is a simpler \nand cleaner approach for the new GUI.  This new part requires that a \nRemoteNetworkEvaluator provide a few descriptors like the name of the \nevaluator, the author, etc.  Additionally, since they&#39;re plug-ins, \nRemoteNetworkEvaluators should have a default constructor and use the \nInitialize method to perform the setup at the beginning.  All of this is \ndemonstrated in the DistributedMaxExperiment.  I plan on implementing \nthe same changes to the SharpNEAT GUI, but that is a lower priority than \nsome of the other features I want to add (e.g., fault tolerance, adding \nnew worker nodes mid-experiment).\n\nThe SharpNeatLib code had to be slightly modified with [Serializable] \nattributes on a lot of the classes to enable them to be transmitted by \ncopy to the worker nodes.  The modified version is included in the \nCodePlex release.\n\nI&#39;ve tested it fairly extensively, but this is a first release, so I&#39;m \nsure it&#39;s got a few bugs in it that I couldn&#39;t catch.  If anyone wants \nto try it out, I&#39;d be glad to hear how/if it works, and of course will \nhelp with any errors.\n\n-- \n\nWesley Tansey\nGraduate Student\nDepartment of Computer Science\nVirginia Tech\nhttp://people.cs.vt.edu/~tansey/\n\n\n"}}
