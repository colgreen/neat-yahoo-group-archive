You&#39;ve put a lot of thought into \nthe way modularity could work, but one question I have is how much \nof this architecture will just naturally arise out of the right kind \nof encoding and evolutionary algorithm on its own?  The other side \nof the question is that there may be a better way to think about \nthis that evolution might discover, but it won&#39;t discover it if you \npredetermine what the right way to do things is.  That&#39;s not in any \nway a criticism of what you&#39;ve been talking about.  Rather, it&#39;s \njust to point out that it&#39;s sometimes hard to know how much thought \nwe should be putting into the solution itself as opposed to a system \nthat can automatically generate the solution on its own.  It&#39;s a \nsublte and confusing distinction sometimes.\n\nI also agree with Mitchell in that we really need some problems that \nrequire the kinds of complex architectures that we are speculating \nabout.  It&#39;s surprisingly hard to think of good benchmarks that need \nor utilize modularity explicitly, or that utilize any kind of high-\nlevel complexity for that matter.  What kind of problem would \nrequire an NN with a million neurons, but wouldn&#39;t take 300 years to \nsolve?  In other words, what&#39;s the right simple proof of concept to \nshow that you can evolve something complex?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \tI&#39;ve been spouting this idea that a modular evolving system \n(NEAT or \n&gt; otherwise) would have to define (and eventually evolve) the \ninterfaces \n&gt; between the modules for quite a while now, and I&#39;m curious to know \nwhether \n&gt; people have any opinions on the approach, e.g. good, bad, \nindifferent, or \n&gt; you just don&#39;t get it?\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
