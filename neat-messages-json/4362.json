The challenge\n&gt; &gt; with encodings is not only for =\r\nthem to theoretically express all\n&gt; &gt; possible procedures, but also to indu=\r\nce a nicely coupled (smooth)\n&gt; &gt; search space. It seems that the space indu=\r\nced by a strictly modular\n&gt; &gt; and hierarchical encodings is unlikely to be =\r\nsmooth, leading to\n&gt; &gt; brittleness. You can have things like a massive new =\r\nmodule being\n&gt; &gt; doubled in one shot (which would usually be a mess, like b=\r\neing born\n&gt; &gt; with two heads) or a change at one level of the hierarchy bre=\r\naking the\n&gt; &gt; rest of it entirely.\n&gt; \n&gt; And yet if evolution stumbles upon =\r\na module whose usefulness stems\n&gt; from multiple occurrences, how else would=\r\n this be accomplished? If we\n&gt; want artificial encodings to be able to prod=\r\nuce something like a\n&gt; mammalian brain, aren&#39;t they necessarily going to in=\r\ncorporate\n&gt; hierarchy and modularity?\n&gt; \n\nDerek, you probably know some of =\r\nmy thoughts on hierarchy and\nmodularity from discussions we&#39;ve had in perso=\r\nn, but to summarize\nbriefly, while I agree wholeheartedly that both are imp=\r\nortant\nproperties observed in phenotypes, the question is how did they get\n=\r\nthere?  \n\nAs some people probably recall me pointing out before, nature doe=\r\ns not\ndiscover one leg, realize it&#39;s a good idea, and then duplicate it\nsom=\r\newhere else.  Both legs are discovered simultaneously as an\nelaboration of =\r\na preexisting bilaterally symmetric convention.  In\ngeneral, I believe that=\r\n most modules and hierarchy are the result of\nsuch elaboration on previousl=\r\ny established conventions, rather than\nfrom the duplication of already-exis=\r\nting modules.\n\nIf an evolutionary algorithm could take a phenotypic module =\r\nand\nduplicate it easily, much of its offspring would be monstrous\namalgamat=\r\nions.  Nature does not generally tinker by simply duplicating\nmodules willy=\r\n-nilly.   \n\nJoe Reisinger and I wrote a position paper on this argument bac=\r\nk in\n2004 called &quot;Exploiting Morphological Conventions for Genetic Reuse.&quot;\n=\r\n It&#39;s still available here:\n\nhttp://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D1=\r\n52\n\nI can tell you that when I presented the ideas in this paper at the\nGEC=\r\nCO workshop in which it appeared, I recall the audience found it\ncontrovers=\r\nial.  A number of people in the audience seemed to react\nespecially strongl=\r\ny to my claim that &quot;nature is not an engineer.&quot; \nAdmittedly, I knew this as=\r\nsertion would draw a reaction, but then\nagain, it&#39;s perfectly true.  If we =\r\ntry to bend evolution to act like a\ngood computer scientist, it may be akin=\r\n to forcing an artist to think\nlike an engineer.  While the concepts of eng=\r\nineering and computer\nscience such as modularity and hierarchy are naturall=\r\ny appealing to us\nas computer scientists and engineers, their traditional e=\r\nngineering\nconception is not necessarily the right perspective for harnessi=\r\nng\nevolution (even if they are byproducts of it).  Evolution is more a\ntink=\r\nerer than top-down (or even bottom-up) designer and its modules\nmost often =\r\nresult from elaborations of regularities that already exist. \n\nken\n\n\n"}}
