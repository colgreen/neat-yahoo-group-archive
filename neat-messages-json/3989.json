The reason I\nsuggested it as a test was to rule out that there&#39;s a trivial method of\nassigning roles that&#39;s more powerful than the r(x) method. \n\n&gt; Mattias, that&#39;s a good question for comparison.  Because it is a \n&gt; challenge to affect the holistic policy of a neural network with a \n&gt; single input, I am guessing it would not work as well.  In contrast, \n&gt; in HyperNEAT, the x position naturally has a holistic effect on the \n&gt; substrate because the whole substrate is generated from that value.  \n&gt; Yet it is an empirical issue and I could be wrong; your idea might \n&gt; work as well.\n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
