My stuff is intended for use on robots, I&#39;m less interested in\n&gt; symmetry and more in repeated structure, I&#39;m not using bilateral\n&gt; symmetry, etc.  So no worries on that front.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll post my thesis to this list when it&#39;s done.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Bryan\n\n--\n  Adam Wright  &lt;zeno@...&gt;\n  University Website Office, The University of Western Australia\n\n\n\n"}}
