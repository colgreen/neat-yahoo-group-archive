In other\n&gt; words,\n&gt; is the net &quot;looking around&quot; at all the cards as it\n&gt; chooses?\n&gt; That would seem to be a way of doing this- have a\n&gt; limited \n&gt; input field but allow it move it around and look at\n&gt; all the cards, and then make a decision (with a\n&gt; separate output\n&gt; node) when it wants to.\n\nI was thinking it would be simpler to just have the X\nand Y coordinate output be the next cards picked.  I&#39;m\nnot sure in Concentration that there needs to be much\nof a &quot;looking around&quot; phase before the net makes two\nchoices.  The only information it would get from\nlooking around (if you stuck to the rules of the game)\nwould be whether or not a particular space had a card\nor was empty, right?  \n\nI&#39;d think you&#39;d want the selection pressure to drive\nthe net to memorize this information, and I would tend\nto think it would take much longer for the net to\nevolve such memory if you allowed it to wander across\nthe tableau every turn before making its pick.\n\nEither way, the fitness of an individual is simply\nbased on the number of turns (or if we allowed a\nwandering phase, the number of looks at the tableau)\nit takes to clear the tableau.  It would be\ninteresting to evolve nets that have a looking phase,\nand an additional output to indicate their choice, and\ncompare the progress of runs against nets that just\npick two positions each turn, without looking around.\n\nEventually, you&#39;d want their actual behavior to\nconverge, right?  That is, you&#39;d want the looking\naround phase to get shorter and shorter so that the\nnetwork could memorize the board and make more\nefficient choices each turn.  It would be interesting\nto see which approach yields a better player in less\ntime.\n\nHmm...so many interesting domains, so little time. :)\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
