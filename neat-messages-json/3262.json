In this case, hidden nodes will have a \ndimensionality ass=\r\nociated with them.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; It would seem that the issue of substrate hidden nodes is mitigated=\r\n \n&gt; somewhat by the fact that in certain instances they are nothing \nmore \n=\r\n&gt; than duplicated substrate input and/or output nodes, created for \nthe \n&gt; =\r\nsole purpose of handling input-to-input or output-to-input \n&gt; connections, =\r\ndue to the current limitation that a) nodes only have \n&gt; one unique input, =\r\nand b) an input has no activation function. In \nthis \n&gt; case, the dimension=\r\nality of the clone node may reasonably carry \nwith \n&gt; it the dimensionality=\r\n of the original.\n&gt; \n&gt; A true substrate hidden (i.e. not a computational du=\r\npe), would not \n&gt; have a clear dimensionality associated with it. So the qu=\r\nestion is, \n&gt; is there a meaningful way to present a true substrate hidden =\r\nnode \nto \n&gt; a hypercube network, or simply have the hypercube network ignor=\r\ne \nthe \n&gt; true substrate hidden nodes, and evolve the true substrate hidden=\r\n \n&gt; nodes and associated connections to whatever, in the substrate \n&gt; netwo=\r\nrk separate from the hypercube network (i.e. hypercube network \n&gt; only oper=\r\nates on &quot;b&quot; & &quot;c&quot; for PSIs and PSOs, and their clones).\n&gt; \n&gt; Other thoughts=\r\n and/or comments are appreciated!\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;    Andy Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Given an arbitra=\r\nry point &quot;P&quot; in design space, comprised of the \n&gt; &gt; following:\n&gt; &gt; (a) prob=\r\nlem specific inputs (PSIs);\n&gt; &gt; (b) auxiliary additional parameters associa=\r\nted w/ PSIs;\n&gt; &gt; (c) problem specific outputs (PSOs);\n&gt; &gt; (d) auxiliary add=\r\nitional parameters associated w/ PSOs;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An instance of a struct of =\r\nitems identified in (a) through (d) \n&gt; above, \n&gt; &gt; which taken together com=\r\nprise a design point P[i], a vector of \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; comprises the current =\r\nsubstrate resolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Substrate Inputs: comprised of PSIs, &quot;a&quot; abo=\r\nve;\n&gt; &gt; Substrate Outputs: comprised of PSOs, &quot;c&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hypercube=\r\n Inputs: comprised of auxiliary additional parameters \n&gt; &gt; associated w/ PS=\r\nIs & PSOs, &quot;b&quot; & &quot;d&quot; above;\n&gt; &gt; Hypercube Output: weight between current pa=\r\nir of nodes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Questions:\n&gt; &gt; (1) When the dimensionality of &quot;b&quot; and =\r\n&quot;d&quot; differ, how is the \n&gt; &gt; hypercube input topology reconciled?\n&gt; &gt; (2) Ar=\r\ne there different hypercube networks depending on if the \n&gt; &gt; current node =\r\n(input or output), is a substrate input, hidden or \n&gt; &gt; output node?\n&gt; &gt; (3=\r\n) How are substrate hidden nodes handled when the hypercube is \n&gt; &gt; focused=\r\n on the associated connecting substrate weight?
