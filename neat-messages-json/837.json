There are at \n&gt; least three ways to implement it.  In the latter 2\n&gt; cases, a &quot;record \n&gt; of innovations&quot; is kept.  (My version of NEAT, and I\n&gt; think all \n&gt; others that I know of have the capability to keep\n&gt; such a record)\n&gt; This record is a list of &quot;things that were added.&quot; \n&gt; So for example, \n&gt; it will say &quot;a new link was added between nodes 3\n&gt; and 7 and given \n&gt; innovation number 12.&quot;  Then, any time another new\n&gt; link is added, \n&gt; NEAT can look back through the record and see if\n&gt; it&#39;s already been \n&gt; added, and then if so give it the same number. \n&gt; Anyway, here are the \n&gt; 3 types of implementation:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  Don&#39;t have NEAT keep any record of previous\n&gt; innovations at all.  \n&gt; In that case, splitting the same link multiple times\n&gt; will always \n&gt; lead to new nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  Have NEAT keep a record of innovations, but\n&gt; clear that record \n&gt; after each generation.  In that case, the same\n&gt; innovation occurring \n&gt; in the same generation will get the same historical\n&gt; marking, but in \n&gt; the next generation the same innovation (e.g.\n&gt; connecting the same \n&gt; two nodes) would get a different marking.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.  Have NEAT keep a record of innovations forever. \n&gt; In that case, \n&gt; the same innovation *always* gets the same number\n&gt; for the entire run.\n&gt; \n&gt; The FAQ question I cited earlier talks about the\n&gt; issues involved in \n&gt; choosing how to do it, but the short answer is that\n&gt; it&#39;s a judgment \n&gt; call, and there is no data to suggest one should\n&gt; strongly prefer one \n&gt; option over the other.  You may have opinions about\n&gt; which is most \n&gt; elegant/biologically plausible/conservative, and\n&gt; those will guide \n&gt; your choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
