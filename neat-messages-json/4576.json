I&#39;m just thinking broadly of the commercial viability of a cheap\n&gt; leg based locomotion controller. Wheels are of course really good for\n&gt; many situations in the modern world, but legs still win in all but the\n&gt; most artificial (roads and level floors) situations. I expect there\n&gt; are military and commercial applications for small to large scale\n&gt; legged vehicles for carrying payloads e.g. up a mountain/hillside,\n&gt; through boggy land, stuff like that. I just see it as an area with a\n&gt; large short term commercial potential in comparison to some of the\n&gt; other typical EC problem domains we all know and love.\n\nI fully agree with you. I wonder how long it will be before we see such\nrobots carrying gear around for us. Big dog certainly implies that it won&#39;t\nbe that far off. \n\n&gt;&gt; Do you know of any robots that can be bought and have a high-fidelity\n&gt;&gt; simulator (preferably in ODE)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry no.\n\nI continue to be shocked by this. I feel like there have to be lots out\nthere, but at this point I have asked the NEAT community and the ODE\ncommunity, and searched a ton on Google,  and no one seems to know of any.\n\nHas anyone out there used Webots? I think they have a simulation of a\nBioloid quadruped in there that you can buy. At least, I think you can buy\nthe building blocks and assemble it.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not getting any clear thoughts on why the period would evolve to\n&gt; be so slow. The only suggestion I have is that maybe the CPPNs weren&#39;t\n&gt; able to effectively coevolve these two disparate features - a gait\n&gt; controller and a single wave period value. Using the CPPN in this way\n&gt; is probably just a cheap and easy way of evolving a period value, with\n&gt; the ideal solution being a completely independent period value bolted\n&gt; onto the NEAT genome.\n\nI agree with you. I have thought many times that it is the fact that I am\nasking the CPPN to do two different things which is causing the problem. I\nlike your suggestion, and have had it on my to do list for a while (bolting\nan extra, one allele, real value genome onto each CPPN genome and see how\nthat works). However, given how far away the CPPN coordinates I am asking\nfor the period are from the joint inputs/outputs, I am surprised it is\ndifficult for the CPPN to deal with the separate objectives.  But your\nsuggested experiment will test these issues and should be performd. I&#39;ll let\nyou know when I get around to it.\n\nThanks (again) for the suggestions. \n\n\n\n"}}
