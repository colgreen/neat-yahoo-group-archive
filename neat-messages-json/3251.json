For all other genomes =\r\nin the new generation, assign them\ninto one\nof the existing species using t=\r\nhe compatibilty distance formula\ndelta =3D c1E/N +c2D/N + c3.W  . if no com=\r\npatibility match found, start\na new species.\n\n\nSo far so good (I hope)\n\nNex=\r\nt Ken&#39;s phd thesis refer to a calculated fitness sharing function fi.\n\nThis=\r\n function gets adjusted to f(dash)i by using the formula\n\nf(dash)i =3D fi/S=\r\nigma (j=3D1 to n) sh(delta)(i,j)\n\n\nThe bit I don&#39;t understand is what the t=\r\nhe original fitness fi is and\nhow its calculated.\n\n(Is it supposed to repre=\r\nsent the phenotype/networks closeness to the\ntarget output?\ni.e. if a netwo=\r\nrk was 90% accurate, would fi =3D 0.9 ??)\n\nAppreciate any clarification\n\nTh=\r\nanks\n\nMike\n\n\n"}}
