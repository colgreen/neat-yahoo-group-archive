To perform enough runs to find\nstatistically significant changes in teh mutation rate would (I would\nwager) take amounts of computation several magnitudes greater than\nwhat we have available.\n\nAlso if we consider evolution in the real world organisms are\nsubjected to wide variations in mutation rate, from differing UV light\nintensity, background radiation, chemical mutagens, etc. I see all\nthese &#39;anomalies&#39; as being an important and central part of evolution\nalong with extinction events (comet impacts, climate change, the\n&#39;switch&#39; to an oxygen atmosphere). Homogenous fitness landscapes and\nmutation/crossover schemes were and are a good starting point for\ncomputational evolution, but I think variation and randomness in the\nfitness landscape *and* the wider evolution &#39;scheme&#39; are very\nimportant.\n\nBottom line: Try a varying mutation rate versus a fixed one regardless\nof whetehr it is fixed high or low.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
