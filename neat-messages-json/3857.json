You can \nallow =\r\nHyperNEAT to determine how to connect them by imposing a \nthreshold on the =\r\noutput of the CPPN below which the connection is \nnot expressed in the subs=\r\ntrate.\n\nTo get hidden nodes it is correct that you need to include them in =\r\n\nthe geometry in some way.  \n\nI am not sure however what your suggested inp=\r\nut vector means to the \nCPPN:\n\n(input cube(t0), hidden cube(t1), single out=\r\nput node(t2))\n\nAre you saying that you will input 3 coordinates at once?  I=\r\nt&#39;s \nlikely I&#39;m just misunderstanding but in general I think it only \nmakes=\r\n sense to input 2 coordinates (the source and target nodes) to \nget the con=\r\nnection weight between them.\n\nNote that one idea that has worked for us wit=\r\nh hidden nodes it to \nhave two outputs on the CPPN: One output is for conne=\r\nctions between \nthe input and hidden nodes, and the other is for connection=\r\ns between \nhidden nodes and the output.  \n\nOf course, there are many possib=\r\nle variations.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;christofer_fransson&quot; \n&lt;c=\r\nhristofer_fransson@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; \n&gt; That means that I have to=\r\n define a fixed network with hidden nodes \n&gt; from the beginning.
