I will be starting a lab there in\n&gt; January, and I=\r\n would like to encourage readers of the NEAT email list that\n&gt; are interest=\r\ned to apply to join my lab. I will continue to work with\n&gt; HyperNEAT, CPPNs=\r\n, NEAT, neuroevolution, etc. in my new lab. One overarching\n&gt; focus will be=\r\n on evolving large-scale, structurally organized neural\n&gt; networks (i.e. ne=\r\ntworks with millions of connections that are modular,\n&gt; regular, and hierar=\r\nchical). I am also interested in combining neuroevolution\n&gt; with learning a=\r\nlgorithms, including neuromodulation. In short, my lab will\n&gt; focus on exac=\r\ntly the sorts of research topics we discuss on this list. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please also=\r\n help me find talented students & postdocs by forwarding this\n&gt; email to th=\r\nose with similar interests. Thank you very much for your help.\n&gt; ----------=\r\n-----\n&gt; Two fully funded Ph.D. positions are available in any of the follow=\r\ning\n&gt; areas, especially in combinations of them: evolving artificial intell=\r\nigence,\n&gt; neural networks, robotics, and deep learning. Postdoctoral positi=\r\nons are\n&gt; also available, but under different funding arrangements (please =\r\nemail\n&gt; jeffclune@... &lt;mailto:jeffclune%40cornell.edu&gt;  for details).\n&gt; Pos=\r\nitions ideally start January 2013, but applications will be reviewed\n&gt; unti=\r\nl the positions are filled. \n&gt; \n&gt; I (Jeff Clune) am starting up a new lab a=\r\nt the University of Wyoming and am\n&gt; seeking two people interested in earni=\r\nng a Ph.D. in computer science. The\n&gt; lab focus is on evolving artificial i=\r\nntelligence by producing artificially\n&gt; intelligent robots, including physi=\r\ncal robots and agents in simulated\n&gt; worlds, such as video games. The lab w=\r\nill also study other bio-inspired AI\n&gt; techniques, such as deep learning. P=\r\nart of these efforts will involve\n&gt; investigating how evolution produced th=\r\ne complex, intelligent, diverse life\n&gt; on this planet by trying to computat=\r\nionally recreate it. Please see my\n&gt; website (http://JeffClune.com) for exa=\r\nmple publications, press articles\n&gt; about the work, videos, etc. Here are s=\r\nome keywords that describe related\n&gt; fields: evolutionary algorithms (also =\r\nknown as genetic algorithms or\n&gt; evolutionary computation), neural networks=\r\n (including evolving neural\n&gt; networks, having them learn, deep learning, a=\r\nnd computational neuroscience),\n&gt; robotics, artificial intelligence, and re=\r\nsearch into the evolution of\n&gt; intelligence, complexity, evolvability, and =\r\ndiversity.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are interested in joining the lab or would like more=\r\n information\n&gt; about the positions, please follow the instructions at\n&gt; htt=\r\np://jeffclune.com/positionsAvailable.html\n&gt; \n&gt; The University of Wyoming is=\r\n located in Laramie, a college town in the heart\n&gt; of the Rocky Mountain We=\r\nst. Nestled between two mountain ranges, Laramie has\n&gt; more than 300 days o=\r\nf sunshine a year and is home to year-round outdoor\n&gt; activities including =\r\nhiking, camping, rock climbing, downhill skiing,\n&gt; cross-country skiing, fi=\r\nshing and mountain biking. Laramie is also near many\n&gt; of Colorado&#39;s major =\r\ncities and university communities (e.g. Fort Collins,\n&gt; Boulder, and Denver=\r\n). \n&gt; \n&gt; The University of Wyoming is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportuni=\r\nty\n&gt; employer.
