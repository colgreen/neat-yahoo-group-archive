This is potentially equivalent to \ncalcul=\r\nating\n&gt; the center center of the region in space defined by the genomes, in=\r\n\n&gt; fact if you average the weight of connections with the same ID you\n&gt; cal=\r\nculate the center of mass of the genomes. So in 2D the exemplar \nis\n&gt; curre=\r\nntly in the center of a circle, but the bulk of the other \ngenomes\n&gt; may be=\r\n clustered around one edge of the circle (because of some \nlocal\n&gt; maximum =\r\nsay), thus the center of &#39;mass&#39; is in fact not in the center\n&gt; but somewher=\r\ne towards (or within) the cluster. So ff we did anchor \nour\n&gt; species for t=\r\nheir lifetime this would become far more likely.\n&gt; \n\nI agree. I think you m=\r\nean that &quot;a hole&quot; is possible, and averaging the \nweights like that would r=\r\nesult in a genome positioned inside the hole, \nbeing far from others, there=\r\nfore making it not really meaningful for a \ngood representative. But there =\r\nis one important thing to consider. If \nthe importance factor for the avera=\r\nge weight difference is high \nenough, there should be no such situation whe=\r\nre most of the genomes \nare around the edge of the circle. Individuals on t=\r\nhe left side and \nindividuals on the right side have to be in separate spec=\r\nies anyway, \nbecause their weights differ significantly. \nSo in this case t=\r\nhe circle is small enough. Its center would make \nsense to represent the en=\r\ntire species. I am not completely sure about \nit, though. \n\nI like the idea=\r\n of a metric function that takes 2 genomes and returns \ndistance. In fact m=\r\ny own implementation follows that idea. So far I am \nusing the traditional =\r\n(Ken&#39;s) way of calculating distance plus some \nadditions, like taking activ=\r\nation functions into account for CPPN \nevolution and the time constants and=\r\n biases of matching nodes as well. \nI am planning to experiment with some o=\r\nther methods in the future. I \nguess I&#39;ll try yours first :) \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
