Our nets range from around 1.4 to 9.0 in\nfitness (out of a possible range of 0-16, with 16\nbeing the max fitness).  The blue bar for each\ngeneration is the range of fitness for the population,\nwith a black dot at the average fitness.\n\nWe&#39;re getting incremental progress, rather than the\nplateaus and sudden jumps you would expect from the\nXOR domain.  And our nets seem to hang at 3 correct\noutputs, but not the fourth.\n\nWe&#39;re investigating our transcription of genomes into\nnetworks and our the activation of our nets as\npossible culprits, but we&#39;re still plugging away at\nfinding all the wrinkles.\n\nJust thought I&#39;d share some of our graphical\ninformation in the meantime.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
