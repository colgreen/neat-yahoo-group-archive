This is certainly a very good point, and one I\nhadn&#39;t considered before when thinking about distributed NEAT.\n\nRegarding using of /dev/random as a seed, I understand this uses\nthings like timing between key presses, or network packets, that sort\nof thing. In the absense of some true RNG hardware this seems liek a\npretty good solution, more info here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
