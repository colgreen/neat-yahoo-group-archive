This follows one of Kens papers, but extends it \ninto \n&gt; more complex networks.  The general problem area is, as suggested \n&gt; previously, aircraft control.  The idea is to maintain level, \nconstant \n&gt; speed flight of the aircraft as environmental and/or aircraft \n&gt; characteristics change.  This could mean the engine losing power, \na \n&gt; wing losing lift or control ability, wind changes, etc. Regarding \nthis, \n&gt; Im looking for any recommendations for papers to look at, and \nideas on \n&gt; what kinds of things to toss into the experimental environment.  \nThe \n&gt; tentative plan now is to run the aircraft through a number of \nrandom \n&gt; environments with different changes or combinations of changes, \nand \n&gt; calculate fitness based off of a deviation from the original path \nas \n&gt; compared to the deviation of an aircraft that&#39;s done nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; The area I could use some help in is with some modifications to \nthe \n&gt; original neat code.  Since the aircraft control is fairly complex, \nI&#39;ve \n&gt; been working at making neat parallel to cut down the time it takes \nto \n&gt; run all this.  Mostly, since this is running on an openmosix \ncluster, \n&gt; this means forking complex procedures that are called from inside \na \n&gt; loop.  Any other potential locations for speedups?  I&#39;ve also been \n&gt; re-implementing the front end in KDE, since that&#39;s usually the \n&gt; environment Im working under.  From those who have done re-writes \nof \n&gt; neat before, is there anything in particular I should be \nespecially \n&gt; careful of?  Now, where I need help is with implementing plastic \n&gt; synapses.  Since I will be comparing this with Ken&#39;s original \nresults, \n&gt; I&#39;d like to implement them in a manner similar to what Ken had for \nhis \n&gt; food foraging experiments.  A rough outline of the implementation, \nor \n&gt; better yet, source code, would be appreciated.\n&gt; \n\nHi Mark, just to make sure I understand, you are using my NEAT code \nright?  \n\nOne really big area that is easy to parallelize is individual \nevaluations.  If each individual in the population can be evaluated \nindividually, then you can parallelize as many evaluations as you \nhave processors.  In that case, you get an n-times speedup in \nevaluation where n is the # processors, and I am betting that in \nyour domain evaluation is by far taking up most of the processing \n(as opposed to e.g. NEAT genetic operations). \n\nI will try to put together a tar of my adaptive NEAT files in the \nnext few days.  I can&#39;t provide experimental control code (it&#39;s far \ntoo complicated and undocumented) but I can provide the genetics.* \nand networks.* files that implement adaptive synapses.  However, if \nyou are using someone else&#39;s NEAT code this obviously won&#39;t help so \nlet me know if I am right that you are using my code.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
