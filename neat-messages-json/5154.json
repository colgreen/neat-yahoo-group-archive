Maybe one can even develop a single CPPN that=\r\n does both. \n&gt; But of course, one can use any generator technique for the s=\r\nubstrate template - it just seems so elegant to use the same technique for =\r\nstructure as well as connectivity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I remember some discussion on =\r\nthis topic in this list a while ago, but can&#39;t remember or find what came o=\r\nf that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone made any inroads into this research area yet? Any r=\r\neferences or pointers?\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Evert\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
