I agree Colin&#39;s \nmethod might help but I want to just point out what might be going \non.  You seem to have run into a classic local optimum.  It&#39;s \nprobably a situation where it&#39;s very easy to get some of the \nclassifications right using some rough heuristic which is found \nearly on, but then to get any of the other classifications right \nrequires *sacrificing* the naive function that was found first, \nwhich is almost never going to happen since it means dropping in \nfitness for a while.  The presence of species should help with this \nproblem but the basin around the initial poor solution may be so \nlarge that it&#39;s virtually inevitable to get pulled in.\n\nThis kind of thing seems to happen more in classification problems \nthan control problems (just based on my observations, not \nexperimental backup).  I&#39;d try Colin&#39;s suggestions but if that \ndoesn&#39;t work then probably the fitness function needs some tuning,\nperhaps extreme ad hoc tuning based on what you know is happening.  \nIn other words, which examples does it tend to get right when its \nstuck?  Maybe you can do something to avoid awarding that situation.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;blackkm7&quot; &lt;karl.black@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Colin,\n&gt; Thanks for the write-up... interesting ideas!\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you know if anyone has added &quot;phasing&quot; or de-complexification \n&gt; mutation code to JNEAT? and is it available?

I also observed poor results, \n&gt; although \n&gt; &gt; the OCR domain has a lot more input and output nodes than your \n&gt; digital \n&gt; &gt; display domain.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I raised a number of issues in the write-up which I \ncan&#39;t \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; do justice here so I would recommend you have a read and see \nwhat \n&gt; you \n&gt; &gt; think. From my experiments with Simple-OCR and knowing that your \n&gt; digital \n&gt; &gt; display domain problem has far fewer inputs and ouptuts, I am \n&gt; fairly \n&gt; &gt; confident that this could be solved in SharpNEAT in it&#39;s current \n&gt; state. \n&gt; &gt; I am willing to implement it and make another release if there \nare \n&gt; any \n&gt; &gt; doubters :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Oh the URL for the write-up is \n&gt; www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/phasedsearch.htm\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
