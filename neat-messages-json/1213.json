It would be interesting to \n&gt;compare it to the &quot;mixed&quot; search of Derek and Philip.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I think if I use the player comparison table format used in their \npaper that should be a good basis for comparison.\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;&gt;3)OCR - Optical Character Recognition. The plan is to expose a set \n&gt;&gt; of 2D &lt;&gt;bitmaps, in turn, to the inputs of an NN. The number of \n&gt;&gt; outputs will\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;reflect the number of 2D maps in the current set, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;It might be easier to evolve a single classifier net for each \n&gt;character, i.e. &quot;is it or isn&#39;t it an &#39;a&#39;?&quot;  That obviously reduces \n&gt;the output space a lot.  Then you could combine all these separate \n&gt;networks into a single network and let NEAT evolve interconnections \n&gt;to improve how they interact with each other...just an idea!\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell this got me thinking. This comes under the heading of task \ndecomposition [again], breaking down the one all-purpose network into \nmultiple single-purpose networks. If I was looking for the best OCR \nnetwork then I think this is a better approach and far more likely to \ngive good results, especially as the number of characters increase. What \nI&#39;m trying to do though is present a problem to NEAT that we know it \nwill find difficult, so that we can measure any improvement. As a \ncompromise between the two techniques I can vary the number of \ncharacters that I am trying to recognise, perhaps starting with just 3 or 4.\n\nI think this makes sense, I am thinking that the phased-search approach \nis a way to improve the search through the topology space (because we \ntrim away and build back up), but not the connection weights. The \ndecomposed OCR technique you propose is largely a problem of searching \nthrough connection weights (I think) since I don&#39;t think it requires any \nhidden nodes to be solved. OK you still need to evolve the connections \nto start with, but the point is that the networks evolved will probably \njust connect each input directly to the output with no hidden nodes, and \ntherefore the scope for improving the search as a whole by improving the \ntopology searching is [very] limited.\n\nActually my approach doesn&#39;t /need/ hidden nodes either but it does have \na larger input/output space to search, and also has [more] scope for \nusing hidden nodes as the basis for representing character recognition \nstrutures that can be reused for more than one character. e.g. where \ncharacters are very similar (c/e/o/q  or P/R/K) a hidden node might \nprepresent the detection of the common parts and then aditional \nstructures detect only the differences.  This potentially makes for \nleaner, more efficient networks, though as you suggest, if we evolve \nindividual networks we can combine them and perorm some more searching \nto make the combined netork more efficient - although I think deletion \nmutations would improve such an &#39;amalgamation&#39; of sub-networks.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
