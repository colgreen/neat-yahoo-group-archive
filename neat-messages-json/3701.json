They really help you\n&gt; understand what&#39;s going on and thereby debug and better optimize\n&gt; parameters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, SharpNEAT is one of the fastest versions of NEAT available.\n&gt; The regression experiments can run 100,000 generations in a few\n&gt; hours, which is impressive. Will the same optimizations that allow\n&gt; that performance really hold after transferring it over?\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Jim,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 19/12/2007, Jim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr. &lt;jim_oflaherty_jr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am curious as to why you are considering shifting from .NET/C#\n&gt; to Java. Given the conversion will cost you development time, what\n&gt; advantages are you gaining in Java, or disadvantages in moving away\n&gt; from .NET/C#?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I ask this as I have been attempting to evaluate performance\n&gt; between these two platforms. To what degree, if at all, is your move\n&gt; performance motivated?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually performance isn&#39;t really a major factor in my thinking. The\n&gt; &gt; Java and .Net compilers and runtime environments are all well\n&gt; thought\n&gt; &gt; out and fast environments in my opinion. OK so you&#39;ve got different\n&gt; &gt; Java VM&#39;s from different vendors for different scenarios, but\n&gt; they&#39;re\n&gt; &gt; all good including the standard (free) ones. And in the .Net world\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; have Mono which was quite slow when I last tried it last (12 months\n&gt; &gt; ago ish). But generally if you see significant performance\n&gt; differences\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s most likely the code you&#39;re using, not the environment. As I\n&gt; say\n&gt; &gt; the generics support in .Net is more performant, so that does tilt\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; performance argument slightly in favour of .Net\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For me the main argument for Java is the Eclipse IDE. It&#39;s far\n&gt; easier\n&gt; &gt; to navigate through code using views such as the type and call\n&gt; &gt; hierarchy, highlighting of variables, errors, warnings, TODO\n&gt; comments,\n&gt; &gt; etc. on the right hand margin. The CVS/SVN support is really nice to\n&gt; &gt; use - Visual Studio&#39;s equivalents are either very poor by comparison\n&gt; &gt; (SourceSafe) or very expensive (TeamSuite). Ultimately the Java\n&gt; coding\n&gt; &gt; experience is nicer and makes more efficient use of programmer time\n&gt; &gt; IMO - a big plus in my book.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So although I prefer the .Net framework, the IDE&#39;s let the side\n&gt; down.\n&gt; &gt; Add to that the fact that Java is more open source friendly and that\n&gt; &gt; could sway the argument for me. Yes you can get a free version of\n&gt; VS,\n&gt; &gt; but (a) it&#39;s not as good as Eclipse (also free) and (b) it has some\n&gt; &gt; features disabled - 64bit support and multithreaded debugging are\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; I bumped into recently.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Development time is an issue. Not so much porting the core algorithm\n&gt; &gt; stuff as I&#39;m intending to refactor all of that anyway, but all the\n&gt; &gt; graphical stuff and GUI interfaces could be a serious headache.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nDaniel Tuohy (danielr2e@...)\nArtificial Intelligence Software Engineer\nStottler Henke\n404-314-8467\n\n"}}
