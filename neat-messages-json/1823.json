That is a problem in a=\r\nll Recurrent Networks,\n&gt; &gt; values are difficult to store more than 10-50 it=\r\nerations in the\n&gt; &gt; network (see LSTM Link for references). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tI pu=\r\nt LSTM inside a NEAT. The evolution make NEAT to use \n&gt; LSTM cells\n&gt; &gt; in a=\r\n productive way storing key values, recovering that values when\n&gt; &gt; they ar=\r\ne useful a forgetting them  if it is useful (The 3 LSTM cell\n&gt; &gt; functions)=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tMy analysis of some of the solved problems suggest that LSTM \n&gt;=\r\n helps to\n&gt; &gt; NEAT in some problems to reduce greatly the searching space \n=\r\n&gt; helping to\n&gt; &gt; memorize (some times to accumulate) some important key eve=\r\nnts that \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; used after to get out the right outputs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tAn i=\r\nntuitional example about reduction of searching space is \n&gt; serial\n&gt; &gt; XOR,=\r\n if you solve serial XOR with NEAT you can see that the \n&gt; solution\n&gt; &gt; net=\r\n use recurrent connection to store the first value and later it\n&gt; &gt; compare=\r\ns with second value in the serial sequence. In my computer \n&gt; (P4\n&gt; &gt; 2,4Gh=\r\nz) it last around  2 minutes to find a solution with NEAT \n&gt; alone.\n&gt; &gt; How=\r\never, when I use one LSTM cell in the NEAT-LSTM it last ONLY 5\n&gt; &gt; SECONDS!=\r\n!!!!.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)  Improving Work Methods in Real Automation Problems:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;       Motivation: Evolution systems have been achieving great \n&gt; resul=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; in last years. In my daily work in automation projects business, I\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; have to face another problem: cost. That is the reason that most of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe times the industry try to avoid complex systems. Complex \n&gt; systems\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n are difficult to develop, difficult to modify and difficult to\n&gt; &gt; mainten=\r\nance. Most of the times, it is the last choosen resource. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tOther =\r\nproblems to use evolution systems are the \n&gt; uncertainty.  Always,\n&gt; &gt; ther=\r\ne is some likelihood that a problem will converge to a \n&gt; solution in\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\n reasonable time. Some time we can evaluate it, sizing the \n&gt; searching\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n space. Other times it very difficult to size such space. \n&gt; Uncertainty\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; is a variable related to, what is known in business as, risk. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \t=\r\nSome recent experiment as in \n&gt; &gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/=\r\nwhiteson.gecco03.pdf \n&gt; suggest\n&gt; &gt; that a way to reduce searching space is=\r\n to &quot;draw&quot; the guide\n&gt; &gt; where the\n&gt; &gt; solution will be searched. Some of m=\r\ny research has gone in that\n&gt; &gt; direction. In most of the systems we have d=\r\neal with, we have some\n&gt; &gt; previous knowledge about them. My work is focusi=\r\nng in how organize\n&gt; &gt; such previous knowledge in: decision trees, tasks, a=\r\nbstraction \n&gt; levels\n&gt; &gt; and interdependences among them to reduce as much =\r\nas possible the\n&gt; &gt; searching space. So the final goal is to find feasibili=\r\nty work \n&gt; methods\n&gt; &gt; and tools to use evolution systems in real automatio=\r\nn Industry\n&gt; &gt; problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Germ=E1n.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
