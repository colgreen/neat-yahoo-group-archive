That is, it &#39;learns&#39; the rules, it =\r\ndevelops a strategy,\nand some of what is &#39;learned&#39; in one game is transferr=\r\nable to another\ngame.\n\nOr is that not the ultimate goal?\n\nWhat if you were =\r\nto attempt to evolve a network that is capable of\nplaying 10 different game=\r\ns?  Chess.  Checkers, Go, tic-tac-toe, and\nwho knows how many others.  The =\r\nsearch space would be impossibly\nlarge, and perhaps even impossible to trav=\r\nerse.  The only possible\nsolution would be a generalized learning mechanism=\r\n, wouldn&#39;t it?  But\nwould we ever find it?\n\nOn 9/30/05, Derek James &lt;djames=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On 9/28/05, Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When we say &quot;let&#39;s evolve a player for game X&quot; we are actually bei=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; ambiguous.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exactly...which is why I would personally shy away fr=\r\nom using such\n&gt; words as &quot;optimal&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; for evolved strategies or p=\r\nlayers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; We might mean:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - evolve a player in the context of so=\r\nme opponent(s), or,\n&gt; &gt; - evolve a fixed strategy for the general case of a=\r\nny opponent, or,\n&gt; &gt; - evolve a adaptive strategy that adjusts itself to th=\r\ne current opponent\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the moment I am working on the second of thes=\r\ne, and I&#39;ll use a lot of\n&gt; &gt; instances of the first along the way.

Hearing a talk on neural network\n&gt; ensembles at th=\r\nis year&#39;s GECCO, though related to a control task, I\n&gt; could see how it cou=\r\nld easily be mapped onto a game domain.  If you\n&gt; evolve a number of differ=\r\nent &quot;specialists&quot;, and then in a secondary\n&gt; phase, evolve a &quot;coach&quot; (calle=\r\nd a &quot;gating network&quot; in Pardoe&#39;s paper)\n&gt; which decides at a given point in=\r\n time which of the specialists should\n&gt; be making the current move, you can=\r\n have adaptive behavior even\n&gt; without plasticity in the connection weights=\r\n.  This approach would\n&gt; work better in longer games, or in the case of Tic=\r\n-Tac-Toe or\n&gt; Roshambo, iterated games, which would give the coach network =\r\nample\n&gt; time to assess patterns in game play of the opponent.\n&gt;\n&gt; Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
