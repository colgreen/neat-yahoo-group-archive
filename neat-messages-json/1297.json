I&#39;d like to see how the solution \n&gt;networks looked as well from the different types of runs.  I wonder \n&gt;if it&#39;s possible to see the difference.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWith the OCR domain I&#39;m using the solutions tend to not have any hidden \nneurons after pruning, which makes sense because I would expect it to be \npossible to distinguish between a large proportion of the 26  characters \nby choosing a select few pixel inputs that are unique to certain \ncharacters, mapping them directly to the output of the corresponding \ncharacter. Where characters have common features it looks like that that \ninstead of using a hidden node the networks are using connections from \nan output node back to another output node. Again this makes sense, e.g. \nin in the Courier New font [that I am using] a lower case &#39;h&#39; is almost \nidentical to a &#39;b&#39;, so a connection from output &#39;h&#39; to output &#39;b&#39; in \naddition to a connection that represents part of the base of the letter \n&#39;b&#39; will be able to distinguish the two characters.\n\nI definitely think this is what is happening because I often see the \nbest solution confuse similar shaped characters, e.g. a/e/s and b/h and \nyet there are no hidden neurons.\n\nBack to your question then - I wonder if without the pruning we would \nsee the common features represented with hidden nodes more often since \nthey would not have been pruned away before other connections had chance \nto connect to them. I definitely think this would be the case - so yeh, \nworth investigating. I actually do some &#39;clever&#39; pruning whereby a \nneuron with either a single output or single input is replaced with a \nload of equivalent(from a connectivity point of view) connections, I \ncould try swicthing this off or reducing the rate that it occurs at\n\nFinding better solutions seems to be mostly due to keeping the \npopulation lean, which keeps the search running at a decent speed. I can \nactually watch the speed of the search increasing from sluggish to fast \nover the space of about 10-30 seconds during pruning. Probably searching \nwithout pruning would find networks that are just as good in time, but \nas the complexity of the population increases the search slows \ndramatically. Note that in the pruning search that scored 24/26 it took \nabout 1.5hrs and performed 56,802 generations in that time! In contrast, \nwithout the pruning, a search of similar duration performs about 7400 \ngens. So increasing complexity is definitely becoming a problem after a \nlarge number of generations. I&#39;m not sure how many gens other people&#39;s \nexperiments are running to, but perhaps such large numbers are uncharted \nterritory for NEAT?\n\nKeep in mind that I specifically chose the OCR domain because it is fast \nto evaluate, so such good performance figures are not indicative of \nSharpNEAT as a whole :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
