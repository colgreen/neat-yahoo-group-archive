How exactly does this work? Doesn&#39;t\nthe CPPN need t=\r\no know of a hidden layer at the start?  It looks to me\nlike there is only a=\r\nn input/source layer and an output/target layer\nthat&#39;s being mapped in the =\r\nstate-space sandwich.\n\n2) Why were tests run against P-NEAT and not against=\r\n regular NEAT? Was\nit just for saving computational resources?\n\n\nI loved th=\r\ne paper though overall.  It&#39;s really exciting and hopefully\nI&#39;ll be able to=\r\n use it in a project I&#39;m planning on starting.\n\nThanks,\nWesley\n\n\n"}}
