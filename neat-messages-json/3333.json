Where do you get 3d humanoid physics models from?\n\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Hello there, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am using the following CPPN model for the substrate=\r\n: \n&gt; \n&gt; Inputs: X1, Y1, X2, Y2, BIAS\n&gt; Outputs: Weight, Node-Bias, Node-Tim=\r\ne_Constant\n&gt; \n&gt; The time constant range is [0.5 .. 5.0] and the weight/node=\r\n-bias \nrange \n&gt; within the substrate in [-8.0 .. 8.0]. \n&gt; The weight range =\r\nin the CPPN is unbounded. \n&gt; \n&gt; The node-specific outputs are computed usin=\r\ng (X1, Y1, BIAS) and the \n&gt; others set to 0.\n&gt; \n&gt; The activation functions =\r\nused are plain sigmoid, gaussian, and \nsine. \n&gt; The CTRNN substrate activat=\r\nes with 0.02 timestep and it is used to \n&gt; control a 3D humanoid model, sim=\r\nulated in a physical environment \n(using \n&gt; Open Dynamics Engine http://www=\r\n.ode.org ). \n&gt; \n&gt; The thing I notice, is the following: \n&gt; \n&gt; The first net=\r\nworks are simple, and so the connective patterns are. \nBut \n&gt; the node bias=\r\nes and time constants are also simple. When I watch an \n&gt; animaion of the a=\r\nctivation changing in the substrate, it looks like \nit \n&gt; exibits a pattern=\r\n. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be described as a \nmexican \n&gt; wave travelling =\r\nacross the hidden nodes. \n&gt; As the CPPNs complexify, so do the activity pat=\r\nterns exibited. When \n&gt; using regular NEAT for the problem of keeping the h=\r\numanoid model \n&gt; balanced, it has moslty erratic behaviour, and the lucky o=\r\nnes (with \n&gt; high fitness) usually find a way to trick the system and stay =\r\nin a \n&gt; balanced position forever, without moving at all. \n&gt; But when Hyper=\r\nNEAT is used for this, it looks really interesting \nand.. \n&gt; natural! The m=\r\nodel is trying to balance using its arms, and it is \n&gt; moving.. It looks li=\r\nke a drunk guy, but you note the difference. \n&gt; I&#39;ve arranged the nodes in =\r\na geometric way.. Let me explain - the \nleft \n&gt; and right arm&#39;s outputs are=\r\n separated in the left and right in the \n&gt; substrate space, and close to ea=\r\nch other. So do the legs. The \nhidden \n&gt; nodes are in the center in a star/=\r\ncirlular shape. I also included 3 \n&gt; inputs (head velocity) in the center a=\r\nround 0.0, but with smaller \n&gt; radius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPeter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
