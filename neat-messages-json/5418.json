The link is:\n\nhttp://ep=\r\nlex.cs.ucf.edu/software/ahni.tar.bz2\n\nAlso, I&#39;ve looked over most of Oliver=\r\n&#39;s thesis and I recommend reading it to anyone in the group interested in H=\r\nyperNEAT.  The visual processing experiments are quite interesting and the =\r\nvisualizations of evolved receptor field layouts provide a lot of insight. =\r\n They turn out to be surprisingly well-organized.  The visual processing ca=\r\npabilities of HyperNEAT had not been previously explored much beyond the ol=\r\nd boxes domain; the new results suggest there is a lot of potential for int=\r\neresting structures to emerge in this kind of domain.\n\nThanks very much to =\r\nOliver for providing a new HyperNEAT package for Java as well.\n\nken\n\n--- In=\r\n neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;ve recently completed a thesis on some of the properties and \n&gt; character=\r\nistics of HyperNEAT. The abstract is below; the thesis is \n&gt; attached. As p=\r\nart of this work I created a Java implementation of \n&gt; HyperNEAT, it is cur=\r\nrently available on the NEAT group page in the files \n&gt; section and should =\r\nsoon be up on the HyperNEAT User&#39;s Page (when Ken \n&gt; gets around to it).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Oliver\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; In this study a recently developed =\r\nneuroevolution method, HyperNEAT, is\n&gt; applied to new tasks in order to lea=\r\nrn more about its characteristics in\n&gt; general and for the tasks specifical=\r\nly. The tasks required directly\n&gt; processing raw image data, including some=\r\n from a robot-mounted camera,\n&gt; requiring the neural networks to directly p=\r\nrocess hundreds or thousands\n&gt; of inputs. The tasks included object recogni=\r\ntion and robot navigation.\n&gt; The complexity and properties of the tasks, as=\r\n well as the neural\n&gt; network substrate topologies, were varied and the per=\r\nformance and\n&gt; characteristics of the evolutionary process and solutions ge=\r\nnerated were\n&gt; analysed. Positive results were achieved for non-trivial tas=\r\nks, and some\n&gt; important characteristics of HyperNEAT not previously report=\r\ned were\n&gt; discovered: a bias towards generating weight patterns aligned wit=\r\nh the\n&gt; topographical arrangement of neurons within the layers of the subst=\r\nrate\n&gt; network; the impact on performance of the number of dimensions in th=\r\ne\n&gt; topographical arrangement of neurons in hidden layers; the ability to\n&gt;=\r\n evolve solutions more quickly with larger substrate networks; and a\n&gt; poss=\r\nible difficulty co-evolving weight patterns for substrate networks\n&gt; contai=\r\nning more than one hidden layer. New directions for further\n&gt; research and =\r\npossible enhancements to HyperNEAT are proposed based on\n&gt; these findings.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; *E:* oliver@...\n&gt; *P:* 0421 972 953 (Aus.), +61 421 972 95=\r\n3 (Intl.)\n&gt; *Skype:* oliver.coleman\n&gt; *W:* www.e-geek.com.au - /commercial =\r\nweb services./\n&gt; *W:* www.enviro-geek.net - /not-for-profit web services./\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
