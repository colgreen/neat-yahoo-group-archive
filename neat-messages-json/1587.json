I didn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;quite understand Ferreira&#39;s explanation on her web site but it looks\n&gt;&gt;like it might be straightforward to implement.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s a similar to the multiplexing problem that has been plaguing IEX...\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s a question with six inputs:\n&gt;\n&gt;2 &quot;address lines&quot;\n&gt;4 &quot;data lines&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is, treat the data lines as a 4-element array, treat the \n&gt;address lines as a 2 bit number, output the contents of the data array \n&gt;element indexed by the address lines.  \n&gt;\nThanks for the explanation.\n\n&gt;A similar standard test is the 11 multiplexer, where there are 8 data lines \n&gt;and 3 address lines.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nand the 20 multiplexer, etc. Perhaps a bit difficult that eh.\n\n&gt;I&#39;ve read her paper now.  Her neurones have a step activation function, and \n&gt;a threshold, they output 0 or 1 and everything is +ve.  This is in line \n&gt;with the standard GP multiplexing test case but it makes the logic simpler \n&gt;than if either the address or data were floats.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIf I find time I might give this a go as well, like you say it&#39;s very \nsimilar to the IEX sub-task John described which I never got around to \ntaking further. Obviously with my current NEAT setup it&#39;s easier to try \nthis with sigmoid activation functions and floating point data.\n\n&gt;&gt; I also note that she runs\n&gt;&gt;a business that uses GEP commercially, so it can&#39;t be all that bad Ian :)\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Not &quot;bad&quot; as such, but like all commercial techniques, a bit hyped beyond \n&gt;its reality.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDespite the song a lot of people still do believe the hype I&#39;m afraid.\n\nCheers for the info.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
