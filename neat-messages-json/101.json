It ensures that small genomes will \n&gt;persist as long as they are competitive, since they won&#39;t be mixing \n&gt;with, and don&#39;t have to compete directly for offspring with other \n&gt;more complex species.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOK but as I said in an earlier email, if the evolution stops progressing \nbecause the problem is too hard, or all of the species are bogged down \nin local maxima, then the simple species will become gradually reduced \nand bloat will set in. Protection of simple structure is only assured \nwhile evolution is progressing, I think that is where the source of our \ndisharmony lies. :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
