The new=\r\n enhancement iteratively searches only through cross-sections of the hyperc=\r\nube instead of through the entire hypercube at once.  Also, while last year=\r\n&#39;s work only showed that ES-HyperNEAT can perform as well as regular HyperN=\r\nEAT, this work shows that ES-HyperNEAT has an advantage on some problems, i=\r\nn particular when progressive elaboration of network structure is useful.\n\n=\r\nFigure 8 on page 8 shows a nice example of a progression of networks over e=\r\nvolution that illustrates why evolving the substrate is promising.\n\nWe are =\r\nplanning to release source code for the evolvable substrate before this yea=\r\nr&#39;s GECCO.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
