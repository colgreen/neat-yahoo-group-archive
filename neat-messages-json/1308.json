The original seed topology (no hidden nodes)\n&gt; was still alive and kicking, and battling it out for first place in the\n&gt; population, which means that things weren&#39;t exactly progressing...\n&gt; \n&gt; So I decided to speed things up.  I chopped down the number of networks in\n&gt; the population so that packets get returned sooner.  Found a bug in my\n&gt; offspring allocation code in the process...oops...but that&#39;s fixed now.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I&#39;m trying to get through the generations faster in an attempt to\n&gt; make some progress.  Problem is, I think I may have done myself a\n&gt; disservice.  By having the evaluation code start at the reduction side and\n&gt; work its way up to enlargement, it seems the pressure is to create a network\n&gt; that merely averages its pixel inputs.  And I&#39;m not convinced that it will\n&gt; be able to (easily) break away from that pressure, even as topology is\n&gt; added.  It might, but I&#39;m thinking that I would be better off if I just went\n&gt; ahead and calculated all activations rather than trying to short-circuit the\n&gt; calculations for less fit networks.
