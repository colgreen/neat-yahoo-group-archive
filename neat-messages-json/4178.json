You switched to\nzero-G and you switched to looking for oscillations. Do I have that right?\n\nOut of curiosity, did you try just searching for oscillations but not\nswitching to zero-G? Alternately, did you try taking some of your walkers\nfrom zero-G and then turning gravity on?\n\nThis raises an interesting question in novelty search research: how can you\nuse a good seed organism to kick-start a process? If you have a walker that\nmoves a few steps away and then falls, it seems that the beginning of\nnovelty search will simply reward the easy discovery of all the points\naround center. So, instead of working on the walker&#39;s genome and moving\nfarther out, it will revert to producing all the &#39;fall left&#39;, &#39;fall right&#39;,\netc since that is the low hanging fruit. Once all that low hanging fruit is\ngone, the genome of the walker is probably lost. There would be a chance of\nrecovering it, I guess, if you periodically resurrected archive individuals\nwhen the population is stagnating. It may even be interesting to try to\nresurrect those individuals whose end-point is furthest from those points\ncurrently being visited by the population.\n\nJust thinking out loud...\n\nVery cool stuff. I&#39;d love to see the zero-G guys if you can post em!\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Thu, 26 Jun 2008 16:04:37 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New file uploaded to neat\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Jeff, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am glad that you like my program and enjoy it! :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I know it would be cool to browse the archive, or have an external\n&gt; routine that queries the archive by different criteria to show me\n&gt; what was achieved during the run, but this program now is actually a\n&gt; stepping stone for another research project I have, evolving leaky-\n&gt; integrator substrates by HyperNEAT combined with evolving the\n&gt; substrate itself, all used in one Alife simulation of mass-spring\n&gt; creatures, sensing collision and reacting by contracting the springs.\n&gt; And all this with Novelty Search searching for new and new behaviors.\n&gt; I believe that this is a pretty serious test of how far complexity\n&gt; can go in such open-ended domain. I can later mix it with fitness\n&gt; search once a good population has evolved, on objectives\n&gt; like &quot;swimming&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me mention about one interesting experiment I made with the NS\n&gt; NEVH. I restricted the substrate connectivity so that output-&gt;output\n&gt; connections are not queried. Then I made the environment to 0 gravity\n&gt; and removed the ground plane. The behavior characterization was\n&gt; changed like this. The behavior data is a vector of 15 doubles\n&gt; representing the outputs. Each time an output oscillates (going to\n&gt; +treshold and then -treshold, or vice versa), its corresponding place\n&gt; in the vector is incremented.\n&gt; So the vector is actually counting how many oscillations the outputs\n&gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate oscillating with high frequency\n&gt; is very far in the behavior space. Different outputs oscillating are\n&gt; counted too. The behavior distance metric is the eucledian distance\n&gt; between these 15-D vectors.\n&gt; \n&gt; So novelty search now has to find new ways to oscillate the entire\n&gt; body, to do repeating movements. In all the runs, Novelty Search with\n&gt; HyperNEAT finds walking gaits 100% of the time, in the first 1000\n&gt; evaluations. There are also swimming gaits and all kind of stuff (I\n&gt; saw one individual actually dancing :))\n&gt; \n&gt; So what was stopping it from walking before, is the gravity. Keeping\n&gt; balance on one leg and trying to walk at the same time turns out to\n&gt; be very hard task. One environmental constraint that would be useful\n&gt; to make it walk is, when only one foot has stepped on the ground,\n&gt; stick that foot to the ground. So the chance the humanoid to fall is\n&gt; minimized. \n&gt; \n&gt; As for the novelty search stagnation, where getting new behaviors\n&gt; becomes hard, the population begins to do something like a random\n&gt; probing anything that is not the same stuff. Then it begins to rely\n&gt; entirely on mutation to get out somehow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I finally borrowed a windows machine from someone and looked at\n&gt; this. It&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; really fun to watch! I am leaving it running overnight to see what\n&gt; happens.\n&gt;&gt; So far the best I have seen has been about a five mini-step shuffle\n&gt;&gt; backwards...although I have seen a few three mini-step forward\n&gt; shuffles.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Can you post either the genome and or a movie of the best org\n&gt; you&#39;ve seen so\n&gt;&gt; far? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I second the notion that it would be cool to browse the archive,\n&gt; especially\n&gt;&gt; if you could choose archive members to view based on max distance\n&gt; from 0,0\n&gt;&gt; or something like that.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; It might help you to visualize things if you added another viewing\n&gt; mode that\n&gt;&gt; put a dot in the 3D viewer for every x,y,z coordinate in the\n&gt; archive (one\n&gt;&gt; color) and in the current population (another color).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Watching this also makes me wonder about the population losing its\n&gt; gradient\n&gt;&gt; and disengaging. Here is the potential concern (and I think mattias\n&gt; and ken\n&gt;&gt; discussed this already): Once all the easy to access points are\n&gt; found, if\n&gt;&gt; most of the orgs are not getting somewhere new, they will all have\n&gt; equal\n&gt;&gt; fitnesses and the search will not be focused on the outside edge.\n&gt; Do you\n&gt;&gt; think this is happening (and might this be why David mentioned that\n&gt; he saw a\n&gt;&gt; lot of repeats toward the end)? The visualization I just proposed\n&gt; might help\n&gt;&gt; on this front. Do the points added in the archive tend to be\n&gt; further and\n&gt;&gt; further away from 0,0....or is it just filling in the spaces in the\n&gt; nearby\n&gt;&gt; vicinity? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Despite these concerns/suggestions, it is very fun stuff to look\n&gt; at...and\n&gt;&gt; its exciting that you are hybridizing these ideas so quickly and\n&gt; testing\n&gt;&gt; them. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: David D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:46:57 -0000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New file uploaded to neat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I thought it would be awhile\n&gt;&gt;&gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combined.  I ran it\n&gt; while I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; was working on other stuff for a bit over 50,000 evaluations,\n&gt; checking\n&gt;&gt;&gt; in on it periodically.  The behavioral diversity was really\n&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby steps and guys that\n&gt; were\n&gt;&gt;&gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them did &quot;the chair&quot;), although\n&gt; there\n&gt;&gt;&gt; were still a good number of repeats, especially near the end\n&gt; (falling\n&gt;&gt;&gt; onto theirs knees seemed pretty common).  No one that I saw had a\n&gt; good\n&gt;&gt;&gt; walking gait, but I guess it&#39;s possible that one could have when I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wasn&#39;t watching, perhaps we need an option to browse the archive.\n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt;&gt; curious about a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -What did you use as a novelty metric?  It&#39;s seems like there are\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number of viable options here.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -What do the nodes on the substrate mean, and are they just on a\n&gt; flat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; plane?  I used your older version when it was first released, and\n&gt; if I\n&gt;&gt;&gt; remember right the two on the left are inputs and the stuff on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; right is various joints, but I wanted to make sure.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -Similarly, what do you use as the 5th input on the CPPN?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, neat@yahoogroups.com wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This email message is a notification to let you know that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the neat\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; group.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   File        : /novelty_nevh.rar\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Uploaded by : petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   Description : Novelty Search applied to evolving HyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt;&gt; leaky-integrator substrates controlling a 3D humanoid model.
