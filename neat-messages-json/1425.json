I also observed poor results, although \nthe OCR domain has a lot more input and output nodes than your digital \ndisplay domain.\n\nAnyway, I raised a number of issues in the write-up which I can&#39;t really \ndo justice here so I would recommend you have a read and see what you \nthink. From my experiments with Simple-OCR and knowing that your digital \ndisplay domain problem has far fewer inputs and ouptuts, I am fairly \nconfident that this could be solved in SharpNEAT in it&#39;s current state. \nI am willing to implement it and make another release if there are any \ndoubters :)\n\nOh the URL for the write-up is www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/phasedsearch.htm\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
