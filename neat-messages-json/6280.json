Among the most obviou=\r\ns, the connection-cost technique (CCT) clearly yields a profound positive e=\r\nffect on modularity, which also helped solve the problems.  This result cer=\r\ntainly gives weight to the value of the CCT.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThank you. We are please=\r\nd that, so far, every time we=92ve applied the CCT to a problem it has impr=\r\noved performance and modularity. We are increasingly confident that it is a=\r\n robust, effective technique, at least based on what we=92ve observed in th=\r\ne last year. \n\n&gt; Going back to our previous debate, on the issue of the int=\r\neraction with the Gaussian Seed (GS) (which had previously been shown to he=\r\nlp the LEO with modularity), there are a lot of nuances to the implications=\r\n of this result.  First, the implications are slightly muddied by the fact =\r\nthat the results do not reproduce the same performance seen in my paper wit=\r\nh Phillip Vebancsics on the LEO with the GS.  It would have been really int=\r\neresting to see both these methods compete in exactly the domain with exact=\r\nly the performance we originally reported.  However, given that the LEO-GS =\r\nresults here look a bit worse than ours, there could be some implementation=\r\n differences at play (as you note), but it makes it hard to be sure whether=\r\n the GS cannot be tweaked somehow more to look better. \n&gt; \nAgreed. We tried=\r\n to make LEO-GS work by playing with its key parameter a bit, but it did no=\r\nt help. Because it wasn=92t the main focus of the paper, we did not invest =\r\na ton of time into tweaking all possible parameters to see if something wou=\r\nld have elevated its performance. As we say in the paper, that may suggest =\r\nthat hand-creating the seed is a difficult enterprise to get right. Then ag=\r\nain, it could be that something about this specific implementation of the p=\r\nroblem made tuning LEO-GS difficult. \n\n&gt; But let&#39;s proceed with the assumpt=\r\nion that the GS simply doesn&#39;t perform as well in the setup attempted here =\r\nregardless of implementation details, since that&#39;s still interesting to con=\r\nsider and likely true.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is, the results under this interpretation =\r\nmakes sense.  After all, the problem is modular and a pressure to maintain =\r\nmodularity through the CCT is helpful.  That seems reasonable.  The GS lose=\r\ns its modularity, probably because there is some kind of deception in the s=\r\nearch space that makes it appear early on that being less modular increases=\r\n fitness.  But CCT can&#39;t be &quot;lost&quot; so it keeps pushing in the direction we =\r\nwant.  The conclusion is pretty clear for this problem setup:  CCT is more =\r\neffective.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that raises an interesting question:  What if there is =\r\na problem whose best solution is not modular?  Then the CCT would presumabl=\r\ny be a persistent liability.  Of course, realistically, modularity is proba=\r\nbly useful in many problems so you could say perhaps that we don&#39;t really c=\r\nare about 100% non-modular problems.  But the real subtlety comes in if the=\r\n problem is partly non-modular and partly modular.  How will the blunt forc=\r\ne of a single CCT deal with the nuance of varying degrees of optimal modula=\r\nrity in different parts of the solution?  It seems perhaps ill suited.  Tha=\r\nt is a big concern given that we are interested in moving on to more comple=\r\nx problems, which likely means problems with a lot of this very kind of nua=\r\nnce.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nI do agree that most challenging problems are modular, so I am n=\r\not worried about doing worse on non-modular problems. That said, we tried t=\r\nhe CCT on a non-modular problem in the original paper =93The Evolutionary O=\r\nrigins of Modularity=94 (http://goo.gl/2vzFv). Performance was not hurt by =\r\nthe CCT, but of course things could work differently on different, non-modu=\r\nlar problems. My guess it that if connections are necessary, then their cos=\r\nt will be justified by the performance improvement they bring, and thus non=\r\n-modular networks can evolve. Of course, a consistent bias in the wrong dir=\r\nection could hurt search, especially when the extra connections do not pay =\r\nfor themselves in the short term (in diversity or performance), but we are =\r\nfinding empirically that the CCT tends to help in many different types of p=\r\nroblems (including in papers not yet published). \n\nOne benefit to the CCT t=\r\nhat we have not discussed is that it is a parsimony pressure. In other word=\r\ns, it encourages simplicity unless complexity is justified. In machine lear=\r\nning terminology, it is a regularization pressure. Thus, for the same reaso=\r\nn that in NEAT you prefer to start simple and only get more complex if nece=\r\nssary, the CCT says =93try to make the simplest network you can, but if mor=\r\ne connections buy you increased performance, that=92s fine.=94\n\nDoes that m=\r\nake you more convinced that the CCT might be a good bias in general to cons=\r\nistently have during search, and not a &quot;blunt instrument&quot;?\n\nAs for problems=\r\n where some part of the space is non-modular, I think the same arguments ap=\r\nply. The CCT allows those extra connections if they earn their keep. \n\nA fi=\r\nnal point to mention (which Joost just reminded me of in a side conversatio=\r\nn), is that the CCT can be made to count much less than the performance pre=\r\nssure. We did just that in both the original paper and this paper via havin=\r\ng the connection cost objective only factor into selection a fraction of th=\r\ne time probabilistically. Thus, the connection cost pressure can be made to=\r\n be slight, allowing evolution to explore solutions with more connections f=\r\nor many generations before they are ultimately culled by the infrequent pen=\r\nalty of having them. \n\n&gt; Yet the GS on its own doesn&#39;t really &quot;solve&quot; that =\r\nissue either because the GS itself is still subject to deception (as you re=\r\nsults show), so although in principle the GS can get you all the subtlety y=\r\nou need (unlike CCT), and thereby solve even such convoluted problems, it w=\r\nill likely top out at some kind of suboptimal configuration due to deceptio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, my argument here is going in a familiar direction.  Here w=\r\ne have a speculative hypothetical situation (desiring varying degrees of mo=\r\ndularity in the same solution) in which perhaps no method is suited.  But t=\r\nhe reason for that is the usual culprit: the problems we are discussing (in=\r\ncluding in this paper) are objectively driven.  I&#39;ve argued consistently th=\r\nat our ability to discover really interesting brain-like structures through=\r\n objectively-driven evolution will turn out limited.  If we are considering=\r\n discovering something radically complex with varying degrees of modularity=\r\n throughout it, then it is almost certain that it won&#39;t happen primarily th=\r\nrough objectives.  That insight raises the question of which will be the be=\r\nst tool then under non-objective conditions: GS or CCT.  I&#39;d argue there th=\r\nat the GS is more aligned with the non-objective spirit because it means we=\r\n can look at all the possibilities without bias:  in one branch of evolutio=\r\nn we will see the less modular, and in another branch the more.  There is n=\r\no presupposition about which will be better or even that anything is object=\r\nively better at all.   \n&gt; \nI disagree. In your last sentence you slip into =\r\ntalking about novelty in brain structure (=93we can look at all the possibi=\r\nlities without bias: in one branch we see the less modular, and in another =\r\nbranch the more=94). But of course Novelty Search is looking for novelty in=\r\n behavior space, and it is hard to generate new, complex behaviors. My inst=\r\nincts are that it will be easier to generate more types of different, compl=\r\nex behaviors with modular brains than with non-modular brains, for the same=\r\n reasons modularity helps in engineering. If that=92s true, then a decrease=\r\nd amount of diversity in brain modularity (i.e. only having modular brains)=\r\n may still yet lead to a dramatic increase in the amount of behavior divers=\r\nity generated. \n\nThe same idea applies with regularization/parsimony: parsi=\r\nmonious solutions tend to generalize better to new situations, which is a n=\r\nice property to have when trying to produce new behaviors that head off int=\r\no new parts of the environment to do new things. \n\nFor both of these reason=\r\ns, my guess is that the CCT will improve performance in Novelty Search (and=\r\n other non-objective searches) as well as in objective-driven searches. But=\r\n whether your hypothesis or mine is right would be fascinating to test rigo=\r\nrously! Some evidence is already presented in our paper: both treatments ha=\r\nve a diversity objective, and the CCT performs better than LEO-GS, although=\r\n of course a performance objective is present too. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I will g=\r\nive you that the CCT&#39;s effect in your paper is really cool and in practice =\r\nit may be worth adding to see what happens, even combined with novelty sear=\r\nch.  But my concern is still that it&#39;s a bit of a blunt instrument if you a=\r\nre aiming to construct a kind of masterpiece with the precision and intrica=\r\ncy of open heart surgery, which a non-objective search might aim to do.  Em=\r\npirical experiments over time will settle these issues and CCT should defin=\r\nitely be on the table in the meantime as an important option.  Also, in pra=\r\nctical situations that are either objective or perhaps not necessarily obje=\r\nctive but nevertheless known to be highly modular, CCT is pretty clearly th=\r\ne preferred choice based on your results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThanks. I agree that we=92l=\r\nl learn more with more tests, but that at present the CCT does look like a =\r\npromising thing to try on most problems, either due to modularity, parsimon=\r\ny, or (most likely) both. \n\n&gt; Finally, as a practical issue, I&#39;m just curio=\r\nus about the one combination you didn&#39;t report:  CCT starting with a GS.  T=\r\nhis combo still doesn&#39;t address the subtle issues discussed above, but in p=\r\nractice it&#39;s interesting and could be cool.  Maybe it would be even better =\r\nthan CCT alone at the problems in the paper?\n&gt; \n&gt; \nThat=92s an interesting =\r\nidea. We did not try it, but if we have time we=92ll try to do so and let y=\r\nou (and the community) know what happens. \n\nThanks again for the kind words=\r\n about our work and the ever-interesting discussion.\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This paper raises a n=\r\number of interesting issues.&nbsp; Among the most obvious, the connection-c=\r\nost technique (CCT) clearly yields a profound positive effect on modularity=\r\n, which also helped solve the problems.&nbsp; This result certainly gives w=\r\neight to the value of the CCT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you. We are pleased that, so far, every time we=92ve applied=\r\n the CCT to a problem it has improved performance and modularity. We are in=\r\ncreasingly confident that it is a robust, effective technique, at least bas=\r\ned on what we=92ve observed in the last year.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;bl=\r\nockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); =\r\nposition: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:=\r\nrelative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to our previous debate, on the issue of the interaction with=\r\n the Gaussian Seed (GS) (which had previously been shown to help the LEO wi=\r\nth modularity), there are a lot of nuances to the implications of this resu=\r\nlt.&nbsp; First, the implications are slightly muddied by the fact that the=\r\n results do not reproduce the same performance seen in my paper with Philli=\r\np Vebancsics on the LEO with the GS.&nbsp; It would have been really intere=\r\nsting to see both these methods compete in exactly the domain with exactly =\r\nthe performance we originally reported.&nbsp; However, given that the LEO-G=\r\nS results here look a bit worse than ours, there could be some implementati=\r\non differences at play (as you note), but it makes it hard to be sure wheth=\r\ner the GS cannot be tweaked somehow more to look better.&nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agreed. We tried to make LEO-GS work by p=\r\nlaying with its key parameter a bit, but it did not help. Because it wasn=\r\n=92t the main focus of the paper, we did not invest a ton of time into twea=\r\nking all possible parameters to see if something would have elevated its pe=\r\nrformance. As we say in the paper, that may suggest that hand-creating the =\r\nseed is a difficult enterprise to get right. Then again, it could be that s=\r\nomething about this specific implementation of the problem made tuning LEO-=\r\nGS difficult.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position: static; z-index: auto;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let&#39;s proceed with the a=\r\nssumption that the GS simply doesn&#39;t perform as well in the setup attempted=\r\n here regardless of implementation details, since that&#39;s still interesting =\r\nto consider and likely true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, the results under this interpr=\r\netation makes sense.&nbsp; After all, the problem is modular and a pressure=\r\n to maintain modularity through the CCT is helpful.&nbsp; That seems reason=\r\nable.&nbsp; The GS loses its modularity, probably because there is some kin=\r\nd of deception in the search space that makes it appear early on that being=\r\n less modular increases fitness.&nbsp; But CCT can&#39;t be &quot;lost&quot; so it keeps =\r\npushing in the direction we want.&nbsp; The conclusion is pretty clear for =\r\nthis problem setup:&nbsp; CCT is more effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that raises an =\r\ninteresting question:&nbsp; What if there is a problem whose best solution =\r\nis not modular?&nbsp; Then the CCT would presumably be a persistent liabili=\r\nty.&nbsp; Of course, realistically, modularity is probably useful in many p=\r\nroblems so you could say perhaps that we don&#39;t really care about 100% non-m=\r\nodular problems.&nbsp; But the real subtlety comes in if the problem is par=\r\ntly non-modular and partly modular.&nbsp; How will the blunt force of a sin=\r\ngle CCT deal with the nuance of varying degrees of optimal modularity in di=\r\nfferent parts of the solution?&nbsp; It seems perhaps ill suited.&nbsp; Tha=\r\nt is a big concern given that we are interested in moving on to more comple=\r\nx problems, which likely means problems with a lot of this very kind of nua=\r\nnce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do agree that m=\r\nost challenging problems are modular, so I am not worried about doing worse=\r\n on non-modular problems. That said, we tried the CCT on a non-modular prob=\r\nlem in the original paper =93The Evolutionary Origins of Modularity=94 (&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://goo.gl/2vzFv&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/2vzFv&lt;/a&gt;). Performance was not =\r\nhurt by the CCT, but of course things could work differently on different, =\r\nnon-modular problems. My guess it that if connections are necessary, then t=\r\nheir cost will be justified by the performance improvement they bring, and =\r\nthus non-modular networks can evolve. Of course, a consistent bias in the w=\r\nrong direction could hurt search, especially when the extra connections do =\r\nnot pay for themselves in the short term (in diversity or performance), but=\r\n we are finding empirically that the CCT tends to help in many different ty=\r\npes of problems (including in papers not yet published).&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One benefit to the CCT that we have not discussed is that it i=\r\ns a parsimony pressure. In other words, it encourages simplicity unless com=\r\nplexity is justified. In machine learning terminology, it is a regularizati=\r\non pressure. Thus, for the same reason that in NEAT you prefer to start sim=\r\nple and only get more complex if necessary, the CCT says =93try to make the=\r\n simplest network you can, but if more connections buy you increased perfor=\r\nmance, that=92s fine.=94&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Does that make you more c=\r\nonvinced that the CCT might be a good bias in general to consistently have =\r\nduring search, and not a &quot;blunt instrument&quot;?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As fo=\r\nr problems where some part of the space is non-modular, I think the same ar=\r\nguments apply. The CCT allows those extra connections if they earn their ke=\r\nep.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A final point to mention (which Joost ju=\r\nst reminded me of in a side conversation), is that the CCT can be made to c=\r\nount much less than the performance pressure. We did just that in both the =\r\noriginal paper and this paper via having the connection cost objective only=\r\n factor into selection a fraction of the time probabilistically. Thus, the =\r\nconnection cost pressure can be made to be slight, allowing evolution to ex=\r\nplore solutions with more connections for many generations before they are =\r\nultimately culled by the infrequent penalty of having them.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(25=\r\n5, 255, 255); position: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the GS on its own doesn&#39;t really &quot;solve&quot; that issue e=\r\nither because the GS itself is still subject to deception (as you results s=\r\nhow), so although in principle the GS can get you all the subtlety you need=\r\n (unlike CCT), and thereby solve even such convoluted problems, it will lik=\r\nely top out at some kind of suboptimal configuration due to deception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Overall, my argument here is going in a familiar direction.&nbsp; Here w=\r\ne have a speculative hypothetical situation (desiring varying degrees of mo=\r\ndularity in the same solution) in which perhaps no method is suited.&nbsp; =\r\nBut the reason for that is the usual culprit: the problems we are discussin=\r\ng (including in this paper) are objectively driven.&nbsp; I&#39;ve argued consi=\r\nstently that our ability to discover really interesting brain-like structur=\r\nes through objectively-driven evolution will turn out limited.&nbsp; If we =\r\nare considering discovering something radically complex with varying degree=\r\ns of modularity throughout it, then it is almost certain that it won&#39;t happ=\r\nen primarily through objectives.&nbsp; That insight raises the question of =\r\nwhich will be the best tool then under non-objective conditions: GS or CCT.=\r\n&nbsp; I&#39;d argue there that the GS is more aligned with the non-objective s=\r\npirit because it means we can look at all the possibilities without bias:&n=\r\nbsp; in one branch of evolution we will see the less modular, and in anothe=\r\nr branch the more.&nbsp; There is no presupposition about which will be bet=\r\nter or even that anything is objectively better at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;I disagree. In your last sentenc=\r\ne you slip into talking about novelty in brain structure (=93we can look at=\r\n all the possibilities without bias: in one branch we see the less modular,=\r\n and in another branch the more=94). But of course Novelty Search is lookin=\r\ng for novelty in &lt;i&gt;behavior space&lt;/i&gt;, and it is hard to generate new, com=\r\nplex behaviors. My instincts are that it will be easier to generate more ty=\r\npes of different, complex behaviors with modular brains than with non-modul=\r\nar brains, for the same reasons modularity helps in engineering. If that=92=\r\ns true, then a decreased amount of diversity in brain modularity (i.e. only=\r\n having modular brains) may still yet lead to a dramatic increase in the am=\r\nount of behavior diversity generated.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sa=\r\nme idea applies with regularization/parsimony: parsimonious solutions tend =\r\nto generalize better to new situations, which is a nice property to have wh=\r\nen trying to produce new behaviors that head off into new parts of the envi=\r\nronment to do new things.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For both of these =\r\nreasons, my guess is that the CCT will improve performance in Novelty Searc=\r\nh (and other non-objective searches) as well as in objective-driven searche=\r\ns. But whether your hypothesis or mine is right would be fascinating to tes=\r\nt rigorously! Some evidence is already presented in our paper: both treatme=\r\nnts have a diversity objective, and the CCT performs better than LEO-GS, al=\r\nthough of course a performance objective is present too.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;bl=\r\nockquote type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); =\r\nposition: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:=\r\nrelative;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I will give you that the CCT&#39;s effect in your paper is rea=\r\nlly cool and in practice it may be worth adding to see what happens, even c=\r\nombined with novelty search.&nbsp; But my concern is still that it&#39;s a bit =\r\nof a blunt instrument if you are aiming to construct a kind of masterpiece =\r\nwith the precision and intricacy of open heart surgery, which a non-objecti=\r\nve search might aim to do.&nbsp; Empirical experiments over time will settl=\r\ne these issues and CCT should definitely be on the table in the meantime as=\r\n an important option.&nbsp; Also, in practical situations that are either o=\r\nbjective or perhaps not necessarily objective but nevertheless known to be =\r\nhighly modular, CCT is pretty clearly the preferred choice based on your re=\r\nsults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks. I agree=\r\n that we=92ll learn more with more tests, but that at present the CCT does =\r\nlook like a promising thing to try on most problems, either due to modulari=\r\nty, parsimony, or (most likely) both.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote=\r\n type=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position=\r\n: static; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fina=\r\nlly, as a practical issue, I&#39;m just curious about the one combination you d=\r\nidn&#39;t report:&nbsp; CCT starting with a GS.&nbsp; This combo still doesn&#39;t =\r\naddress the subtle issues discussed above, but in practice it&#39;s interesting=\r\n and could be cool.&nbsp; Maybe it would be even better than CCT alone at t=\r\nhe problems in the paper?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;That=92s an interesting idea.
