If you recall I was working on the idea of a buffer of \nfailed/difficult test cases, e.g. waiting for a genome to score 100/100 \nand then running that champion  through 10000 test cases, storing the \ncases that failed in a buffer(max size 50). This buffer then became part \nof the evaluation, thus if the buffer was full (50 cases) then I \nperformed another 50 random test to make up 100, thus keeping the same \nmaximum fitness throughout evolution - which keeps everything simple. \nUpon finding a genome that scores 100 I repeat the process until the \n10000 test cases are all passed, at which point evolution is complete, \nor we progress to the next difficulty level. My implementation of prey \ncapture as you may recall utilises incremental evolution, so the \ndifficulty level is increased in steps (0 to 11) by incerasing the prey \nspeed.\n\nThe test case buffer idea is currently on hold because I realised that \nthere was a flaw in this approach when combined with my evaluation \nroutine. The problem was that on every evaluation I generated 100 random \ntests cases, so that the test cases from one eval to the next were \ndifferent. In turn this means that some genomes can get &#39;lucky&#39; with the \nset of test cases they receive, and therefore score above their actual \nfitness level. E.g. if I take a champ that has scored 100/100 and pass \nit through a large set of tests to get an accurate fitness level it \ntypically had a fitness level of 91-92%.\n\nSo when I implemented the idea of a test case buffer the champ genome \nwould typically fail the 10000 test cases, the buffer would be filled \nand then immediately on the next generation a champ would pass all test \ncases in the buffer but fail on the next round of 10000 random test \ncases. This cycle would continue ad infinitum.\n\nSo right now I am experimenting with evaluating against 100 fixed test \ncases. They are still generated randomly, so hopefully they represent a \ngood spread of test cases, but they are the same 100 cases on each \nevaluation. This approach results even worse champ genomes, with actual \nfitness arounf the 87-88% mark. However I can improve this figure by \nincreasing the number of evaluations, e.g. if I perform 1000 test per \neval the figure comes out at around 99%+, unfortunately this is a \nmeasurement from a lower difficultly level, I have yet to evolve a champ \nat the highest level, but I think the figure is indicative of what can \nbe expected.\n\nI know that Derek wanted to avoid increasing the number of test cases \nper eval. because it does eat up more CPU time, but what I want to do is \ngo back to the idea of a test case buffer with a small number of \ndifficult test cases, but this time with a fixed set of &#39;random&#39; test cases.\n\nAlso of note is a simple techique I&#39;ve been using for improving \nperformance with a large numbers of  tests per evaluation - If I want a \nscore out of 1000 tests then I initially just run the first 100 tests, \nif 100 is scroed then I go on a test against the next 100, and so on up \nto 1000. Thus I don&#39;t waste time performing 1000 tests on poor genomes. \nAn alternative would be to keep testing until the first failed test, but \nI don;t think this is as good since the proportion of tests passed in \nthe first 100 cases gives some idea of relative fitness between poor \ngenomes - which is all of the genomes at the start of evolution.\n\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
