Actually, this starts to\nbecome very interesting.=\r\n  Suppose I have a set of compounds that I\nknow bind well to a particular p=\r\nrotein - a training set.  If I can use\nCPPN or HyperNEAT to establish a gen=\r\neralizable assessment of the\nability of a compound to bind, I then in effec=\r\nt have a map of good\nfeatures and bad features.  The next trick would be to=\r\n find a compound\nthat maximally meets those criteria.  This aspect could be=\r\n done by\nscreening pre-existing databases of compounds, or perhaps even\nbui=\r\nlding one from scratch.  This actually starts to resemble a\nfundamental pro=\r\nblem in computational drug design.  Often we have\naccess to many chemicals =\r\nthat have the activity we want, but those are\nowned by other companies.  To=\r\n identify new chemical matter we have to\ndo something called &quot;Scaffold Hopp=\r\ning&quot; which consists of using\nexisting chemical information but changing the=\r\n core structures such\nthat they are outside of any pre-owned chemical space=\r\n.  This is much\nharder than if appears as it is often hard to keep the same=\r\n chemical\nsubstituents in the right place on a new scaffold.\n\nAlso, we have=\r\n both converged on HyperNEAT.  After reading some more of\nthe references yo=\r\nu suggested, I&#39;m thinking HyperNEAT is indeed a\npotential option.  I&#39;m thin=\r\ng that representing the binding site of the\nprotein as a 3D grid with point=\r\ns spaced at 1 angstrom apart.  The\n(x,y,z) input could correspond to partic=\r\nular small molecule or protein\n(or both) atom types or properties that exis=\r\nt at those locations. \nRepresenting both atom types may be interesting as i=\r\nt would allow\nidentification of beneficial pairings of atoms between protei=\r\nn and\nligand.  \n\nI agree that the details need to be fleshed out somewhat. =\r\n I&#39;m\nplanning to do some additional reading and hopefully start working on\n=\r\nsome details.  Please feel free to offer further suggestions.\n\nIf only I ha=\r\nd a bored grad student or intern to set on this one.  8^)\n\n\n\n--- In neat@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; It seems like at=\r\n first glance the simplest thing to do with a CPPN\n&gt; would be to search for=\r\n the shape or comformation of some protein or\n&gt; molecule that would produce=\r\n some sort of desired binding.  However,\n&gt; that is not exactly the problem =\r\nyou are describing; rather, you are\n&gt; suggesting something more like a scor=\r\ning system that looks at two\n&gt; interacting pieces and rates their interacti=\r\non.  Perhaps something\n&gt; like that would be served well by HyperNEAT, which=\r\n can form a neural\n&gt; network based on the geometric configuration of its in=\r\nputs.  The\n&gt; possibilities would obviously need to still be fleshed out.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;ve captured the basic idea.  Let me expand on it a bit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; One of the currently leading problems in computational chemistry or\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmolecular modeling is coming up with a method to predict the affinity\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nf a small molecule for the binding site of a protein.  In the case\n&gt; &gt; wher=\r\ne you have a model of the binding site (typically from a crystal\n&gt; &gt; struct=\r\nure), there are tools that will accurately position a small\n&gt; &gt; molecule in=\r\nto the binding site, however, there is not a good scoring\n&gt; &gt; function that=\r\n will give you an estimate of the activity that small\n&gt; &gt; molecule will hav=\r\ne against the protein.  It seems counter-intuitive -\n&gt; &gt; we can accurately =\r\nplace the molecule in the right 3D conformation into\n&gt; &gt; the 3D binding sit=\r\ne, but we can&#39;t really tell you how active it will\n&gt; &gt; be.  In other cases =\r\nyou do not have a model of the protein.  In both\n&gt; &gt; cases you may have a n=\r\number of compounds for which the activity is\n&gt; known.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For small mo=\r\nlecules to bind to a protein/enzyme, they will be required\n&gt; &gt; to make a nu=\r\nmber of interactions with that protein.  This implies that\n&gt; &gt; they must be=\r\n the correct shape, obviously, but they must also place\n&gt; &gt; the correct typ=\r\nes of atoms/groups in the right place to make those\n&gt; &gt; interactions.  Ofte=\r\nn, the bulk of the compound is used to place things\n&gt; &gt; into the right loca=\r\ntions in order to get an interaction - to get the\n&gt; &gt; right shape.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Given the CPPN&#39;s ability to capture spatial relationships, I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; wonderi=\r\nng if it could be used as an evaluator for the strength of an\n&gt; &gt; interacti=\r\non of this sort.  The spatial relationships of interest may\n&gt; &gt; stem from t=\r\nhe small molecules themselves, the protein binding site, or\n&gt; &gt; a combinati=\r\non of the two.  All of this is going on in a 3D space\n&gt; &gt; defined by the pr=\r\notein binding site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Obviously I need to think about this further, =\r\nbut there very well may\n&gt; &gt; be something useful here that hasn&#39;t yet been t=\r\nried.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken=\r\nneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kirk, I think that&#39;s a very in=\r\nteresting potential application\narea.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me make sure I&#39;m understa=\r\nnding how it would work.  You are\nsaying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you might capture the s=\r\nhape of a protein binding region (or\nsome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other important region) wit=\r\nh a CPPN and then use that CPPN-encoded\n&gt; &gt; &gt; model to test other chemical =\r\ncompounds?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But if you already have a model of the intended s=\r\nhape, what\nadditional\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capability would the CPPN provide other than en=\r\ncoding the 3D model\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that you already have?  Or do you mean you might =\r\ntry creating new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shapes with the CPPN that you haven&#39;t thought of and=\r\n see how they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; react with known compounds?  There are probably other w=\r\nays it\ncould go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as well, but I&#39;m curious from the point of view of co=\r\nmputational\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chemistry where the most exciting opportunity would be.  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; =\r\n&lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I may be over-interpreting the CPPN pro=\r\ncess, but it stimulated\na few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas.

The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3D shape of a chemical is a princi=\r\nple determining factor of its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activity.  On top of 3D shape, you ha=\r\nve different functional\ngroups\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that impart different properties.  F=\r\nor example, let&#39;s say the\n&gt; shape is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just right to bind to a partic=\r\nular enzyme (and prevent it from\n&gt; running\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; amok) but you need an ox=\r\nygen atom at a particular location, or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nitrogen, or any atom with=\r\n a hydrogen attached, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are two ways to get to th=\r\nis type of information.

I&#39;m=\r\n wondering if there is an\n&gt; application\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for CPPNs here.  Can the CP=\r\nPN capture the shape of the site\n&gt; along with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the essential propert=\r\nies based on the protein itself and then be\n&gt; used\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to assess differ=\r\nent chemical compounds that have not yet been\n&gt; tested -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to pre=\r\ndict their activities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Ki=\r\nrk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth=\r\n Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kirk, what is your idea fo=\r\nr applying CPPNs to pattern\n&gt; &gt; recognition?
