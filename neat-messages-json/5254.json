At least I think I&#39;m right in saying that the task is imp=\r\nossible if the poles are the same length (and/or same mass?).\n\nSo anyway I =\r\nwas just thinking that we can alter the difficulty by making the lengths mo=\r\nre or less similar. The code as it stands defines the poles as:\n\nPole 1: 1m=\r\n, 0.1kg\nPole 2: 0.1m, 0.01kg\n\nJust though I&#39;d mention this.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
