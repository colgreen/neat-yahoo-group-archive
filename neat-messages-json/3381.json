I took a CPPN that produ=\r\nces a CTRNN exhibiting \n&gt; a &quot;mexican wave&quot; behaviour. I scaled up the subst=\r\nrate to \n&gt; approximately 200 hidden nodes. The &quot;mexican wave&quot; pattern was \n=\r\n&gt; preserved!

I suddenly made =\r\nthe connection \n&gt; between \n&gt; &gt; the sensor placements and the substrates for=\r\n the robot experiment \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; D&#39;Ambrosio&#39;s paper. It is so similar. So I=\r\n begin to think.. What \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; NERO, but using HyperNEAT? The substra=\r\ntes can be made \ngeometrically \n&gt; &gt; similar to the.. enivonment, you know w=\r\nhat I mean. \n&gt; &gt; I will try to implement a 2D version of something similar =\r\nto \nNERO, \n&gt; but \n&gt; &gt; with leaky integrator neurons, because there every no=\r\nde has a \nbias \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to care about where to place the bi=\r\nas unit in the \n&gt; &gt; substrate. \n&gt; &gt; Besides, I have the following idea. Dur=\r\ning evolution, in the \nfirst \n&gt; &gt; generations (in the rtNEAT case, the firs=\r\nt N minutes of \nevolution), \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; substrates will be simple, with low=\r\n node counts. Then, given a \n&gt; &gt; threshold (num. of generations/time), the =\r\nprogram will \n&gt; automatically \n&gt; &gt; scale up the substrate to a higher densi=\r\nty. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any suggestions/ideas about that? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
