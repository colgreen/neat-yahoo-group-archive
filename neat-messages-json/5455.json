It does a=\r\nppear that the max fitness graph is behaving strangely by jumping up and do=\r\nwn.  One possibility is that the Matlab code does not implement elitism: mo=\r\nst NEAT implementations keep the best individual of each species from one g=\r\neneration to the next, but perhaps Matlab NEAT is not doing that.\n\nWhat I w=\r\nould do is try to track the best individual in the code to see what happens=\r\n during reproduction.  If it is not copied into the next generation, then y=\r\nou would know the problem.  On the other hand, if it is copied, yet for som=\r\ne reason performs differently, then you would know there is a different, mo=\r\nre serious kind of bug.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Mohsen Davarynej=\r\nad &lt;davarynejad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Actually I played a bit with=\r\n the original Matlab implementation code of NEAT\n&gt; which I downloaded from\n=\r\n&gt; here&lt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/soft-view.php?SoftID=3D23&gt; that\n&gt; includes t=\r\nhe XOR experiment. I only changed the fitness function from\n&gt; (4-individual=\r\n_fitness)^2 to (81-individual_fitness)^2 (in xor_experiment\n&gt; function). I =\r\nhave attached the results I got (Regression-NEAT1.jpg). Should\n&gt; I consider=\r\n it as a bug, since I could not interpret the results, specially\n&gt; the fact=\r\n that the maximum fitness plot is not a monotonically increasing\n&gt; function=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I did this experiment is because I wanted to see ho=\r\nw good a\n&gt; standard NEAT can approximate a function. So I generated 81 trai=\r\nning samples\n&gt; spanning [-2 : 0.5 : 2] with an output between 0 and 1 (the =\r\nfunction\n&gt; was [x*exp(-x^2\n&gt; - y^2) + .5]). I only replace the XOR training=\r\n data set with my training\n&gt; data set and changed the activation function f=\r\nrom\n&gt; 1./(1+exp(-4.9*population(index_individual).nodegenes(3,4:number_node=\r\ns))) to\n&gt; 1./(1+exp(-1*population(index_individual).nodegenes(3,4:number_no=\r\ndes))) and\n&gt; the fitness function as the one I mentioned above. Again I was=\r\n expecting a\n&gt; monotonically increasing function in maximum fitness plot\n&gt; =\r\n(Regression-NEAT2.jpg), but surprisingly this was not the case. I realized\n=\r\n&gt; that its maybe duo the fact that the species may die out. But the point i=\r\ns\n&gt; that it never converge to an acceptable solution, even its not increasi=\r\nng,\n&gt; but seems like a decreasing function. I have attached the results I g=\r\not\n&gt; after 1000 iterations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I will appreciate if somebody could =\r\nreflect on these results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you so much,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mohsen.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
