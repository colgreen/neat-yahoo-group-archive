I think this prevents the last species in the list from spaw=\r\ning.\n\nThe code at http://neat-python.googlecode.com removes the last added =\r\nmembers.\n\nIn either case, as the python code notes, &quot;This is dangerous! I c=\r\nan&#39;t remove a species&#39; representant!&quot; i.e. a species exemplar with which ne=\r\nwly spawned genomes will be compared.\n\nI have considered killing off any sp=\r\necies that is not allowed to spawn all its offspring.  I already do so if t=\r\nhe spawns required from a given species rounds to zero.\n\nOr should I just r=\r\nemove any overflow genomes first making sure it is not a species exemplar?\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
