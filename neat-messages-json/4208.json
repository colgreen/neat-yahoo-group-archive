However,\nthat is not exactly th=\r\ne problem you are describing; rather, you are\nsuggesting something more lik=\r\ne a scoring system that looks at two\ninteracting pieces and rates their int=\r\neraction.  Perhaps something\nlike that would be served well by HyperNEAT, w=\r\nhich can form a neural\nnetwork based on the geometric configuration of its =\r\ninputs.  The\npossibilities would obviously need to still be fleshed out.\n\nk=\r\nen\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nYou&#39;ve captured the basic idea.  Let me expand on it a bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; One of the=\r\n currently leading problems in computational chemistry or\n&gt; molecular model=\r\ning is coming up with a method to predict the affinity\n&gt; of a small molecul=\r\ne for the binding site of a protein.  In the case\n&gt; where you have a model =\r\nof the binding site (typically from a crystal\n&gt; structure), there are tools=\r\n that will accurately position a small\n&gt; molecule into the binding site, ho=\r\nwever, there is not a good scoring\n&gt; function that will give you an estimat=\r\ne of the activity that small\n&gt; molecule will have against the protein.  It =\r\nseems counter-intuitive -\n&gt; we can accurately place the molecule in the rig=\r\nht 3D conformation into\n&gt; the 3D binding site, but we can&#39;t really tell you=\r\n how active it will\n&gt; be.  In other cases you do not have a model of the pr=\r\notein.  In both\n&gt; cases you may have a number of compounds for which the ac=\r\ntivity is\nknown.\n&gt; \n&gt; For small molecules to bind to a protein/enzyme, they=\r\n will be required\n&gt; to make a number of interactions with that protein.  Th=\r\nis implies that\n&gt; they must be the correct shape, obviously, but they must =\r\nalso place\n&gt; the correct types of atoms/groups in the right place to make t=\r\nhose\n&gt; interactions.  Often, the bulk of the compound is used to place thin=\r\ngs\n&gt; into the right locations in order to get an interaction - to get the\n&gt;=\r\n right shape.\n&gt; \n&gt; Given the CPPN&#39;s ability to capture spatial relationship=\r\ns, I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering if it could be used as an evaluator for the strength of =\r\nan\n&gt; interaction of this sort.  The spatial relationships of interest may\n&gt;=\r\n stem from the small molecules themselves, the protein binding site, or\n&gt; a=\r\n combination of the two.  All of this is going on in a 3D space\n&gt; defined b=\r\ny the protein binding site.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously I need to think about this furth=\r\ner, but there very well may\n&gt; be something useful here that hasn&#39;t yet been=\r\n tried.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley=\r\n&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kirk, I think that&#39;s a very interesting potent=\r\nial application area.  \n&gt; &gt; Let me make sure I&#39;m understanding how it would=\r\n work.  You are saying\n&gt; &gt; that you might capture the shape of a protein bi=\r\nnding region (or some\n&gt; &gt; other important region) with a CPPN and then use =\r\nthat CPPN-encoded\n&gt; &gt; model to test other chemical compounds?  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt if you already have a model of the intended shape, what additional\n&gt; &gt; ca=\r\npability would the CPPN provide other than encoding the 3D model\n&gt; &gt; that y=\r\nou already have?  Or do you mean you might try creating new\n&gt; &gt; shapes with=\r\n the CPPN that you haven&#39;t thought of and see how they\n&gt; &gt; react with known=\r\n compounds?  There are probably other ways it could go\n&gt; &gt; as well, but I&#39;m=\r\n curious from the point of view of computational\n&gt; &gt; chemistry where the mo=\r\nst exciting opportunity would be.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;newtwist2000&quot; &lt;rkdelisle@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may be over-in=\r\nterpreting the CPPN process, but it stimulated a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas.  I work i=\r\nn the field of Computational Chemistry and my in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; day to day operat=\r\nions I deal with drug-like chemical compounds.  The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3D shape of a che=\r\nmical is a principle determining factor of its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activity.  On top of 3=\r\nD shape, you have different functional groups\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that impart different p=\r\nroperties.  For example, let&#39;s say the\nshape is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just right to bind to=\r\n a particular enzyme (and prevent it from\nrunning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; amok) but you need =\r\nan oxygen atom at a particular location, or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nitrogen, or any atom w=\r\nith a hydrogen attached, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are two ways to get to thi=\r\ns type of information.  First is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; having a large collection of chemica=\r\nls with a known endpoint.  For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this I usually apply the standard patt=\r\nern recognition tools. \nAnother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more difficult approach is when you d=\r\non&#39;t have much data for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chemicals, but you know the 3D structure of t=\r\nhe enzyme and where you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want your chemical to bind.  I&#39;m wondering if=\r\n there is an\napplication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for CPPNs here.  Can the CPPN capture the sh=\r\nape of the site\nalong with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the essential properties based on the prot=\r\nein itself and then be\nused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to assess different chemical compounds th=\r\nat have not yet been\ntested -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; try to predict their activities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Kirk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nKirk, what is your idea for applying CPPNs to pattern\n&gt; recognition?
