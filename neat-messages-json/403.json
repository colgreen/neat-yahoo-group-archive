Now, you can achieve the same results (e.g the LI you \n&gt; descibed) without connections going back to the input &#39;layer&#39; - you\njust \n&gt; perform the inhibition feedback in the first hidden layer. You can \n&gt; actually think of the input nodes as not actually being nodes, just \n&gt; connection points that the real nodes connect to to obtain input\nsignals.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own feelings on this are that it&#39;s far more natural to *not* \n&gt; distinguish between input, hidden and outputs nodes. This is how my \n&gt; current NN implementation is arranged. Each node holds a collection\nof  \n&gt; Connection objects that point to the source of an input signal -\nthat \n&gt; source can be another node or an element in an input signal array.\nBy \n&gt; relying on a layer of hidden nodes to substitute for the fact that\ninput \n&gt; nodes cannot receive connections I think we are effectively\nerrecting an \n&gt; artifical barrier for the topology search process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken, I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts on this one while I&#39;m still\nat \n&gt; the early stages of development.\n&gt; \n\n\nI think this discussion is mostly semantics; the &quot;input array&quot; is just\nanother word for &quot;inputs&quot; in NEAT.  In other words, one might ask you,\n&quot;why not have incoming connections to the input array?&quot;  But the point\nis, at some level, the inputs are just the inputs.  In NEAT, the\n&quot;input nodes&quot; are that level.\n\nMy advice is to follow the NEAT conventions unless there is a very\ngood functional reason not to, because that way it will be easier for\nyou to ask questions, since then the less your system diverges from\nthe ones that already exist.  On the other hand, if some design\ndecision I made was really poor, it is certainly reasonable to try\nsomething different.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
