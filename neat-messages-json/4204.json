We&#39;ve\ntalke=\r\nd about it in our research group but we don&#39;t have any ongoing\nprojects wit=\r\nh it, and I don&#39;t know of any.  The only downside is that\nall that querying=\r\n will get expensive.  However, it&#39;s very interesting\nbecause it means that =\r\nthe learning rules themselves become distributed\nin a pattern, and are &quot;mad=\r\ne up&quot; by HyperNEAT rather than being\npreselected by the experimenter.\n\nThe =\r\nCPPN might also be able to output Hebbian parameters; although\nthat is less=\r\n groundbreaking, though it might work well.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; It i=\r\ns an interesting idea to see what if the phenotypes produced by the \n&gt; CPPN=\r\ns change over their lifetime. There are two approaches to this: the \n&gt; CPPN=\r\n can output hebbian learning parameters to the connections or the \n&gt; CPPN c=\r\nan be re-queried every time step, so the connections will be \n&gt; basically d=\r\nifferent every time, depending on the environment, which \n&gt; will be input t=\r\no the CPPN. \n&gt; Is there any ongoing research into this? \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
