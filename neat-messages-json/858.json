In every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment I&#39;ve seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except the very simplest, NEAT takes up a tiny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fraction of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; computation time.  It&#39;s the evaluations that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; expensive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Each evaluation requires the operation (or\n&gt; &gt;computation) of the neural net itself, i.e., giving\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt;some inputs, and progagating the signals through\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;network.  When you studied the time required for\n&gt; &gt;evaluation did you separate it into time for\n&gt; &gt;problem-specific code vs. neural net computation\n&gt; code?\n&gt; &gt;  For a complex network with many connections that\n&gt; &gt;might be substantial.\n&gt; \n&gt; How would that distinction be helpful?  Are you\n&gt; thinking that there might be \n&gt; ways of optimizing the network computation step? \n&gt; And you want to know \n&gt; whether the effort is worthwhile?  For some domains,\n&gt; it would be...\n\nIn order to compare NEAT to other approaches, the\nprocessing time to compute the network is important. \nFor example, is NEAT fast enough to use a NEAT-evolved\nnetwork in a real time application?\n\nIn doing neuroevolution the time to compute the\nnetwork can be significant.  It is possible to have a\nfairly simple fitness function requiring many neurons\nand many connections to optimize it.  In such a\nsituation the time to complete the evolution will be\nstrongly affected by the computation time for the\nnetwork.  I don&#39;t mean something as simple as XOR of\ncourse, but it could be an algebraic function of 4\nvariables which it is desired to approximate closely\nby an ANN.  That function might compute in much less\ntime than processing the network.\n\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFriends.
