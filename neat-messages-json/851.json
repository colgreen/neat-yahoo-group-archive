I realise now that this \n&gt;is a result of crossover between two genomes that contained the same \n&gt;connection, but with a different innovation ID. To fix this I should \n&gt;check for duplicate connections within genomes created by crossover, \n&gt;which erodes some of the performance gain obtained from using technique \n&gt;(2).\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOn closer inspection of the network diagrams I published there are \nactually quite a lot of duplicate connections! I really should have \nchecked for this sort of thing, well at least it demostrates how useful \nvisualization is huh. I guess that this would impair the effectiveness \nof a search by describing a larger search space than is necessary as \nwell as unecessarily slowing down decoding the (larger) genomes into \nnetworks and the actual operating of the networks.\n\nPerhaps now would be a good time to point out that I also work on NEAT \nin my spare time :)\n\nColin\n\n\n\n"}}
