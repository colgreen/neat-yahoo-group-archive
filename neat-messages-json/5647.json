Is anyone working in this area?  I realize that for most=\r\n of the robot control, there is implied perception - that is, mapping some =\r\naspects of a world through a NN-based policy to actions - but what I&#39;m inte=\r\nrested in is doing things like object recognition or something along the li=\r\nnes of more traditional computer vision.\n\nAlso, if anyone is willing to col=\r\nlaborate on this or any other NEAT-related efforts in robotics, I&#39;d love to=\r\n talk to you.  I&#39;m trying to drum up support for doing research in evolutio=\r\nnary robotics at my lab (Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Labs&#39; Intellig=\r\nent Robotics Lab).  It&#39;s been a subject I&#39;ve long been interested in, but h=\r\nave never had much opportunity to actually work on outside of my own side p=\r\nrobjects and school.\n\n\n-- Chris\n\n\n"}}
