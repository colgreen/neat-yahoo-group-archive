You noted:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This program violates a few of the NEAT advantages;\n&gt; &gt;  * It doesn&#39;t use species (there&#39;d be not point)\n&gt; &gt;  * It doesn&#39;t start minimally (that would be dull)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a feeling starting minimally could still be made pretty\n&gt; cool.  The reason is that if you have some kind of vague shape or\n&gt; design in mind, you could kind of use the principle of\n&gt; complexification to get there.  In other words, you&#39;d first start\n&gt; out with really simple base shapes and then as NEAT adds neurons\n&gt; progressively elaborate on them.  You could even let the user decide\n&gt; exactly when or how often to complexify.  You might even put a\n&gt; little number next to each picture representing network complexity.\n&gt; That way, a user can consciously protect innovation by giving a\n&gt; chance to more complex artists even if their pictures are initially\n&gt; a bit off from the simpler ones.  I think a program that lets you\n&gt; explore from the simple to the complex on your own could be made\n&gt; quite compelling.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
