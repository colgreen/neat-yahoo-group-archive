Novelty search really does much better than fitness \nsearch in=\r\n this domain. I agree that HyperNEAT allows too much \nrecurrence in this pa=\r\nrticular substrate (there are no restrictions), \nbut I am actually doing a =\r\nmore interesting thing - I exploit the fact \nthat as the time constants and=\r\n biases &quot;pictures&quot; through the \nsubstrate are simple, the activity pattern =\r\nof the neural network is \nalso simple. Then as the CPPNs complexify, so do =\r\nthe activity \npatterns of the CTRNN substrate. So too much recurrence is no=\r\nt much \nof a problem. Perhaps I am wrong. Maybe output-&gt;output connections =\r\n\nare not necessary? Or I can make it like a typical feed-forward \nnetwork, =\r\nsimilar to the one presented in the HyperNEAT playing \ncheckers paper? I&#39;ll=\r\n try this stuff. But this essentialy cuts out a \nlot of the search space wh=\r\nere solutions may exist. It is a kind of \ndilemma. On the one side, HyperNE=\r\nAT without restrictions in the \nsubstrate (except trivial things like input=\r\ns do not have incoming \nlinks) can find perfect solutions, but on the other=\r\n side, that search \nspace is too big and probably intractable. I believe th=\r\nat the \ndynamics of CPPN evolution is very different than direct encodigs, =\r\n\nlike for example the mating and mutation causes entirely different \nthings=\r\n to happen. If there was not speciation, I doubt that HyperNEAT \nwould have=\r\n the same performance as it currently has. \nYet this is about novelty searc=\r\nh combined with an indirect encoding. \nThe good thing is that it is indeed =\r\nvery effective and it is true \nthat the ladder of complexity is climbed up =\r\nmore efficiently this \nway. But I also think that this can be improved in s=\r\nome way, to be \nbetter. \n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth S=\r\ntanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice work, Peter, it&#39;s a very nice demons=\r\ntration.  I also saw the\n&gt; humanoid shuffle backwards.  It does seem easier=\r\n to do that than go\n&gt; forwards.  \n&gt; \n&gt; My guess is that the behavior charac=\r\nterization of final (x,y,z)\n&gt; probably conflates too many behaviors.  The t=\r\nrick in walking is in\n&gt; oscillation, so the proper stepping stone needs to =\r\nhave some ability\n&gt; to oscillate, regardless of where its head ends up.  I&#39;=\r\nd also guess\n&gt; that the substrate also could be simplified.  I believe that=\r\n it is\n&gt; allowing so much recurrence that it is very difficult to produce a=\r\n\n&gt; stable system.\n&gt; \n&gt; You know what would be cool is if you could specify =\r\nthe behavior\n&gt; characterization yourself as the user, like if the program p=\r\nrovided\n&gt; all the possible state variables and you could select what to \nin=\r\nclude\n&gt; in the characterization.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey I am glad that=\r\n you like that stuff, it was around in my \ncomputer \n&gt; &gt; a whole week but I=\r\n decided to upload a binary just before a day. \nLet \n&gt; &gt; me explain the det=\r\nails behind it. As you are probably familiar \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the other NEVH shit=\r\n this code does the same but uses another NEAT \n&gt; &gt; implememtation and nove=\r\nlty search. (steady state evolution). \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen some dolls actually wa=\r\nlking, but backwards. Kind of \nweird. \n&gt; &gt; I guess it is the easier way, th=\r\nough :) \n&gt; &gt; The behavior characterization is (as Peter B proposed) the fin=\r\nal \nXYZ \n&gt; &gt; location of the head. The distance is simply the eucldian \ndis=\r\ntance \n&gt; &gt; between those points. I agree that there are many options and I =\r\n\nam \n&gt; &gt; trying out many different BCs (behavior characterizations). But \nt=\r\nhis \n&gt; &gt; one works well. \n&gt; &gt; The nodes in the substrate are arranged in a =\r\ngeometric way to \nreflect \n&gt; &gt; the body&#39;s geometry in space. Each output co=\r\nrresponds to a joint \n&gt; &gt; angle. Arms and legs are placed symmetrically in =\r\nthe left and \nright \n&gt; &gt; sides. The head (neck joint) is placed above them =\r\nin the center. \n&gt; &gt; Outputs are drawn in green. Inputs (head velocity) are =\r\ndrawn in \nred. \n&gt; &gt; Hidden nodes are drawn in yellow. Ergh I see it is upsi=\r\nde-down \nbut \n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT doesn&#39;t care about this anyway :) \n&gt; &gt; The 5th =\r\ninput to the CPPN is the distance from 0, 0 in node-\nspecific \n&gt; &gt; data and=\r\n the distance between the 2 points when computing the \nweight \n&gt; &gt; of the c=\r\nonnection between 2 nodes. Just like in your paper, the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; bias. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;David D&#39;Ambrosio&quot; &lt;dda=\r\nmbro84@&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow, this looks really cool Petar.  I thought =\r\nit would be awhile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before we saw HyperNEAT and novelty search combine=\r\nd.  I ran it \n&gt; &gt; while I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working on other stuff for a bit over 5=\r\n0,000 evaluations, \n&gt; &gt; checking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in on it periodically.  The behavior=\r\nal diversity was really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impressive: I got guys that were taking baby =\r\nsteps and guys \nthat \n&gt; &gt; were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing yoga poses (I swear one of them =\r\ndid &quot;the chair&quot;), \nalthough \n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were still a good number of re=\r\npeats, especially near the end \n&gt; &gt; (falling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; onto theirs knees seemed=\r\n pretty common).  No one that I saw had \na \n&gt; &gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; walking gait, bu=\r\nt I guess it&#39;s possible that one could have \nwhen I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t watching, =\r\nperhaps we need an option to browse the \narchive. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curious ab=\r\nout a few things, if you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -What did you =\r\nuse as a novelty metric?
