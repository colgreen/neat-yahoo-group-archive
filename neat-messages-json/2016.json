They \nthink &quot;how hard can it be?&quot;  And the answer is &quot;far harder than you \nimagine&quot;, and they come up with some horrible effort with clunky \ninterfaces, unusable controls, manual install procedures, flat-shaded \ngraphics which poke through walls, etc etc etc.\n\n\tBut Nero completely turns this experience around.  It is _very_ cool.  I \njust ran it last night and was up and running within a minute.  There is \neven a tutorial!  Which is _necessary_ for any complex game these days but \nusually gets missed out.  The menus all make sense, training the teams is \neasy.  There&#39;s a sound-track and sound effects and the graphics are OK (not \nquite up to commercial grade but that would probably be over the top in \nthis context).\n\n\tNice one Ken!\n\n\tNow I just need a longer day so there&#39;s time to play with it :)\n\n\tIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
