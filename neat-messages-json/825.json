Am I right when I seem to \nnotice more than one recurrent connections on the same link to \nitself?  (i.e. double loops)  \n\nAlso, I think more important than distinguishing strength through \ncolor is distinguishing excitatory from inhibitory.  Then strength \ncould be thickness.  If thickness gives too much clutter, you could \nmake the scale of widths very small, like only thickness between 1 \nand 3 or even 1 and 2.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to seeing these visualizations as part of \nSharpNEAT.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; There are some example network images generated by SharpNeat at: \n&gt; http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/networks.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; There isn&#39;t a new software release with this in (yet), these are \njust \n&gt; examples showing how the layout manager places the neurons into \nlayers \n&gt; and how connections back into the same or previous layers are \ndrawn.\n&gt; The networks themselves aren&#39;t meant to be good functional \nexamples \n&gt; since they seem to have a lot of redundancy, e.g. the xor networks \n&gt; contain a lot of hidden nodes whereas we know that only one or two \nare \n&gt; needed depending on the type of network. What they do show is how \n&gt; networks of varying complexity are drawn, and hence the limits of \nthese \n&gt; types of diagram.\n&gt; \n&gt; The layout manager basically places the hidden neurons into a \n&gt; rectangular grid that best matches the available space, there is \nno \n&gt; attempt at analysing interconnections to determine which neurons \nshould \n&gt; be in which layers, etc.  Inputs and outputs are all drawn in \ntheir own \n&gt; layer, so for example if there were a lot of  inputs then you \nwould see \n&gt; an overcrowded input layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; The connections are coloured to indicate their strength using a \nblue-red \n&gt; scale. Optionally I can also vary the width of the connections but \nthis \n&gt; seems to clutter up the diagrams that much more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Going forward then there will be the able to manipulate the \nnetworks, \n&gt; drag neurons around and zoom in/out and save/load these as \nannotated xml \n&gt; (hint-xpos/ypos in the saved xml). As I mentioned before I hope to \n&gt; incorporate this stuff into the main exe to show the current best \n&gt; network (and perhaps best of each species?) and also in the \nsimulators \n&gt; to show the loaded network in realtime using varying \nneuron/connection \n&gt; colors.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
