The physics model has been carried forwar=\r\nd for several generations of systems, so it is a kind of uniform benchmark =\r\nenvironment, but to my knowledge it is not validated whether or not it corr=\r\nesponds to the real world.  However, the pole balancers evolved by various =\r\nsystems in this environment have been analyzed extensively, so we at least =\r\nwe know that the solutions are doing what we think they are doing (e.g. dam=\r\nping oscillations), which suggests that the physics model is good enough to=\r\n provide the kind of problem it attempts to provide.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 17 May 2010 07:08=\r\n, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, there is a solution to the=\r\n no-velocity version that has only a single hidden neuron.
