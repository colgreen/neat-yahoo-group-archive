Tell me you&#39;re also into evolving physically simulated critters\nand I&#39;ll start getting nervous...\n \n&gt; &gt; Further, if you invest 100% of your capital on each predictable game,\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; loss will wipe out all your funds. So I played 20% of the (simulated)\n&gt; &gt; capital per game. While this limits the downside, it severely limits\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; upside.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20% is a scary number.  Bear in mind that you may have simultaneous\n&gt; bets running. What if 40 games kick off at 3pm on Saturday and your\n&gt; system wants to bet on 10 of them?\n\nMy system wasn&#39;t confident all that often, more like a game per week it\nwould suggest a gamble. The rest of the time, it&#39;d recommend staying out.\n\n&gt; If you can correctly estimate your &quot;edge&quot; then the Kelly Criterion can\n&gt; be applied to determine stake size. I rather like the idea of having\n&gt; the model tell me how much it thinks I should bet (or tell me its\n&gt; estimate of the edge and I&#39;ll work out how much to bet).\n&gt;\n&gt; Say you estimate the likelihood of an away win at 70% and the bookies\n&gt; have it at 60% (odds are 1.67). You have an edge of about 16% and\n&gt; Kelly would suggest you bet an amount that increases your bank by that\n&gt; amount: about 25% in this case. A more conservative measure might be\n&gt; to bet half that amount (a &quot;Half-Kelly&quot; staking plan).\n\nAh, clever.\n\n&gt; But the bookies are very accurate in pricing Home-Draw-Away results:\n&gt; if your model is predicting a large mispricing, be careful: the model\n&gt; may be wrong.\n\nIt usually is - when out of bounds that is ;)\n\n&gt; &gt; Sadly, it wasn&#39;t as good picking winners out of bounds as it was in\n&gt; &gt; bounds, which kinda killed the usefulness even if it had been able to\n&gt; &gt; predict profitably.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has anyone else done any work in this vein?\n&gt; \n&gt; I did have some success with identifying matches where the likelihood\n&gt; of half-time/full-time draw-draw was greater than implied by the\n&gt; bookmakers&#39; odds: it was profitable the first season I operated it\n&gt; (for small stakes while I tested it) and blew up spectacularly the\n&gt; following season. If the correct scores market were more competitively\n&gt; priced then I think it could be profitable: 1-1 draws would probably\n&gt; be the place to start as they&#39;re the most frequent result (in English\n&gt; games at least). \n\nRight, I have idea what the odds are on those. I looked up a few games on\nladbrokes, the odds seem to be around 5.5 to 6.5 for the games that I\nreviewed, indicating that about 17% of the games end 1-1. If you could\npick games that end 1-1 with better frequency than 17%, you&#39;d be in the\nmoney. I&#39;ll give it a shot see what happens.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s a colossal overround in that market though,\n&gt; which is hard to overcome. \n\nToo bad :(\n\n&gt; There may be some advantage to using the\n&gt; exchanges over the fixed-odds bookmakers. I do know of at least one\n&gt; guy who has a Ward Systems Predictor-based system that just takes the\n&gt; last six scores for each team. He seems to get some promising results,\n&gt; although I don&#39;t think he&#39;s made his first million yet...\n\nI&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;last six scores&quot;, I tried the following\nindicators\n\n(results=home draw or away)\nresults in the last 3 games for home team,\nresults in the last 3 games for away team,\n\nresults in the last 3 HOME games for home team,\nresults in the last 3 AWAY games for away team,\n\nresults in the last 3 games for home vs away\n\nNext I tried goal differences where I counted;\n\n(home goals scored-home goals conceded) - (away goals scored-(away goals\nconceded)\n\nand related indicators. One problem is that I don&#39;t have league positions\nin my dataset, so a goal conceded to the top team counts as much as a \ngoal conceded to the bottom team. I could calculate my own &quot;league score&quot;\nfrom the last 10 games per team or some such, but I never got to that.\n\n&gt; I was evolving the weights on a fixed-topology network working from\n&gt; heavily-preprocessed data. \n\nI could send you my XML dataset for training, it contains a few thousand\ngames with results, my indicators and the best odds that were available -\nif you&#39;re interested.\n\n&gt; As with the stock market stuff, this is a topic about which I can go\n&gt; on and on and on.... So I&#39;d better stop for now. If you&#39;re brave\n&gt; enough to want to ask questions I am more than happy to bore you some\n&gt; more!\n\nWell, as long as you don&#39;t actually talk about football, I&#39;m very\ninterested. If sweden made it to a combined Olympics and world games\nfinal, I _might_ watch parts of the game, but I&#39;d surely not enjoy it much ;)\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
