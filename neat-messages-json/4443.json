Is that how the updated code will work\ntoo?\n\nIf so, it strikes me that might really slice up building blocks. To take\nP-NEAT, which is easier to think about, if one neural module existed in a\nregion of the substrate, and a different neural module existed in the same\nregion in a parent, instead of possibly grabbing the whole module from one\nparent and sticking it in a new genetic background, crossover would take a\nfew links from the modules of each of the parents and see if they work\ntogether. \n\nTo use a nice metaphor Ken has used before, in crossover you want to swap a\nhand for a hand instead of take a hand and put it where an ear belongs. This\nsystem is at least swapping parts of hands for parts of hands, but it\n(almost) never allows an *entire* hand to be placed on a new body. Instead,\nit sees if taking x% of phenotypic slices from one hand works in combination\nwith 100-x% of phenotypic slices from the other hand.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nThis is very similar to the question in GAs of using uniform (swapping\nslices of hands) vs. one- or two-point crossover (potentially swapping\nentire hands). \n\nA few questions\n1) does canonical NEAT use the uniform version of crossover or something\nlike two-point crossover?\n2) does the version of HyperNEAT you are about to release use uniform or\ntwo-point?\n3) if the answer to 1 is &#39;uniform&#39;, has anyone ever looked at trying\nsomething like two-point?\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Thu, 13 Nov 2008 00:25:50 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] HyperNEAT C++ Crossover\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason and I have been checking the debugged crossover operator by\n&gt; rerunning experiments and it appears that (as expected) in aggregate\n&gt; results are not altered in any significant way.  Jason plans to\n&gt; release a revised version of HyperNEAT C++ with the fix in the next\n&gt; few days after some more careful checking to make sure it&#39;s working as\n&gt; it should.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jeff, thanks very much for bringing the crossover bug to our\n&gt; attention.  The good news is it should not significantly affect major\n&gt; conclusions from prior experimental results.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
