In this particular case the ANN can learn\n&gt; that a cart has momentum, such that if velocity sharply drops to zero\n&gt; then we can probably assume the input is wrong and estimate the true\n&gt; velocity from past inputs (using recurrent connections) . However the\n&gt; problem is easier if we have another input telling us the connection\n&gt; is broken - we don&#39;t have to evolve structure to do work that out and\n&gt; the ANN can flip immediately to it&#39;s velocity estimate sub-net.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my instinct on this one (in the genral case) is that if we overload\n&gt; an input then NEAT will typically have to evolve some structure to try\n&gt; and distinguish between the distinct overload cases - which generally\n&gt; will be more difficult than if you just tell the ANN directly that the\n&gt; input is currently dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; An additional 100 inputs sounds bad, but it&#39;s not as bad as trying to\n&gt; evolve 100 substructures trying to do something potentially complex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n\n"}}
