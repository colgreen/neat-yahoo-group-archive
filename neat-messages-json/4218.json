In NEAT there is=\r\n a bias input which has a constant value \n&gt; of 1.0. There is clear advantag=\r\ne for using it, otherwise the \n&gt; hyperplanes that the nodes represent would=\r\n all cross the origin of the \n&gt; hyperspace, which is limiting the possible =\r\nbehaviors the NN can have. \n&gt; But not all nodes in NEAT have a connection t=\r\no the bias node. Evolution \n&gt; connects nodes to it when only when it is use=\r\nful. In this way the \n&gt; search space is further minimized, NEAT does not ha=\r\nve to search for a \n&gt; proper bias on every node. \n&gt; However, in HyperNEAT s=\r\nubstrates, it is better to have a bias in every \n&gt; neuron anyway, then the =\r\nbiases will be &quot;drawn&quot; by the CPPN. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;stig.bergestad&quot; &lt;stig.bergestad@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello!\n&gt; &gt; I wa=\r\ns wondering if the original NEAT(c++) used/uses threshold values\n&gt; &gt; for no=\r\nde activation? And if there are any advantages to using it in\n&gt; &gt; general?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; To be clear, I am talking about a value that a node has, that is used\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; in the calculation of the activation of a node, the threshold value is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; subtracted from the weighted sum of connecting nodes before sending\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthis sum to the activation function.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Stig\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
