But one thing I find a little confusing is the idea that there is a special\n&gt; kind of random distribution that is better than other random distributions. If that is true,\n&gt; then doesn&#39;t it require some information to encode what that distribution is? And if it\n&gt; does need to be chosen from some special distributions, and those distributions are\n&gt; captured by Junk DNA, which ends up being expressed, then why is it called &quot;Junk\n&gt; DNA?&quot; Couldn&#39;t we essentially tell the same story in a simpler way by saying, &quot;a\n&gt; subset of DNA encodes the initial weight distribution in the brain?&quot; What then makes it\n&gt; junk? And why use the word random either?\n\nJunk DNA is a horrible term with multiple connotations, so perhaps\nsome clarification would help here (drawing from what I know).\nOriginally DNA was considered to code for proteins and nothing else,\nso all the DNA that didn&#39;t code for proteins (which is quite a lot I\nbelieve) was thought to be junk that was just &#39;in it for the ride&#39; so\nto speak.\n\nLater on it turned out that some of this junk DNA had regulatory roles\n- e.g. controlling the expression of protein coding genes. Think of\nthe distinction between program data and program instructions in\ncomputers - that&#39;s probably a crude generalisation but that&#39;s the\ngeneral principle. (If anyone wants to step in and correct me here I&#39;d\nbe more than happy).\n\nThis stilll left a load of other DNA which came about through\naccumulated replication errors and chunks of ancient viruses that\nperhaps infected our ancestors in the recent past (up to 100&#39;s of\nthousands of years ago) or much further back when we were still worms\ncrawling around in mud :)  The point is that it&#39;s DNA that has no\nfunctional use, it doesn&#39;t normally get expressed in any way. This to\nme is closest to being true junk DNA and it&#39;s possible that it just\ngot replicated and not used through much of our evolutionary\nhistory... then we started to evolve big brains and (the theory goes)\nsome parts of this junk start to get used as a source of arbitrary\ncomplexity for brain physiology.\n\nIf the theory is true then some of that junk DNA came to be used and\nis therefore no longer junk (albeit interpreted in a novel new way\ndistinct from it&#39;s original context and purpose). Essentially it&#39;s not\npart of the &#39;main-sequence&#39; DNA that was functional for our entire\nevolutionary history - the DNA that optimised and accumulated slowly\nand incrementaly.\n\n----\n\nYeh the word random is not really appropriate either - I think\n&#39;arbitrary complexity&#39; is a more accurate term, but perhaps others\ndisagree or have a better description? Also as a side note I want to\npoint out that distribution curves are not complete descriptors of\ntypes of randomness - I&#39;m not sure to what degree I&#39;m stating the\nobvious to folks on here, but just to be clear - there are other\nfactors at play, e.g. you can have two RNGs with the same distribution\ncurve but very different properties, so taking gaussian curves, an RNG\nmight emit extreme values all clumped together and then mid values all\nclumped together so that it&#39;s only seen to be gaussian when a very\nlarge number of samples are observed, but it is gaussian and very\ndistinct from a typical gaussian process/sequence.\n\n\n&gt; In any case, it still does bring up whether a special activation function inspired by this\n&gt; idea might be helpful in establishing some aspect of initial connectivity. I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; that if that is true, then the advantage would probably show up more in plastic networks\n&gt; than static ones.\n\nAgreed. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily black and white but it would\nseem to be less applicable to fixed weight networks than plasticity\nnets that are using this arbitrary connectivity as a starting point\ninstead of something that needs to be immediately functional.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
