The challenge\nwith encodings is not only for them to th=\r\neoretically express all\npossible procedures, but also to induce a nicely co=\r\nupled (smooth)\nsearch space.  It seems that the space induced by a strictly=\r\n modular\nand hierarchical encodings is unlikely to be smooth, leading to\nbr=\r\nittleness.  You can have things like a massive new module being\ndoubled in =\r\none shot (which would usually be a mess, like being born\nwith two heads) or=\r\n a change at one level of the hierarchy breaking the\nrest of it entirely.  =\r\n\n\nI am not dismissing GE, but I would want to hear an argument\nsupporting i=\r\nt more from the encoding and search spaces side rather\nthan from the formal=\r\n languages side.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jean-Baptiste Mouret / =\r\nMandor\n&lt;mandor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;shaflidason&quot; &lt;styrmis@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;shane=\r\nmcdonaldryan@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone ever compared the performance =\r\nof grammatical evolution to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; neuro evolution? Perhaps on the standard =\r\nproblems\npole-balancing, xor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems quite promising and I c=\r\nan post my results when they are\ndone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I wanted to see if anyone =\r\nelse has looked into it before I do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve invested quite a bit of ene=\r\nry in NE but GE looks very\npromising,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I like the fact that it pro=\r\nduces actual code rather than a black\n&gt; &gt; &gt; box. Which makes it more approp=\r\nriate for some domains. ie commercial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; video games.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did some co=\r\nmparaisons of NEAT with regards to our attribute grammar\n&gt; based encoding (=\r\nthis is not grammatical evolution but it&#39;s related). I\n&gt; used a pole-balanc=\r\ning task and a task in which a multi-dof robotic arm\n&gt; had to move to defin=\r\ned positions. Our system performed a bit better\n&gt; than NEAT on these tasks =\r\nbut NEAT could probably be tweaked\n&gt; more. While I&#39;m very happy with the th=\r\neoritical features of the\n&gt; encodings (it&#39;s hierarchical, modular and forma=\r\nlized), more benchmarks\n&gt; will be needed to draw any final conclusion about=\r\n the &quot;efficiency&quot;\n&gt; (btw, Ken previously highlighted the problems with benc=\r\nhmarks such as\n&gt; those).\n&gt; \n&gt; See : http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12065-008-00=\r\n15-7\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor\n&gt; http://anim=\r\natlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
