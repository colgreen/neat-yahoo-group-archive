Just thinking back to \nour discussion of Darren Izzard&#39;s shape recognizer, and possible ways \nto input board states of games like Tic-Tac-Toe, it might be more \nefficient to only have two sets of inputs, in this case 10 inputs, \nonly for the cards being &quot;looked at&quot; each turn.\n\nPerhaps you could have the outputs be the X and Y coordinates of the \nnext two choices, and those outputs could have connections that feed \ndirectly back into the input of the net (it might be very interesting \nto start without these connections and see if and/or how long it \ntakes for them to develop).\n\nThis would probably be a more efficient representation, since the net \nwould only look at two positions each turn, instead of looking at \nevery position each turn. \n\n&gt; I could reduce the number of inputs to three by using\n&gt; binary coding: 000 no card, 111 face down, 001 ace,\n&gt; 010 deuce, 100 trey.  I would like to hear opinions\n&gt; about whether that&#39;s a good idea.  If this works it\n&gt; makes it easier to enlarge the deck.\n\nMy instinct would be to not combine the nodes that identify the cards \nwith the ones that indicate its up/down state, but I&#39;m admittedly not \nvery experienced.  I&#39;d probably have a dedicated node that indicates \ncard state, and have separate input nodes for the identity.\n\nAnybody else have any thoughts on this?\n\n&gt; &gt; If your inputs range from 0 to 1, are you\n&gt; &gt; representing\n&gt; &gt; each type of card as a value range (e.g. King/clubs\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; from 0 to 0.33, 2/hearts is from .33 to .66, etc.)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Ken thought it was not a good idea to use this\n&gt; representation, and I&#39;m inclined to agree.\n\nYeah, I would too. :)\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
