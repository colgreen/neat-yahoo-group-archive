Sort of obvious huh.\n- Biological organisms have no way of assessing genetic compatibility \ndirectly and therefore use phenotype as an indirect way of assessing \nthis compatibility. After all, similar genotypes will normally result in \nsimilar phenotypes.\n\nA few points here:\n1) I think I&#39;ve made this point before - we have a very limited amout of \ncomputational power to hand when compared to nature. Therefore if we can \nmake shortcuts then we should do so. So, because we have direct access \nto the genomes we should then compare them directly if it makes sense to \ndo so. There is no point simulating systems that came about to solve a \nproblem that we (within simulations) do not have.\n\n2) As has been pointed out, nature&#39;s technique is by no means perfect. \nConsider predators that mimick some part of a prey&#39;s phenotype in order \nto pretend to be a potential mate, thus luring them into eating range \n:)  This can be a familiar (sexy) shape or the emitting of a pheromone, \netc.  If nature had direct access to genomes then the poor old prey \nwould be able to determine that the potential mate over there is in fact \na predator, and to &#39;leg it&#39;(as we say in the UK) poste haste!\n\n \nSo is this the full story? Does phenotype comparison have /any/ possible \nuse within simulations? Or is it the case that the the only useful role \nof phenotype is in it&#39;s expression within an environment so that we can \nassess its fitness? I think it does have a use...\n\nConsider an indirect encoding under which a very small mutation DID give \nrise to a significant and beneficial change in the phenotype. We now \nhave organisms that have almost identical genotype but a significantly \ndifferent phenotype. For comic potential let&#39;s say this creature grew an \nextra eye on the back of it&#39;s head, and that this was quite good for \nspotting oncoming predators. In nature it is quite possible that \ncreatures without this mutation (and perhaps even those with it) would \nsee the &#39;mutants&#39; as being less desirable mates, because they do not \nmeet the criteria for a good mate based upon what they know. This could \nactually be one way in which new species arise. The mutants, rejected by \nwhat they consider to be good mates, now mate with the next best \nthing... another mutant. Thus a rudamentary form of speciation has come \nabout.\n\nIf we were comparing genotypes then this speciation never would have \noccured. Was the speciation in this example actually useful? I think it \nwas because it effectively focused a new evolutionary search around the \nmutation by forcing mutants to mate with each other. If the mutants \ncontinued to mate with non-mutatnts as normal then the mutation would \nstill become dominant eventually through selection - but this would have \noccured at a slower rate.\n\nSo I recon phenotype comparison can be useful over and above plain \ngenome comparison. It&#39;s a bit of a concocted scenario but there it is.\n\nWhether this is of any use within simulations is, I suspect,  yet \nanother question for research. As Derek and Mitchell were (sort of) \nsaying earlier, we need to pick-and-choose techniques employed by the \nbiological world in order to obtain a balance between simplicity and \nefficacy with the limited computational resources we have to hand.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
