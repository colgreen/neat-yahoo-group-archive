I\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; taken note of some of the recommendations. So I\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; go ahead and set something up and we can make\n&gt; changes\n&gt; &gt; from there. One question I did have though was,\n&gt; how do\n&gt; &gt; we want to upload documentation to this site?\n&gt; &gt; Do we want anyone/everyone to be able to upload (\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; we do it via a web interface) Or do we want to log\n&gt; &gt; into unix machine and ftp it?  What do you\n&gt; recommend?\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Rog\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Rog, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;upload\n&gt; documentation to the\n&gt; site?&quot;  What kind of documentation do you mean?\n&gt; \n&gt; But to answer your other question, I think it would\n&gt; be nice to have a\n&gt; web interface for uploads.  If someone uploads\n&gt; something\n&gt; innapropriate, we don&#39;t have to include it.  What do\n&gt; others think\n&gt; about this?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew Yahoo!
