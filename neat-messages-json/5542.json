Run basic examples, like learning the XOR functi=\r\non, a often included example of supervised learning. Read the paper that in=\r\ntroduce NEAT, not all, but at least the section about how it&#39;s done, a one =\r\nhour effort. If you data are vector of fixed size, it&#39;s very straighfoward =\r\nto move from the XOR example to your problem.\n\n  But anyway, if the real pr=\r\noblem is to actually build a classifier and not tinkering with NEAT, better=\r\n first have a good reason to use NEAT and not something more simple (Occam =\r\nrazor principle). A perceptron with backprop, you got plenty of implementat=\r\nions for it in the most esotheric languages, and it&#39;s easy to do your own i=\r\nf you wish to. Same goes for SVM, if you don&#39;t use fancy kernels. And both =\r\nare likely to be faster for many supervised learning tasks. I might be corr=\r\nected by the others, but I think the original purpose of NEAT was to do *UN=\r\nSUPERVISED* learning. Don&#39;t expect a less informed algorithm to be better t=\r\nhan a better informed one :p\n\nAlex\n\n--- En date de=C2=A0: Dim 10.4.11, eko =\r\nsakti &lt;smuet_item@...&gt; a =C3=A9crit=C2=A0:\n\nDe: eko sakti &lt;smuet_it=\r\nem@...&gt;\nObjet: Bls: Re : [neat] ask about NEAT\n=C3=80: neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\nDate: Dimanche 10 avril 2011, 13h16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n=\r\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      thanks alex,=C2=A0\ni&#39;m new in neat.=C2=A0if=C2=\r\n=A0I=C2=A0use the=C2=A0NEAT=C2=A0for=C2=A0classification, what the first th=\r\nings i must to do?\n\nbest regards\neko sakti,=C2=A0Dari: Alexandre Devert &lt;ma=\r\nrmakoide@...&gt;\nKepada: neat@yahoogroups.com\nTerkirim: Rab, 6 April, 201=\r\n1 23:01:48\nJudul: Re : [neat] ask about NEAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n    =\r\n\n      \n      \n      Hi,\n\n\n\nNEAT optimize neural network. NEAT will generat=\r\ne many neural network, and you give a *fitness* to each neural network. Hig=\r\nher fitness means more interesting neural network.\n\n\n\nThus, with NEAT, you =\r\ncan produce neural networks that can themselves can be used for doing class=\r\nification. Your fitness for a given neural network should be its classifica=\r\ntion performance. To avoid over-learning (a classifier which does not gener=\r\nalize), be careful to not use the same sample set to compute classification=\r\n performance.\n\n\n\nAlso, be sure that more classic machine learning methods a=\r\nre not suitable, like SVM or back-prop, they are likely to be faster if the=\r\ny work good enough on your problem. Those methods are less general than NEA=\r\nT but can exploit some properties specific to supervised learning for speed=\r\n gain.\n\n\n\nAlex\n\n\n\n--- En date de=C2=A0: Mer 6.4.11, smuet_item &lt;smuet_item@=\r\nyahoo.co.id&gt; a =C3=A9crit=C2=A0:\n\n\n\nDe: smuet_item &lt;smuet_item@...&gt;=\r\n\n\nObjet: [neat] ask about NEAT\n\n=C3=80: neat@yahoogroups.com\n\nDate: Mercred=\r\ni 6 avril 2011, 16h28\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\nhello. \n\n\n\nmy name is sakti, iam student=\r\n at its[dot]ac[dot]id\n\n\n\nplease explain to me, can NEATH algorithm used for=\r\n clasisication like neural network.\n\n\n\nregards,\n\n\n\nsakti\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
