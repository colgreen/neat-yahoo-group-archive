The &#39;pure&#39; approach is to leave them in, the\nmotivation for taking them out is practicality - you may end up with\nmillions of connections that have very little functional role, along\nwith their resulting memory and CPU overhead.\n\nI think it&#39;s fair to say though that low weight connections aren&#39;t\ncompletely useless and therefore we have made a trade-off between\npracticality and the power of hyperNEAT&#39;s generative encoding. Overall\nit makes sense because the potential gain from weak connections is\noutweighed by the very large resource cost in simulating them. However\nthere may be better alternatives:\n\n1) Simply reduce the cut off range. (What is the optimal cut-off?)\n2) Devise CPPNs with an additional connection on/off output.\n3) Use HybrID to refine *all* of the weights over their full range,\nregardles of whether they were eliminated during the HyperNEAT phase.\nThis then raises the question of how much HybrID&#39;s performance is down\nto this effect.\n\nEven more broadly, given the potentially huge resource cost of ANNs\ngenerated by CPPNs perhaps we should consider factoring that cost into\nthe fitness functions. That way we allow evolution to find the sweet\nspot between good performance on the objective function and lousy\nresource utilisation (which slows down search speed and thus the power\nof the overall search method)\n\n\nBTW HybrID reminds me of Hinton&#39;s explanation of the relationship\nbetween RBMs and backprop - that RBMs are good at global search and\nbackprop at refining that search once RBMs haved honed in on a good\nsolution. These are promising results indeed.\n\n\nColin\n\n"}}
