Given that there are only 14 test cases I would \nsay that this network has just learned to give the correct answers \nrather than actually calculating the average of the inputs. So we can \naddress this problem by varying the test data and/or using a larger grid \nsize - but for now I would say your NEAT code has some problems if it&#39;s \nnot finding a solution.  A couple of quick questions - what activation \nfn are you using? and are you scaling the outputs to the expected range?\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
