It is in both Ken and Colin&#39;s code.  \n&gt;\nYeh this was pointed out recently on the list. It was probably a typo \nbut it doesn&#39;t matter all that much so long as the starting angle isn&#39;t \ntoo big. I either mistakenly copied the typo or decided to keep the \nstarting state the same as in Ken&#39;s code. For consistency you might want \nto leave it at 0.07 and put a comment explaining why.\n\n&gt;2) When the environmental state values are normalized for input into\n&gt;the network, they are handled differently in single and double pole\n&gt;balancing.  For single:\n&gt;\n&gt;\t// Provide state info to the network (normalised to 0 to 1.0).\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(0, (cart_pos_x + trackLength/2.0) / trackLength);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(1, (cart_velocity_x + 0.75) /1.5);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(2, (pole_angle + twelve_degrees) / twentyfour_degrees);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(3, (pole_angular_velocity + 1.0) / 2.0);\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For double:\n&gt;\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(0, state[0] / trackLength);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(1, state[1] / 2.0);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(2, state[2] / 0.52);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(3, state[3] / 2.0);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(4, state[4] / 0.52);\n&gt;\tnetwork.setInputSignal(5, state[5] / 2.0);\n&gt;\n&gt;Why are these different?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood question :)\n\nThe SP code seems to be rescaling to about 0 to 1(as the commentsays). \nWhereas the DP code is scaling by slightly different numbers but not \nadjusting into the 0-1 range, thus generating a range of (approx.) -1 to \n1. As it happens I don&#39;t think this really matters since the input \nsignals can be scaled and their sign switched by the connection weights \nfrom the input nodes. As such you may want to leave them as they are, \nbut again perhaps insert a comment explaining that the values are used \nfor consistency,  assuming that my code duplicates Ken&#39;s.\n\n&gt;For double it seems like you don&#39;t actually get values scaled between\n&gt;0 and 1 or -1 and 1.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt looks liek they&#39;re scaled to -1 to 1 to me.\n\n&gt;3) Are 100,000 time steps necessary?  It seems to us that all networks\n&gt;we&#39;ve looked at so far either fail or succeed very early in each\n&gt;trial, (e.g., &lt;10,000 timesteps).  This would greatly increase\n&gt;efficiency to truncate the amount of timesteps.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think you&#39;re right for all experiments except the anti-wiggle one. In \nthat experiment I noticed some networks could keep the system stable for \nquite some time only to fail dramatically some time before the 100,000 \ntimesteps where up.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
