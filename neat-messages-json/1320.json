Which pixel, and how big that\n&gt;pixel is\n&gt; &gt; is determined by the top,left,right,bottom inputs.  a top,left of\n&gt;0,0 and\n&gt;\n&gt;Do you mean outputs rather than inputs?  This description doesn&#39;t\n&gt;seem to leave anything left for the network to decide if everything\n&gt;is based on only its inputs?\n\nNo, I mean inputs.  What&#39;s being asked of the network is for it to form a \nmodel of its pixel inputs, and then use the top,left,bottom,right inputs to \nspecify which part of that model we are interested in.  So if the pixel \ninputs indicate a smooth gradient from upper left to lower right, the model \nshould reflect that.  Then, if I ask it for the center portion of the model, \nit should return a value that is the average intensity of that region of the \nmodel.\n\nThe problem I have is the evolutionary pressure I&#39;m applying.  When I was \nasking it to do the &#39;reduction&#39; first, that created a pressure that forced \nit to optimize towards simply averaging its inputs.  That doesn&#39;t do me any \ngood.  When I do ALL activations, there&#39;s still a majority of activations \nthat are just verifying its ability to do reductions.  So it can still \noptimize itself into uselessness...  BUT...if I turn it around and ask it to \ndo enlargements first and only reductions if it succeeds at enlargements, \nthen the pressure to actually evolve what I was looking for is much \nstronger.  MUCH stronger.  Then, once it has evolved that, everything else \nis just optimization and error-reduction.\n\nI&#39;m going to give that a try.  I&#39;m going to restart the experiment (again) \nas soon as the machine is done making the smaller versions of the original \nimages.\n\n\n\n"}}
