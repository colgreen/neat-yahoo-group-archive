This could alternatively have been done by inputing a\nfifth posotion input node (making the five x1,y1,x2,y2 and Position, call\nit method 1b), which would also have allowed the genotype-&gt;phenotype\nconversion to implement different phenotypes for different roles. \n\nMy suggestion was simpler still, to implement the same phenotype for each\nposition, but adding an input node (at the phenotype) specifying position\n(call it method 2). This input could be used to inhibit or excite the\nfunctioning of nodes within the phenotype, depending on position. This\nwould also allow roles to evolve, but using a different method.\n\nFor a comprehensive investigation, which might be well beyond the scope of\nthe research - the paper did demonstrate a very successfull test, I&#39;d\npersonally like to see all three methods implemented. 1a and 1b are very\nsimilar in reality and genotype-&gt;phenotype conversion has all the\ninformation required to switch between 1a and 1b internally, though\nsupplying the information explicitly as per 1b _might_ be more powerful\nfor evolving. \n\nwith regards,\nmattias\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: &quot;afcarl2&quot; &lt;a.carl@...&gt;\nTo: neat@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Fri, 25 Apr 2008 16:26:47 -0000\nSubject: [neat] Re: Another New Paper:  Multiagent HyperNEAT\n\n&gt; Just for the record, and for the benefit of the group, isn&#39;t the &quot;r\n&gt; (x) method&quot; just a mechanism employed within the current \n&gt; infrastructure limitations, to map multiple agents within the \n&gt; substraite and generalize the CPPN to the presence of the multiple \n&gt; agents?\n\n\n"}}
