When I watch \n&gt; an \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; animaion of the activation changing in the substrate, it looks \n&gt; like it=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; exibits a pattern. The simplest I&#39;ve seen can be described as a \n&gt; me=\r\nxican \n&gt; &gt; wave travelling across the hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; As the CPPNs compl=\r\nexify, so do the activity patterns exibited. \n&gt; When \n&gt; &gt; using regular NEA=\r\nT for the problem of keeping the humanoid model \n&gt; &gt; balanced, it has moslt=\r\ny erratic behaviour, and the lucky ones \n&gt; (with \n&gt; &gt; high fitness) usually=\r\n find a way to trick the system and stay in \na \n&gt; &gt; balanced position forev=\r\ner, without moving at all. \n&gt; &gt; But when HyperNEAT is used for this, it loo=\r\nks really interesting \n&gt; and.. \n&gt; &gt; natural! The model is trying to balance=\r\n using its arms, and it is \n&gt; &gt; moving.. It looks like a drunk guy, but you=\r\n note the difference. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve arranged the nodes in a geometric way.. Let=\r\n me explain - the \n&gt; left \n&gt; &gt; and right arm&#39;s outputs are separated in the=\r\n left and right in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; substrate space, and close to each other. So d=\r\no the legs. The \n&gt; hidden \n&gt; &gt; nodes are in the center in a star/cirlular s=\r\nhape. I also included \n&gt; 3 \n&gt; &gt; inputs (head velocity) in the center around=\r\n 0.0, but with smaller \n&gt; &gt; radius than the ring of hidden nodes. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
