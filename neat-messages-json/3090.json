Let me explain how it is set up. The system \nwas u=\r\nsed like a host to implement HyperNEAT. I haven&#39;t another \ninvolving many i=\r\nnputs to properly test it with. \n3 possible substrate configurations are cu=\r\nrrently supported- \nparralel, circular and random. Parralel is arrangement =\r\nof nodes in \nlayers, in the circular case, there are 3 rings of nodes, the =\r\nouter \none is the input layer, the middle one are the hidden neurons and th=\r\ne \ninner are the outputs. The rings reside on radiuses 0.99, 0.66 and \n0.33=\r\n from the origin. This looks very.. cool when viewed with all \nconnections =\r\n:) \nIt was easy to turn regular NEAT into HyperNEAT. \nInstead of giving the=\r\n roving eye a brain directly created from a NEAT \ngenome, I give it a big n=\r\network created from a temporary genome and \nthe newtork that used to be its=\r\n brain is now used as a CPPN. \nAnd this is it. Everything else is untouched=\r\n from the original \nversion. \nI wrote some nice looking GUI too.. I&#39;ll uplo=\r\nad it soon so you can \ncheck it out.. \n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Really you have a roving eye vision =\r\nsystem already working with \n&gt; HyperNEAT?  How is it set up?  Is there a hi=\r\ndden layer?\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n=\r\n&gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow Peter, that is fast work!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yeah, it was about a day of coding :) I even applied it to =\r\nthe \n&gt; Active \n&gt; &gt; Vision system from ANJI (my own implementation of it).. =\r\ncurrent \n&gt; &gt; results show that with HyperNEAT it learns actually better, an=\r\nd \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; circular substrate configuration increases performance among =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; others. :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Assigning node-centric values is a legitimate re=\r\nsearch \nproblem.  \n&gt; &gt; The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; simplest answer is that a CPPN can have m=\r\nore than a single \n&gt; output.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There can be additional outputs for th=\r\nings like biases and \n&gt; learning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rates.  Each such property will the=\r\nn be patterned across the \n&gt; &gt; substrate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just like weights.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; However, the one problem that comes up with nodes is that node-\n&gt; &gt; ce=\r\nntric \n&gt; &gt; &gt; properties are overspecified by a 4D CPPN because nodes are \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; specified \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by only two dimensions (that is, they are points in spa=\r\nce \nrather \n&gt; &gt; than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lines).  Therefore, you have to set a conventio=\r\nn for when to \n&gt; read \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; value of a node-centric output and as=\r\nsign it to a node.  For \n&gt; &gt; example, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you could say that the node at=\r\n x1 y1 is set to the value of the \n&gt; &gt; node \n&gt; &gt; &gt; output only when x2 y2 a=\r\nre both zero.  Of course there are many \n&gt; &gt; &gt; alternative ways it could be=\r\n done, but some convention must be \n&gt; &gt; set.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will try to do th=\r\ne following.. the CPPN will have 2 more \n&gt; outputs, \n&gt; &gt; that will specity =\r\nthe time constant and bias of THE SECOND node, \n&gt; &gt; (x2,y2) .. I think this=\r\n shouldn&#39;t hurt performance.. But I guess \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; will take some trial a=\r\nnd error. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
