I&#39;ve been lurking on the list for a while, and have been\n&gt;interested in NEAT since attending GECCO 2002.  I&#39;m just about to\n&gt;submit the following as a Sourceforge project:\n&gt;\n&gt;**** \n&gt;\n&gt;REAT (Rete Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an attempt to apply\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWish I&#39;d thought of that acronym :)\n\n&gt;the concepts of Ken Stanley&#39;s NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting\n&gt;Topologies) to Charles Forgy&#39;s Rete network.   This will, hopefully,\n&gt;enable the evolution of inference rules through continual\n&gt;complexification of their underlying RETE network.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s not an area I know much about, although where I work we actually \nproduce software that implements a rule engine - and although RETE type \nstuff  has been looked at, as far as I know we don&#39;t do anything that \nclever just yet.\n\nDo you think there is scope for improving upon existing RETE algorithms \nor is this more of a proof of concept project?\n\n&gt;I intend to develop this in Java, starting from a clean implementation\n&gt;of the RETE network.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWell good luck with that. I think this may actually be the first non \nneural net use of NEAT, unless Ken knows otherwise. I know he&#39;s often \nmentioned that the NEAT technique isn&#39;t constrained to just ANN&#39;s.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
