Sometimes it can \ntake a while to build up the necessary structure to jump \nfrom &quot;almost perfect&quot; to &quot;perfect.&quot;  That is, it may take hundreds \nof generations even.  \n\nIt is also possible that you have your speciation parameters set up \nin a way that doesn&#39;t let new species develop.  Unfortunately, I \ndon&#39;t know exactly how SharpNEAT allocates these parameters (such as \nthe coefficients of the compatibility equations and the \ncompatibility threshold).  I am not sure if the threshold is dynamic \nin SharpNEAT..may Colin can clarify.  But knowing the details might \nhelp determine what&#39;s going on.  Another thing that would help is to \nsee a graph or an output of species sizes and fitnesses over \ngenerations.  Then we could see if species are dying out prematurely \nor not appearing often enough.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chris Turner&quot; &lt;chris@l...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a couple of questions that I&#39;d like to put to the group.  I \n&gt; suppose these questions may have been asked before but I&#39;ve spend \n&gt; sometime searching through past messages with not much success.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Why is it that if I create a network with 10 input nodes and 1 \n&gt; output nodes, when I use the newwork viewer application is show \nthe \n&gt; network as haveing 11 input nodes?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I&#39;ve created an experiment where most test require a simple \n&gt; network in order to get the right answer.  However, a few of the \n&gt; tests require a more complex solution.  What seems to be happening \n&gt; is that the searching process quickly finds the simple network but \n&gt; which achieves about 94% of the fitness but never finds a network \n&gt; that fits the complete solution.  I think a solution should be \n&gt; possible as the inputs are logically created.  I think the more \n&gt; specialised species are being wiped-out before they get the change \n&gt; to evolve properly.  What changes to my network parameters can I \n&gt; make to increase the change of more complex networks?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Chris Turner\n\n\n\n"}}
