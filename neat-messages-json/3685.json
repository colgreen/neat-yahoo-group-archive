I think I remember someone telling me that\n&gt;  there was a some kind of bug like that in the SharpNEAT XOR but I\n&gt;  could be remembering wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Note that the issue is, if you don&#39;t flush between each example, the\n&gt;  network can succeed by memorizing the order of the examples, which is\n&gt;  not a true solution to XOR.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I may be mistaken about SharpNEAT not flushing, but it&#39;s still a good\n&gt;  issue to be aware of with any XOR experiment.\n\nYou may be thinking of ANJI. That happened with us when we first\nimplemented XOR.\n\nOh, look, it solved XOR...yay! Oh wait, the error is huge when we\nrandomize the input sequence. :)\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
