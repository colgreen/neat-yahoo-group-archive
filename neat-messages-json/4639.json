It would be cool to see how Vinod&#39;s technique works\non more complicated robots with more degrees of freedom. Have you tried that\nVinod?\n\nBut in the GECCO paper I was not concerned with the quality of the gait. As\nyou know, I was more interested in how HyperNEAT reacted to different\ngeometric representations of the same problem. The fact that certain\ngeometric representations made it much more likely for HyperNEAT to create\nleft-right symmetry is interesting, even if those left-right symmetry gaits\nare not that graceful.\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Wed, 22 Apr 2009 05:04:10 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: New paper investigating HyperNEAT&#39;s sensitivity to\n&gt; different geometric representations of a problem\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way guys, one significant difference between your two models is that I\n&gt; believe Jeff&#39;s model has knees and Vinod&#39;s does not.  Therefore, the results\n&gt; are not as directly comparable as they appear when just looking at the\n&gt; creature morphologies casually.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Jeff!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hi Vinod. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; It is an interesting and useful analysis of HyperNEAT&#39;s sensitivity to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; geometry in the quadruped locomotion domain.  BTW, I will also be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; presenting a paper that utilizes the same domain at the same GECCO\n&gt;&gt;&gt; track, and it also has been nominated for the Best Paper Award.  It\n&gt;&gt;&gt; introduces a new abstraction of indirect encoding for evolving\n&gt;&gt;&gt; symmetric and modular neural networks:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;    http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?valsalam:gecco09\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; So it looks like we are going to have an exciting competition for the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Best Paper Award :-)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Congratulations! The paper looks very cool. I wish you the best of luck.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Table 1, listing the gaits for different leg orderings, is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    particularly interesting because it gives insight into the type of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    patterns that the CPPN tends to produce. Do you have online videos\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    of the different gaits?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- What is the phase difference between the legs for the gaits with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    left-right and front-back symmetry (Table 1)?  In particular, do\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    they qualify as pace and bound respectively, i.e. is the phase\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    difference between the sides a half-period? (I usually find it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    useful to plot the leg angles as a function of time to determine\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    the leg phases more accurately than by observing the videos.)\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I looked at these videos a while back and found that most of the bilaterally\n&gt;&gt; symmetric gaits have two of the legs stiff and the other two doing most of\n&gt;&gt; the work. So, I would not classify those as pace and bound. At the moment, I\n&gt;&gt; do not recall any true pace and bound gaits. I will look into that again,\n&gt;&gt; but at the moment I am swamped with a paper deadline and the end-of-semester\n&gt;&gt; rush. I don&#39;t have any videos posted yet, but I will try to get to that\n&gt;&gt; before I leave the country (I&#39;m off to Norway soon for the Congress on\n&gt;&gt; Evolutionary Computation).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have looked at plots of the angles over time in the past, as in this\n&gt;&gt; paper:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/supportDocs/EvolvingCoordinatedGaitsWithHyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have not yet done that for the gaits in the GECCO paper. It would be\n&gt;&gt; interesting to try.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; By the way, I still plan on using angular velocities instead of desired\n&gt;&gt; angles with HyperNEAT. That may produce more natural pace and bound gaits,\n&gt;&gt; especially when using a geometric representation that is biased toward\n&gt;&gt; producing such gaits.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- What kind of gaits did the HyperNEAT experiments with randomized\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    geometry produce?  Are they similar to the gaits in Table 1, with\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    all four legs in synchrony occurring in the majority of trials?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If memory serves, the answer is yes. They mostly produced gaits with all\n&gt;&gt; four legs in synchrony. I&#39;ll try to check in on that when I have a sec to\n&gt;&gt; provide a more definitive answer.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- In the randomized experiments, do you think keeping the PRYS inputs\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    fixed and randomizing only the other inputs would produce better\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    results?  It seems to me that including the PRYS inputs in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    randomization may disrupt the geometry more since they do not have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    a clear geometric interpretation.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Interesting. I would think the opposite. Since they have no proper geometric\n&gt;&gt; location, why should it matter one way or the other if they are included in\n&gt;&gt; the randomization. In a sense, their current position is random. Why do you\n&gt;&gt; think HyperNEAT will do better with PRYS where it is than in any other\n&gt;&gt; random location?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- You mention that each controller was simulated for 6000 time steps,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    but the simulation was terminated early if the controller did not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    produce good behavior.  Do such early termination occur during the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    evaluation of champions evolved by HyperNEAT as well?  Also, how\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    long was each time step?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Those 6000 seconds correspond to 6 seconds of &#39;real&#39; simulated time. I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; nearly sure that the answer to your question is that some of the HyperNEAT\n&gt;&gt; champs do not fall over in the time allowed and others do. Another\n&gt;&gt; interesting question is what happens if I take the final HyperNEAT champions\n&gt;&gt; and run them for more than 6 seconds. This would test whether they have\n&gt;&gt; evolved a true, general gait. I plan on performing that study when I put\n&gt;&gt; these results into a journal article.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am sorry I can&#39;t provide less qualified answers at the moment, but I\n&gt;&gt; really am overwhelmed with work. I will try to get you better answers when\n&gt;&gt; the storm clears.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Congrats again on your best paper nomination. It is fun that we are working\n&gt;&gt; on different ways of evolving controllers for the same domain.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Jeff\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Vinod\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; At Wed, 15 Apr 2009 20:07:52 -0400,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Below is a link to a new HyperNEAT paper that I will present at GECCO 2009\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this summer. It studies how sensitive HyperNEAT is to different geometric\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representations of the same problem.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am especially excited about this paper because it was nominated for the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best Paper Award in the Generative and Developmental Systems track. If you\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are going to GECCO this year, and enjoyed the paper, please keep it in mind\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when casting your ballot.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The paper can be viewed here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HyperNEATSensitivit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\ny\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ToGeometry.pdf\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Abstract:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT, a generative encoding for evolving artificial neural networks\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (ANNs), has the unique and powerful ability to exploit the geometry of a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem (e.g., symmetries) by encoding ANNs as a function of a problem&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geometry. This paper provides the first extensive analysis of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sensitivity of HyperNEAT to different geometric representations of a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem. Understanding how geometric representations affect the quality of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolved solutions should improve future designs of such representations.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HyperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinated gaits for a simulated\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quadruped robot with a specific two-dimensional geometric representation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here, the same problem domain is tested, but with different geometric\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representations of the problem. Overall, experiments show that the quality\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can be substantially affected\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outperforms a direct encoding\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; control even with randomized geometric representations, but performs even\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; better when a human engineer designs a representation that reflects the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, even choices in geometric\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori can significantly affect\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representation can bias the type of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right symmetry more common than\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest that HyperNEAT practitioners can\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obtain good results even if they do not know how to geometrically represent\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a problem, and that further improvements are possible with a well-chosen\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; geometric representation.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As always, I look forward to any questions or comments you may have.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
