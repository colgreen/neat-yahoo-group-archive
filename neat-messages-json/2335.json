That is\n&gt;something to be aware of since it will look really bad if you\n&gt;knowingly got into a conference with no intention of showing up.  If\n&gt;that causes problems for you, you may want to consider the journal\n&gt;option.\n\nDamn!  I half suspected that, but was ignoring it :)\n\nI never was great one for attending conderences, even when I wasn&#39;t \ngoing to have to pay the costs myself (getting invited to speak is \nsomehow different, I did a fair bit of that as part of liaiaiaiaising \nwith academia when I was in game R&D).\n\nHave these people never noticed the Internet and how you generally \nnever need to leave you armchair for anything short of reproduction \nthese days.  Actually, given the choice, I _would_ leave the \narmchair, I&#39;d take the PC out onto the moors, but have you tried \nfinding a broadband network connection half-way up a millstone \ntor?  One day though....\n\nOf course, the simplest solution for me would be if I had a \ncollaborator who was in academia.  Maybe my friend at the U of \nSheffield would be interested, I&#39;ll ask him....\n\nIan\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
