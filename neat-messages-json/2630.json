So if you get a novel game and right \naway ne=\r\ned to play it with no prior experience, how can an \nevolutionary system be =\r\nprepared for that?  Are you trying to evolve \na single neural network that =\r\ncan play any game?  I&#39;m still unclear \nhow this can be accomplished.\n\nken\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Charles Tarun&quot; &lt;ctarun@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Accord=\r\ning to the competition&#39;s site(please correct me if I&#39;m \nwrong!)\n&gt; \n&gt; Your a=\r\npplication functions over a network, your program connects to\n&gt; the GameMas=\r\nter who picks the game that will be played and transmits\n&gt; the game definit=\r\nion to the program, the game is then played (some \nare\n&gt; 1,2, or more playe=\r\nrs) and the GameMaster program decides a score at\n&gt; the end of the game bas=\r\ned on the game rules.  Before your match \nyou do\n&gt; not know what game you w=\r\nill be playing, and for the competition \nthey\n&gt; will add new games that hav=\r\nen&#39;t been release so people can&#39;t just\n&gt; program for all the different game=\r\ns.  During the weeks of the\n&gt; competition you are allows( and encouraged) t=\r\no make changes to your\n&gt; application for the next week&#39;s matches.  The play=\r\n clock can vary \nfrom\n&gt; between 10 seconds and an hour.  This year they pla=\r\nn to have a \npretty\n&gt; large range of the clocks.  If you don&#39;t make a move =\r\nthe GameMaster\n&gt; will for you, if you make an illegal move, the GameMaster =\r\nwill \nmake a\n&gt; move for you and you get a score of 0 for the match.\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\n the short answer I believe is &quot;Yes, it is plug and play.&quot;. :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Charle=\r\ns Tarun\n&gt; \n&gt; On 4/20/06, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, Joseph Reisinger &lt;joeraii@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Per N=\r\nEAT, is there any training/evolution that occurs prior \nto\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncompetition, or do you basically start evolving the \npopulation\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scratch during the competition, once you receive the rule \nset?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After the spec is received, there is some amount of time for\n&gt; &gt; ini=\r\ntial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learning before the match commences.

It would be cool if it was totally plug \nand\n&gt; &gt; play, such that your=\r\n platform could be used by anyone to evolve \nany\n&gt; &gt; game spec right away w=\r\nith no further coding, but I&#39;m not sure \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; what you say how it works=\r\n exactly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
