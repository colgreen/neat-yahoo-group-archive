There are however works that do apply =\r\nmultiobjective optimization to neuroevolution.  For example it has been use=\r\nd in recent years in combination with novelty search (i.e. where novelty is=\r\n one of the &quot;objectives&quot;).  But I don&#39;t know about a general such test-suit=\r\ne.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;willemvanwilligen&quot; &lt;willemvanwillige=\r\nn@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m working on a multi-objective version of =\r\nNEAT, that I tested on my own problem, but I was wondering if there are any=\r\n good test suites for this purpose. Of course, there are many test suites f=\r\nor multi-objective function approximation, but these are not suitable for s=\r\nolving with neural nets. So I need multiobjective control / classification =\r\nproblems.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions are welcome!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Willem\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
