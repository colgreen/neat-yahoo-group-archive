The network is evaluated several times in order to \nconstruct the program, which is essentially an array of instructions. \nOn each evaluation, the network can see a single entry in the number \nsequence, and also a single instruction in the program. The intention \nhere is that, if necessary, the network can navigate back and forth \nwithin the program to change instructions.\n\n&gt;Output appears to be threshold applied \n&gt;to select the program instruction w/ highest output.\n\nYes, along with an ability to navigate through the program list and/or \nnumber sequence. This is probably needlessly complicated for the task.\n\n&gt;The outputs \n&gt;corresponding to the sequence is tested for length and correctness as \n&gt;applies to the status of the stack.\n\nOnce the network has been evaluated MAX_STEPS times, the generated \nprogram is evaluated at each index in the number sequence, and the \ndifferences between its output and the supplied sequence are totalled. \nIf the program fails to evaluate for any reason, an error of 100 is \nassumed.\n\nFitness is computed based upon\n&gt;cumulative error over input sequence. It appears that cost is tracked \n&gt;but does not appear to factor into fitness?\n\nIt is divided down and added to the cumulative error in line 2882. \nCost was probably a fairly ill-thought out attempt to help NEAT find \nmore sophisticated networks, by making the more disruptive \ninstructions expensive.\n\nI&#39;ll freely admit that this experiment wasn&#39;t thought through terribly \nwell, as it fell more into the &quot;I wonder if this might work&quot; realm \nthan a serious investigation. The main reasons for uploading the file, \nas I recall, were the shape recognition experiments, so I&#39;m not sure \nreally how much use the program experiment could be.\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
