I am learning much from this discussion too.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In =\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;martin_pyka&quot; &lt;martin.pyka@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joel,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; thanks for your fast response which addressed exactly my inquiry. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n First, I want to clarify that even if evolvability can reach a maximum the=\r\n conclusion of your paper is correct that it can emerge without any pressur=\r\ne for adaptation in the individuals. In this regard, my question whether a =\r\nmaximum of evolvability exists was more of general nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The way I=\r\n think about it currently is that perhaps there is no ultimate tension, and=\r\n that evolvability can generally increase without limit. The reason is that=\r\n canalization of low-level mechanisms can act to increase evolvability. For=\r\n example, many of the mechanisms behind development are heavily conserved, =\r\nbut can generate much phenotypic variability through being combined and mod=\r\nulated in various ways. In other words, modulating conserved features of de=\r\nvelopment gives evolution higher-level levers that enable small genetic cha=\r\nnges to be amplified and have a large meaningful phenotypic effect. Thus th=\r\nrough continued evolution of the genotype/phenotype map, perhaps evolvabili=\r\nty can continually increase (through exploiting canalization of lower-level=\r\n mechanisms to generate increasingly high-level features).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep, when I=\r\n read this I noted that this is actually also my opinion about generative e=\r\nncodings. From this perspective, I would also assume that evolvability can =\r\ncontinuously increase in the sense that the genome can become more powerful=\r\n (or more flexible) in generating new meaningful phenotypes. Maybe my impli=\r\ncit assumption was not correct that evolvability in a phenotype map could b=\r\ne depicted as iso-oriented point-cloud:\n&gt; \n&gt; left image in http://www.marti=\r\nnpyka.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/evolvability.png\n&gt; \n&gt; According to this=\r\n illustration, increased evolvability would increase the size of the point =\r\ncloud. I think I had this picture in mind when I argued in my previous post=\r\n that evolvability cannot increase infinitely because genotype-phenotype ma=\r\nppings should become instable when a certain degree of evolvability has bee=\r\nn reached. However, maybe a 2d-depiction of the evolvable phenotype-space w=\r\nould rather look like in the right image (I am sorry for my poor artwork). =\r\nThrough canalization, not all phenotypes in the 2d-space are evolvable but =\r\nevolvability itself can still increase!?\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe, both pictures can also=\r\n illustrate what canalization means. The left picture could depict all poss=\r\nible points in the genotype space that can be reached through mutation and =\r\nrecombination and the right image all possible points in the phenotype spac=\r\ne that can be generated from it. While each bit in the (2d)-genotype has eq=\r\nual probability of been mutated, in canalized encodings only a well-ordered=\r\n subspace of phenotypes can be reached.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for this inspiring d=\r\niscussion. :-) I enjoy thinking about how all this fits together.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best=\r\n,\n&gt; Martin\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
