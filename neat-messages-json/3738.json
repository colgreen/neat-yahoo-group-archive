As Dr. Jones stated up front, \nno one knows=\r\n the full answer, and that&#39;s absolutely true.  What I was \nmore interested =\r\nin was how the leaders in these areas of biology \nthink about this issue, w=\r\nhich I see as one of the most profound \npuzzles at the core of evolution, w=\r\nhether natural or artificial.  \nThus, it is intriguing to learn the depth o=\r\nf insight that they can \ndraw from their respective realms of expertise.\n\nS=\r\no when I express disappointment over the answers, it is not because \nthey f=\r\nailed to solve the entire problem.  Rather, it is that the \nanswers were ma=\r\ninly superficial and perhaps even touching on the \nobvious (of course to a =\r\nGECCO audience what is obvious is quite \ndifferent than to a normal audienc=\r\ne).  It left me feeling that, at \nleast within their spheres of research, t=\r\nhe puzzles of complexity are \nseen more as peripheral curiosities than para=\r\ndigm-defining problems.  \nWhile it is certainly possible that they have dee=\r\nper insights than \nthose they offered, it seems a bit strange that they wou=\r\nld fail to \nshare them at a debate headlined as &quot;evolution and complexity&quot; =\r\nin \nfront of an audience of Ph.D. scientists.  So it&#39;s not unreasonable \nto=\r\n conclude they don&#39;t have a lot to say on the subject that is \nparticularly=\r\n groundbreaking.\n\nIf that is true, my view is that it is somewhat unfortuna=\r\nte for \nbiology.  So while their answers perhaps reflect the best the field=\r\n \nhas to offer (as Thomas speculates may be the case), the field in \nthat c=\r\nase must bear the burden of ignoring such important issues.  By \nthe way, I=\r\n know that some biologists such as Raff and Meinhardt probe \nthese issues m=\r\nuch deeper than this panel did, so I would not naively \nendict the entire f=\r\nield.  But the mainstream seems a bit off the \ntrack.  \n\nWhat&#39;s really inte=\r\nresting about all this, from a GECCO point of view, \nis that it may be that=\r\n evolutionary computation, rather than biology, \nis where some of the most =\r\npowerful secrets of evolution are beginning \nto fall out.   Who would have =\r\nthought?  \n\nMost people at GECCO who I spoke to after the debate echoed the=\r\n \nsentiment that they hadn&#39;t really learned much, and in fact, had \nheard d=\r\neeper insights on evolution and complexity during GDS-track \n(Generative an=\r\nd Developmental Systems, a track at GECCO) paper talks \nthan during the key=\r\nnote event.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Thomas Johnson&quot; &lt;thomas.j.=\r\njohnson@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; These people must have email addresses, why not fo=\r\nllow up with them \nthat\n&gt; way? If they care about the question at all, I&#39;m =\r\nsure they&#39;ll give \na more\n&gt; thoughtful response via email. If they don&#39;t ca=\r\nre, well, then \nthat&#39;s why you\n&gt; got such bad answers in the first place :-=\r\n)\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, maybe you got bad answers because the answers actually reflect \n=\r\nthe\n&gt; current best guesses in their fields. In that case, the answers \naren=\r\n&#39;t\n&gt; really bad, it&#39;s just that people in other fields haven&#39;t been \nfocusi=\r\nng\n&gt; their attention on this problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tom\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 4, 2008 12:09 AM=\r\n, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Yes, the answers were inde=\r\ned lacking. By the way, notice also \nhow\n&gt; &gt; they ignored the second part o=\r\nf my question: &quot;How can evolution\n&gt; &gt; search a space of such astronomical c=\r\nomplexity?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was really disappointed that they didn&#39;t even venture=\r\n into that\n&gt; &gt; issue, because that&#39;s the really interesting question. Of co=\r\nurse \nyou\n&gt; &gt; can always speculate on how a little can be converted to a lo=\r\nt by\n&gt; &gt; talking about fractals and subroutines (after all, that&#39;s just\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n compression), but when you realize that we are talking about\n&gt; &gt; *searchin=\r\ng* a space of such mappings, it becomes far more \ncomplicated\n&gt; &gt; and profo=\r\nund. The problem then becomes compounded by the fact that\n&gt; &gt; not only must=\r\n the representation be efficient but it must also \nwarp\n&gt; &gt; in meaningful w=\r\nays, e.g. a biped should have biped children. How\n&gt; &gt; does natural evolutio=\r\nn manage to induce such a nicely structured\n&gt; &gt; search space?
