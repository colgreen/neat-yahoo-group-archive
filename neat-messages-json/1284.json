The conversation sprouted more branches but I \nhadn&#39;t read those emails when I replied.\n\nI cannot find the New Scientist article, maybe it&#39;s too long ago for their \nweb-site, or maybe they don&#39;t index the search by every possible term.\n\nI&#39;m with Derek, however -- just reading the caption of the guy&#39;s web page:\n\nImagination Engines, Inc., Inc....the future of all technology ...the \nfuture of mind\n\nI&#39;m inclined to discount everything he says.  I mean hubris or what!?  You \njust can&#39;t believe people who talk like that.\n\nHowever, from this web-page:\n\nhttp://www.imagination-engines.com/technologies/cm.htm\n\nWe get this paragraph, which probably tells us all we need to know:\n\n         &quot;Creativity Machines represent a new kind of neural network \nparadigm that is capable of generating, rather than just associating, \npatterns. They are based upon what we believe to be a significant \nscientific discovery, that a neural network exposed to any conceptual space \nand then internally irritated, in a specially prescribed way, tends to \ngenerate coherent ideas derived from its absorbed wisdom. Another neural \nnetwork, trained to filter out the very best of these notions, patrols the \nformer net&#39;s outputs, accumulating useful concepts (i.e., drug or \nautomobile designs) or using these output patterns in real time to devise \nstrategies (i.e., robotics and control systems).&quot;\n\n(Is that the same one Derek highlighted?  I&#39;m not sure.)\n\nSo this &quot;internal irritation&quot; is the &quot;damage&quot; I mentioned before.  And he \nmentions the second network for &quot;sanity checking the first one&quot; and he \nconceals details of how the &quot;irritation&quot; is done.\n\nThis is like any other AI technique, there&#39;s some areas where it really \nexcels, but that doesn&#39;t make it a general approach.  E.g. you have to be \nable to train the first network to generate &quot;solutions&quot;, which is not \nalways simple, and you have to be able to train the second one to recognize \ngood ones -- which again is far from straightforward in all but the \nsimplest domains.\n\nPut it another way, if this were as good as they claim we would have seen \nmore breakthroughs coming out of it.\n\nHowever, there are some positive things to take from this:\n\n1) the idea of inserting noise into a trained/evolved network as a way of \nmaking it explore the space around the solution it has found\n\n2) the idea of using one (proven) network to validate the output of another \n(experimental) one\n\n3) a trained/evolved net, fed a source of randomness, tends to produce \nconcepts with some &quot;meaning&quot; to the field on which it was trained (scare \nquotes because this is _far_ from a solid argument).\n\nThis last point supports the idea that the only way a small net can encode \na large training set is by exploiting real patterns in the data, which for \n&quot;deep&quot; enough data could only mean &quot;real&quot; concepts (location, velocity, \nchord structure).\n\nIt doesn&#39;t say anything about how hard it is to train, however :)\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\nAt 14:50 29/07/2004, you wrote:\n&gt;Is there some connection between his approach and Echo\n&gt;State Networks, perhaps?  One major difference is that\n&gt;ESNs are recurrent and Thaler&#39;s STANNO/Creativity\n&gt;Machine appear to be feed-forward.\n&gt;\n&gt;Tyler\n&gt;\n&gt;--- Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;       It was described in moderate detail in New\n&gt; &gt; Scientist sometime in the last\n&gt; &gt; few years.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Basically, it all stemmed from an attempt to study\n&gt; &gt; what happens to an ANN\n&gt; &gt; &quot;as it dies&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       E.g. he trained an ANN to do some sort of problem,\n&gt; &gt; I think the example in\n&gt; &gt; the article was reproducing musical phrases (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; from a limited treaining\n&gt; &gt; set?).  Then he studied the degrading behaviour of\n&gt; &gt; the net as its weights\n&gt; &gt; were damaged in some way (zeroed or randomised...?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       To his surprise, some of the outputs from the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;dying&quot; network were good\n&gt; &gt; phases representing &quot;improvisation&quot; on the training\n&gt; &gt; set.  But only some of\n&gt; &gt; them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       So his general approach is to take the output from\n&gt; &gt; a damaged network and\n&gt; &gt; feed it through another (healthy) network.  The\n&gt; &gt; damaged section produces\n&gt; &gt; variations on the basic data, and the healthy\n&gt; &gt; section screens them for quality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Obviously this is very vague, I&#39;ll try to find the\n&gt; &gt; original article, but\n&gt; &gt; since he&#39;s exploiting it commercially, the details\n&gt; &gt; there are not complete\n&gt; &gt; either...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       I don&#39;t think he uses a TWEANN approach, just the\n&gt; &gt; weights...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;       Ian Badcoe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms -\n&gt; &gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;__________________________________\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt;New and Improved Yahoo!
