I have\n&gt; finally accepted a tenure-track faculty position at the University\n&gt; of Central Florida in Orlando in the Dept. of Computer Science:\n&gt; www.cs.ucf.edu\n&gt; I am set to start in the Spring 2006 term, which begins in January.\n&gt; This will be a research-intensive position and I do plan on starting\n&gt; a research group there.  Annie Wu, a former student of John Holland,\n&gt; is also a prof there, so there will be two people there now in\n&gt; evolutionary computation.  There is also one of the biggest\n&gt; simulation and training labs in the country (meaning opportunities\n&gt; for applications).\n&gt;\n&gt; Obviously I only just accepted this job so I can&#39;t tell people a lot\n&gt; of details about getting into the program, etc., but a lot of people\n&gt; have noted that in America there are almost no places to go to study\n&gt; neuroevolution aside from UT Austin.  Therefore, I am hoping this\n&gt; will be a good development for the future of our field and give\n&gt; people another choice for studying and pursuing funded research in\n&gt; neuroevolution and artificial embryogeny.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
