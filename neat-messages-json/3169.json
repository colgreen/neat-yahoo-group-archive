I find it very interesting, especially \nsince I come from a non-research background.  It all seems to come down \nto, as Ken Says, semantics.\n\nIn one system, you&#39;re more closely modeling (what we understand to be) \nbiological systems; whereas, in another you sacrifice the biological \naccuracy for computing efficiency.\n\nIn either case, I believe you can solve the same set of problems.\n\nAnd, as I think you say here ...\n\n&gt; Note that a standard recurrent NEAT implementation can achieve the\n&gt; first case all on its own, whoever, with a single recurrent link from\n&gt; a neuron&#39;s output back to its input.\n\n... those variable time delays can indeed also be modeled by recurrent \nlinks.\n\nThanks,\nSteve\n\n\n"}}
