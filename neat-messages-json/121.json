Are you suggesting that we only\n&gt; inform\n&gt; the ANN of changes to the tablaeu of card?  \n\nYes, something like that.  I&#39;m suggesting that the\ninputs to the network each turn are only for the two\npositions on the tableau that it is &quot;choosing&quot;.\n\nFor example, with the following tableau:\n\n1  3  1\n3  2  2\n\nAs you suggested, you could either start out by\ninputting the values for two random positions, or you\ncould always start in the upper left corner.\n\nAnd let&#39;s stick with your binary representation.  The\nvalues of the cards could be represented by two input\nnodes:\n\nCard value of 1: 1 0\nCard value of 2: 0 1\nCard value of 3: 1 1\n\nTo represent an occupied space or not you only need\none input node:\n\nNo card present: 0\nCard present:    1\n\nTo represent the position on the tableau, you could\nalso use binary representation, e.g. with two rows and\nthree columns, as above, you could use:\n\nX1: 0 0\nX2: 0 1\nX3: 1 0\n\nY1: 0\nY2: 1\n\nUsing this representation scheme, you would have six\ninput nodes for each position on the tableau (2 for\nthe value of the card, 1 for whether or not there is a\ncard, 2 for the X coordinate, and 1 for the Y\ncoordinate), and you only need to input two tableau\npositions each turn, so your neural net only needs 12\ninputs.\n\nThe outputs would be the X and Y coordinates of the\nnext two positions to pick, so you would need a total\nof 6 outputs.\n \n&gt; This is a\n&gt; new idea; maybe it has merit.  \n\nWell, it&#39;s not really a new idea. :)\n\nCheck out the message archives for this forum.  See\nDarren Izzard&#39;s first message (#8), and the ensuing\n&quot;Shape Recognition&quot; thread.  Similar idea.\n  \n&gt; It seems like we\n&gt; would\n&gt; be increasing the memory burden, but maybe this\n&gt; would work.  \n\nYes, but that&#39;s exactly what you want to test, right?\n:)  It would be interesting to experimentally contrast\nthis representation scheme with one in which the\nentire tableau is input each turn.\n\n&gt; Do I understand you correctly now, that the idea is\n&gt; to tell the ANN all the changes that occur, instead\n&gt; of the current state of the table?\n\nNot precisely, but I think I&#39;ve explained it a little\nbetter now.\n\nThat&#39;s the basic approach, but the ANN could &quot;look at&quot;\na given position on the tableau more than once, so\nit&#39;s not as if it&#39;s restricted only to information\nthat is different each turn.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
