Even a 1D multiplexor is very interesting (e.g. a network \nwhich, given one input between 0 and 1, selects one of N other inputs as \nthe output [N being fixed and moderately large]).  A 2D multiplexor can be \nbuilt from N+1 1D multiplexors...\n\n\tIf, as I am just starting to suspect, you were just referring to one of \nyour averaging tests (was (1,1) - (9,9) the first test applied) then I \nthink you may have a point about the construction of your fitness \nfunction.  It may be that the step between your first and second fitness \nterms is too high.  Wasn&#39;t the first one average for the whole thing, needs \nno multiplexors and the second dome other average which does need \nmultiplexing?  The system cannot evolve up one of these &quot;cliffs&quot; unless \nthere are reasonably spaced steps all the way.  If your second term cannot \nstart giving a reward at all until after some multiplexor is achieved, then \nthat&#39;s probably too high a probability barrier.  Maybe if your second \nfitness term involved only a lower limit and only on one axis and only \nbetween two ordinate values (e.g if it required distinguishing (1,1) - \n(9,9) and (5,1) - (9,9)).  Then your third step could do the same thing on \nthe other axis....\n\n\tIan Badcoe\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
