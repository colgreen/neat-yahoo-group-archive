It&#39;s proceeding much faster now!\n\nI also took a long hard look at how MUCH enlargement I was asking of it.  \n16x is too much to ask it to try to learn on.  So I made a minor \nmodification that lets me first train it to do  2x.  Once it appears to be \nable to do 2x, I can up the expected amount of enlargement to 3x, 4x, 5x, \nand so on, until I max out forward progress.  That should make things \nprogress much faster.  But we&#39;ll have to wait and see if theory meets \nreality. :)\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
