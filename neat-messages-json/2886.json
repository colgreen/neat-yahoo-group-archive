I have been doing grad research in evolutionary computation\nfor three and a half years now at MSU on the Avida system. I have worked\nwith alife and GAs but have not yet done any real work in neural nets. I\nwould like to use generative representations (e.g. L-systems) to evolve\nneural nets for my dissertation, however, so I need to ramp up on neural\nnets.  \n\nFor the next three weeks I will be in Africa and would like to use any free\ntime there to learn as much as I can about neural nets. Is there any book\nthat you recommend I take? I won&#39;t have nearly any internet access, and will\noften not have my computer, so it would be good if the book does not require\neither of those. \n\nI also think better in sentences than equations, so a book that emphasizes\nmore of an intuitive logical explanation rather than mathematical\nformulation (when possible) would be ideal.\n\nAnd, of course, I have put off buying this to the last second so I don&#39;t\nhave time to order it online...but do have a Borders nearby and the many\nUniversity book shops.\n\nGiven all those qualifications, I&#39;m probably out of luck. But I figured if\nthere was something good out there this group would know of it.\n\nAny recommendations you have would be much appreciated.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab\njclune@...\n517.214.1060 (cell)\n\n\n\n"}}
