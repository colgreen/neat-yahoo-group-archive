I believe i=\r\nt works, but could do with testing by someone other than me.  If anyone is =\r\nup for that I can let them have the code.  Not sure when I will release thi=\r\ns, looking for a new job as I have been made redundant.

There is currently no Java v=\r\nersion of HyperNEAT, so others might be interested as well.  Do you have an=\r\ny experiments working in it?\n&gt; \n&gt; (I understand if it&#39;s not ready for that =\r\nbut I wanted to at least raise the possibility.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;JT&quot; &lt;skybro77@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I actually im=\r\nplemented HyperNeat in Java about a year ago. (I had some trouble understan=\r\nding what to do with ANJI and JNEAT too.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was designed to be ab=\r\nle to modify the number of hidden layers. It was my first Java project and =\r\nit was unnecessarily complicated. However, a large chunk of the code was po=\r\nrted from the original C++ HyperNeat. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s reusable with a bit tun=\r\ning (e.g. not mutating number of layers and their connection patterns.)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; If you want it, I will email you the code.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
