Of course I&#39;m talking\nabout the one you will find in the SailChallenge\nsoftware on the annevolve website.  That requires a\ncontroller to respond to the local environment and set\nthe sails and rudder.  An ANN that does that is\nincluded with SailChallenge.  You can just replace it\nwith yours.\n\nAn example of neuroevolution applied to creating such\nan ANN is found in the EvSail software.\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
