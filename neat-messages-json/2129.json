In your scheme, it seems possible that\n&gt;&gt;because there is no particular guard in place keeping any two\n&gt;&gt;individuals from mating, over time you might get more uniformity and\n&gt;&gt;convergence.  Not sure about this though, of course it depends on\n&gt;&gt;your parameters...but I wonder how things compare.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think he does have a partial guard, in that he selects mating pairs with \n&gt;a probability inversely based on their distance.  \n&gt;\nThis /sounds/ like it might have a significant performance overhead - on \nthe basis of  requiring more genome comparions than regular discretized \nspeciation. I&#39;m coming round to the idea though.\n\n\n&gt;But he may also be \n&gt;protected by a more natural mechanism, in that when the parents become too \n&gt;disparate, they will become &quot;infertile&quot; with one another and although the \n&gt;system may try to breed them, their offspring will all be of lower fitness \n&gt;than themselves.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTrue, but limited CPU means we can&#39;t rely on this sort of approach /too/ \nheavily. All of those bad genomes still need evaluating, and this is CPU \ntime that coud be better spent focused on mating genomes we know to be \nreasonably compatible. But I accept that we can adjust the probability \nof mating pairs at a given distance to achieve this with continuous \nspeciation - it&#39;s not a continuous vs discretized issue.\n\n&gt;A contradictory theory, observed in human &quot;attractiveness&quot; studies, \n&gt;suggests that there is a best degree of diversity to breed with.  When you \n&gt;see a member of the opposite sex who has a different genetic background and \n&gt;who seems very sexy in an exotic way, the theory is that person is just \n&gt;different enough that your sub-conscious tags them as a really promising \n&gt;mate. \n&gt;\nThis is an intersting point, right now if two genomes are identical then \nthey are very likely to get selected as mates - which obviously is not \ngoing to produce any useful offspring. So a new &#39;minimum-distance&#39; \nparameter sem like a good idea.\n\nActually I had another idea today whilst staring at a search that had \nstagnated...\n\nLooking at the list of species in SharpNEAT I could see that all species \nseemed to be stuck in a local peak in the fitness space. Now, when this \nhappens species will arrive at the species droppoff age and will be \ndropped from the population. Eventually the number of species will drop \nbelow the minimum species threshold and so to compensate (this is \nSharpNEAT but I think this is close to other implementations) the genome \ncompatibility threshold is lowered and this has the effect of splitting \nsome species.\n\nNow this depends on the fitness space, but it seems to me that it&#39;s \nlikely these new species will get stuck in the same local peaks, \nespecially if they are very deep and/or broad, since they are spawned \noff of species that are already stuck. Thus I was thinking that a pool \nof dead species (or a token genome from each, say the species champ) \ncould be kept and that we could implement some mechanism for avoiding \nthe area of the fitness space represented by these genomes - using the \ngenome compatibility function.\n\nI need to think through the specifics on this but it seems to make sense \nbecause it forces the search into new areas (or it could if implemented \nproperly). The problem is how do we ensure we generate new genomes that \nare sufficiently different enough from the dead species to go and \nexplore new areas of the search space? The answer may lie within the \nabove discussion(s).\n\n\n&gt; The idea is that people who are too similar don&#39;t bring your \n&gt;offspring any novel factors, and will even lead to more homozygous \n&gt;deleterious recessives. \n&gt;\nI&#39;ve never heard the Windsor&#39;s called that before.\n\n&gt; But people who are too different, will have \n&gt;(presumably minor) &quot;competing conventions&quot; problems and thus cannot so \n&gt;usefully &quot;merge their genetic and cultural differences&quot; with your own.  The \n&gt;Borg never mentioned that part, did they :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe borg are overrated IMO -  they were defeated by suggesting they take \na nap in the middle of a battle as I recall :)\n\nColin\n\n"}}
