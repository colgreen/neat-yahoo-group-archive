Any good research lab will have a very international\nworkforce and outlook, and the working language will be English.\nMyself, I speak English at work and (very bad) Italian in the\nsupermarkets...\n\nYou should only look at funded PhD positions that pay you a salary you\ncan live on. The way it works is that professors apply for grants for\nspecific projects from funding agencies, and if they obtain their\ngrant they employ the best person they can find as a PhD student or\npostdoc. Typically, it does not matter where you come from (though\nthere are exceptions).\n\nI did my MSc at Sussex as well, and while it is a good program, it is\nquite ALife-oriented.\n\nGood luck with your studies and research!\nJulian\n\n2008/8/12 Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;:\n&gt; Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d guess there are others in the group with similar questions so I\n&gt; think it&#39;s probably useful to the group. (By the way, by &quot;Adaptive\n&gt; Networks,&quot; I assume you are referring to adaptive neural networks?)\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, another option is the University of Texas at Austin,\n&gt; which is where I did my Ph.D. under Prof. Risto Miikkulainen, who has\n&gt; a leading group in the area:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://nn.cs.utexas.edu\n&gt;\n&gt; Another good lab is Prof. Jordan Pollack&#39;s DEMO Lab at Brandeis:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.demo.cs.brandeis.edu/\n&gt; http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~pollack/\n&gt;\n&gt; However, Jordan tells me that he will be renaming and revamping his\n&gt; lab soon, so it will no longer be called &quot;DEMO.&quot; However, it is\n&gt; undoubtedly still a good place to be.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some newer places too with groups led by new professors,\n&gt; including Prof. Bobby Bryant&#39;s &quot;Neuroevolution and Behavior\n&gt; Laboratory&quot; at the University of Nevada at Reno\n&gt; (http://nebl.cse.unr.edu/) and Prof. Josh Bongard&#39;s new group at the\n&gt; University of Vermont (http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~jbongard/).\n&gt;\n&gt; Prof. Hod Lipson at Cornell formerly worked with Prof. Pollack and\n&gt; runs the Cornell Computational Synthesis Lab:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://ccsl.mae.cornell.edu/\n&gt;\n&gt; However, that lab is a focused on emergent phenomena in general, with\n&gt; a broader scope than some of the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; One other important group is Prof. Dario Floreano&#39;s Laboratory of\n&gt; Intelligent Systems. This lab is in Switzerland, so I am not sure if\n&gt; it conducts its day-to-day work in English (it might), but in any case\n&gt; it is very prominent in the area:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://lis.epfl.ch/\n&gt;\n&gt; Not all these groups have an explicit focus on neural networks, but\n&gt; most have done some good work with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that any Ph.D. program in North America should be willing to\n&gt; support you financially if you get in.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;frayn.michael&quot; &lt;frayn.michael@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am about to head over to the University of Sussex (in Brighton,\n&gt;&gt; England) to do their MSc in Evolutionary & Adaptive Systems.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, as I am Canadian, the concept of doing a PhD there is a\n&gt;&gt; little daunting because of the cost. Unfortunately, I am not aware of\n&gt;&gt; many other Universities that would be interested in funding a PhD of\n&gt;&gt; such research focuses (let alone would be able to comprehensively\n&gt;&gt; support students along the way). This assumes, of course, that my MSc\n&gt;&gt; is wildly successful and I come up with a research question worthy of\n&gt;&gt; funding.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyhow, I was hoping that some of the members here might be able to\n&gt;&gt; point out other Universities (in North America or English-speaking\n&gt;&gt; Europe) that may be appropriate to do such a PhD in. These are the\n&gt;&gt; ones I&#39;m familiar with now:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; University of Edinburgh\n&gt;&gt; University of Sussex\n&gt;&gt; University of Central Florida\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I realize this isn&#39;t directly related to NEAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\n&gt;&gt; a more knowledgeable group on the subject matter a hand. If there is a\n&gt;&gt; more appropriate group, then please just point me in the right\n&gt;&gt; direction and I&#39;ll not post about this again here. Apologies if it&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; too off-topic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
