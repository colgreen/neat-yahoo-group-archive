Interesting\nstuff.  The basic approach to the &quot;roving eye&quot; makes\nsense...so does the way you implemented it.\n\nI have a couple of questions, though.\n\nWhat was the initial position of the eye at the\nbeginning of its turn?  Did it begin where it was\npositioned at the end of the last turn, or does it\nalways start from a set position (e.g., the center)?\n\nI notice that both the 5x5 and 7x7 roving eye players\nform a vertical border down the center of the board as\neffective strategies.  How would they react if the\nplay from GnuGo was transformed rotationally?\n\nIs it possible the eye players are just memorizing a\nsequence of moves against GnuGo?  GnuGo plays\ndeterministically, right?  Is the roving eye robust\nenough to adapt if GnuGo plays slightly different from\ngame to game (e.g., rotating the board, slightly\nrandomizing its play)?\n\nI&#39;ve found, just experimenting with Tic-Tac-Toe, that\nANNs evolved against deterministic players are very\nbrittle.  Ones evolved against semi-random players\ntend to be more robust in general.  \n\nThe roving eye networks were composed of 30 inputs and\n5 outputs.  That means an initial minimal toplogy of\n185 genes, correct?  (35 nodes + 150 connections.) \nYou used a fairly low node mutation rate (0.0045) and\nan add-connection mutation rate of (0.1).  What were\nthe sizes of some of your champion networks?  \n\nAnyway...interesting stuff.  Thanks for sharing the\npaper ahead of the conference.  It seems like a\npotentially very fruitful approach.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
