It suggests that lun=\r\ng cells know to become\n\nlung cells based on the air passing back and forth =\r\nover them. It is\n\nintriguing in the context of HyperNEAT because it shows t=\r\nhat sometimes\n\nnature does not use geometric position (provided by complex =\r\nprotein\n\npatterning) to make differentiation decisions, but uses environmen=\r\ntal cues.\n\nOf course, HyperNEAT could create the same end product just with=\r\n positional\n\ninformation, but it might be easier to accomplish this with si=\r\nmple\n\nenvironmental- based tricks like this one. Thoughts?\n\n\n\nNew Scientist=\r\n\n\nBreath of fresh air transforms stem cells\n\n\n\n14:32 09 November 2009 by An=\r\ndy Coghlan\n\nFor similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide\n\nMimickin=\r\ng the environment experienced by cells in the windpipe is enough to\n\ntransf=\r\norm stem cells into a range of different lung cells. Such &quot;physical&quot;\n\ntechn=\r\niques could be used to create specialised tissues when growth factors\n\nalon=\r\ne aren&#39;t enough.\n\n\n\nLindsey Van Haute of the Free University of Brussels (V=\r\nUB) in Belgium and\n\ncolleagues spread human embryonic stem cells onto a por=\r\nous membrane. The\n\ncells were fed from beneath by nutrients and from above =\r\nby a fluid that\n\nencouraged them to multiply. Removing two chemicals from t=\r\nhe growth fluid\n\nkickstarted differentiation.\n\n\n\nFour days later, the team =\r\nremoved the fluid covering the cells, leaving them\n\nopen to the air while s=\r\ntill being sustained and supported from below, as\n\nthey would be in the tra=\r\nchea. After 24 days the cells had developed surface\n\nproteins that identifi=\r\ned them as specific types of lung cell, including\n\nalveolar cells, which al=\r\nlow the exchange of gases, and cilia, which expel\n\nbacteria and dirt.\n\n\n\nPh=\r\nysical influence\n\n\n\n&quot;Our study proves differentiation into lung cells is in=\r\nfluenced by physical\n\nforces,&quot; says Van Haute. Previously, stem cells have =\r\nbeen made to\n\ndifferentiate into lung cells using a cocktail of different g=\r\nrowth factors,\n\nbut Haute says using physical forces might be simpler.\n\n\n\n&quot;=\r\nPhysical forces are certainly a factor in getting the lung lining to be\n\nfu=\r\nlly functional,&quot; says Anne Bishop at Imperial College London, who has made\n=\r\n\nalveolar cells from mouse stem cells using growth factors alone. &quot;But I fi=\r\nnd\n\nit difficult to believe that raw stem cells would differentiate through=\r\n to\n\nthese uncommon types of cells solely in response to physical forces.&quot;\n=\r\n\n\n\nHaute&#39;s team plans to use the cells they created to study lung diseases,=\r\n\n\nsuch as cystic fibrosis. Such cells might one day be used to treat people=\r\n\n\nwith damaged lung tissue, but only if the cells can be made from a person=\r\n&#39;s\n\nown tissue. This could be done by converting the cells first into induc=\r\ned\n\npluripotent stem cells.\n\n\n\nJournal reference: Respiratory Research, DOI=\r\n: 10.1186/1465- 9921-10-105\n\n\n\nCheers,\n\nJeff Clune\n\n\n\nDigital Evolution Lab=\r\n, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\nwww.msu.edu/ ~jclune\n\n\n\n\n\n    =\r\n\n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
