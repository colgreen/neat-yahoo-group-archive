(whic=\r\nh is represented by the division) moot.\n\nIf you try situations where specie=\r\ns have different sizes you should \ndiscover quite different results.\n\nken\n\n=\r\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi, I t=\r\nhought I understood the basics of calculating adjusted \nfitness\n&gt; sharing f=\r\nor NEAT, but find I need some more clarification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose we have a po=\r\npulation with 100 members.\n&gt; \n&gt; Species A has 5 members with unadjusted fit=\r\nnesses of (say)\n&gt; 20,14,16,20,30\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I right in assuming that the adjus=\r\nted fitnesses are just the\n&gt; averages ie\n&gt; 4,2.8,3.2,4, 6   with a total ad=\r\njusted fitness for that species of \n20?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If yes... then species B , =\r\nalso with 5 members but unadjusted\n&gt; fitnesses of twice\n&gt; the above\n&gt; 40,28=\r\n,32,40,60  , with a total adjusted fitness for that species \nof 40\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAllocating offspring by adjusted fitness would give 2 times more \nto B\n&gt; th=\r\nan A which makes sense, except the same could be achieved by just\n&gt; adding =\r\nthe unadjusted fitness levels without needing to average\n&gt; withing species,=\r\n which is where I&#39;m confused. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve looked at the papaers and FAQ, whi=\r\nch has some info on this, \nbut I\n&gt; can see where I would be going wrong by =\r\njust summing the unadjsuted\n&gt; fitness (eg in the above example B has 200 , =\r\nA has 100 , so B still\n&gt; gets twice as many offspring as A).\n&gt;
