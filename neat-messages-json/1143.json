It turns out \n&gt; this is very hard to do, and most domains turn out to have a limit \n&gt; to how much intelligence can help after a certain point.  Such \n&gt; domains are called &quot;open-ended,&quot; and designing them to be truly \nopen-\n&gt; ended is perhaps as hard as AI itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;t_bommel&quot; &lt;t_bommel@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; hey,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; has anyone created a simulation of considerable complexity like \n&gt; ken&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; robot dual domain and let it run for very long period of time \nlike \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; million generations to see what kind of strategies evolve? i was \n&gt; just \n&gt; &gt; kinda curious to know how far competative co evolution could go. \n&gt; &gt; anyway thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; timmy\n\n\n"}}
