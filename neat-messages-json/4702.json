They report that the best\nalgorithms for setting experimental parameters=\r\n greatly improve performance\nvs. humans picking their own values.\n\nIt might=\r\n be interesting to turn the best in class algorithm loose on NEAT or\nHyperN=\r\nEAT, and see what parameters are chosen (and then see how much these\nresult=\r\ns generalize to different problem domains). At a minimum, these\nalgorithms =\r\nmay help you if you are looking to truly optimize whatever\nproblem you are =\r\nworking on.\n\nComparing Parameter Tuning Methods for Evolutionary Algorithms=\r\n. Smit and\nEiben. CEC 2009.\n\nAbstract:\nTuning the parameters of an evolutio=\r\nnary algorithm (EA) to a given problem\nat hand is essential for good algori=\r\nthm performance. Optimizing parameter\nvalues is, however, a non-trivial pro=\r\nblem, beyond the limits of human\nproblem solving. In this light it is odd t=\r\nhat no parameter tuning algorithms\nare used widely in evolutionary computin=\r\ng. This paper is meant to be\nstepping stone towards a better practice by di=\r\nscussing the most important\nissues related to tuning EA parameters, describ=\r\ning a number of existing\ntuning methods, and presenting a modest experiment=\r\nal comparison among them.\nThe paper is concluded by suggestions for future =\r\nresearch =E2=80=B9 hopefully\ninspiring fellow researchers for further work\n=\r\n\nPS. I can send you the paper if you email me.\n\nPPS. I talked to A. E. Eibe=\r\nn, one of the authors, about the fact that\nautomating\nthe process seems on =\r\nthe surface to contradict my PLoS Computational Biology\npaper result that e=\r\nvolution is\nbad at managing its own parameters. While we had a very long ch=\r\nat about\nThat result in general, which I will not recount, the apparent con=\r\ntradiction\nis resolved when\none realizes that here evolution is not managin=\r\ng its own parameters during\nthe run, but only choosing good settings to hav=\r\ne fixed throughout the run.\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Mi=\r\nchigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
