There&#39;s a user guide available on \nthe NEVT website, which is also included in the .zip distribution.  \nIt should be able to walk you through using the package.\n\nWhen you unzip it, you&#39;ll find four directories:\n\n/complexity\n/fitness\n/network\n/species\n\nThese correspond to the four types of graphical output that NEVT \nproduces.  Each directory contains the style sheet, DTD, and a sample \nXML file.  Just look at the XML file and DTD for the type of \ngraphical output you want to produce and make sure your XML conforms.\n\nHopefully over the next few months, with some feedback, we can settle \non good standard formats for the XML output.  Even if they&#39;re \nslightly different, it is fairly simple to convert one XML format to \nanother with XSL, and I don&#39;t mind helping people out with this.\n\n&gt; Thank you for nevt!\n\nNo problem.\n\nI know some people are reluctant to have to deal with new \ntechnologies, but there&#39;s not a lot that needs to be learned to use \nthese tools.  We were just trying to create a good, platform-\nindependent set of graphing tools to keep others from having to spend \ntime and energy coding that stuff for their implementations.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
