How are you generating them?\n&gt; \n&gt; Perl module GD::Graph.  Works pretty well, and is pretty easy to \nuse.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s a definite rise in the current fitness graph, seems to be\n&gt; &gt;levelling off at the momement though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yep.  That happened last time, too.  Then as the current champions \nbecome \n&gt; stagnant and die off, all that is left are the less fit members, \nand so the \n&gt; max fitness graph could angle back downward for a time.\n\n\n"}}
