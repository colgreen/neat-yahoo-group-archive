I went back and reread\nKen&#39;s pape=\r\nr &quot;A Taxonomy for Artificial Embryogeny&quot;\n(http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.=\r\nphp?PubID=3D121), which is a very nice\npaper. I was specifically wondering =\r\nabout the suggestions at the end\nof the paper, regarding benchmarks for AE =\r\nsystems, such as:\n\nEvolution of:\n\n--Pure symmetry (e.g. bilateral symmetry)=\r\n\n--Specific shapes (e.g. rings, stars, and trees)\n--Specific connectivity p=\r\natterns (e.g. for neural networks)\n--Simple controllers (e.g. for double po=\r\nle balancing)\n\nKen goes on to say:\n\n&quot;Such benchmark comparisons will eventu=\r\nally make it possible to\npredict the performance\nof AE systems based on the=\r\nir location in the taxonomy. For example, one\nbenchmark might be to evolve =\r\na five-pointed star. This benchmark can\nbe attempted\nwith a system in which=\r\n all the dimensions of development are fixed\nexcept the cell\nfate dimension=\r\n. That dimension can vary from using only prepatterning\nto using every\nconc=\r\neivable form of fate determination, from stochastic\nself-organization to si=\r\ngnaling,\nmigration, and proliferation. The results can be measured using\nse=\r\nveral criteria: How\nfast does the objective shape evolve? How often and how=\r\n many genes are reused by\nthe solution genome? Is symmetry used, or is each=\r\n point in the star\nspecified by a separate\nsection of genetic code=97that i=\r\ns, is there emergent modularity? For\nevery possible\nsetting on the varying =\r\ndimension (e.g., cell fate determination), data\nwill be available\nfor compa=\r\nrison.&quot;\n\nThis sounds like a great idea. I&#39;m wondering, though...what kind o=\r\nf\nresponse has this generated? Have there been any follow up papers on\nAE s=\r\nystems that have tried to apply such benchmarks in a systematic\nway?\n\nHave =\r\nthese types of benchmarks been systematically applied to the 2D\nrepresentat=\r\nions evolved using HyperNEAT?\n\nI also noticed rereading Sims 1994 paper tha=\r\nt he displays hand-coded\nexamples of recognizable morphologies such as a pr=\r\nimate hand, a\nhumanoid form, and a tree structure. But I&#39;m wondering if and=\r\n/or how\neasy such structures arise using his encoding when starting from a\n=\r\nsimple core structure and either using artificial selection or a\nfitness fu=\r\nnction tailored to evoke similar structures.\n\n--Derek\n\n"}}
