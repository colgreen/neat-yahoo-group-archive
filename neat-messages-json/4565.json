Thanks for sharing your paper. \nThe p=\r\nroblem that rtNEAT requires a high level of interaction indeed\nconstrains t=\r\nhe types of scenarios in which it can be effective.  If\nthe NPCs don&#39;t get =\r\nenough interaction, the evaluation is impoverished.\n Thus there is clearly =\r\na challenge when a single player is the only\nfocal point of interaction.  H=\r\nowever, if that single player is is in\ncontrol of a set of agents, each one=\r\n of which is a point of\ninteraction, I think there is hope that the net int=\r\neraction can be\nsufficient.  However, the balance is delicate and the speci=\r\nfics of the\ngame obviously become important.  Your paper makes a good point=\r\n by\nhighlighting this issue and showing that it needs to be considered in\nt=\r\nhe game design if real-time evolution is to be successful.\n\nken\n\n--- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;g.yannakakis&quot; &lt;yannakakis@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI thought the following might be of interest to some of you. \n&gt; \n&gt; We recen=\r\ntly presented a paper at the IEEE Computational Intelligence\n&gt; and Games 20=\r\n08 symposium where NEAT and rtNEAT are used to dynamically\n&gt; adjust the cha=\r\nllenge level of a real-time strategy game.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the article:\n&gt; http=\r\n://www.itu.dk/~yannakakis/cig08_1.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; In a few words, NEAT worked just=\r\n fine in generating diverse NPC\n&gt; behaviors like &#39;win-fast&#39; and &#39;produce-ma=\r\nximum-numbers-of-warriors&#39;.\n&gt; rtNEAT, on the other hand did not perform tha=\r\nt well and that fast due\n&gt; to insufficient interaction in the RTS game unde=\r\nr investigation. \n&gt; \n&gt; Comments and feedback are more than welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; Georgios\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
