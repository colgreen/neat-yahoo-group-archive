Additionally, methods from\n&gt; computational=\r\n intelligence promise to have a big impact on game\n&gt; development, assisting=\r\n designers and developers and enabling new types\n&gt; of computer games. The 2=\r\n010 IEEE Conference on Computational\n&gt; Intelligence and Games brings togeth=\r\ner leading researchers and\n&gt; practitioners from academia and industry to di=\r\nscuss recent advances\n&gt; and explore future directions in this quickly movin=\r\ng field.\n&gt;\n&gt; Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the follow=\r\ning:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Learning in games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Coevolution in games\n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0* Neural-based approaches for games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Fuzzy-based approaches fo=\r\nr games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Player/Opponent modeling in games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* CI/AI-based=\r\n game design\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Multi-agent and multi-strategy learning\n&gt; =A0 =A0* =\r\nApplications of game theory\n&gt; =A0 =A0* CI for Player Affective Modeling\n&gt; =\r\n=A0 =A0* Intelligent Interactive Narrative\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Imperfect information=\r\n and non-deterministic games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Player satisfaction and experience =\r\nin games\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Theoretical or empirical analysis of CI techniques for =\r\ngames\n&gt; =A0 =A0* Comparative studies and game-based benchmarking\n&gt; =A0 =A0*=\r\n Computational and artificial intelligence in:\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o Video=\r\n games\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o Board and card games\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o E=\r\nconomic or mathematical games\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o Serious games\n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o Augmented and mixed-reality games\n&gt; =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0o G=\r\names for mobile platforms\n&gt;\n&gt; The conference will consist of a single track=\r\n of oral presentations,\n&gt; tutorial and workshop/special sessions, and live =\r\ncompetitions.
