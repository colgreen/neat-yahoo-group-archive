That is\n&gt; &gt;something to be aware of since it will look really\n&gt; bad if you\n&gt; &gt;knowingly got into a conference with no intention\n&gt; of showing up.  If\n&gt; &gt;that causes problems for you, you may want to\n&gt; consider the journal\n&gt; &gt;option.\n&gt; \n&gt; Damn!  I half suspected that, but was ignoring it :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I never was great one for attending conderences,\n&gt; even when I wasn&#39;t \n&gt; going to have to pay the costs myself (getting\n&gt; invited to speak is \n&gt; somehow different, I did a fair bit of that as part\n&gt; of liaiaiaiaising \n&gt; with academia when I was in game R&D).\n&gt; \n&gt; Have these people never noticed the Internet and how\n&gt; you generally \n&gt; never need to leave you armchair for anything short\n&gt; of reproduction \n&gt; these days.  Actually, given the choice, I _would_\n&gt; leave the \n&gt; armchair, I&#39;d take the PC out onto the moors, but\n&gt; have you tried \n&gt; finding a broadband network connection half-way up a\n&gt; millstone \n&gt; tor?  One day though....\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, the simplest solution for me would be if\n&gt; I had a \n&gt; collaborator who was in academia.  Maybe my friend\n&gt; at the U of \n&gt; Sheffield would be interested, I&#39;ll ask him....\n\n\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nYahoo!
