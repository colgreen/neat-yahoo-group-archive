If you know your opponent is suboptimal, \nit is\n&gt; &gt;always beneficial to know that they are suboptimal, and even \nmoreso to\n&gt; &gt;know their particular weaknesses so that you can exploit them.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This is an  important aspect to consider, especially going forward \n&gt; looking at other more complex games. In fact it&#39;s absolutely \ncrucial for \n&gt; some (most?) types of game. At this point in time though I favour \n&gt; factoring out this aspect of gameplay by assuming no knowledge of \nan \n&gt; opponent. Given this stipulation what is a perfect player?  A \nperfect \n&gt; player must assume that the opponent is strong, and therefore must \nplay \n&gt; defensively whilst trying to keep winning lines open as a \nsecondary goal \n&gt; only - and only making a winning move if the opportunity arises.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evaluating against defensive players will only give defensive \nplayers at \n&gt; best - they won&#39;t know to make a winning line if the opportunity \narises, \n&gt; except out of pure luck maybe. So a perfect player (with no \nopponent \n&gt; knowledge) is defensive but also knows how to win, thus a range of \npoor \n&gt; to good strategies need to be represented during evaluation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
