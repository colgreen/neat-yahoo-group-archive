My name is Tyler Streeter.  I am a master&#39;s student \n&gt; in Human Computer Interaction at Iowa State University.  \n\nHiya,\n \n&gt; Last fall in an AI class I began working on a project that I called \n&gt; Autonomous Virtual Humans.  This involved creating a simulated human \n&gt; body in a physical environment (using Open Dynamics Engine), \n&gt; controlling the human with a neural network, and training the neural \n&gt; network to perform certain behaviors (standing and jumping) with a \n&gt; genetic algorithm.  This page has more details about what I did last \n&gt; fall and what I&#39;m currently doing: \n&gt; www.vrac.iastate.edu/~streeter/avh.html\n\nI personally saw your work when you announced it on the ODE list. I&#39;ve \ndone some physics simulations with NEAT and ODE - you can read about it \nhere:\n\nhttp://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/Evolved/\n\n&gt; I would love to get feedback from anyone who is interested (and has \n&gt; a Windows machine; Linux version coming later, btw).  I am planning \n&gt; to continue this work as my master&#39;s thesis next year, so I will be \n&gt; working on it for quite a while.\n\nWhat kind of comments are you looking for? Except - it sounds really \ncool? ;)\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n\n"}}
