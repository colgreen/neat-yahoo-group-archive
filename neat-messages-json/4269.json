Unfortunately, I am not aware of\nmany other Universit=\r\nies that would be interested in funding a PhD of\nsuch research focuses (let=\r\n alone would be able to comprehensively\nsupport students along the way). Th=\r\nis assumes, of course, that my MSc\nis wildly successful and I come up with =\r\na research question worthy of\nfunding.\n\nAnyhow, I was hoping that some of t=\r\nhe members here might be able to\npoint out other Universities (in North Ame=\r\nrica or English-speaking\nEurope) that may be appropriate to do such a PhD i=\r\nn. These are the\nones I&#39;m familiar with now:\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nUnive=\r\nrsity of Sussex\nUniversity of Central Florida\n\nI realize this isn&#39;t directl=\r\ny related to NEAT but I couldn&#39;t think of\na more knowledgeable group on the=\r\n subject matter a hand. If there is a\nmore appropriate group, then please j=\r\nust point me in the right\ndirection and I&#39;ll not post about this again here=\r\n. Apologies if it&#39;s\ntoo off-topic.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
