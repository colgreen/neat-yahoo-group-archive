It works fine, and now I&#39;m trying to use image\ninput. \n&gt; Right now the input is small-ish - 30 x 50 = 1500. I generated one \n&gt; random genome, and am using that as the starting genome file. Now\nI&#39;m \n&gt; getting OutOfMemory errors. Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Reuben\n\n\n\n\n"}}
