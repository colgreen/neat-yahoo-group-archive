If there&#39;s waste at the end, there \n&gt; was waste throughout.\n&gt; \n\nWhile this is true, I think the important point is the opposite: \njust because there is a nice final topology does not mean that you \ndidn&#39;t waste a lot of time on overly complicated ones along the way.\n\nYour point, i.e. that an imperfect final topology implies an \nimperfect search, is true as well, but doesn&#39;t really say anything \nthat people weren&#39;t already saying.  What people didn&#39;t talk about \nbefore was my point above, that just because their final XOR network \nlooks pretty doesn&#39;t mean they have a good algorithm.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
