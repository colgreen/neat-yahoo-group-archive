A quick point in the\n&gt; right direction would be helpful.\n&gt;\n\nNot sure if this is what you mean but the evolved networks that are\nrecurrent aren&#39;t resolved in any way at all. What happens is that an\nactivation scheme is required to use them, some simple schemes would\nbe:\n\nA) Activate for some fixed number of iterations.\nB) Activate until the network is relaxed. E.g. until the change in\noutput value of all nodes is within some threshold.\nC) (A) but with the fixed number of activations determined by\nanalysing the network and calculating its maximum depth, such that we\ncan get at least some signals all the way from the input nodes to the\noutputs.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
