I&#39;m\nguessing that a mixture of intuition, experience, and tinkering were\nhow Ken arrived at many of the parameter settings he recommends for\nvarious domains...though if he had a more concrete approach, I&#39;d\ncertainly like to hear it too.\n\nI&#39;ve heard people toss around the idea of making such parameters\nsubject to mutation as well, but I haven&#39;t seen it really implemented,\nand I&#39;m not sure it&#39;d be such a great idea.\n \n&gt; What, aside from a solution, are\n&gt; the variables to look for when evaluating the quality of a run?\n\nWell, we&#39;ve experimented in game domains and now image recognition,\nand well before a network in our population finds a solution, what\nwe&#39;re looking at are the min, max, and mean fitness for each\ngeneration.  We&#39;re looking for an increase in each of those\nindicators.  In fact, even if the max fitness is not increasing, but\nthe mean is, that&#39;s usually a good sign, since the overall population\nis improving, and we&#39;ll usually subsequently see improvement in max\nfitness.  What we *don&#39;t* want is flatness in all three, for many\ngenerations.\n\nWe also look at the variability in fitness between generations.  If\nthe max fitness is fluctuating wildly (e.g., between 50% and 90% max\nfitness each generation), then our evaluation is probably too noisy.\n\nOther factors we try to keep tabs on have to do with population and\nspeciation dynamics.  We generally want to see a split of the\npopulation into several different species relatively early in the run,\nbecause we want to be exploring different parts of the solution space.\n We also want to monitor turnover in the population, make sure that\nspecies that aren&#39;t holding their own go extinct, that new species\narise, and that new champions take the place of old ones.\n\nWe use SVG-based visualization tools to monitor this stuff:\n\nhttp://nevt.sourceforge.net/\n\nThough the speciation visualization doesn&#39;t really capture the\ninformation we want very well.  If you generate data in an XML format\nsimilar to what we and Colin use, you can use these tools.  Or you can\nbuild your own visualization stuff...either way, I think it&#39;s\nimportant to have visualization of important features to track\nprogress during runs, and to do post-run analysis.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
