You could look at one row\nor column as an input vector and step the network through cycles looking at\nconsecutive columns/rows.  Of course, this implies a greater network\ncomplexity, but it&#39;s a different approach if you&#39;re trying to cut down on\ninputs...may be interesting anyhoo.\n\nNow someone else can say why this is a crazy idea :)\n\nBest,\n\njeff\n\nOn Fri, 09 Sep 2005 23:08:00 -0000, Carl Strange wrote\n&gt; I kicked around a few ideas for a project, many getting wildly out of\n&gt; hand, and settled on Braille character recognition.  It let me play\n&gt; with a bit of development while using your OCR experiment as a\n&gt; framework.  I thought the reduced 7 X 5 input grid and very distinct\n&gt; character set would be a snap for the network.  Now I know better. \n&gt; Thirty-five inputs and twenty-six outputs is too much for a one-to-\n&gt; one connected net so the problem isn&#39;t trivial.  I&#39;m having fun playing\n&gt; with the various search parameters, especially the frequency of &quot;add\n&gt; connections&quot; and &quot;add nodes&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The downside of adding an experiment is my SharpNEAT library and some\n&gt; of the Form1 initialization differ from the standard release.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lots to play with and I haven&#39;t even looked at the network code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carl\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
