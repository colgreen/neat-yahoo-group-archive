Can you expand it a bit?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sure. Assuming you did use a cut-off of +-0=\r\n.2 (or so) then I&#39;m\n&gt; suggesting that this may be a disadvantage to HyperNe=\r\nat because it\n&gt; cannot express connection weights in the +-0.2 range - beca=\r\nuse they\n&gt; get zeroed. If it is a significant disadvantage then perhaps som=\r\ne of\n&gt; the advantage of HybrID is due to it&#39;s adjusting some of the\n&gt; conne=\r\nctions weights (zeroed or otherwise) into the +-0.2 range.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nColin,=\r\n that&#39;s an interesting point.  However, I believe the rule in the HyperNEAT=\r\n implementation is that if the CPPN outputs a number greater than 0.2, then=\r\n the connection weight is scaled from the range [0.2..max] to [0..max].  In=\r\n other words, it can produce weights below 0.2 after all because it is scal=\r\ned to the full range.  However, I&#39;d need to make sure that is actually what=\r\n the implementation Jeff is using does, but I think it&#39;s correct.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
