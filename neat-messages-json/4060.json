My understanding\nis NEAT =\r\nonly uses sigmoid.\n\nAlso, my eventual goal is to evolve an agent in a singl=\r\ne time frame,\nsay daily, then create a role which uses weekly, daily, and h=\r\nourly\nagents in much the same way as the recent multi-agent paper discussed=\r\n.  \n\nYou are correct the geometric regularity is not as strong as the\ntypic=\r\nal robotic examples, but I was intrigued by HN&#39;s ability to\nscale.  I will =\r\nlook into NEAT by itself though.\n\n--Todd\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pet=\r\nar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I don&#39;t understand wh=\r\nat does HyperNEAT to do with it. Unless you \n&gt; believe there is some geomet=\r\nric regularities in those time series \n&gt; there is no point to use HyperNEAT=\r\n. Try regular NEAT first.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
