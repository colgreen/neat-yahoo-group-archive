With the introduction of evolved virtual creatures (or \nEVCs) by Karl Sims in 1994, a new source of creature content became \navailable. Despite their immediate appeal, however, EVCs still lag far \nbehind their natural counterparts: Neither their morphology nor their \nbehavior is sufficiently complex. This dissertation presents three \ncontributions to address this problem. First, the ESP system, which \ncombines a human-designed syllabus with encapsulation and \nconflict-resolution mechanisms, is used to approximately double the state \nof the art in behavioral complexity for evolved virtual creatures. Second, \nan extension to ESP is presented that allows full morphological adaptation \nto continue beyond the initial skill. It produces both a greater variety \nof solutions and solutions with higher fitness. Third, a muscle-drive \nsystem is demonstrated to embody a significant degree of physical \nintelligence. It increases morphological complexity and reduces demands on \nthe brain, thus freeing resources for more complex behaviors. Together, \nthese contributions bring evolved virtual creatures, in both action and \nform, a significant step closer to matching the entertainment value of \ncreatures from the real world.\n\n"}}
