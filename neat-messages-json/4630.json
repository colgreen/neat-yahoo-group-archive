One reason is to =\r\npromote the work of those outside our own EPlex research group.  There is n=\r\now a fair amount of significant work on HyperNEAT from outside EPlex and it=\r\n is difficult for someone interested in HyperNEAT to find out about it from=\r\n our own publications pages, which only features our own work.  Therefore, =\r\nthe HyperNEAT Users Page has a section called, &quot;HyperNEAT Projects and Publ=\r\nications from Outside EPlex,&quot; which features this outside work.\n\nIf you wou=\r\nld like your work featured on this page please let me know and we will be h=\r\nappy to link it.  It does not have to be an official publication.  Software=\r\n, experiments, or informal documents are also welcome.\n\nAnother reason for =\r\nthe page is to have everything about HyperNEAT available in one place.  Bef=\r\nore this page, there was no clear destination for people searching for &quot;hyp=\r\nerneat&quot; in search engines.  This page will help people find what they are l=\r\nooking for in an organized manner.\n\nFinally, we hope the page makes it easi=\r\ner for newcomers to get started.  It has a brief introduction explaining th=\r\ne main concepts at a high level and some pictures that give the gist of the=\r\n approach without having to read a whole research article.  \n\nComments are =\r\nwelcome,\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
