I don&#39;t mind at all you=\r\n saying that you think Sims creatures are just as natural. I&#39;m actually qui=\r\nte interested in hearing the community&#39;s opinions on this front, whatever t=\r\nhey are. We purposefully did not take a stand on whether we have matched/be=\r\nat Sims. Instead, our point was simply that adding the degrees of freedom w=\r\ne did and evolving with CPPNs shows promise that may, with future work, ena=\r\nble the community to produce organisms that obviously surpass Sims. I defin=\r\nitely think we are not &quot;obviously&quot; better yet, which should be a goal of ou=\r\nr field. \n\nYour question about why the creatures are not more regular one i=\r\ns an interesting one that I myself have been puzzling over since the beginn=\r\ning of this project. I originally expected that we&#39;d get creatures like tho=\r\nse from EndlessForms.com that walk around. As you point out, though, the cr=\r\neatures in this paper are not nearly that symmetric (either bilaterally or =\r\nradially). There is clearly a lot of regularity, especially compared to the=\r\n direct encoding (as Ken points out), but not nearly as much as in EndlessF=\r\norms and Picbreeder. My current leading hypothesis as to why is very simila=\r\nr to Ken&#39;s, which is why our next step is to repeat the work with diversity=\r\n algorithms like MOLE and NS+LC (novelty search + local competition). \n\nAs =\r\nfor when different types of symmetry evolved in nature: a lot of that is ad=\r\ndressed in Raff&#39;s book &quot;The Shape of Life&quot;, which Ken recommended to me lon=\r\ng ago. \n\nThanks again for your comments. I look forward to seeing your evol=\r\nved creature work when it comes out. \n\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nAssistant=\r\n Professor\nComputer Science\nUniversity of Wyoming\njeffclune@...\njeffcl=\r\nune.com\n\nOn Apr 14, 2013, at 11:50 AM, Derek James &lt;djames@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 13, 2013 at 4:00 PM, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Derek, nice to see you back.

That kind of very explicit objective encourages piecewise kind o=\r\nf improvement, i.e. if I add some idiosyncratic element to my body and it m=\r\nakes me just a bit faster, that element will get rewarded and tacked on to =\r\nmy lineage forever. In addition, if I discover some kind of overarching reg=\r\nularity like bilateral symmetry, it will not be retained unless it immediat=\r\nely significantly improves my gait. So I&#39;d speculate that you&#39;d see more re=\r\ngularity with some kind of behavioral and/or morphological diversity pressu=\r\nre (like novelty search, novelty search with local competition, or some kin=\r\nd of multiobjectivization like MOLE) rather than just pushing only for fast=\r\ner and faster walkers, because diversity pressures can reward and hold onto=\r\n overall changes in organization even if they don&#39;t immediately lead to imp=\r\nrovements in ambulation. Of course, the authors acknowledge this issue them=\r\nselves in their discussion as well, so it&#39;s clearly already on their minds,=\r\n but certainly interesting to look at in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; That certainly ma=\r\nkes sense. It raises the question of how bilateral symmetry arose in biolog=\r\nical organisms. Maybe this has been brought up on the list before, but is t=\r\nhere a good source to paleontology studies that estimates when bilateral sy=\r\nmmetry arose and whether or not it might have been a result of piecewise im=\r\nprovement (i.e. gradualism) or some dramatic jump in the search space (i.e.=\r\n punctuated equilibrium)? Maybe this just isn&#39;t well understood. I don&#39;t kn=\r\now the literature on this at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if we&#39;re explicitly evolving w=\r\nalkers/crawlers/swimmers is it really much of a cheat to go ahead and enfor=\r\nce a high degree of bilateral symmetry in the phenotypes, since we know fro=\r\nm biological organisms all the benefits that come with it? It would seem fi=\r\nne to do that if our goal is just to evolve really fast, really efficient m=\r\novers. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail=_00148F9B-1D5D-49A1-9723-648F6B46BE1B\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=windows-1252\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html charset=\r\n=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-=\r\nmode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; ; font-family: &#39;Times&#39;;=\r\n font-size: 14px; color: rgb( 0,  0,  0); &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Ti=\r\nmes&#39;; font-size: 14px; color: rgb( 0,  0,  0)&quot;&gt;Hello Derek,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Thanks for your comments on our work.

Maybe this just isn&#39;t well und=\r\nerstood. I don&#39;t know the literature on this at all.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Also, if we&#39;re explicitly evolving walkers/crawlers/swimmers is it real=\r\nly much of a cheat to go ahead and enforce a high degree of bilateral symme=\r\ntry in the phenotypes, since we know from biological organisms all the bene=\r\nfits that come with it? It would seem fine to do that if our goal is just t=\r\no evolve really fast, really efficient movers.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br class=3D&quot;webkit-block-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n   =\r\n \n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group email --&gt;\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--Apple-Mail=_00148F9B-1D5D-49A1-9723-648F6B46BE1B--\r\n\n"}}
