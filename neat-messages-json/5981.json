I think the discussion here is very fruitfu=\r\nl. Indeed I did forgot that you made a control experiment where geometry co=\r\nuld not be exploited. \n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune  wrote:\n&gt; =\r\nThis discussion raises the larger question of whether you could have truly =\r\ntemporal problems that did not require spatially distinct processing stream=\r\ns\n\nMaybe I misunderstand here something, but a truly temporal problem would=\r\n be any kind of sequence learning (e.g. navigation, episodic memories, moto=\r\nr skills)?! Learning of information that have a temporal order, comparing s=\r\nequences, recognizing sequences. The area that has been associated with the=\r\nse kinds of tasks is the hippocampus with its areas dental gyrus, ca3 and c=\r\na1. Information are processed along those three areas but each area returns=\r\n also feedback to the entorhinal cortex (which in turn connects to the cort=\r\nex). The hippocampus has been implicated in many different functions (depen=\r\nding on the species in which it is observed) but maybe common to all proble=\r\nm domains of the species that have a hippocampus is the fact that it has so=\r\nmething to do with sequence learning. \n\nGiven the fact that the anatomy of =\r\nthe hippocampus is very well conserved across evolution it seems to me that=\r\n the hippocampus is an excellent example, that spatial properties of biolog=\r\nical neural networks can also be exploited to solve temporal problems. Its =\r\nmodular structure seems to play crucial role here.\n\nFor more see: http://ww=\r\nw.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16881079\n\n&gt; As such, even if our technique did no=\r\nt encourage modularity for simple problems where no separate processing str=\r\neams are required, it probably is still important for most (all?) complex p=\r\nroblems.  \n\nIn this context I was wondering whether it could be helpful to =\r\nmeasure the ratio between the current number of edges in a network and the =\r\nnumber of edges that have to be removed in order to have a modular network.=\r\n Maybe, this ratio could help to provide an analytical solution for the que=\r\nstion how likely it is that modularity emerges in larger networks. \n\nBest,\n=\r\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
