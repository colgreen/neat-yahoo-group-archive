Can you find in the code where the=\r\n mutate_add_link and mutate_add_node methods are called?  You should be abl=\r\ne to see the condition it is checking to decide whether to call them.  That=\r\n will tell you if the variable in question is the only factor in the condit=\r\nion.  If it is, then it is possible that the variable itself is not being r=\r\neset properly through the GUI, which you can check by outputting the variab=\r\nle when the condition is checked.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, John=\r\n Lisco &lt;jlisc0@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello NEAT group,\n&gt; I&#39;ve\n&gt; been working with=\r\n jNeat and I&#39;ve come to a bit of confusing output, so\n&gt; Nate Kohl pointed m=\r\ne this way. Anyways, what happened was I was messing\n&gt; with the constants i=\r\nn the GUI, and running the test runs to see the\n&gt; kind of networks became c=\r\nhampions and such. So I set mutate_add_link\n&gt; and mutate_add_node both to 0=\r\n.0, and watched the champion view. To my\n&gt; surprise, I got some fairly comp=\r\nlex networks.\n&gt; I believe it was logical to expect the networks to all be i=\r\ndentical\n&gt; structure to the initial structure. Is something wrong with the\n=\r\n&gt; testing, or did I miss something?\n&gt; Thank you for your time.\n&gt; Sincerely,=\r\n\n&gt; =A0 John Lisco\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
