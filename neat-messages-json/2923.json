Basically, for XOR, im \nassuming the output values c=\r\norresponed to &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; (&lt;0.5 or &gt;=3D \n0.5), and I am now making that m=\r\nore precise, and interpreting a value \nbetween 1 and 10. \nI am getting fair=\r\nly encouraging results with this, during a run, I \nwill get several values =\r\nwhere 3 of the numbers are right, but I never \nget the full 4 number soluti=\r\non. \nI cant be sure that the 3 numbers are not just being generated by \ncha=\r\nnce. The fitness values that are being generated dont seem to be \nstarting =\r\nsmall and then gradually getting closer and close to the \ngoal, they seem t=\r\no be just random. \n\nId just like to know if Im on the right track or not. I=\r\n see that XOR \ndoesnt seem to do anything else with the network itself, jus=\r\nt the \ninputs, and the evaluation/fitness function, but it also only needs =\r\n\nand on/off output, do I need to do something different for an output \nfrom=\r\n 1 - 10? \n\nI understand this is probably a painfully simple problem, but th=\r\neres \na hell of a lot of code to get my head around here, and its quite \nha=\r\nrd to figure out where and how the XOR specific code interacts with \nthe NN=\r\n, and that interacts with the Genetic Algorithm. \n\nThanks a lot for any adv=\r\nice,\n\nJack. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
