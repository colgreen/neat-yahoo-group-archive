Please see below for more specific responses.\n\nAt Tue, 24 Fe=\r\nb 2009 14:03:11 -0500,\nJeff Clune wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interesting work!\n&gt; \n&gt; Than=\r\nks Vinod! \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; &gt; perform=\r\n on this domain.  The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; &gt; evolved, =\r\nand the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\n&gt; &gt; year&#39;s GEC=\r\nCO are available here:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;      http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modula=\r\nrne\n&gt; \n&gt; I read your paper when you posted it last year. I think it is very=\r\n\n&gt; interesting work. In particular, I think it is cool that you can produce=\r\n all\n&gt; of these different types of gaits.\n\nThanks!  The different gaits are=\r\n a consequence of the coupled cell\nsystem formalism, which predicts those g=\r\naits.\n\n&gt; I do not get that kind of variety with\n&gt; HyperNEAT, but I think th=\r\nat is because I am only using one fitness function\n&gt; (speed) and the two ga=\r\nits I get reliably may simply be faster than the other\n&gt; types of gaits.\n\nI=\r\nf you set up the substrate as I suggested so that it represents a\ncoupled c=\r\nell system, then HyperNEAT may also be able to produce those\nother gaits.\n\n=\r\n&gt; Why do you think you do not see a collapse down to a single\n&gt; fastest gai=\r\nt type in your work? Is it because you bias them so strongly to\n&gt; one type =\r\nof gait (in each setup) that they cannot override that bias and\n&gt; choose a =\r\nfaster gait? \n\nMy fitness function is also speed (distance travelled in one=\r\n minute of\nsimulated time), and it is the same for all cases.  I observed p=\r\nronk,\nbound, and trot in different runs using the same experimental setup\nb=\r\nut different random seeds.  I think it is because these three gaits\nhave ro=\r\nughly the same speed for the robot morphology and experimental\nconditions I=\r\n used.  However, I observed pace only when I changed other\nexperimental par=\r\nameters, including the maximum joint angular velocity\nthat the controller c=\r\nan produce (you can see that the legs move slower\nfor the pace gait in the =\r\nvideo).\n\n&gt; If so, that is a cool and interesting results, so I am\n&gt; merely =\r\nasking out of curiosity and not as a criticism. It is good to be able\n&gt; to =\r\nget these systems to produce the types of gait we want in addition to\n&gt; sim=\r\nply producing fast gaits.\n\nI agree, that would be useful.  The types of gai=\r\nts that are possible\nare determined by the coupled cell system.  For exampl=\r\ne, the walk gait\nof a quadruped in which legs move a quarter period out of =\r\nphase is not\npossible in the coupled cell system I used in the GECCO paper.=\r\n  Thus,\nwe can restrict the set of possible gaits by selecting a suitable\nc=\r\noupled cell system.  However, I don&#39;t think it is always possible to\nfind a=\r\n coupled cell system that can produce only one given gait.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I wonder i=\r\nf I selected for certain slower speeds, or if I selected for\n&gt; energy effic=\r\niency, if I would get different gaits that are more commonly\n&gt; seen in natu=\r\nre. It would be a cool experiment to try.\n\nYes, that would be an interestin=\r\ng experiment to run.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of curiosity, how would you label these two =\r\ngaits?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think of this as pronk:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/sites/dev=\r\nolab.msu.edu/files/HyperNEAT_medianFitness_1\n&gt; .mpeg\n\nYes, that looks like =\r\na pronk.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; and this as gallop:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://devolab.msu.edu/sites/devola=\r\nb.msu.edu/files/HyperNEAT_bestIndividual_\n&gt; 1.mpeg\n\nI disagree for this one=\r\n.  In the above gait, it looks like three legs\nare synchronous and the four=\r\nth leg is of opposite phase.  In contrast,\nin gallop, none of the legs are =\r\nsynchronous and they hit the ground at\ndifferent times.  See the following =\r\nwikipedia page for horse gaits\n\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait\n\n=\r\nor the following paper (pages 434--435) for phases of legs in\ndifferent gai=\r\nts\n\n  S. V. Shastri. A biologically consistent model of legged locomotion\n =\r\n gaits. Biol. Cyber., 76(6):429--440, 1997.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it looks like a g=\r\nallop because to me it looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F=\r\nile:Muybridge_race_horse_animated.gif\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With only minor adjustments to=\r\n your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; &gt; substrate configuration to represent =\r\nnon-linear oscillators.  In fact,\n&gt; &gt; you would get a configuration similar=\r\n to my modular controllers by\n&gt; &gt; restricting the network inputs to just th=\r\ne joint angles and producing\n&gt; &gt; angular velocities instead of angles as ou=\r\ntputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those changes alone would make them non-linear oscillators? But=\r\n the only\n&gt; change you mention is reducing the number of inputs. How would =\r\ntaking out\n&gt; some of the inputs (the touch sensor, the pitch, roll, yaw and=\r\n sine) change\n&gt; my system to possess non-linear oscillators? Or do you mean=\r\n that there are\n&gt; other &#39;minor adjustments&#39; that need to be made? If so, wh=\r\nat would\n&gt; they be?\n\nI also mentioned changing the outputs from desired ang=\r\nles to desired\nangular velocities, and that is actually the crucial change =\r\nnecessary\nto represent a coupled cell system.  Removing the touch, pitch, r=\r\noll,\nyaw, and sine inputs is not crucial.  They are also not necessary in\np=\r\nrinciple, if you make the above change to the interpretation of\noutputs.  I=\r\n suggested removing them only to make the system simpler\nand therefore perh=\r\naps easier to evolve.  See my previous reply to Ken\nfor a description of ho=\r\nw this change would allow the substrate to\nrepresent a coupled cell system,=\r\n and therefore generate gaits.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; How would you describe my system? Do I=\r\n have linear-oscillators? Or\n&gt; linear-non-oscillators? Please forgive me if=\r\n these are na=EFve questions, but\n&gt; I am very interested in learning the pr=\r\noper terminology for this\n&gt; field.\n\nYour system is non-linear because of th=\r\ne sigmoid squashing function in\nthe network.  However, I don&#39;t think the sy=\r\nstem is an oscillator in\nthe sense that it generates oscillations because y=\r\nou are driving the\nsystem with an external oscillatory signal.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hype=\r\nrNEAT would then\n&gt; &gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand=\r\n.  I think that\n&gt; &gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if succe=\r\nssful would\n&gt; &gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think =\r\nI am missing something. Reducing the number of inputs would not\n&gt; suddenly =\r\nobviate the need for the sine wave.\n\nLet me know if my previous explanation=\r\ns have not yet clarified this\npoint.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, I do think it woul=\r\nd be an interesting experiment to see\n&gt; whether HyperNEAT can produce the g=\r\naits you obtained, but I think whether\n&gt; that occurs is related to the fitn=\r\ness function issue I raised above.\n\nI agree that the fitness function can i=\r\nnfluence the gaits produced.\nEven in the coupled cell system formulation, i=\r\nt would be interesting\nto design fitness functions that select some gaits o=\r\nver others from\nthe set of gaits allowed by the dynamics of the system.\n\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; BTW, did you find that\n&gt; &gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, an=\r\nd touch) were necessary to\n&gt; &gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFor the setup in the paper, such information increased performance (althoug=\r\nh\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t call the extra information necessary, as the experiments wit=\r\nhout\n&gt; such information still evolved coordinated gaits, just slower ones).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I did experiments with and without PRY (pitch, roll and yaw) and the\n=\r\n&gt; performance was better with PRY inputs. I also ran experiments with and\n&gt;=\r\n without the touch information and found that the touch information helped.=\r\n\n&gt; Oddly, and to my disappointment, I found that these results depended on\n=\r\n&gt; other aspects of the system. For example, when I used a different period =\r\nfor\n&gt; the sine wave, and the gaits were thus different (e.g. much faster an=\r\nd more\n&gt; frantic), it was no longer the case that the PRY and touch informa=\r\ntion\n&gt; helped. As such, the system does seem to be somewhat chaotic and the=\r\nrefore\n&gt; general statements such as &quot;PRY inputs help&quot; are unjustified.  I d=\r\non&#39;t fully\n&gt; understand why that is the case, although I have some ideas.\n&gt;=\r\n \n\nThat&#39;s interesting to know, but I don&#39;t have an explanation for the\nresu=\r\nlts you observed either.\n\nVinod\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your questions and comment=\r\ns.\n&gt; Jeff\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
