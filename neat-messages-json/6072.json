I read it already, when you put it=\r\n on arxiv, but great to see that it is now published as a reviewed paper. I=\r\n think you very nicely demonstrated in the abstract and more concrete model=\r\n how evolvability can evolve without following any adaptive pressure. I rea=\r\nlly like how Ken and you investigate these fundamental principles in easy t=\r\no understand simulations. And I am a bit proud to say that the insights of =\r\nthis paper are already included in my Artificial Development lecture. :-) \n=\r\n\nSince you opened a thread for this paper I would like to use this opportun=\r\nity to ask a question that came to my mind, when I read it the first time:\n=\r\n\nFrom your simulations, one could falsely conclude that evolvability can an=\r\nd will increase infinitely (which is not a criticism on your paper, because=\r\n this was not the focus of your study). However, too much evolvability woul=\r\nd decrease the robustness in a genotype-phenotype mapping (e.g. the ability=\r\n to canalize), which possibly means that evolvability only increases to a c=\r\nertain extent. Following this perspective, I was wondering whether in actua=\r\nl fact *diversity* is inevitable while evolvability in species will show a =\r\nceiling effect?\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;joel278&quot; &lt;leh=\r\nman.154@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ken Stanley and I are pleased to annouce our new ar=\r\nticle, &quot;Evolvability is Inevitable: Increasing Evolvability without the Pre=\r\nssure to Adapt,&quot; which was published today in PLoS ONE. The paper can be vi=\r\newed at: \n&gt; \n&gt; http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062186\n&gt; \n&gt; The art=\r\nicle applies both abstract simulations and neuroevolution to explore a non-=\r\nadaptive explanation for increasing evolvability in nature. Interestingy, u=\r\nnderstanding evolvability (the capacity to further evolve) might lead not o=\r\nnly to better understanding how complex organisms evolve in nature, but may=\r\n also provide insight into how to design evolutionary algorithms that are b=\r\netter able to evolve complex artifacts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most existing theories for evo=\r\nlvability increase depend upon particular selective scenarios, such as a sp=\r\necies surviving through constantly changing environments. However, the insi=\r\nght in the article is that evolvability can instead arise spontaneously wit=\r\nhout natural selection acting at all. The main idea is that if evolvability=\r\n is heritable, then evolvable organisms separate themselves naturally from =\r\nless evolvable organisms over time simply by their children becoming increa=\r\nsingly diverse and thereby spreading further through the space of possible =\r\nphenotypes. That is, the space of phenotypes itself can act like a filter t=\r\nhat distinguishes evolvability.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this way, when novel phenotypes app=\r\near in the future, they are most likely descendents of those that were evol=\r\nvable in the past. The result is that evolvable species accumulate over tim=\r\ne even without selective pressure. This idea is supported by a variety of s=\r\nimulations where evolvability increases without any pressure for organisms =\r\nto out-compete each other.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those familiar with novelty search will not=\r\nice some conceptual parallels with Ken&#39;s and my previous work on searching =\r\nwithout objectives. Like novelty search, the proposed non-adaptive hypothes=\r\nis for evolvability may invite some controversy because adaptive explanatio=\r\nns for evolvability are intuitive and widely-held. For example, researchers=\r\n often worry about what kind of selective pressure will lead to evolvabilit=\r\ny, even in discussions in this group. One implication of this work could be=\r\n that such worrying is unwarranted because the best way to get evolvability=\r\n may sometimes be to stop trying to select for it. In any case, despite any=\r\n potential controversy, we hope that this alternate perspective leads to co=\r\nnstructive discussion and demonstrates the need to question the assumption =\r\nthat evolvability requires particular selective scenarios for it to increas=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; Joel\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
