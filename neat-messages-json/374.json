If you have a winning move, make it (if more than\none exists, make the first you find)\n2. If opponent has a winning move, block it (if more\nthan one exists, block the first you find)\n3. If the center is open, play there\n4. If your opponent makes a forking move, in opposite\ncorners with your piece in the center, play a random\nedge to threaten.\n5. Play in a random corner.\n6. Play on a random edge.\n\nSo does a player that follows this rule base play\n&quot;optimal&quot; Tic-Tac-Toe (if &quot;optimal&quot; is defined as\nwinning if at all possible, and playing to a tie when\nnot)?\n\nIn looking around, I found another student paper that\ndefined optimal play as never losing, much like\nJoseph&#39;s paper.  But a rule set for such a player\nwould not necessarily resemble the rule set above.  It\nwould primarily be concerned with blocking winning\nmoves and preventing opponent forks (moves which\ncreate two possible win threats).\n\nKen suggested testing a perfect player by constructing\nall possible game states, and making sure the neural\nnet player makes an optimal move for each possible\nboard configuration.\n\nBut how to you determine what optimal is, without\nempirical tests?\n\nWhen I put two Random players against each other, the\nresults fall out like this:\n\nPlayer 1 wins: 45%\nPlayer 2 wins: 45%\nTies: 10%\n\nWhen I play a &quot;Best&quot; player, using the rule set above,\nagainst a Random player, I get:\n\nBest wins: 90%\nRandom wins: 0%\nTies: 10%\n\nIs there a way to mathematically determine the correct\nratio of W/L/T between an optimal player and a random\none?\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
