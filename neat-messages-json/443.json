I think it might make more sense\nfor\n&gt; &gt;you to use the scheme you describe except instead of trying to make\n&gt; &gt;specific decisions about what &quot;type&quot; something is, try to assign\nthem\n&gt; &gt;a meaninful fitness number, so NEAT can then take those and do\nthings\n&gt; &gt;the way it likes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, what I mean is to be able to utilize NEAT&#39;s decision-making\nprocess \n&gt; to help determine when further evaluations will no longer contribute\nto the \n&gt; outcome of the next generation, at which point further calculations\nare just \n&gt; wasted energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s an idea.  Suppose the Epoch code of NEAT were broken up into\nparts \n&gt; (if it isn&#39;t already).\n&gt; \n&gt; // pseudo-code...\n&gt; Epoch()\n&gt; {\n&gt;     IdentifyBreedingSpecimens();\n&gt;     NextGeneration();\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, existing experiments that call Epoch() still work the same as\nthey \n&gt; currently do.  But other experiments could call the \n&gt; IdentifyBreedingSpecimens() code directly.  Suppose that code just\nsets a \n&gt; flag to true for all those that will be reproducing, and false for\nthose \n&gt; that will not.  Then, it returns the number of specimens whose flag\nchanged \n&gt; during the course of evaluation.  Thus, it is a non-zero value any\ntime the \n&gt; list of who is selected for reproduction changes.  Then the\nexperiment can \n&gt; use that value to help it know when it has performed &#39;enough&#39;\nevaluations to \n&gt; have &#39;adequate&#39; fitness values and is ready to move on to the next \n&gt; generation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Example:\n&gt; \n&gt; steady = 0;\n&gt; do {\n&gt;     GetNextSample();\n&gt;     EvaluateNetworks();\n&gt;     if ( IdentifyBreedingSpecimens() )\n&gt;         steady = 0;  // something changed...keep evaluating\n&gt;     else\n&gt;         steady++;\n&gt; } while ( steady &lt; 10 )\n&gt; NextGeneration();\n&gt; \n&gt; My guess is that mine is not the only domain where this kind of\nthing might \n&gt; be handy.  Any sufficiently large domain would probably benefit. \nWhat do \n&gt; you think?\n&gt; \n\nI&#39;m not sure I&#39;m understanding this idea correctly; can you go into a\nlittle more detail on what makes IdentifyBreedingSpecimens() true? \ni.e. how do you know you have &quot;enough&quot; information to start breeding?\nAnd if there is some criteria for this concept of enough, then why not\njust apply the criteria directly to your fitness spread instead of\ncalling NEAT?  It seems that NEAT could just be called after you&#39;ve\ndetermined you have enough info.\n\nThe thing I&#39;m not understanding is that NEAT just takes the top n% of\neach species and lets them reproduce.  So no matter how many\nevaluations you do or what the results are, NEAT will always choose\nthe same # of parents.  It&#39;s true that perhaps in some cases too many\nnetworks will have the same fitness, but in that case NEAT will just\nchoose an arbitrary group as the mating pool.  So I&#39;m not sure how\nthis fits into your idea that you will somehow accumulate a mating\npool incrementally?  Note also that different species are allowed to\nproduce different amounts of offspring, i.e. offspring are assigned on\na per-species basis.\n\nAlso note that you can&#39;t really make reproduction decisions without\nall the fitness info, since the final fitnesses are adjusted by the\nsize of their respective species.  So the fitnesses are shared.  So if\nyou tried to decide who is going to reproduce before fitness sharing,\nyou would not get the benefit of fitness sharing.\n\nSorry if I may be misunderstanding- it&#39;s possible I&#39;m answering the\nwrong question!\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
