I don&#39;t\nhave any experience in this realm, but I guess I always assumed that the\nmore inputs, the harder the problem.\n\nShouldn&#39;t it be rather easy for neural nets to ignore 0s? I mean, a 0 input\nmultiplied by any link value is 0..so it has no effect on the neuron it is\nconnected to. Right?\n\nCan you expand on your intuitions behind thinking that doubling the input\nspace is the best way to go?\n\nChristian- \nAre you sure that your problem works ok even without this missing data\nproblem? Is it a problem that you could try to run just on the subset of\ndata that have no missing holes, just to see if it can do the task? This is\nakin to trying a simple version of the problem to see if it works...in order\nto rule out that your problem is not more upstream.\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sun, 16 Nov 2008 22:15:53 +0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] unassigned input values for Neural Net\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Christain,\n&gt; \n&gt; I would do as you suggested and double up the number of input neurons.\n&gt; If however it&#39;s always the same 50% that have no input, and they are\n&gt; missing the input at the same time then you could just have one input\n&gt; that indciates that that group of input data is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n\n\n\n"}}
