They \n&gt; have experience in trying to publish without ac=\r\nademic affiliation, \n&gt; so they may be able to give you some perspective.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that the main barrier to independent publishing in research is \n&gt;=\r\n not lack of affiliation.  In my opinion, it is style.  \n\nYes, I think Ken =\r\nis probably right here.  If you really want to \npublish, as with any kind o=\r\nf writing, it&#39;s important to be well-read in \nthe literature, and to be fam=\r\niliar with the approach and style, as well \nas with previous research.\n\nWe =\r\nsubmitted a couple of papers to journals, and I think one of our big \nprobl=\r\nems was simply lack of depth of knowledge in a particular area.  \nWith all =\r\nof these issues, it helps if you have an advisor of some sort, \nsomeone who=\r\n *has* published, to critique and help you improve your work.\n\nPart of our =\r\nproblem honestly was access to some of the literature.  I&#39;m \na student now =\r\nat UL Lafayette, and I have free access to just about any \njournal article =\r\nI want to read.  I was limited to what I could find \nfreely through CiteSee=\r\nr or Google Scholar before.  Books were not a \nproblem, but journal article=\r\ns definitely were.  And now I also have \nthat critical infrastructure of pr=\r\nofessors who have published who can \nprovide me critical feedback.\n\nSo whil=\r\ne I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible to publish outside the academic \nframework,=\r\n there are definitely a number of issues that make it more \ndifficult.\n\nDer=\r\nek\n\n\n\n\n"}}
