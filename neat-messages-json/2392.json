So the ANN is mappin=\r\ng x directly to y.\n&gt;\n&gt; I decided to experiment with an alternative techniqu=\r\ne whereby there is\n&gt; no input and I use the ANN as a sort of wave generator=\r\n. I activate the\n&gt; network and take a reading and repeat this as many times=\r\n as I want. I\n&gt; can then match the outputs against an expected output and h=\r\nopefully\n&gt; evolve ANNs that can generate a continuous wave form.\n&gt;\n&gt; This d=\r\noes seem to work to some extent, e.g. I can evolve sine wave\n&gt; generators e=\r\nasily enough, and a square wave approximation has a lot of\n&gt; rough edges an=\r\nd noise but the overall shape is there. So I decided to\n&gt; try something a b=\r\nit more challenging, specifically the Mackey-Glass\n&gt; series, which can be m=\r\nade to generate a chaotic waveform. Here&#39;s were I\n&gt; noticed the first probl=\r\nem.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I use a low sampling rate then the output from the series rises =\r\nand\n&gt; falls within just a few activations of my ANN&#39;s and they can do a\n&gt; r=\r\neasonably good job of tracking the function over short periods (I\n&gt; haven&#39;t=\r\n tried anything too long yet). If however I increase the sampling\n&gt; rate th=\r\nen there may be many activations between rises and falls, but the\n&gt; kind of=\r\n small networks that I start out with when I initiase a run have\n&gt; a very f=\r\nast oscilaltion rate (or high natural frequency) due to their\n&gt; small size =\r\nand compact interconnections. I suppose I could try and start\n&gt; with a popu=\r\nlation of pre-built networks with a lower oscillation rate,\n&gt; but I don&#39;t t=\r\nhink this is a solution for the general case where a\n&gt; function may have ma=\r\nny different harmonics.\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway to give you an idea of the kind of resul=\r\nts I&#39;ve been getting\n&gt; here&#39;s a link to a graph showing a short section of =\r\na mackey-glass\n&gt; waveform in black and an approximation in red. The trainin=\r\ng data is\n&gt; shown on the first third of the graph up until the black line d=\r\nrops to\n&gt; zero, the remaining two thirds show the network&#39;s response beyond=\r\n the\n&gt; training data.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://tinypic.com/fdhssg.png\n&gt;\n&gt; The graph shows=\r\n the network generating a fairly regular output that\n&gt; roughly matches the =\r\nblack line, but there is no or very little matching\n&gt; of the subtle variati=\r\nons. The low-res approximations I tried were\n&gt; generally better matching wa=\r\nveforms.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
