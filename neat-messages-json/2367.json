I was a little disappointed to discover\n&gt;that their format was restricted to board state evaluations at a 1-ply\n&gt;depth search.\n\n         They are planning more complex entries, but they haven&#39;t \nfinalized he format for them yet.\n\n&gt;   Why not just recieve the board state and return a\n&gt;suggested move?\n\n         I guess the problem with this is what language would you be \nusing then they tried to pass you the data.\n\n         I did try to start a project called REACTS, quite a while \nago now, where the idea was to provide a system to abstract the \ncommunication problem away from the user and allow miscellaneous \nprogram formats to enter the same competition, but I didn&#39;t get \nenough support so I shelved it.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
