Computatio=\r\nnal overhead for development of the LRC is expended once,\nii. Computational=\r\n overhead for LRC hypothesis model selection is low,\niii. Computational pro=\r\ncess for development of the LRC is well understood,\niv. There is no good re=\r\nason to re-invent the wheel, corresponding to the cost of evolving rudiment=\r\nary performance equivalent of the LRC in NN formative elements,\nv. LRC inte=\r\nrior non-linear terms are available for complexification, and therefore do =\r\nnot require evolutionary development from NN formative elements,\nvi. The ge=\r\nneral truism, that it is usually easier/faster/quicker to modify and improv=\r\ne something that is in-the-ballpark, than start from scratch.\n\nAndy\n\n\n"}}
