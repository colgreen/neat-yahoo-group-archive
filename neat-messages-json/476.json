How many generations did\n&gt; you run, what was your pop size, and did you get a chance to look at\n&gt; the winning structure at all?  One thing that&#39;s also always useful \nto\n&gt; check is that the number of species is reasonable over the \nrun...huge\n&gt; explosions of species, or lack of species, can indicate a problem.\n\npopsize was 150. The first few easy tasks were solved within the \nfirst dozen generations - which is behaviour I had witnesses before. \nFollowing that a plateau was reached after about 150-200 generations.\n\nThe number of species hovered around 40 to 70.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you give a little more info on what you mean by &quot;amalgamate\n&gt; matching innovations per generation?&quot;  I thought you meant \nrefreshing\n&gt; the recorded list of innovation numbers each generation, but then \nwhen\n&gt; you ask whether I do this in the initial population as well, I&#39;m not\n&gt; sure what you mean?  \n\nSorry, amalgamate isn&#39;t the right word. Yeh I did mean the refreshing \n(normalizing?) of the innovation ID&#39;s per generation. I currently \ngenerate a random population by linking each output to a single, \nrandomly chosen input. My innovation ID&#39;s are being incremented \nduring this phase - so yeh, I need to change this.\n \n&gt; As far as elitism, keep in mind each species should have its best\n&gt; member copied (as opposed to only the best in the population).  It\n&gt; definitely should make a positive difference in performance, \nassuming\n&gt; your species are not too small.\n\nThinking about thia again I realise that what I said isn&#39;t 100% \ncorrect. What I actually do is pure roulette wheel selection - but \nthen the offspring get added to the existing population (therefore \nincreasing it&#39;s size by 2x). I then cull the least fit 50%. So in \neffect I have implemented elitism - but the fittest individuals are \nnot guaranteed to be selected for reproduction. This final point is \nwhat I&#39;m intending to change.\n\n&gt;  Also, you should probably be using a\n&gt; dynamic speciation threshold if you are running more than 50\n&gt; generations or so.  If you don&#39;t know how to do this, let me know.\n\nok, i&#39;ll add it to the list and get back to you if I get stuck.\n \n&gt; On more question, is your prey domain animated so you can watch the\n&gt; solutions?\n\nyes, I have a seperate program that can load in a given network and \nanimate it. I hope to integrate visualization such as this more \nclosely in the long run - this is just a quick hack really.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
