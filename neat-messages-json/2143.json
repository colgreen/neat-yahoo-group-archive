We theorised that we would know \n&gt;when we had driven the system far enough, if when we released it, it did \n&gt;not fall back into the same optimum...\n&gt;\n&gt;Of course, you could then chase the new optimum as far as was constructive, \n&gt;decide to drive away from it was well, and find you had got into a cycle \n&gt;where you ended up back in the original one.\n&gt;\n&gt;BUT...\n&gt;\n&gt;What if we kept exemplars of previous successful species in a list such as \n&gt;you were using for your TTT fitness assessments.  Then we could drive away \n&gt;from all of them during the EE-phase...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nTo limit CPU overhead we should try to keep this list as short as \npossible, on the other hand there may be scenarios where there are a lot \nof local optima and thus we need to track of all of them. One idea then \nis to keep adding local optima to the list as species die, but instead \nof arbitrarily removing items from the end of the list (after a number \nof gens or whatever) we thin out the list by removing local optima that \naren&#39;t anywhere near any of the current population.\n\n&gt;The other take I considered on the same thing was to wonder whether one \n&gt;could formulate a modification of the molecular energy function (c.f. \n&gt;fitness function) that would specifically remove one minimum (peak) from \n&gt;the landscape.  Obviously not in the general case but since we are \n&gt;designing that function ourselves...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nI think this is what Greg was getting at. Right now I favour tracking \nthe species threshold, e.g. if it was at least 30 for the whole lifetime \nof a species that died, then one can summise that there aren&#39;t any \n(easily found) good genomes within distance 30 of the center of that \nspecies(assuming the center didn&#39;t move too much). Therefore the easiest \nthing to do is to test all new genomes before evaluation proper, and if \nthey are within range of a &#39;dead-spot&#39; then just allocate them a zero \n(or very low) fitness without wasting time evaluating them fully.\n\nThis approach could generate &#39;volcanoes&#39; within the fitness space, and \nnew genomes will then tend to cluster on the rim of volcanoes. Of \ncourse, after time the species on the rim will die and form another \n&#39;crater&#39;. Eventually the whole area of the original peak will be one big \ncrater and the search will drift off into other areas. This however may \ntake some time especially if you consider that I would favour increasing \nthe species drop-off age to ensure we had more fully explored an area \nbefore we declared it as a no-go zone. So perhaps measuring new genomes \npropensity to move back to the local optima would be a way of \nshort-cutting this lengthy process, e.g. if the whole of the  new \nspecies is at distance 30.1 from teh old local optima then we can \nsummise that they are on the edge of it&#39;s rim and that we should \nincrease it&#39;s radius.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
