So let&#39;s say you get a spec, what exactly do you do next?\n\nWe parse the spec and turn it into basically a state machine that we can \nfeed inputs (player moves) to and read outputs (new game state) from. Also \nwe set up helper functions that can be used to generate all valid moves \nfrom a certain game state. Finally we extract some relevant information \nabout the kinds of things that can constitute the game state, and use that \ninformation to fix the input layer size of our neural nets.\n\n&gt; Do you get to change some code around or add a new fitness function or\n&gt; perhaps sensor/output combos appropriate to that spec?  Or is it\n&gt; completley plug and play and you have a totally generic architecture?\n\nCompletely plug and play, we get a spec, and weeks later :P once evolution \nis done we have some players.\n\nSo one of the cool things about the system is that there are already a lot \nof games for it, and once we release our GDL-&gt;NEAT bridge it should be \nusable with really any NE system.\n\n&gt; Interesting, thanks Charles.  So if you get a novel game and right\n&gt; away need to play it with no prior experience, how can an\n&gt; evolutionary system be prepared for that?\n\nThe short answer is coevolution. A game has a certain number of players. \nWe establish populations for each player and let them have at each other \ncoevolutionarily. Since we don&#39;t know what game we will be learning before \nhand, this seems like the most obvious approach. Of course, there are tons \nof tricky details using coevolution (in particular I don&#39;t know of any \nresearch offhand that coevolves more than two populations simultaneously), \nbut we&#39;re making progress.\n\n&gt; Are you trying to evolve a single neural network that can play any game?\n\nNo, for now we&#39;re just evolving from scratch every time we receive a new \nspecification. One of the interesting research issues that comes up in GGP \nthough is whether or not we can use some cool developmental systems jazz \nto evolve an &quot;embryo&quot; player which is an optimal starting genome for any \nkind of game (encapsulating information that is useful for a broad range \nof human-designed games). The idea is that we obtain the embryo by playing \nall the games, and then specialize it later to play a specific game. Its \nreally unclear how this can be done, but thats what makes it such an \ninteresting research problem.\n\nDoes that clear everything up?\n\nJoe\n\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii\n\n"}}
