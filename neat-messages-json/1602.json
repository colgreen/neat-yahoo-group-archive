[deep\n&gt;breath] Here goes...\n&gt;\n&gt;* Consider using daily returns not prices, i.e. percentage price\n&gt;change up/down. It saves your network having to strip out the boring\n&gt;part of the price...\n&gt;\n&gt;* Confidence sounds like a smart place to be - in particular when two\n&gt;similar input vectors might result in wildly different outcomes (a\n&gt;major problem with backprop) - the network can simlpy say &quot;dunno&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh I agree that this is a *really* important thing to implement. In \nfact it would be fine if a network just said &#39;dunno&#39; 99% of the time so \nlong as it is corect most of the time when it gives a positive signal.\n\n&gt;* Fitness function: profit? return on capital invested? volatility?\n&gt;Sharpe Ratio? Be sure to factor in trading costs (execution fees,\n&gt;stamp duties, margin/funding costs if using CFDs) as they can kill\n&gt;models that evolve to &quot;scalp&quot; (sell on an uptick), which some of the\n&gt;big boys can afford to do because of the cheapness of individual\n&gt;transactions compared to the rest of us.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAs I said in an ealrier email, I would prefer to take as much work out \nof the network as possible. E.g. instead of getting buy/sell signals I \nwould prefer the network to give me price (or price change) predictions \nand I can then write some simple business logic that can determine if  \nthis information can be used to make a profit. If I can do this part in \ncode then why would I try an evolve a network to do it? Keep the \nnetwork&#39;s job as simple as possible.\n\n&gt;* Outputs - consider something like \n&gt;-1.0 .. -0.8\topen short position\n&gt;-0.8 .. -0.5\tstay short\n&gt;-0.5 .. -0.3\tcover short\n&gt;-0.3 .. +0.3\tnothing to do\n&gt;+0.3 .. +0.5\tclose long\n&gt;+0.5 .. +0.8\tstay long\n&gt;+0.8 .. +1.0\topen long position\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAh, so the network can indicate not only a price at a given point in the \nfuture, but actually indicate a varying point in the future. Whereas \nwith my approach (with the seperate business logic) we would need the \nnetwork to output a price estimation for a range of points in the future \n- actually this is the same thing huh. So yeh, I&#39;d go along with this \napproach.\n\n&gt;* Go Short? Well, you can if you trade with CFDs (Contracts For\n&gt;Difference) rather than actual shares. IIRC correctly, you can go long\n&gt;without paying Stamp Duty as well...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHere&#39;s were your market knowledge clearly exceeds my own! Spread betting \ngives you similar abilities, right? Without the need to pay \nbroker/transaction charges.\n\n&gt;* Efficient Market Hypothesis says all available information is in the\n&gt;price. Well, it may get there eventually but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s\n&gt;instantaneous! Therefore it could be useful to provide information\n&gt;outside of the stock price. Some possibilities:\n&gt;- Days (or fraction of the normal period) since (or to) announcements\n&gt;of results\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI like this idea. e.g. a price rise may be due to an imminent mildy \npositive announcement or a very positive announcement still some \ndistance in the future. I don&#39;t think you can determine which case is in \neffect in advance with just the price alone.\n\nThere is a whole bunch of stuff you could apply to the networks and you \ncan never supply all of the available information, therefore I think I \nprefer to go for a conservative approach and just stick to the basics. \nIf there are outside (as far as the network is concerned) factors at \nplay then the network can just set it &#39;dunno&#39; output high.  Think about \nit like this, the network can either be very good as predicting one or \ntwo specific events, or it can be less good at predicting a whole range \nof events. If we keep the input/output space lean then the searches will \n(theoritically) have more chance at success - assuming they have enough \ninfo to make a prediction of course. Swings and roundabouts huh.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;* Oh, Dividends. Remember that share prices fall by the dividend\n&gt;amount on the ex-div date (or by approximately the present value\n&gt;thereof but near as dammit). So you&#39;ll either need to factor dividends\n&gt;back into the price (not recommended, they&#39;re a realised one, whereas\n&gt;in the price they&#39;re unrealised and rather less liquid) or (a) add the\n&gt;dividend amount to your P&L\n&gt;\nP&L?\n\n&gt; and tell your network that the price drop\n&gt;is OK, either by flagging the data on the date on an extra input or\n&gt;more pragmatically just dropping the day from your input data set.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBut there may be profit opportunities here, if, say there are certain \nsubtle situations where the market as a whole may temporarily re-adjust \nto the div payment incorrectly - e.g. if there were other complicating \nfactors effecting the price at the same time. I prefer letting the \nnetwork know what the dividend payment will be and when it will be paid, \nis that possible?\n\n&gt;I believe that there are companies using AI techniques in the markets,\n&gt;D E Shaw is one that comes to mind, and there are/were a group in what\n&gt;is now part of UBS (was Swiss Bank, was O&#39;Brien(?)) that were in Santa\n&gt;Fe, as described in The Predictors\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHave you read it? Are these guys for real? and if so why did they go to \nthe effort of writing a book? :)\n\nActually I&#39;m thinking that this particular discussion is straying from \nNEAT quite a bit, shall we take it elsewhere?\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
