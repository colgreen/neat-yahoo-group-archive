It would be really cool to see how either of those\nsuggestions works. Even cooler would be a comparison of the two. My guess is\nthat the separate, co-evolved strategy would work better because it would be\nless constrained. \n\nDo you have any test problems in mind? Problems that require the use of many\ndifferent types of activation functions?\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n517.214.1060\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Colin Green &lt;locster01@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sat, 19 Jan 2008 16:18:50 +0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: HyperNeat\n&gt; \n&gt; Luca,\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you suggesting a fixed network structure? And then we get the activation\n&gt; function for each node by querying a CPPN?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Technically CPPN would be the wrong term there but hopefully you all\n&gt; understand what I mean. Ken and others, another way of looking at it is that\n&gt; the CPPN as well as outputting connection strength between two nodes, also\n&gt; outputs a value which tells us what activation function to use (although\n&gt; each connection has two end points of course). A better way to do this might\n&gt; be to have an entirely separate co-evolved genome that describes a network\n&gt; that accepts a single substrate coordinate and outputs parameters for a\n&gt; parameterised activation function. Make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n\n"}}
