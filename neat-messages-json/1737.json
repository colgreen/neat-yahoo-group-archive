Is there a particular step in \nthe process that the roving eye can fill?  For example, is the \nexperiment you are doing now a task usually done by human eye?\nIt seems even if the entire process of fingerprint identification \ncan&#39;t be done with the roving eye, it may still be able to fill some \ncrucial link in the chain.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; On Wed, 17 Nov 2004 22:20:55 -0000, Kenneth Stanley\n&gt; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Man, I just gotta say, this is a really cool demo.  I think \nwhat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; so compelling about it is that you are watching the \neye &quot;thinking.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hopefully if you get a paper accepted you&#39;ll get a chance to show\n&gt; &gt; this demo.  I think it would get a really good reaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks...we hope so too.  Right now we&#39;re wrangling with the NIST\n&gt; Special Database 4, a database of preclassified fingerprint images\n&gt; that&#39;s a standard benchmark in a lot of the literature.  It&#39;s from\n&gt; 1992, and the images are compressed and stored in a proprietary\n&gt; format, and the software is clunky and difficult to compile,\n&gt; and...welcome to the world of research. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; We hope that we can get some good work done over the next month, \nand\n&gt; evolve the networks for a system that&#39;s able to generalize and \nperform\n&gt; well on a large test set.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ll keep you guys posted on our progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n\n\n\n\n"}}
