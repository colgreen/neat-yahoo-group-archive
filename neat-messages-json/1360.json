My inputs are always in the range of +/- 1, centered \naround 0.  And it is always equally centered, such that it goes just as much \nabove as below.\n\nNEAT, of course, captalizes on this fact.  By evolving networks that try \ntheir hardest to always return &#39;0&#39; as the output, they minimize their error. \n. . without actually solving the problem they were asked to solve.\n\nWhat I need is a fitness function that penalizes for this.\n\nI suppose I could keep track of the minimum and maximum of the activations \nand of the expected results.  The difference between the dynamic range of \nthe expected vs. the dynamic range of the actual could be used to further \npenalize the network.  The bigger the difference in range, the higher the \npenalty.  Then, if it tries to optimize by always outputting 0, but the real \ndynamic range is +/-1 for a range of 2, then the penalty is 2, adding to the \nexisting penalty of the average error, which hovers around 1/3.\n\nThink that might work?  Or does anyone perhaps have any other suggestions \nbased on similar experiences with rogue evolutions?\n\n\n\n"}}
