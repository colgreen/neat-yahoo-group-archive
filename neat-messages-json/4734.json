However, I generally\n&gt; recommend not having more than one of each kind.\n\nUnderstood. Start with a minimal set and maybe introduce others at a\nlater time if they show promise. E.g. I wonder about functions with\nabrupt changes in rate of change, e.g. abs and square, and whether\nthey are complementary or substitutes for functions with a similar\noverall profile but with smoother curves, e.g. gaussian and sine.\n\n&gt; I also agree that something like an unbounded linear function can have\n&gt; unintended consequences.\n&gt;\n&gt; My guess is that even sigmoids and Gaussians alone can work well, although\n&gt; it&#39;s just a hunch.\n&gt;\n\nThanks.\n\n"}}
