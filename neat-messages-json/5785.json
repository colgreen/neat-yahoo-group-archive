Suppose a CPPN sub=\r\nstrate is being pruned for a Go game board evaluator.  If ideally the weigh=\r\nts along the board edge should be expressed they will be removed by band pr=\r\nuning. Am I missing something?\n\nTony \n \n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ken&quot; =\r\n&lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Tony, I believe the issue there is with =\r\nthe definition of a &quot;band&quot;:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;points that are enclosed by at least two =\r\nneighbors on opposite sides (e.g. left and right) with di=0Bfferent CPPN ac=\r\ntivation levels&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that the points in the outer black region do not=\r\n have _two_ neighbors of different level on opposite sides, so I believe th=\r\nat is the reason they are pruned away.  However, it&#39;s possible that I&#39;m mis=\r\nunderstanding the question, in which case please let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regardin=\r\ng the quote that says, &quot;the CPPN speaks a language through its pattern,&quot; th=\r\nis idea conveys that of course there is more than one way to interpret the =\r\npatterns output by CPPNs for this purpose, and any such method of interpret=\r\nation is a kind of language.  In other words, there might be other perfectl=\r\ny legitimate ways of deciding which connections to express from an infinite=\r\n-resolution pattern that are different from the method in the paper (i.e. t=\r\nhose would be different &quot;languages&quot; for the CPPN to express what it wants).=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, the &quot;language&quot; suggested in the paper is nice in the sense=\r\n that it allows the CPPN to express one type of connection without being fo=\r\nrced to express another at the same time - that&#39;s what the band pruning ach=\r\nieves.  Otherwise you&#39;d get points chosen on both sides of a sharp border, =\r\nforcing connections often to be chosen in pairs (which seems an undesirable=\r\n tendency).\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;wilsontg80&quot; &lt;wil=\r\nsontg@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am puzzled by the result of band pruning in Figure=\r\n 3: Example point selection in two dimensions, from Evolving the Placement =\r\nand Density of Neurons in the HyperNEAT Substrate.  It seems like the infor=\r\nmation inherent in the image should include points along the black-white ed=\r\nge of the outer black region, but band pruning removes them all.  The figur=\r\ne explains &quot;In effect, the CPPN speaks a language through its pattern that =\r\ndenotes exactly which weights within the hypercube should be expressed.&quot;  I=\r\n am curious why &quot;language&quot; is used here.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My goal is to add itera=\r\nted ES-HyperNEAT to the C++ version at https://github.com/MisterTea/HyperNE=\r\nAT.  I am presently a hobbyist (my profession is embedded software engineer=\r\ning) but considering to someday pursue a PhD involving HyperNEAT, etc.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Tony Wilson\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
