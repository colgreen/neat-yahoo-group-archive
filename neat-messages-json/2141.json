At this point though I think we should distinguish \nbetween the two (that come to mind) benefits of NEAT&#39;s discrete species:\n\n1) Each species represents a distinct point or area in the search space, \nand therefore speciation allows NEAT to search several areas of the \nsearch space simultaneously.\n2) Mating between genomes within a species are more likely to generate \ngood offspring - than mating with more distant genomes from other species.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if there exists hard evidence/research to back up these two \npoints. I&#39;m happy to assume that (1) is the case. (2) though is a bit \nmore shaky. Actually one experiment I would like to do is track the \nquantity and quality of offspring and to graph this against their \norigin, e.g. mutation or crossover, and the genetic distance between \nparents. I wouldn&#39;t be /too/ surprised if it turned out that crossover \ndidn&#39;t generate many good offspring and thus I don&#39;t feel comfortable \nassuming (2).\n\nOk now consider that the discrete speciation in NEAT does indeed perform \n(1) fairly well, and there isn&#39;t that much room for improvement. \nTherefore any new speciation technique should probably maintain the \nbenefits of (1) whilst improving (2). Does a heap based continous \nspeciation meet these criteria?\n\nCertainly the heap maintains genomes over a number of areas of the \nsearch space, or at least over one wide area. It&#39;s not clear to me if \nthe genomes would form clusters in the search space, as with discrete \nspeciation, or whether perhaps they would describe a tree structure. \nThus I can see that (1) seems intact, but (2)?\n\nIt seems to me that the heap structure is trying to maintain two things \n- a hierachy of fitness and a hierachy of genetic distance. The first is \nexplicity coded into the heap, the second though I think can become \nbroken when really fit genomes bubble up to the top of the heap and \nbecome h-parents of genomes that are genetically dissimilar. Thus when \nselecting mating pairs we may end up with two very different genomes \n(couldn&#39;t we?), when ideally we probably want to select mates within \nsome genetic distance range. Actually in discrete speciation we might \nfind that some species generate good offspring with a wider or narrower \nrange than others.\n\nI&#39;m going to leave it there as I&#39;m not really forming a clear train of \nthough on this one right now :(\n\nCheers,\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
