For\n&gt; example,\n&gt;\n&gt; $ neat-gen &lt;settings&gt;.xml &lt;in-pop&gt;.xml &lt;in-fit&gt;.xml &lt;out-pop&gt;.xml\n&gt; &lt;out-phenotype&gt;.xml\n&gt;\n&gt; Why separate it out from the main experiment loop?  Because I want the\n&gt; experiment loop to be controlled by CGI scripts.  I want it to be\n&gt; event-driven.  I want an experiment to be able to pick right up where it\n&gt; left off after a reboot or power outage.  Because my ultimate goal is a\n&gt; distributed NEAT that may take months to get anywhere... :(\n&gt;\n&gt; Those of you with an existing NEAT implementation could probably convert\nit\n&gt; for use in this manner in about a half-hour, huh?  :)  And if you are\n&gt; willing to save me the effort, I wouldn&#39;t complain...\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, I&#39;ll probably build it in Perl, since that&#39;s the language I&#39;m\nthe\n&gt; most proficient in.  (YANI...yet another neat implementation.  :-) )\nBefore\n&gt; I begin, would any of you like to give me some tips or suggestions?  Some\n&gt; design suggestions that you perhaps wish you had thought of before you\n&gt; started?  Anything?  Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; -- John\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
