Concerning NEAT, which seems \nvery promising t=\r\no me, I do have the following questions:\n\nHow does NEAT compare (in estimat=\r\ning models from time series) to GMDH \n(group method of data handling: http:=\r\n//www.gmdh.net) type neural \nnetworks ?\nGMDH automatically selects relevant=\r\n inputs, evolves the topology \n(using genetic algorithms) and estimates coe=\r\nfficients of polynomial \ntransfer functions (using least squares for exampl=\r\ne). Because of \nrestricting the GA to the topology, the search space is kep=\r\nt \nrelatively small. Like in NEAT, networks are evolved from small to \nmore=\r\n complex, in order find the least complex optimal solution. The \ngmdh metho=\r\nd is supposed to be fast, working well on noisy, small \nsample data, insens=\r\nitive to irrelevant inputs, and creates explicit \nmodels (algebraic equatio=\r\nns which can be analyzed).\n\nFurther questions are:\nHow well does NEAT perfo=\r\nrm on noisy time series ? \n\nDoes it require any enhancements to make NEAT m=\r\nodel (noisy) time \nseries well ?\n\nThank you for your help,\nAchim\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
