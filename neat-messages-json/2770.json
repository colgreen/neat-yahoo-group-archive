This has been attempted several times and works well \nfor problems=\r\n that can be broken into parts nautrally.  Perhaps you can \nprovide more de=\r\ntail on the domain you&#39;re thinking about?\n\nken \n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Luca_PI&quot; &lt;wolfgroups@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I am a newbie in this secto=\r\nr, even if I am watching your forum from a\n&gt; long time. \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if =\r\nit&#39;s right, but what do you think if we create more\n&gt; Neural Network locali=\r\nzing the different information (linking all the\n&gt; result in the main NN) to=\r\n increase the performace in the research? \nThe\n&gt; fitness of the previuos NN=\r\n could be the result of the last.
