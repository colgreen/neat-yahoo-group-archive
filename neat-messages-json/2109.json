I should say that my version is not a\n&gt;carbon copy of the original in implementation and is in fact different\n&gt;in a few areas by quite a bit (although I think functionally mostly\n&gt;equivalent).  The three biggest differences that I can think of are\n&gt;that speciation is done continuously without distinct species\n&gt;(individuals get fitness modifications depending on how new and how\n&gt;rare their innovations are, and probablistically mated based on\n&gt;similarity), there is no genotype - crossover and mutation is just\n&gt;done directly, and links don&#39;t have their own innovation ids (instead\n&gt;its a tuple of the innovation ids that they connect).   I can describe\n&gt;these in more detail, but I don&#39;t think they are very interesting.\n&gt;Suffice it to say that I can&#39;t guarantee that this will work\n&gt;identically to original NEAT on every problem, although it has done\n&gt;well thus far.\n\nHi,\n         I&#39;m currently thinking hard about a NEAT implementation (been \ntalking about it for _AGES_ but busy busy busy...).\n\n         Speciation: that sounds like an interesting approach.  I have \nalways had my doubts about speciation (not just in NEAT but in genetic \ncomputing generally) as it often seems quite arbitrary and &quot;hacky&quot;.  It \nalways seems to me that there must be better approaches, and I have ideas \nin that direction, but so far I didn&#39;t clarify it enough that I could say \n&quot;this is _definitely_ correct&quot;...\n\n         Genotype: my feeling is that is just a detail, I think I would \nwant one myself, so that possible future moves to indirect encodings can be \nimplemented in the same genome-&gt;ANN transformation...\n\n         Innovation numbers in links: I was also planning this, and I think \nsomebody else already did it?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nYahoo!
