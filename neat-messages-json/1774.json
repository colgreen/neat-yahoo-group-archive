Therefore the fitness oscillations seen aren&#39;t indicative of \nthe oscillation period during a typical run.\n\n&gt;  It looks like not enough could be happening in\n&gt;that time to warrant a phase switch.  Does fitness really stagnate in\n&gt;just 20 or 30 seconds?  We thought maybe you&#39;d expect to see the first\n&gt;phase of the run stay in the complexifying mode for a long time before\n&gt;going to pruning, since it doesn&#39;t usually stagnate right off the\n&gt;bat?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk I&#39;m putting a graph of a single pruning run at:\n\nhttp://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/pruning_run_1.png\n\nX-axis is generations in this graph, not clock time.\n\nThis includes the mean complexity (total number of neurons & connections \nin a genome) which shows a nice regular oscillation right from the \nstart. The reason why there isn&#39;t a long(er) period at the start of the \nrun (before a pruning phase) is because the threshold for the pruning \nphase is set very low. So if you look at the best fitness line where the \nfirst pruning occurs you can see it is flat for a few generations, and \nthis was enough to trigger the pruning phase. Note that pruning phase \nkicks in when mean complexity has risen by some threshold amount above \nthe level at the end of the last prune run (or the starting mean \ncomplexity if no prune phase has occured yet), if this threshold is \npassed then pruning won&#39;t start until the best fitness has stagnated for \nsome (configurable) number of generations.\n\nSo in the graph you can see that the complexity rises quite steeply at \nthe start, probably crosses the threshold and then pruning phase kicks \nin at the first sign of stagnation in best fitness.\n\nWith regards to the question of how many gens per second and whether \nenough time has passed to warrant pruning, remember that the whole \nexperiment runs quite fast, so for example the first pruning phase in \nthe above graph kicks in at generation 1005 which corresponds to 41 secs \nclock time. Also you can see that the complexity has risen a lot in that \ntime and pruning is therefore warranted.\n\n&gt;I guess the overall question is what is really going on and how is\n&gt;that graph staying so stable?  Maybe it would be useful to see a graph\n&gt;of *champion* complexity over time, rather than mean.  Then you might\n&gt;see where pruning was really paying off.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes that would be worth doing, but don;t discount the pruning of the \npopulation as whole because this speeds up the simulation and ultimately \nincreases our chances of finding a solution within a given timeframe. \nIt&#39;s an indirect benefit but an important one, I suppose you could say \nI&#39;m taking a holistic approach to searching. So rather than just \nfocusing in on how well genomes are doing I also consider how conducive \nthey are to running a simulation.\n\nHope that help clarify things. I still have the raw log files from all \nof my experiments so if there are any other questions or if you want a \ncopy of them, just ask.\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
