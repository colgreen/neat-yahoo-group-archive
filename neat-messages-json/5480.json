One of the take=\r\n\naway points for me was that the connectivity in real brains has a lot\nof r=\r\negular structure and order, but also some rather more messy\nconnectivity. I=\r\n&#39;m going from memory here but the pictue he paints is\none of cortical colum=\r\nns packed together vertically, columns have\nlayers (6 or so if memory serve=\r\ns) and intra-column connectivity\nappears to be fairly well understood at a =\r\n*very* broad level, that is,\nlayer 1 neurons tend to connect to layers 2 & =\r\n3, etc.\n\nAt the top of the columns we then see connections reaching out ove=\r\nr\nthe tops of multiple columns, connecting up different regions\nsometimes o=\r\nver very long distances - perhaps up to several\ncentimeters. It&#39;s interesti=\r\nng to contemplate what processes are\ncausing connections to form over such =\r\nlong ranges. One explanation I\nquite like is that the early brain (e.g. a n=\r\newborn baby) has a mass of\nconnections that have *not* yet been guided by a=\r\nny learning process -\nso what is all this mass of connections doing? what a=\r\nrrangement of\nconnectivity does it have and why? I suspect that our DNA des=\r\ncribes\nconnectivity patterns in the newborn that are primed for learning an=\r\nd\nthat as learning progresses some of these pre-existing connections are\nst=\r\nrengthened (and grow new connections locally), and some wither away.\nI&#39;m sp=\r\neculating that this early connectivity pattern includes some\nproportion of =\r\nlong connections acting between distant regions. I\nfurther speculate that t=\r\nhis might be partly responsible for the\nvarious axon bundles that occur in =\r\nthe brain that broadly follow the\nsame path in all (most?) people (e.g. fro=\r\nm the retina to the visual\ncortex) - do &#39;primer&#39; fibers grow by following a=\r\n DNA blueprint during\nthe early stages of brain development?\n\nAlso last yea=\r\nr I came across this article that discusses work\nregarding expression of bi=\r\nts of DNA considered to be junk acquired\nfrom ancient viruses and the like:=\r\n\n\n   &quot;A special report on the human genome: The soul of an old machine&quot;\n   =\r\nhttp://www.economist.com/node/16349410\n\n\nI&#39;ve appened some of the salient p=\r\narts to the end of this post. This\njunk DNA appears to be expressed more in=\r\n brain tissue than elsewhere\nin the body, and so there&#39;s a question of why =\r\nthis is and if it has\nany purpose. One suggested purpose is that this DNA i=\r\ns used as a\nsource of complexity in brain connectivity growth processes in =\r\nthe\nembryo. It&#39;s possible that the learning processes/rules in the brain\ndo=\r\nn&#39;t require any specific structure but do requrie some existing\nstructure w=\r\nith sufficient interconnectivity and &#39;messiness&#39; to build\nupon, and that th=\r\nese large sequences of &#39;junk&#39; DNA (I appreciate junk\nDNA is a loaded term) =\r\nwere a convenient source of messiness or\narbitrary complexity that evolutio=\r\nn came to utilise over time.\n\nDo you think this is possible? Likely? or jus=\r\nt another madcap theory? :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n&quot;A special report on the human geno=\r\nme: The soul of an old machine&quot;\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n=\r\n&quot;...Dr Gage studies LINE-1 elements, bits of DNA known colloquially as\njump=\r\ning genes. These make up about 20% of the human genome, and most\nbiologists=\r\n do regard them as junk=97or rather as parasites. Their origin\nis unknown, =\r\nthough they may be the distant descendants of some type of\nretrovirus (the =\r\nsame class as the AIDS-causing virus, HIV) because\nthey are able to copy th=\r\nemselves using a retroviral gene called\nreverse transcriptase. Generally, t=\r\nhis is a bad thing for their hosts.\nIf nothing else, it wastes resources. A=\r\nnd if an element happens to\ncopy itself into the wrong place it can cause a=\r\nn existing gene to\nmalfunction.\n[...]\nFive years ago he showed that LINE-1 =\r\nelements are much more active in\nthe brains of mice than in their other tis=\r\nsues. And in 2009 he and a\ncolleague, Nicole Coufal, showed the same is tru=\r\ne in people. Using\nsensitive sequencing methods they discovered that human =\r\nbrain cells\nhave around 100 more LINE-1 elements in them than tissues such =\r\nas the\nheart or the liver. That means the elements are multiplying during t=\r\nhe\nprocess of brain formation.\n[...]\nWhy that is remains an unanswered ques=\r\ntion. But one possible\nexplanation is this. Each new brain develops by a pr=\r\nocess akin to\nnatural selection. Nerve cells grow and develop lots of conne=\r\nctions\nwith each other, and then most of those connections and many of the\n=\r\ncells themselves die. Only the fittest cells and connections survive,\nleavi=\r\nng a working network.\n\nIn this context a way of generating variations on wh=\r\nich selection can\noperate may actually result in better networks and thus b=\r\nrains. The\nrandom changes brought about by LINE-1 elements jumping around t=\r\nhe\ngenomes of nerve cells can yield such variation. It is a daring\nhypothes=\r\nis. But there is at least one other part of the body=97the\nimmune system=97=\r\nthat relies on the internal mutability of the DNA to\ngenerate the variety n=\r\needed for it to recognise all the pathogens that\nnature can throw at a body=\r\n. Though the immune system has come up with\na different solution in detail =\r\n(particular cassettes of DNA have\nevolved to shuffle round at this one plac=\r\ne in the genome), the general\nprinciple is the same.&quot;\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\n"}}
