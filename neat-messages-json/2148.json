This explains why I&#39;m getting 89 \n&gt; as a best fitness but I don&#39;t understand why the output signal is \n&gt; not different for each of the 10 calls to SequenceTest.  The \n&gt; XorEvaluator has more than one pass through the network with \n&gt; different parameters and doesn&#39;t suffer from the same problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can any of you more experienced NEAT users see what I am doing wrong \n&gt; here?\n\nI managed to solve the problem.  I made the assumption that as the \noutput signal is between 0 and 1, that the input signals should also \nbe beween 0 and 1.  This is why I divided the number by 10 when \nsetting the value.\n\nAfter removing the divide by 10, the network learned to reach 100 \nfitness which is what I wanted to achieve.  The only thing still \npuzzling me is that I&#39;m not sure that I understand why there is a \ndifferent between dividing the input signal by 10 and not dividing.\n\nRegards\n\nChris Turner\n\n\n\n"}}
