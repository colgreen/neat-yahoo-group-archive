Still no where near a &#39;solution&#39;, but \nproceeding.\n\nI found that if I installed cygwin (http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/) \non my windows box, I&#39;m able to use it as a client for the project, too.  So, \nfor all those out there that wanted to help, but didn&#39;t have a linux box, \nthere you go!\n\nAlso, Collin, there was a bug in the client that broke the auto-update \nfeature.  I fixed it, but you need to manually update your machine in order \nto pick it up.\n\nI&#39;ve added some nice graphs to the status page.  First graph is maximum \nfitness per generation.  It fluctuates a lot, because of the slightly random \nnature of the fitness evaluation process.  But I&#39;ve also plotted the running \naverage, which definitely shows an upward trend.\n\nThe second graph replaces the old HTML-based population fitness graph.  It \nis a bar graph, one bar per network, with the scale of the graph \nrepresenting the range of fitness within the population.  A zero in this \ngraph represents the minimum fitness, not a zero fitness.  Likewise, a max \nvalue does not represent a solution, only the top performer.  The graph only \nshows the relative fitness between networks, not an overall fitness value.  \nThe graph shows the networks in the order in which they were created, so all \nthe elites from the previous generation appear first, followed by the \noffspring for each topology.\n\nThe next graph is harder to understand.  It is a measure of how stable, or \nreliable, the fitness value described above is for each network.  If the \nfitness of a network is still wildly fluctuating, then it is not very \nstable.  If the fitness hasn&#39;t changed appreciably in some time (where time \nis number of samples processed), then it will have a high stability.  The \nidea is, if we reach a point where all the networks have a stable fitness, \nwe are done for that generation (we can finish up early).  Unfortunately, at \nthis point there is one topology whose fitness values still fluctuate \nwildly, so it has low stability, so the mechanism that was intended to help \nthe experiment get through generations faster isn&#39;t yet able to do so.\n\nThe final graph is a fitness histogram.  The bars at the extreme left \nrepresent the lowest fitness within the population, the bars at the right \nrepresent highest fitness, and the height of the bar represent how many \nnetworks are in that range of fitness.\n\nThe next graph I intend to add is a pie chart, which shows the relative \ninvestment in each topology (offspring allocation number, not necessarily \nthe same thing as actual offspring, since there is an offspring limit).  \nI&#39;ll try to add that today or tomorrow.\n\nAny comments or suggestions for the status page?  Thanks!\n\n-- John\n\n\n\n"}}
