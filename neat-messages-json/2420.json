And in fact a given experiment may\n&gt;have a number of different measures we would like to keep track of and\n&gt;cluster/speciate on. I think it makes sense for some problem domains,\n&gt;but this does potentially sounds a bit like driving evolution by\n&gt;comparing phenotypes rather than genotypes - which was another\n&gt;discussion we had some time ago.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway I thought the specific example might be interesting.\n\nYes it&#39;s interesting as it brings up an interesting point.\n\nAs a general principal, I prefer any technique that &quot;autoconfigures&quot; \nover one that requires the user to carefully set it up for each \nproblem.  So in this case, as you started your discussion, I was \nthinking it was interesting, but not very general because you were \nusing domain information in order to devise a speciation strategy.\n\nWhen you got to the end, however, I realized you&#39;ve come full circle \nand are basically saying that we could plug-in a speciation \ncomparitor in just the same way as we plug-in fitness functions.  So \nyou&#39;ve arrived at a far more general idea than you started with...\n\nAll that said, I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether using &quot;species&quot; for \nall these different types of grouping doesn&#39;t muddy the waters a \nbit.  e.g. any scheme where individuals get assigned into species on \nthe basis of a comparison sounds to me very different from any scheme \nwhere (for example) the species of an individual is known from its \nlineage.  e.g. dolphins and sharks look very similar, and with good \nreason, but they are not in the same species genetically.\n\nNatural species use two methods for determining whether something is \nthe same or a different species:\n\n1) when I breed with it, are there any (viable) offspring -- e.g. all \nplants do this, they just scatter the pollen and if it hits a \ndifferent species, never mind\n\n2) is it an individuals opinion that another individual is a valid \nmate -- e.g. all the more-sophisticated animals do this, using a \n_lot_ of techniques to make the decision (looks, responding \ncorrectly, smelling right, having a Ferrarri, ...)\n\nSo although both of those do involve some sorts of comparisons, e.g. \nof sense-data in 2 and by molecule-to-molecule collisions in 1, \nneither of them is anything like as primitive (which I mean in the \nsense of &quot;fundamental&quot;, not &quot;simplistic&quot;) as our individual to \nindividual comparisons.  I more-natural scheme might be to give each \nindividual an (evolving) FID and then just call them the same species \nif their FIDs match to within some threshold.  Why does this \nmatter?  Well, for example, each evolving species is a population, \nwith a variety of different individuals in it, that&#39;s how its search \nworks, but as soon as we assign species by direct comparison, we \nsuddenly define the members of the species as all being similar to \nsome degree (and we also prevent any other species from exploring the \nsame individuals).  So I wonder if we hamper our species by being too \nprecise in how we assign individuals.\n\nAnyway, to get back a point or two.  &quot;Species&quot; created by comparisons \nwould seem better named as &quot;categories&quot; to me, e.g. because that&#39;s \nwhat we did, we categorised the population...\n\n         Ian\nIn 15 minutes everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
