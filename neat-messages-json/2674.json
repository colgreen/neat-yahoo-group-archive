It&#39;s really helpful to hear \nthoughts =\r\nlike yours at this early stage of research.  I&#39;ll try to \naddress some of y=\r\nour questions.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Philip Tucker&quot; &lt;ptucker@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just finished reading your paper.  Cool stuff.  I=\r\nt&#39;s exciting to \nsee\n&gt; you expand NEAT in such a novel way.  I have a few c=\r\nomments and \nquestions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I agree there is intuitive appeal to the CP=\r\nPN scheme.  The way\n&gt; subtle elaborations are applied to core structure see=\r\nms powerful.  \nBut\n&gt; I can&#39;t see what the next step from here is - specific=\r\nally, to \nproduce\n&gt; an ANN.  \n&gt; The examples in the paper produce 2D greysc=\r\nale images.  Do you \nalready\n&gt; have ideas how a CPPN would produce a direct=\r\ned network graph with\n&gt; connection weights?  I suppose one simple scheme wo=\r\nuld be to \ninterpret\n&gt; the X and Y inputs as neuron IDs, and the output as =\r\nthe connection\n&gt; weight between those IDs.  The range and density of neuron=\r\n IDs \nwould\n&gt; need to be represented somehow.  Does that seem lik the right=\r\n \ntrack? \n\nThat is one way that might lead to interesting results, although=\r\n the \ndownside is that it views the network as being fully connected, \nwhic=\r\nh could get expensive for large networks.  But your proposed \nmethod is nic=\r\ne in the sense that it could create complex patterns of \nweights.\n\nI think =\r\nthe bigger answer is that there are numerous ways to use \ngeneric patterns =\r\nto specify weighted connected graphs.  We (myself \nand my students) do have=\r\n some in mind that I believe will be \npowerful.  One thing to remember is t=\r\nhat neural connections groups \nin biology also ultimately rely on chemical =\r\ngradients.  It&#39;s true \nI&#39;m not giving you a complete answer since I don&#39;t w=\r\nant to hype a \npotential method until it&#39;s been at least tested a little, b=\r\nut we \ndefinitely have some methods in mind.  We spent a research group \nbr=\r\nainstorming session on this one topic.\n\n&gt; Do you envision CPPNs with multip=\r\nle outputs?\n&gt; \n\nYes, for sure.  As you are anticipating, it will be helpful=\r\n to have \nmultiple correlated patterns for certain kinds of domains, likely=\r\n \nincluding weighted connected graphs.\n\n&gt; 2) Can you give a short definitio=\r\nn of &quot;gradient&quot; and &quot;coordinate\n&gt; frames&quot; in the context of the paper?  The=\r\ny&#39;re used several times, \nand\n&gt; I think I have the general idea from contex=\r\nt.  But they are \npivotal to\n&gt; this domain, so I want to make sure I have a=\r\n clear understanding.\n&gt; \n\nThis is a good question because it suggests the t=\r\nech report may \nbenefit from some more clarification on these definitions. =\r\n By \ngradient I mean a gradually shifting chemical concentration over \nphys=\r\nical space. The simplest gradient would be a chemical that is \nhighly conce=\r\nntrated at one side but that gradually becomes less and \nless concentrated =\r\nas you move towards the other side.   But gradient \npatterns can take almos=\r\nt any form, such as periodic concentrations \nthat go up and down several ti=\r\nmes.\n\nCoordinate frame means all the variables that specify positional \ninf=\r\normation that are available to higher-level functions.  So in 2D, \nx and y =\r\nare a minimal coordinate frame.  But you also might have x, \ny, and d (dist=\r\nance from center).  Or, you could have only x and d, \nbut no y.  The coordi=\r\nnate frame profoundly biases the kinds of \npatterns a function within that =\r\nframe might output.  For example, if \nthe coordinate frame is sin(x) and y,=\r\n then it is highly likely that \nany function within this coordinate frame w=\r\nill output a pattern that \nis periodic along x.  \n\nGradients relate to coor=\r\ndinate frames in that in biological \norganisms, the coordinate frames are s=\r\npecified by chemical gradients.\n\n&gt; 3) You list repetition, repetition with =\r\nvariation, symmetry, \nimperfect\n&gt; symmetry, elaborated regularity, and pres=\r\nervation of regularity as \nthe\n&gt; 6 patterns exhibited in nature that a good=\r\n model should include. \n&gt; Other than your own intuition, is there any justi=\r\nfication for this\n&gt; being a necessary and complete list?\n&gt; \n\nI need to put =\r\nup my paper on this topic that I just presented at the \nGECCO workshop on d=\r\nevelopment (it should go up soon).  This was the \nexact question I was tryi=\r\nng to address.  The question is not so much \nwhether it&#39;s just my intuition=\r\n, but rather what else one could go \non?  It seemed to go over pretty well =\r\nwith the community that these \nare critical features to look for.\n\nI would =\r\nnot argue that the list is complete, but it is certainly \nnecessary.  Can y=\r\nou imagine an encoding being able to evolve \nanything with near biology com=\r\nplexity without these properties?  For \nexample, imagine an encoding that c=\r\nannot produce repetition, or one \nthat can&#39;t produce imperfect symmetry.  I=\r\n&#39;d argue that it&#39;s clear \nwithout the need for further evidence that such e=\r\nncodings would be \ntoo limited to achieve anything superior.\n\nThere are pos=\r\nsibly other critical features as well, but I think this \nlist a good start =\r\nsince you rarely find an encoding that can even \ndisplay all these features=\r\n.\n\n\n&gt; 4) I&#39;m skeptical of the human-guided evolution process you used \nwith=\r\n\n&gt; evolutionary art.  It seems like you&#39;re arguing that an important \nstep\n=\r\n&gt; on the path to evolving a bird is to evolve a bird-shaped picture. \n&gt; But=\r\n birds weren&#39;t selected because somebody thought they looked \nlike\n&gt; birds,=\r\n they were selected mostly based on behavior.  \n&gt; You mention 2 other schem=\r\nes (L-Systems and Turing&#39;s &quot;reaction\n&gt; diffusion model&quot;) that produced orga=\r\nnic-looking structures.  Those\n&gt; were both around 50 years ago (I think), a=\r\nnd they haven&#39;t (as far \nas I\n&gt; know) led to serious biologically-inspired =\r\ncomputer systems.\n&gt; \n\nIn contrast to you, I think the interactive approach =\r\nmakes a strong \nanalogy to how birds evolved- stronger than any other.  The=\r\n reason \nis that birds evolved, like humans, from flatworms.  Flatworms, wh=\r\nen \nthey were new, were not being &quot;evaluated&quot; for their similarity to \nbird=\r\ns, either behaviorally or morphologically.  Likewise, they were \nnot evalua=\r\nted for their human-ness either.  Rather, flatworms \nwere &quot;evaluated&quot; in th=\r\neir local context for what they could do at \nthe time, given the current si=\r\ntuation on earth hundreds of millions \nof years ago.\n\nInteractive evolution=\r\n is analogous because when I choose a picture I \nam not comparing it to an =\r\nultimate target (like bird or human) but \nrather evaluating it relative to =\r\nthe current context it is in.  I am \nsaying, this has the most promising pr=\r\noperties right now.  I might \nchoose a blob-like picture simply because it =\r\nis symmetric and I know \nthat I want symmetry down the line.  Even though i=\r\nt looks nothing \nlike a spaceship (or bird, or human), it has good properti=\r\nes in its \npresent day, just like the flatworm.  Benchmarks do not work lik=\r\ne \nthat.  So I think the behavioral/morphological dimension is \northogonal =\r\nto the issue of the non-target-based selectivity of \nnatural evolution.  As=\r\n you say in a later point, there is no final \nsolution in mind in natural e=\r\nvolution.  Likewise in interactive \nevolution.\n\n&gt; 5) You draw a strong dich=\r\notomy between CPPNs and develompental\n&gt; processes because CPPNs aren&#39;t time=\r\n-based.  But, the CPPN network \nis\n&gt; going to have to be activated, and eac=\r\nh step is going to take \ntime. \n&gt; Also, one could view the model as having =\r\none of the inputs be \ntime. \n&gt; It can be very fast, but a gene regulatory n=\r\network in a computer is\n&gt; much faster than a biological one.  Am I missing =\r\nsomething here?\n&gt; \n\nA CPPN need only compute an output once for each coordi=\r\nnate.  A GRN, \non the other hand, must continually send information back an=\r\nd forth \nacross multiple coordinates.  That means that each coordinate in t=\r\nhe \nphenotype instantiates multiple computations, whereas in a CPPN each \nc=\r\noordinate only instantiates once.  The question is not about the \ncomplexit=\r\ny of simulating a single GRN vs. a single NN (both are \nlikely similar), bu=\r\nt rather about how many times that GRN or that NN \nmust be fully-activated =\r\nfor each coordinate/cell in the phenotype.\n\nAlso, I&#39;m not sure about what y=\r\nou mean by &quot;one could view the model \nas having one of the inputs be time.&quot;=\r\n  I don&#39;t see the meaning of \nthat view when the only inputs are coordinate=\r\n frames like x and y.  \nHow could x be considered time?  Of course, one cou=\r\nld simply say \nthat one input is x and the other is time, so that the whole=\r\n pattern \nis viewed as &quot;how x changes over time,&quot; but the CPPN formalism do=\r\nes \nnot have any need or interpretation for such a view.  It simply \nproduc=\r\nes a pattern on its output(s).\n\n&gt; 6) This is a semantic nitpick.  You write=\r\n in paragraph 4 of section\n&gt; 2.3, &quot;[biological evolution] does not start se=\r\narching in a space of\n&gt; the same complexity as the final solution&quot;.  Descri=\r\nbing evolution \nas\n&gt; having a &quot;final solution&quot; is misleading - it makes it =\r\nseem \ndirected. \n&gt; There is no final solution, there are just solutions goo=\r\nd enough to\n&gt; survive.\n&gt; \n\nYes true, this point is right.  I was just tryin=\r\ng to be more \nconcise.  It would be more wordy and perhaps confusing to say=\r\n \nthat &quot;biological evolution did not start search in a space of the \nsame c=\r\nomplexity as the current successful phenotypes.&quot;  However, \nthat is what I =\r\nmeant.\n\nThanks again for the comments.  I&#39;m very happy to discuss this topi=\r\nc.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
