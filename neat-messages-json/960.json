This goes back \n&gt;to the debate about how long to keep a record of innovation \n&gt;numbers.  In the FAQ I give some reasons I chose to only keep them \n&gt;around for 1 generation.  In your proposed model, this wouldn&#39;t be \n&gt;an option.  Also, it&#39;s nice to know the order that connections \n&gt;appeared.  If you ever look at a NEAT genome you can tell how often \n&gt;connections are successful and in what order they were put togther \n&gt;by looking at their innovation numbers.  Aside from these concerns, \n&gt;your idea is still doable but you&#39;d lose these capabilities.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI kind of like the idea. As a substitute for the loss of history I was \nthinking of storing the generation number at which a connection was created.\n\nAnyway this only relates to connections, maintaining consistent neuron \nIDs seems trickier. When a neuron is added it splits a connection, that \nconnection has a source and target neuron, but several other splits \ncould have occured in the past between the same two neurons. How do I \nknow which neuron my new neuron is equivalent to? Now, if I look through \na histrory of previous splits as your (Ken) NEAT does and also JOONE I \ncan lookup the connection ID. Fine. But when you load in a population \nfrom file you have lost the history. Something equivalent to the \nhashtable lookup for conenctions would be ideal, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s \npossible.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
