Like yo=\r\nu say you probably don&#39;t need this now, but it might\nbe\n&gt; an idea to cast a=\r\nn eye over the release logs as there are some\n&gt; changes/fixes you might be =\r\ninterested in. I&#39;ve also migrated the\nproject\n&gt; files over to .Net 2.0.\n\nCo=\r\nol. I&#39;ll go look over the next few days.\n\n&gt; I haven&#39; included the zedgraph =\r\nstuff yet, I&#39;m still not sure about the\n&gt; performance and memory footprint.=\r\n BTW do you know if you can set the\n&gt; graphs to roll when the number of dat=\r\na points hits a certain number?\n&gt; This was one of the things I managed to d=\r\no in RudyGraph by using a\n&gt; circular buffer based plot set.\n\nMy model is su=\r\nfficiently expensive that the impact is negligible. (BTW,\nI&#39;ve switched, as=\r\n recommended, from relaxing to a max 5 step evaluation,\nwhich has doubled t=\r\nhroughput). I don&#39;t know about &quot;rolling&quot; the graphs,\nI suspect it might be =\r\nachievable by deleting the earliest point(s) from\nthe PointPairList that dr=\r\nives the display.\n\n&gt; &gt;You&#39;re almost certainly going to need to use derived =\r\ndata rather than\n&gt; &gt;raw prices: percentage change from day to day is a good=\r\n start.\nz-scores\n&gt; &gt;are good but I&#39;m always slightly concerned that they as=\r\nsume that the\n&gt; &gt;bounds of the range of source values is known. There are a=\r\n number of\n&gt; &gt;other derived values that can be calculated from the technica=\r\nl\nanalysis\n&gt; &gt;(TA) domain, from the simple (moving averages, relative stren=\r\ngth,\n&gt; &gt;momentum) though trickier (volatility) to the downright exotic\n&gt; &gt;(=\r\nBollinger bands, oscillators, fratal coefficients).\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll probably use p=\r\nercentage change pushed through a sigmoid curve -\n&gt; this means I can avoid =\r\nnormalising the range which will of course\n&gt; contain some extreme spikes wh=\r\nich would cause a problem for a linear\n&gt; mapping (normalisation) to the neu=\r\nron input signal range. I&#39;m going to\n&gt; avoid anything too clever and let th=\r\ne network&#39;s calculate averages and\n&gt; the like for themselves, at least at f=\r\nirst.\n\nI like the sigmoid &quot;normalisation&quot; idea. I&#39;m going through a phase o=\r\nf\nseeking the simplest presentation that is consistent with making sense\nat=\r\n the moment.\n\n&gt; Not sure about this. e.g. it&#39;s not like football where your=\r\n network&#39;s\n&gt; compete against each other and use memory (potentially) as a s=\r\nort of\n&gt; initial relative rating of two teams. Actually I was wondering if =\r\nyour\n&gt; pre-processing is actually providing your networks with information\n=\r\n&gt; about the future, e.g. relative strength of a team determined from\n&gt; futu=\r\nre results. Or have I misunderstood?\n\nThis may have been true in previous e=\r\nfforts, but all I do now is run\nthrough historical results for a few season=\r\ns without making any\nfinancial decisions in order to &quot;calibrate&quot; the model =\r\n- it should have\nformed an &quot;opinion&quot; by the time the bookmakers get involve=\r\nd.  For each\nrun I now have it dumping all kinds of interesting information=\r\n every\ntime a new max fitness occurs. A number of interesting strategies ha=\r\nve\nshown up, although I wouldn&#39;t say they look like they&#39;ll be particularly=\r\n\nrobust once a test set is presented...\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
