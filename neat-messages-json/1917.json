The most successful and applicable\npredator/prey experiment, that I&#39;ve found, is the incremental SANE\nexperiment.  It also used absolute distances in that the character did\nnot have a viewing vector.\n\nThe coevolution experiments that Ken developed to showcase NEAT also\ndid not give the characters a view vector.  To be honest I&#39;d be very\ninterested to see any of these experiments that you are suggesting do\nutilize velocity measurements.\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Philip Tucker &lt;ptucker@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The cat is red, the mouse is yellow.  The cat has 16 inputs:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 0-3: Distance to walls in U,R,D,L\n&gt; &gt; 4-7: Proximity to mouse in U,R,D,L (-1.0 for no sight)\n&gt; &gt; 8-11: Direction heading of mouse is: U,R,D,L (-1.0 or +1.0)\n&gt; &gt; 12-15: Measure of how long since walking on tiles in U,R,D,L\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The cat can only see through LOS.  There are five outputs of the cat:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 0 - Move Up\n&gt; &gt; 1 - Move Right\n&gt; &gt; 2 - Move Down\n&gt; &gt; 3 - Move Left\n&gt; &gt; 4 - Make Sound\n&gt; \n&gt; Are the directions absolute or relative to the cat; i.e., do they map\n&gt; more to north, south, east, west, or to forward, left, right, and\n&gt; backward?  It sounds like the former.  Not sure how much it matters,\n&gt; but that would be a difference between your representation and many\n&gt; other predator/prey representations I&#39;ve seen.  Colin, what was your\n&gt; representation like?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Philip\n\n\n\n\n"}}
