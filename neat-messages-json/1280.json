This\n&gt;basically prevents me from having to write the LIKE\n&gt;statements etc....\n&gt;Well I was thinking about rathing than using that\n&gt;coming up with a set of inputs such as Page UpTime,\n&gt;Num Clicks, etc.. and using those inputs into the\n&gt;Neural Network and using Ga to evolve the weights. \n&gt;Well I have looked at the smartsweepers example on\n&gt;ai-junkie and Matt has done a gerat job, but I am not\n&gt;sure how I could apply it to my solution. For instance\n&gt;inthe smartsweepers problem he had a controller which\n&gt;iterataed through the sweepers and each sweeper had a\n&gt;brain independent of the other sweepers. For my\n&gt;problem would I have a SearchSweeper with its own\n&gt;brain and then it would get a list of results from the\n&gt;database(perhaps FullText INdexing still) and then\n&gt;rank them on the basis of the weights of the inputs or\n&gt;should each search result have its own brain and\n&gt;determine its own ranking?\n&gt;Does that help, not sure if it does.\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Rog\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Roger, I don&#39;t know anything about smartsweepers I&#39;m afraid but I \nthink I&#39;m starting to get the picture. You want to rank the search \nresults from an SQL server query, so that instead of having to deal with \ng the raw, un-ranked search results from SQL you want to pass each \nresult, in turn, through a network and for the network to output a \nranking,  or some variation on this scheme that gives you a ranked list \nof search results, right?\n\nI&#39;m not sure what benefit such a  scheme would provide over simple \nweighting of the various factors, such as page-up time, and other \nfactors such as the proximity of the various keywords and the frequency \nthey occur on a page. Google of course also factors in how many links \npoint to a page from elsewhere on the web - but my guess would be that \nthey take all of these factors, give some more weight than others, total \nthem all up and sort them so that the highest scoring pages occurs first \nin the list.  Now, perhaps a Neural Net could apply a more intelligent \nanalysis of the various factors, but then there is the problem of \ndetermining the &#39;best&#39; order that the search results could be in so that \nyou can train a network to achieve that &#39;best&#39; order.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
