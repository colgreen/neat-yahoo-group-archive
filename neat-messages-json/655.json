I also tried with no connections and \nfully connecting inputs with outputs, if I remember correctly there \nwasn&#39;t much in it for the XOR problem - starting with fully connected \ninput/outputs was a bit slower if I recall correctly.\n\nI had been thinking about adding in extra types of mutation e.g. remove \nconnection/node, but not using them in the main search. Instead I was \nthinking of periodically trimming back the population&#39;s complexity by \nonly allowing these types of mutation (deletion) and running the search \nalgorithm as normal, this should work because the search is elitist and \ntherefore we will never loose the good networks we have evolved so far. \nI was initially intending to do this to trim back unecessary clutter in \ngood networks prior to performing any visualization, but I think it may \nbe useful as part of the search itself.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilip Tucker wrote:\n\n&gt;In the original version of NEAT, the default initial topology is to \n&gt;have 0 hidden nodes and the input and output layers fully \n&gt;connected.  In doing some runs with XOR with subtractive mutations, \n&gt;we found that our smallest solutions do not require a connection \n&gt;from the bias input node.  This led me to wonder what would happen \n&gt;if I were to start with a more minimal arhitecture.  I did some runs \n&gt;starting with 0 connections, and was still able to solve it in about \n&gt;the same number of generations.\n&gt;\n&gt;So a few question:\n&gt;- has anyone else tinkered with alternate starting architectures? \n&gt;- is there any reason to start with ANY hidden neurons or \n&gt;connections?  \n&gt;- Ken, in your experiments, do you have the bias input fully \n&gt;connected along with the other inputs?\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s possible that, with more complex domains, starting with such a \n&gt;small architecture would yield significantly slower results as the \n&gt;members of the population take longer to start up.  We&#39;ve read other \n&gt;experiments where the starting architecture is a sparse randomly \n&gt;connected matrix.  But that would still allow for the possibility of \n&gt;starting with a connection that you never need, and never being able \n&gt;to get rid of it.  Starting with fewer connections might take \n&gt;longer, but gives you a better shot at a minimal solution.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
