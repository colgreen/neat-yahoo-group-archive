Are you using the cmake=\r\n scripts to build HyperNEAT? The manual has instructions on how to use cmak=\r\ne scripts to build HyperNEAT and these scripts build NEAT and Tinyxmlplus t=\r\no static libraries.\n\nNote that I&#39;m using tinyxmlplus, which is a different =\r\nlibrary from tinyxml and adds support for creating .xml.gz files (compresse=\r\nd xml files), as well as a host of other changes.  I do not think that usin=\r\ng the regular tinyxml library will work with HyperNEAT.  The tinyxmlplus li=\r\nbrary is included in the HyperNEAT download.\n\nJason G.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;erikcss&quot; &lt;erikcss@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am making some pro=\r\ngress here on my project. The examples for HyperNEAT are very good and help=\r\nful. Some technical questions will follow once I get this whole thing to co=\r\nmpile. \n&gt; \n&gt; So far, I have been able to compile tinyxml to a DLL. Apparent=\r\nly NEAT has to be compiled to a DLL as well, and that is where I ran into a=\r\n road block. When I attempt to compile NEAT, I get a number of errors. They=\r\n are all related to Tinyxml. Any advice on how to overcome this would be gr=\r\neatly appreciated. I am using version 2.6.1 of tinyxml. \n&gt; \n&gt; (I am buildin=\r\ng this on a windows machine using QT - Once I get things working here, I am=\r\n going to cross-compile this for use on a Gumstix)\n&gt; \n&gt; In constructor &#39;NEA=\r\nT::GeneticPopulation::GeneticPopulation(std::string)&#39;:\n&gt; no matching functi=\r\non for call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXmlDocument(std::string&)&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; In member =\r\nfunction &#39;void NEAT::GeneticPopulation::dump(std::string,bool,bool)&#39;:\n&gt; no =\r\nmatching function for call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXmlDocument(std::string&)&#39;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; In member function &#39;void NEAT::GeneticPopulation::dumpBest(std::string=\r\n,bool,bool)&#39;\n&gt; no matching function for call to &#39;TiXmlDocument::TiXmlDocume=\r\nnt(std::string&)&#39;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
