Ultimately,\n&gt; though, from what I read he is using a purely boolean approach to \nhis activation mechanism (below\n&gt; &lt; 2 does not fire, &gt; 1 does fire).  Without smooth activation \nfunctions, it means the evolved\n&gt; network by its nature must then create smoothness where it is \nneeded IN THE CONNECTIVITY.  That\n&gt; seems very inefficient.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is an interesting experiment.  I would have to see it perform \nover the long term to be\n&gt; convinced the results were equavalent to using a smooth activation \nfunctions (i.e. sigmoidal).  I\n&gt; just don&#39;t think they are.  Human distinctions in reality of \nfuzzy.  Formal logic is just a small\n&gt; subset of human intelligence.  And very few humans use formal \nlogic.  And a pretty large number of\n&gt; these produce &quot;valuable&quot; solutions to problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then the guy kind of lost me with his whole &quot;Terran/Artilect&quot; \ndiscussion at the end.  I was not\n&gt; prepared for that.  I then became all that much more suspicious he \nis just another &quot;over-the-top\n&gt; dreamer&quot;, scaling up a very simple view of logic as the basis \nfor &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; - a\n&gt; way over-abused term.  :^)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- Ian Badcoe &lt;ian_badcoe@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \tThis seems to be a nice mix of ANN, GA and CA, and he&#39;s \ndoing it all in \n&gt; &gt; hardware...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.cs.usu.edu/~degaris/papers/biomim.html\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tIan Badcoe\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; &gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n\n\n"}}
