This week there \nare a few nice performance improvements and additional configurability \nin the GUI. I have also made the decision to start releasing under the \nGPL/LGPL. See www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com for details.\n\nStuff in the pipeline:\n\n - Realtime network visualization in the simulation projects using a \ncolor range to indicate neuron activation and signal strength in \nconnections. If all goes to plan then this same network drawing code \nshould also appear in the main exe, showing the structure of the best \nnetwork. Hopefully ready in about 1 week.\n\n - Distributed NEAT. I have been casting an eye over the \nnetwork/remoting support in .Net. I think two distinct approaches are \nrequired. 1) Client/Server where folks can connect in to a server and \nchoose to dedicate CPU timer to a specific problem, kind of how \ndistributed.net works (worked?).  2) master/slave - slave machines \ndirectly controled by a master, this more like the beowulk arrangemet \ntypically used in research set ups.\n\nAlong with this weeks performance improvements, a scalable distributed \napproach should provide a nice boost for researching more CPU intensive \nproblems. Well that&#39;s the plan.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
