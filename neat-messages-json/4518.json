Consider a family tree of\ngenomes=\r\n where each mutation is a essentially a choice to go down one\nbranch of the=\r\n tree. For a genome at the end of a branch to evolve into\na genome at the e=\r\nnd of another branch evolution would probably have to\nback-track up the tre=\r\ne and back down again. Because successive genomes\nare building on previous =\r\ngenerations it&#39;s unlikely a more direct\nevolutionary path between the two g=\r\nenoems exists.\n\nIf we compare this situation to moving around in a euclidea=\r\nn space\nthen I&#39;m saying that the direct path from A to B isn&#39;t available, t=\r\nhat\nwe have to traverse first on the X axis and then the Y axis (or vice\nve=\r\nrsa), thus the simple distance calculation we have been using is\nprobably m=\r\nore correct in giving us an evolutionary distance between\ntwo genomes. \n\nIt=\r\n would be nice to see some experimental results backing up this\nhypothesis =\r\n- it would be straightforward to tweak the compatibility\ncalculation and co=\r\nmpare results.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
