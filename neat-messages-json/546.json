I am still not able to see its value for\n&gt; scientific work.  \n\nYou don&#39;t see any value in being able to share data\nbetween NEAT implementations written in different\nlanguages?\n\nOr having a platform/language-independent way of\nvisually rendering networks or run data?\n\n&gt; Don&#39;t forget\n&gt; that learning about the various software systems you\n&gt; mentioned requires time.  \n\nThere&#39;s not really much to learn.  For instance, using\nXSL is just a matter of installing Xalan and\ngenerating the SVG file with a single command-line\nargument.  If you wanted to write your own style\nsheets, then you&#39;ve have to learn XSL, but there&#39;s no\nneed.\n\nAnd of course, if you don&#39;t want to do any of this,\nyou don&#39;t have to.  But I think there is a desire\namong some in the group to develop a standard way of\nrepresenting data that&#39;s independent of how it was\nevolved/generated.  If you have a better suggestion\nfor such a format than XML, please let us know.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Finance Tax Center - File online.
