Which version\nof NEAT are you using? Did you write your own, or are you using an\nexisting implementation? If you wrote your own, have you tested it on\nsimpler problems to make sure it works properly?\n\nIf you&#39;re sure you have a working implementation, I&#39;d like a little\nbetter explanation of your domain. You say you&#39;ve tried a simplified\nversion of the task with a single joint, correct? So you have a\nnetwork with 3 inputs (current joint angle, goal joint angle, and\ncurrent speed), and 1 output (a force applied to the joint?). If\nyou&#39;re trying the task with a single joint, this seems trivial. What\nexactly is the desired output? The arm starts in one position and has\nto move the joint into another position? And you&#39;re giving it as input\nwhat that new position needs to be? Is the goal position static or\ndynamic, i.e. do you want to the arm to exhibit some kind of\noscillating behavior?\n\nIf you have an arm with just one joint and it has to move from one\nstatic position to another, and you&#39;re explicitly giving the network\nthe new position as input, then yes, something is horribly wrong.\nPlease elaborate a bit more.\n\n--Derek\n\nOn Sat, Nov 15, 2008 at 3:33 AM, matthias.linhardt &lt;faulerlennert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been following this group for some time and it was quite\n&gt; educational. But now the time has come to ask a few questions,\n&gt; because for over two months now I&#39;ve been trying very hard to get my\n&gt; project working - without success. As I am totally new to NEAT, my\n&gt; questions may sound trivial or naive to you, so please don&#39;t be\n&gt; offended by that. I read a lot of earlier posts on this group, but I\n&gt; didn&#39;t have the time to read them all. Additionally, as I&#39;m German,\n&gt; my English may be not very good, but I&#39;m trying my best. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; My project includes the following facts: 3-degrees-of-freedom robotic\n&gt; arm (dynamic simulation with gravitation), for each joint three\n&gt; inputs (current joint angle, goal joint angle, current speed) and one\n&gt; output (motor command), all inputs are scaled to [-1;1] before being\n&gt; fed to the system, all other nodes are sigmoid [0;1]. The arm gets 6\n&gt; training samples with different start and goal angles, each sample\n&gt; consisting of 500 timesteps. In each of these 3000 timesteps, the\n&gt; difference between current and goal angles is calculated. The sum of\n&gt; these differences becomes the errorsum. I assume this is not the best\n&gt; fitness function for this problem, but it should work to continually\n&gt; reduce the mean difference and therefor to make the arm &quot;want&quot; to go\n&gt; to the goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is the following: I do not know which kind of settings for\n&gt; the parameters I should use for such an experiment. I tried tons of\n&gt; possibilites, but without any significant results. Most of the time,\n&gt; there is a gradual improvement in fitness, but after some time it\n&gt; just stagnates and doesn&#39;t evolve any further at all. I thought this\n&gt; to be a problem of overcomplexification, so I scaled down the\n&gt; add_node_probability, which in turn resulted in slower learning\n&gt; curve, but after some time the same stagnation.\n&gt; So to clearify this: My main problem is stagnation after some time\n&gt; without having produced reasonable results. What can I do about it?\n&gt; What&#39;s it&#39;s cause and what can I do to get it done right?\n&gt;\n&gt; I would very much appreciate your helpful advice!\n&gt; With best regards,\n&gt; Matthias\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
