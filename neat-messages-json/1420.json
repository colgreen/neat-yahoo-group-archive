Your mutation rates were:\n\nadd neuron: 0.001\nadd connection: 0.01\nremove neuron: 0.003\nremove connection: 0.03\n\nIs this correct?  Your remove topology mutation rates were triple your\nadditive ones?  Are you sure everything is working correctly?  If so,\nhow do you account for the fact that your blended run complexity\nincreased at nearly the same rate as the complexifying runs?  This\ndoesn&#39;t seem right.\n\nAlso, it seems very strange to me that the fitness of the evolving\npopulations in both complexifying and blended NEAT *decrease* over the\nrun.  You speculate that this has to do with speciation culling, I\nbelieve, but there is either something very wrong with the algorithm\nas implemented or something extremely peculiar about your domain if\nNEAT is evolving progressively *worse* individuals.\n\nDerek\n\n\n"}}
