Such a GUI should support general \nnode placement concepts too (like arra=\r\nnging nodes in a circle or a \nmatrix), so the same substrate file can be re=\r\nused in multiple node \ndensities. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ke=\r\nnneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I know this is going to happen soo=\r\nner or later, but Thomas&#39;s recent \n&gt; question brought it to mind.
