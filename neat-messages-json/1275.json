I&#39;m not saying make randomness available to the network, I&#39;m saying \nmake a network that is inherently (a little) noisy.\n\ne.g the activation function becomes something like:\n\nval = Sigmoid(total) + RangedRand(-0.001, 0.001)\n\nI suggest this because:\n\n(i) the presence of randomness, averaged over many generations, can smooth \nthe fitness landscape\n\n(ii) a system evolved in the presence of randoness *within* the neurones \nwill have been forced to be robust w.r.t other sorts of randomness \n(discuss, 10 points, show your working)\n\n(iii) if the network can exploit randomness (e.g. in game playing where \nbeing unpredictable -- within constrains -- is an advantage) then it merely \nneeds to amplify up some of it&#39;s own noise.  And, because the noise is \navailable on every neurone, there&#39;s complete choice over what kind of noise \nit amplifies (e.g. it could apply far more noise to evaluating pawn moves \nthan king moves...)\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\np.s.    there&#39;s a whole other discussion here, about whether the TWEANN \ncommunity should still use a neurone design which was essentially enforced \nhistorically by the mathematical requirements of back-propagation, but it&#39;s \na long and complex discussion\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
