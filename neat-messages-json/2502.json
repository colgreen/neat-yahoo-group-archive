So I assume\n&gt;that you&#39;re seeing an increase in size, without a corresponding increase in\n&gt;fitness.\n&gt;\n&gt;If increasing the deletion mutations is having no effect on the rate of\n&gt;growth, I&#39;d say there&#39;s a problem with your algorithm.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, instead of merely increasing the deletion mutation rate, you might try\n&gt;decreasing the additive mutation rates.\n&gt;\n&gt;Derek\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nAs well as additive mutations, crossover also results in structure being \ncopied throughout a population and quite possibly faster than deletion \nmutations can remove them. Also the speciation in standard NEAT causes \noffspring with different structure (either via add or delete mutation) \nto get placed into their own species thus leaving the original species \nwith the offspring with the same amount of structure. This occurs if say \nyou get a lot of neutral additive mutations - they create new bloated \nspecies.\n\nIt might be worth casting an eye over my phased pruning write-up again, \nas I covered some of this in that.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
