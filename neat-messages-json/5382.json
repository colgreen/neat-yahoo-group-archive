To be honest, this i=\r\ns so silly I wouldn&#39;t try it myself. It&#39;s a better idea to observe the Sun&#39;=\r\ns activity than other planets. There are hundreds of thousands of objects i=\r\nn the solar system, why only planets should have impact on us, as everythin=\r\ng is made from the same stuff? How about exoplanets throughout the galaxy? =\r\nAstrology is just another twisted kind of stupidity. The market is a chaoti=\r\nc system and the best chances are that it can be predicted for a short time=\r\n. Even this is a hard task, considering the high liquidity of the market. I=\r\n don&#39;t think that Uranus&#39;s weather has anything to do with the direction of=\r\n EUR/USD today, people. This is absolutely silly and metaphysical. lol\n\nPet=\r\ner \n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Peter Henry &lt;blackprinzze@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hi All\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a normal response when planetary cycles and stock-mar=\r\nket timing is \n&gt; mention within the public domain.
