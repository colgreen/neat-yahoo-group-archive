The best result I got was a draw\nwith me (I am not=\r\n a good player) and I wasn&#39;t really concentrating -\nso the fact that this d=\r\nid very well against another, albeit, virtual\nplayer is fascinating\n\nMy que=\r\nstion is about the 3rd layer, the single node, what co-ordinates\ndo you fee=\r\nd into the CPNN in conjuction with those that come from the\nhidden layer?  =\r\nAll the other co-ordinates make sense, I just need\npointing in the right di=\r\nrection.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kst=\r\nanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with you new r=\r\nesults with\n&gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAA=\r\nI\n&gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt; Cr=\r\nitical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;  The paper\n&gt; is a=\r\nvailable here:\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?option=3Dcom_content&=\r\ntask=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=3D28#gauci.aaai08\n&gt; \n&gt; Or for a direct link:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/gauci_aaai08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; This paper demonstra=\r\ntes HyperNEAT in a more interesting domain\n&gt; (checkers) than our introducto=\r\nry papers from last year and introduces\n&gt; an effective method to evolve sub=\r\nstrates with a hidden layer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jason is also planning to release the sou=\r\nrce code for this domain,\n&gt; although we do not have an exact release date a=\r\nt this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those familiar with AI conferences will also notice that =\r\nin fact this\n&gt; paper appears in AAAI, which is more associated with mainstr=\r\neam AI. \n&gt; That they accepted a paper in this area is a hopeful sign that\n&gt;=\r\n evolutionary computation and even indirect encoding can in fact\n&gt; succeed =\r\nin the larger AI community.  We are grateful to the reviewers\n&gt; and chairs =\r\nat AAAI for keeping an open mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additional HyperNEAT publications wi=\r\nll be made available soon as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
