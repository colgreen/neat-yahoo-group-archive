Most \nof the time, it seems to get caught into an infinite loop and just \nprints &quot;** DEPTH NOT DETERMINED FOR NETWORK WITH LOOP&quot; to the \nscreen.  Only once has this not happened, and has a xor_winner file \nbeen generated.\n\nI&#39;m thinking that there must be something wrong with the NNode::depth\n() method.  Can anyone help me in this area?  Any ideas for \nalternative code for this method?\n\nCheers,\nRobert.\n\n\n"}}
