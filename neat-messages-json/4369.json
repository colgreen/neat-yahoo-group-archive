I th=\r\nink Kenneth De Jong&#39;s textbook, &quot;Evolutionary\nComputation: A Unified Perspe=\r\nctive&quot; examines it.\n\nHowever, of course as people have pointed out in NEAT =\r\nit&#39;s not just a\nquestion of a healthy population but of healthy species, si=\r\nnce each\nspecies is like its own little population.  In other words, the\nsp=\r\necies need enough internal diversity to drive their own\nexplorations.  My o=\r\nwn rule of thumb has been a minimum of 15 members\nper species (on average) =\r\nto keep them healthy.  I&#39;m sure 30 is even\nsafer.  \n\nAnother thing to note =\r\nis that the population size you need can vary\nwildly by problem and it can =\r\nbe surprising.  For pole balancing, it\nturns out that you can solve it fast=\r\nest with a minuscule population of\nsize under 20 total (that&#39;s for the whol=\r\ne population!).   That is\nbecause smaller populations are greedier (they co=\r\nncentrate resources\non a small part of the search space) and apparently pol=\r\ne balancing\nbenefits greatly from greedy search.  However, that is a specif=\r\nic\nproperty of pole balancing and I would not expect it to carry over to\nmo=\r\nre significant domains.  Surely in some domains having a population\nover 10=\r\n00 would lead to the most interesting results, if only you can\nafford the l=\r\nuxury of the added computational cost of a large population.\n\nken\n\n--- In n=\r\neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s funny.
