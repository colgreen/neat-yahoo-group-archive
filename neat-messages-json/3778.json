Maybe I have not understood all the backgrou=\r\nnd.\nWhat I tried to explain is that looking the code the substrate simply\ng=\r\nenerates the connections for a static structure network. So, in a\nsimple wa=\r\ny, I was thinking if using it as an activation function (in\nthis case it wi=\r\nll have one input and one output) would have given some\nresult.\nThe connect=\r\nion in the network would be fixed, giving a &quot;hierarchy&quot; in\nthe list of inpu=\r\nt, and the substrate (as activation function) would\ngenerate the complexity=\r\n. But maybe is not in this way :P\nThanks,\n\nLuca\n\n\n"}}
