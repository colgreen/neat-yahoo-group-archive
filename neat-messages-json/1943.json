Since neural nets and gas \nare largely considered research and development areas in the private \nsector, companies are likely to seek out people with research \nbackgrounds in those areas to fill such positions.  I think there \nare a lot of industries with an interest in neural networks, but a \nlot of them fund research at universities instead of doing the \nresearch themselves.  On the other hand, there are a few companies \nthat work specifically with neural networks or evolutionary \ncomputation.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Roger R.

They have a\n&gt; &gt; very strong group in the area, especially when it\n&gt; &gt; comes to evolving\n&gt; &gt; neural nets for autonomous agents (as opposed to\n&gt; &gt; pure pattern\n&gt; &gt; recognition), and a lot of interdisciplinarity -\n&gt; &gt; people from biology,\n&gt; &gt; philosophy and informatics really take an interest\n&gt; &gt; in each other&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; work.
