Anders also visited us at the EPlex lab at U=\r\nCF for one semester last year while working on the project.  \n\nIn the proje=\r\nct, the shape of what roughly correspond to an iris and retina are evolved =\r\nand specified by CPPNs.  The results, which you can see easily by browsing =\r\nthe pictures in the thesis, are surprisingly plausible.  Of course, since t=\r\nhe evolution of the eye is a popular subject in evolutionary theory, it is =\r\ninteresting to see an algorithm actually evolve the shape of an eye.\n\nThe q=\r\nuestion it raises to me is what other types of objects can be evolved throu=\r\ngh CPPNs other than the traditional ones we are concentrating on in the pre=\r\nsent.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
