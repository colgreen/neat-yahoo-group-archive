I have reduced my experiment to a=\r\n single input, no hidden layer, and a single output trying to figure this o=\r\nut.  I really hate to spend twice the time evovling my network because I&#39;m =\r\nspending half the time testing a 2nd output that never gets used.  \n\n\n--- I=\r\nn neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOn 6 February 2012 13:36, gotnobluemilk &lt;gotnobluemilk@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n// Read bias connection weight from output 1.\n&gt; &gt; double weight =3D outputS=\r\nignalArr[1];\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Should this be outputSignalArr[0]?

The CPPN\n&gt; a=\r\nccepts inputs describing the coordinates of the source and target\n&gt; nodes w=\r\nithin the substrate. Output [0] is the connection strength\n&gt; between the so=\r\nurce and target, output [1] is the strength of the bias\n&gt; connection going =\r\nin to the target node.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are trying to evaluate the CPPN directly=\r\n then ignoring the\n&gt; second output is probably the easiest approach, unless=\r\n you wish to\n&gt; improve the performance by eliminating it. I think this is e=\r\nasy to do\n&gt; as the number of outputs on the CPPN is defined on each\n&gt; IGuiN=\r\neatExperiment (or INeatExperiment) class, on the OutputCount\n&gt; property, he=\r\nnce it&#39;s not fixed for SharpNEAT as a whole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; Col=\r\nin.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
