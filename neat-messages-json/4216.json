Once the Breve s=\r\nimulation\n&gt; is finished, it returns the fitness for each individual.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\no it&#39;s a two-step problem: first set-up your environment within\n&gt; Breve, as=\r\n you&#39;d do in a normal experiment; then you define a fitness\n&gt; function to l=\r\noad that environment every time you need to evaluate the\n&gt; population. Thin=\r\nk of Breve as the &quot;evaluator&quot; and not part of NEAT.\n&gt; It&#39;s a completely sep=\r\narated module.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have interest, we can send you the code.
