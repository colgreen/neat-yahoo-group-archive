I only skimmed the patent,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Briefly looking over their method, it doesn&#39;t look very principled.  I\n&gt; &gt;mean it just seems like a glorified GP implementation.  Every once in\n&gt; &gt;a while I see a site like this with very little detail but lots of\n&gt; &gt;grandiose claims about changing the world.  You get the sense they\n&gt; &gt;aren&#39;t aware of what&#39;s going on in the research world, because they\n&gt; &gt;seem to think their idea is one-of-a-kind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; But what about the patent? I&#39;m not sure how the system works in the US \n&gt; but over here in the UK patent applications cost not an insignifacnt \n&gt; amount of money - I seem to remember figures in the thousands of pounds \n&gt; when I have discussed this in the past. Perhaps they just have more \n&gt; money (to throw about) than sense :)\n&gt; \n\nTrue, I shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions without knowing about the\npatent, but as you know lots of things get patented that aren&#39;t\nnecessarily useful.  And in this field, it&#39;s especially unlikely that\nsomething is useful just because it&#39;s original, since there are a\nmillion mediocre variations of implementations that haven&#39;t been\npatented yet. But anyway my comments were based only on what the\nauthor said about his method; the patent could be different.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
