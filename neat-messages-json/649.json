Anyway\nthis \n&gt; situation should be resolvable by extending the trials to contain \n&gt; further more difficult tests or by switching completely to a more \n&gt; difficult trial  i.e.incremental evolution.  In fact I may be able\nto \n&gt; revert to my original randomized trials once a good population has\nbeen \n&gt; found.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
