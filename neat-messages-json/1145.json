The man wakes up slowly, reaches over and \nfeels the windowpane, and decides it is warm enough to skip his \nthermal underwear. He yawns and dresses and goes out for his morning \njog. When he comes back, he showers, cooks himself a scrambled egg, \nand settles down on the sofa with The Essays of E. B. White. Around \nnoon, he rides his bike to the bookstore. He spends a couple of hours \nthere, just poking around the books. Then he pedals back through the \nlittle town, past his house, and to the lake. \n\nWhen the woman woke up this morning, she got out of bed and went \nimmediately to her easel, where she picked up her pastels and set to \nwork on her painting. After an hour, she is satisfied with the light \neffect and quits to have breakfast. She dresses quickly and walks to \na nearby store to buy shutters for her bathroom. At the store, she \nmeets friends and has lunch with them. Afterward, she wants to be \nalone and drives to the lake. \n\nNow, the man and the woman stand on the wooden dock, gazing at the \nlake and the waves on the water. They haven&#39;t noticed each other. \n\nThe man turns. And so begins the sequence of events informing him of \nher. Light reflected from her body instantly enters the pupils of his \neyes, at the rate of ten trillion particles of light per second. Once \nthrough the pupil of each eye, the light travels through an oval-\nshaped lens, then through a transparent, jellylike substance filling \nup the eyeball, and lands on the retina. Here it is gathered by one \nhundred million rod and cone cells. \n\nCells in the path of the reflected highlights receive a great deal of \nlight; cells falling in the shadows of the reflected scene receive \nvery little. The woman&#39;s lips, for example, are just now glistening \nin the sunlight, reflecting light of high intensity onto a tiny patch \nof cells slightly northeast of back center of the man&#39;s retina. The \nedges around her mouth, on the other hand, are rather dark, so that \ncells neighboring the northeast path receive much less light. \n\nEach particle of light ends its journey in the eye upon meeting a \nretinene molecule, consisting of 20 carbon atoms, 28 hydrogen atoms, \nand 1 oxygen atom. In its dormant condition, each retinene molecule \nis attached to a protein molecule and has a twist between the \neleventh and fifteenth carbon atoms. But when light strikes it, as is \nnow happening in about 30,000 trillion retinene molecules every \nsecond, the molecule straightens out and separates from its protein. \nAfter several intermediate steps, it wraps into a twist again, \nawaiting arrival of a new particle of light. Far less than a \nthousandth of a second has elapsed since the man saw the woman. \n\nTriggered by the dance of the retinene molecules, the nerve cells, or \nneurons, respond. First in the eye and then in the brain. One neuron, \nfor instance, has just gone into action. Protein molecules on its \nsurface suddenly change their shape, blocking the flow of positively \ncharged sodium atoms from the surrounding body fluid. This change in \nflow of electrically charged atoms produces a change in voltage that \nshudders through the cell. After a distance of a fraction of an inch, \nthe electrical signal reaches the end of the neuron, altering the \nrelease of specific molecules, which migrate a distance of a hundred-\nthousandth of an inch until they reach the next neuron, passing along \nthe news. \n\nThe woman, in fact, holds her hands by her sides and tilts her head \nat an angle of five and a half degrees. Her hair falls just to her \nshoulders. This information and much, much more is exactingly encoded \nby the electrical pulses in the various neurons of the man&#39;s eyes. \n\nIn another few thousandths of a second, the electrical signals reach \nthe ganglion neurons, which bunch together in the optic nerve at the \nback of the eye and carry their data to the brain. Here, the impulses \nrace to the primary visual cortex, a highly folded layer of tissue \nabout a tenth of an inch thick and two square inches in area, \ncontaining one hundred million neurons in half a dozen layers. The \nfourth layer receives the input first, does a preliminary analysis, \nand transfers the information to neurons in other layers. At every \nstage, each neuron may receive signals from a thousand other neurons, \ncombine the signals - some of which cancel each other out - and \ndispatch the computed result to a thousand-odd other neurons. \n\nAfter about thirty seconds - after several hundred trillion particles \nof reflected light have entered the man&#39;s eyes and been processed - \nthe woman says hello. Immediately, molecules of air are pushed \ntogether, then apart, then together, beginning in her vocal cords and \ntraveling in a spring like motion to the man&#39;s ears. The sound makes \nthe trip from her to him (twenty feet) in a fiftieth of a second. \n\nWithin each of his ears, the vibrating air quickly covers the \ndistance to the eardrum. The eardrum, an oval membrane about .3 inch \nin diameter and tilted fifty-five degrees from the floor of the \nauditory canal, itself begins trembling and transmits its motion to \nthree tiny bones. From there, the vibrations shake the fluid in the \ncochlea, which spirals snail-like two and a half turns around. \n\nInside the cochlea the tones are deciphered. Here, a very thin \nmembrane undulates in step with the sloshing fluid, and through this \nbasilar membrane run tiny filaments of varying thickness, like \nstrings on a harp. The woman&#39;s voice, from afar, is playing this \nharp. Her hello begins in a low registers and rises in pitch toward \nthe end. In precise response, the thick filaments in the basilar \nmembrane vibrate first, followed by the thinner ones. Finally, tens \nof thousands of rod-shaped bodies perched on the basilar membrane \nconvey their particular quiverings to the auditory nerve. \n\nNews of the woman&#39;s hello, in electrical form, races along the \nneurons of the auditory nerve and enters the man&#39;s brain, through the \nthalamus, to a specialized region of the cerebral cortex for further \nprocessing. Eventually, a large fraction of the trillion neurons in \nthe man&#39;s brain become involved with computing the visual and \nauditory data just acquired. Sodium and potassium gates open and \nclose. Electrical currents speed along neuron fibers. Molecules flow \nfrom one nerve ending to the next. \n\nAll of this is known. What is not known is why, after about a minute, \nthe man walks over to the woman and smiles.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
