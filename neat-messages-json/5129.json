Because the number of offspring that a =\r\nspecies\n&gt; &gt; will produce collectively is proportional to its average fitnes=\r\ns (which\n&gt; &gt; follows from fitness sharing in NEAT), scaling fitness in diff=\r\nerent ways\n&gt; &gt; will cause offspring to be allocated to species in different=\r\n proportions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think there is a harm in exponential fitness =\r\nif you want to\n&gt; &gt; emphasize the curve in certain ways. The same motivation=\r\ns that apply in\n&gt; &gt; regulars EAs can apply to NEAT.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, the pl=\r\nace where fitness scales can hamper NEAT is if they are\n&gt; &gt; proportionally =\r\ntoo narrow. For example, if every species has an average\n&gt; &gt; fitness betwee=\r\nn 1001 and 1005, then they will look practically the same to\n&gt; &gt; fitness sh=\r\naring and will all get roughly the same number of offspring. In\n&gt; &gt; that ca=\r\nse, speciation won&#39;t really distinguish much between better and worse\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\npecies. However, if the average fitnesses were instead between 1 and 5,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n then the allocations would vary a lot, with many more offspring going to t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; 5 species than the 1 (because 5 is 5 times 1).

Of course the code\n&gt; &gt; is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit complicated and figuring out w=\r\nhat it does is difficult to do\n&gt; &gt; quickly. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular here are =\r\ncorrections for b and c:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (b) Species are not killed off if =\r\ntheir average fitness falls below a\n&gt; &gt; certain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level. Rather, ther=\r\ne is a rule that, if turned on, would kill off a\n&gt; &gt; species\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if its=\r\n maximum fitness has not improved in some number of generations.\n&gt; &gt; That\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; is a way to dump stagnant species.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (c) &quot;Stolen babie=\r\ns&quot; is almost never used in any experiment that I have\n&gt; &gt; seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; publ=\r\nished or published myself, so it isn&#39;t really an important\n&gt; &gt; mechanism.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; However, it is a way to increase greediness. As Daniel rightly infer=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t steal actual genetic code from one species, but r=\r\nather it\n&gt; &gt; steals the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *right* to reproduce from the worse species=\r\n and redistributes that\n&gt; &gt; right to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the better ones. So sort of Ro=\r\nbin Hood in reverse (steal from the poor\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help the rich).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of &quot;weighting the number of offspring produced toward=\r\ns the\n&gt; &gt; stronger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; species,&quot; that is correct, but that is just a pr=\r\noperty of fitness\n&gt; &gt; sharing,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which NEAT uses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In =\r\ngeneral, the most important selection mechanism in NEAT is in fact\n&gt; &gt; fitn=\r\ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sharing, which makes it difficult for good species to take over=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; population because individuals must share the fitne=\r\nss of their species.\n&gt; &gt; So as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a species gets bigger, the fitness o=\r\nf everyone within it drops. I would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consider fitness sharing essent=\r\nial to NEAT&#39;s &quot;identity.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, all fitness sharing does=\r\n is adjust the fitnesses of everyone\n&gt; &gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; population. So afte=\r\nr that, there is still a need to decide how many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; offpspring individ=\r\nuals get. It is at this point that versions of NEAT\n&gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diverge=\r\n and I do not have a strong opinion because I do not consider\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; choice essential to NEAT&#39;s identity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my own implement=\r\nations, first, offspring numbers are assigned on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; per-species basi=\r\ns (proportionally to *adjusted* fitness after fitness\n&gt; &gt; sharing)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand then they are assigned within to species to individuals. My version\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT usually uses truncation selection within species. So it ju=\r\nst cuts\n&gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bottom n% of the species from being eligible to=\r\n reproduce and the\n&gt; &gt; rest get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to reproduce. (rtNEAT is different =\r\nof course since it only produces one\n&gt; &gt; at a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time - it probabilist=\r\nic). The remaining individuals are selected as\n&gt; &gt; parents\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; randomly=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps most appealing for me about this approach is the =\r\nidea that each\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; species can be treated as its own little mini-popula=\r\ntion in which\n&gt; &gt; whatever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selection scheme you choose is implement=\r\ned. I think it makes conceptual\n&gt; &gt; sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to think of a species as =\r\na population because *within* a species one\n&gt; &gt; wants the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same kind=\r\n of healthy phenomena to happen that one wants in a regular GA\n&gt; &gt; with a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; full population.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, you could alternatively =\r\nchoose roulette wheel selection\n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; species (after adjusting=\r\n fitness for fitness sharing) or something\n&gt; &gt; else. That\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choice is=\r\n not that important, and I have tried a number of schemes and\n&gt; &gt; found\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; that, at least with NEAT, it makes limited difference which one is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n chosen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the fitness sharing is still key.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So J=\r\neff, there is no simple to answer to &quot;what kind of selection scheme\n&gt; &gt; doe=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEAT use&quot; because it is a multi-level scheme that first acts at t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speciation and then at the level of individuals wit=\r\nhin species. So no\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket terms really covers the whole th=\r\ning. To distill it to a short\n&gt; &gt; phrase,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps we could say it u=\r\nses &quot;fitness sharing and any other scheme\n&gt; &gt; after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitness-sharing=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Daniel Tuohy\n&gt; &gt; &lt;danielr2e@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m helping with the overhaul of JNeat.
