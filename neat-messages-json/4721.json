I am ex=\r\nperimenting with co-evolutions of higher level\n&gt; constructs=A0GA&#39;s and TWEA=\r\nNNs=A0and comparing them with low level mathematical\n&gt; graph constructs=A0(=\r\nrepresentations).\n\nIt did occur to me that the connection IDs are redundant=\r\n information\nin representing a graph. Say we are using 32bit integers for t=\r\nhe node\nIDs, then a connection can be represented by the two nodes at it&#39;s\n=\r\nendpoints to form a single 64bit integer to act as the connection ID.\nAnywa=\r\ny, this and my separating of the connection and node ID spaces\ndoes mean yo=\r\nu lose the order in which connections were added, eitehr\ncompletely in the =\r\nendpoint ID case or relatve to the node IDs in the\ncase of separate ID spac=\r\nes/counters.\n\nI hadn&#39;t really considered order of element addition to be im=\r\nportant,\nwhich from the point of view of an EA trying to find a solution it=\r\n\nisn&#39;t. But it may be useful information for research into the NEAT\nmethod =\r\nitself.\n\n\n&gt; Finally, I have turned my=A0HyperNEAT=A0inspired TWEANN=A0loose=\r\n on the problem\n&gt; space of configuring the=A0hybrid, heterogeneous compute =\r\nclusters in solving\n&gt; the dynamics of partitioning the data and tasks given=\r\n various contexts\n&gt; (schedules of experiments, priorities, the existing con=\r\nfiguration\n&gt; capabilities of the cluster hardware) to see if it can evolve =\r\nbetter\n&gt; &quot;compute fabrics&quot; than I can hard-code=A0using the parallel_for lo=\r\nops on the\n&gt; CPUs (used in distributing code modules)=A0and various CUDA st=\r\nructures on the\n&gt; GPUs.=A0 That answers so far=A0have been humbling.\n\n\nInte=\r\nresting.
