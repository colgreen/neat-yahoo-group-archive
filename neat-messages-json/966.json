For\n&gt; &gt; example, A-B-Z and A-C-Z\n&gt; &gt; where C and B are siblings.  The only way you could\n&gt; &gt; construct such a network\n&gt; &gt; with this approach is to support removing nodes\n&gt; &gt; and/or connections.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure that the A-B-Z and A-C-Z could evolve\n&gt;just fine.  They just have to come from both mutation\n&gt;and crossover not strictly mutation of one individual.\n\nIf I understand crossover correctly, which I may not, no new structure is \nadded by crossover.  The &#39;extra&#39; stuff comes from the more fit parent.  The \nonly thing that comes from the less fit parent amounts to some portion of \nthe connection weights of connections that already existed in the more fit \nparent.\n\nYes, the sub-structure A-B|C-Z could evolve.  But you can&#39;t start with A and \nZ and end up with it.  C would have to be connected to something else, \nfirst, and then get connected to A and Z, and then have its connection to \nthat other thing lost.  And then that other thing has to go away.  So, no, \nyou can&#39;t form that simple structure without deletions.\n\n&gt;I have been working on an implementation of NEAT in\n&gt;python.  It tracks uniqueness of structural\n&gt;innovations from start to finish.\n&gt;\n&gt;When a new node is added via mutation it is assigned\n&gt;an id based on the connection it split.  If that\n&gt;connection has been split previously the new node gets\n&gt;the same id as the last time it was split.  If the\n&gt;connection hasn&#39;t been split before the next\n&gt;sequentially available node id is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;When a new connection is added it checks to see if a\n&gt;connection between the chosen endpoints has been made\n&gt;before, the same innovation number is used, if no prio\n&gt;connection between the endpoints has been made, the\n&gt;next sequentially available innovation number is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;The implementation checkpoints the entire state of the\n&gt;evolutionary process every N generations and can be\n&gt;restarted from any checkpoint.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m not sure how my handling of new structure relates\n&gt;to the ongoing discussion exactly but it may be of use\n&gt;to someone.\n\nIt&#39;s exactly what I had proposed doing.  So, how does it compare?  Do you \nhave any statistics on number of generations required to solve the reference \nproblems?\n\n\n\n"}}
