Doing this will save you a lot of deb=\r\nugging \n&gt; time at the end, because if you only start debugging after the wh=\r\nole \n&gt; thing is created it will be very difficult to tease apart all the \n&gt;=\r\n interlocking parts to find what&#39;s causing a bug.\n\nOr to take it to the log=\r\nical (?) extreme: write a piece of test code\nthat will show the code to be =\r\nworking before you actually write the\ncode. That way you&#39;ll have a complete=\r\n test pack that you&#39;ll be able to\nuse to check you don&#39;t break anything as =\r\nyou progress.
