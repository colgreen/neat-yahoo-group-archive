It is certainly one possible approach.  The \nrepresentation isssue you bring up though is a problem for all of \nconnectionism and machine learning in general: how should states be \nrepresented?  There is no single answer or method for deciding on \nrepresentation and many times it comes down to an art form, and \ngetting practice at seeing how different representations work with \nNN&#39;s.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Chad Bohannan&quot; &lt;chad@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; so let me try to summarize what you said.\n&gt; If I find a network that achieves some minimum fitness, adding new \nnodes\n&gt; and continuing the search would be the best way to minimize the \nsearch\n&gt; time.\n&gt; I do not, as you said, already have a monochrome network. I want \nto find\n&gt; a color network in a comparable amount of time to a monochrome \nnetwork. \n&gt; Are there ways of using previously discovered topologies to speed \nup\n&gt; searches? Something that comes to mind from colins advice is to \nhave\n&gt; stratified features, and when one stratus of inputs reaches an\n&gt; acceptable fitness, freeze evolution on those elements, and force \nthe\n&gt; new stratus of features to evolve around the previous features. \nThis\n&gt; would keep the dimensionality the same, and assuming that each \nstratus\n&gt; was of comparable size, the search time would only increase \nlinearly to\n&gt; the number of additional inputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I way out of my league, or is this in the right direction?\n&gt; \n&gt; Chad\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;-----Original Message-----&gt; \n&gt; From: Colin Green\n&gt; Sent: 5/5/2004 3:19:50 AM\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] differentiation\n&gt; \n&gt; Chad Bohannan wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; how do you differentiate between similar types of information \nwith\n&gt; NEAT?\n&gt; &gt; I understand that the input should represent intensity, but what \nif I \n&gt; &gt; want to add more information? For instance: color.\n&gt; &gt; The only approach I see is to just tack on inputs that begin the \nsame \n&gt; &gt; as any other input. For a three color system, the eye just got \nthree \n&gt; &gt; times many more dimensions complicated. Is there any way to \nscale from\n&gt; &gt; a monochromatic solution to a color solution, without forcing a \nnew \n&gt; &gt; search?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Chad, I would keep the monochromatic input and attach 3 new \ncolor \n&gt; signals. That way previously evolved genomes can be used (with the \nnew \n&gt; inputs added) in the start population and mainatian their existing \n&gt; functionality. You also might want to look at different color \n&gt; representation systems, Red/Green/Blue is the system used in \nbiological \n&gt; eyes (or most of them AFAIK) but there are other schemes such as \n&gt; Hue/Saturation//Brightness. So for instance in *that* scheme the \n&gt; monochromatic input is effectively a brightness input so you only \nneed \n&gt; two more inputs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
