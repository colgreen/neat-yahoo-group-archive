I don&#39;t know much about \nthese, but you say in your research & theory section, &quot;The success \nof the Evolved ESN approach can be compared to that of the NEAT \nalgorithm on identical morphology.&quot;  It sounds as if you will evolve \nthis ESN networok...so my question is, why not evolve it with NEAT?\n\nOne last thing is I can&#39;t view your videos no matter what I do.  Are \nthey available in any other format?

I use\n&gt; &gt; training wheels (applying forces to the torso when the\n&gt; &gt; center of mass moves too far) at first until they\n&gt; &gt; learn to oscillate their legs reasonably well.  Then I\n&gt; &gt; remove this external help, seed a new population with\n&gt; &gt; the champ, and continue without the support.  It seems\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m curious why you restart the population rather than just \nchanging the \n&gt; fitness function in the middle of the run?  Is it that you want to \n&gt; whittle away all but the best species?  Are the genes in the first \nrun \n&gt; treated differently in the second run somehow?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; to help to focus evolution on one thing at a time\n&gt; &gt; (first oscillate legs, then worry about\n&gt; &gt; balancing/moving forward) for this task.  Kind of like\n&gt; &gt; teach an infant to walk by holding his/her hands.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Also, how are you choosing the morphology?  The\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; block torso seems to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; swing forward, and that makes sense, since walking\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; is mostly leaning\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; forward and catching yourself with your feet.  But\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; does the ANN\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; controller only control the legs or also the torso\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; joint (which\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; probably needs to swing back to slow the gait or\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; stop)?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The ANN only controls the two hip joints that connect\n&gt; &gt; the thighs to the torso, each having one degree of\n&gt; &gt; rotational freedom.  So there are just two outputs\n&gt; &gt; from the ANN.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;torso joint&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; just the two hip joints.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My ANN outputs desired joint angles, and I use a\n&gt; &gt; modified PID (proportional integral derivative)\n&gt; &gt; controller to calculate the torque necessary to\n&gt; &gt; achieve that angle.  This sort of simulates a\n&gt; &gt; higher-level control system: the brain has desired\n&gt; &gt; angles, but it doesn&#39;t need to think about exactly how\n&gt; &gt; much force/torque to apply.  The springy ankles use\n&gt; &gt; the same type of controller but just have a constant\n&gt; &gt; desired angle, so they constantly try to maintain that\n&gt; &gt; angle.  The knee joints have no controller; they just\n&gt; &gt; swing freely. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing some similar stuff lately, same intent, but some \n&gt; different specifics from Tyler&#39;s.  FWIW, NEAT is the best \ncontroller \n&gt; evolver I&#39;ve found so far. :-)  If anybody&#39;s interested, there&#39;s a \n&gt; couple animations up now:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://pantarhei.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Brian Dexter Allen\n&gt; http://www.luminousbeings.com/\n\n\n"}}
