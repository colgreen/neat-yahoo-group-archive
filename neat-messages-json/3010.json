I am researching using NEAT for time series\npredi=\r\nction.\n\nI have been lurking in the group for the past few months. I&#39;ve got =\r\na\nfew questions/suggestions that I&#39;ll post as three separate messages. \n\nI =\r\nam wondering if anyone has tried using a variable mutation rate?\nBasically =\r\nif the system determines that overall the fitness rate\nchange has gone belo=\r\nw a threshold value. Then increase the chance of\nnew nodes being added and =\r\nincrease the range of weight variations\nuntil the fitness begins to improve=\r\n again. Then lower the system wide\nmutation rate back down again once there=\r\n has been an improvement.\n\nThe way I see it when the system begins to stagn=\r\nate. Instead of\ncontinuing to fine tune the system. Start making some much =\r\nmore\nradical changes.\n\nAnother way to do this might be too increase the num=\r\nber of species\nbased of the rate change of fitness. Essentially start with =\r\nmany\nspecies then lower the overall number of species and increase their\npo=\r\npulations when you want to fine tune the solutions. But if there\nhasn&#39;t bee=\r\nn any improvements for a significant amount of time start\nincreasing the va=\r\nriety of topologies (ie increase the number of\nspecies) until there are som=\r\ne improvements.\n\nI searched the archives but didn&#39;t find any topics exactly=\r\n matching\nthis. Sorry if it has been discussed ad nauseum. Please point me =\r\nin\nthe right direction if this topic has been flogged to death!\n\nThank you,=\r\n\n\nShane Ryan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
