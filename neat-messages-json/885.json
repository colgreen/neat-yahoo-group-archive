One good free\none is cmix (not to be confused with the music language of the same name),\nhttp://www.diku.dk/forskning/topps/activities/cmix/ which I&#39;ve used on\nvarious occasions.\n\nNow, it true that a specializer will be unlikely to use the matrix\nmanipulations mentioned elsewhere to optimize the network, but given the\nNEAT network evaluator and a particular network, it should be able to turn\nit into much more optimal code.\n\n(nb. One rather fun use of cmix is to use it on a high-level language\ninterpreter and turn it into a compiler.)\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
