In a stagnant situation, you do not have information (i.e. a =\r\ngradient) suggesting which direction is right to go.  Therefore, the most p=\r\nrincipled response is to expand your options while never putting all your e=\r\nggs in one basket.  When fitness is stagnant, we cannot know if further sea=\r\nrch within the currently dimensionality might eventually find a solution, o=\r\nr if the current dimensionality is insufficient and contains no solution at=\r\n all.  In the latter case, the number of nodes and connections would need t=\r\no ascend to higher dimensionality.  Because we do not know which case we ar=\r\ne in when stagnation occurs, the best idea is to try both:  Some species st=\r\nart arriving with bigger networks while others keep searching in the same o=\r\nld spaces.  Thus, we would expect the *range* of sizes to increase along wi=\r\nth the average size.  \n\nYour situation with nondeterminism is probably some=\r\nwhat similar, causing the average size of solutions to go up because of sta=\r\ngnation.  However, because the champion will keep changing with the randomi=\r\nzed evaluation, you will observe this phenomenon in the champion itself.  T=\r\nhe more noisy it is, the more it is probably observable (i.e. because the m=\r\nore &quot;random&quot; it is who happens to look best at any given time, in effect le=\r\nading to a kind of sampling of the population through the champion).  \n\nOf =\r\ncourse, that may not be a complete explanation for the steep angle of the i=\r\nncline.  I would guess that nondeterminism is also causing a general unheal=\r\nthiness about the evolutionary process overall. Nondeterminism is highly de=\r\nstructive to evolutionary algorithms.  This issue is controversial (even wi=\r\nthin my own group!) but my personal opinion is one should avoid nondetermin=\r\nism unless it is absolutely essential.  For example, you can choose a rando=\r\nm order of examples but then subject everyone to the same random set - a ki=\r\nnd of &quot;deterministic randomness.&quot;  Of course, you are banking on the impart=\r\niality of randomness to give you maximal generality, but it will often be o=\r\nutweighed by its unhealthy side effects on the population.  So I&#39;m guessing=\r\n that part of the phenomenon is just a side-effect of an inconsistent evalu=\r\nation scheme leading to relative chaos.\n\nThere may also be more to it; it m=\r\nerits further investigation as well.\n\nken \n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nJeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Ken-\n&gt; \n&gt; I am plotting the number=\r\n of CPPN nodes in the generation champion.\n&gt; \n&gt; This fitness function is no=\r\nt deterministic (here I am running the bit\n&gt; mirroring problem, and I rando=\r\nmly generate 10 different sets of inputs per\n&gt; organism per generation).

The ch=\r\nanging\n&gt; environments, however, have the runaway CPPN bloat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there =\r\nsomething in NEAT that causes bloat unless you have elitism\n&gt; counteracting=\r\n it?

If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the same=\r\n champion stick around\n&gt; &gt; unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new indi=\r\nviduals occasionally come in\n&gt; &gt; with the same fitness as the champion, but=\r\n it would be very surprising if that\n&gt; &gt; is happening on every single gener=\r\nation.  Yet that would seem to be the only\n&gt; &gt; possibility with the number =\r\nof champion nodes going up so rapidly even while\n&gt; &gt; fitness is flatlined. =\r\n So what is going on during the fitness plateau?  Which\n&gt; &gt; genomes exactly=\r\n are being measured to get the node counts?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently that the n=\r\number\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of time\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory =\r\nof the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; run. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; https://www.m=\r\nsu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets rea=\r\nlly pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt; &gt;&gt; every 100 gene=\r\nrations, such as here:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-No=\r\nde-Bloat-2.png\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second=\r\n figure where the CPPN node\n&gt; &gt;&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing=\r\n environment and those runs where\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a =\r\nhealthy level) are in a constant\n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Are any of yo=\r\nu seeing such bloat?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One problem is that it makes the runs slow =\r\nto a crawl, because running\n&gt; &gt;&gt; populations with 200-node genomes is reall=\r\ny slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evolution can make too much progress with th=\r\nat many nodes (although I have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; seen fitness continue to increase even =\r\nwith such large genomes).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have tried dropping the MutateAddNod=\r\neProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that definitely changes the slope =\r\nof the line, but it still linearly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; increases. The good news is that it=\r\n does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Any thoughts? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan =\r\nState University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
