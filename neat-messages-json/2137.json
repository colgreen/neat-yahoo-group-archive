Now, when this\n&gt;happens species will arrive at the species droppoff age and will be\n&gt;dropped from the population. Eventually the number of species will drop\n&gt;below the minimum species threshold and so to compensate (this is\n&gt;SharpNEAT but I think this is close to other implementations) the genome\n&gt;compatibility threshold is lowered and this has the effect of splitting\n&gt;some species.\n&gt;\n&gt;Now this depends on the fitness space, but it seems to me that it&#39;s\n&gt;likely these new species will get stuck in the same local peaks,\n&gt;especially if they are very deep and/or broad, since they are spawned\n&gt;off of species that are already stuck. Thus I was thinking that a pool\n&gt;of dead species (or a token genome from each, say the species champ)\n&gt;could be kept and that we could implement some mechanism for avoiding\n&gt;the area of the fitness space represented by these genomes - using the\n&gt;genome compatibility function.\n&gt;\n&gt;I need to think through the specifics on this but it seems to make sense\n&gt;because it forces the search into new areas (or it could if implemented\n&gt;properly). The problem is how do we ensure we generate new genomes that\n&gt;are sufficiently different enough from the dead species to go and\n&gt;explore new areas of the search space? The answer may lie within the\n&gt;above discussion(s).\n\nWe (you don&#39;t know who) considered this years ago as part of searching \nprotein folding configuration spaces (200+ dimensions) but we never tried it.\n\nCall it an &quot;Enforced Exploration&quot; phase.\n\nThe idea was (this was in the context of steepest-descents or simulated \nannealing) to introduce an artificial force that drove the system away from \none energy minimum (c.f. fitness peak).  We theorised that we would know \nwhen we had driven the system far enough, if when we released it, it did \nnot fall back into the same optimum...\n\nOf course, you could then chase the new optimum as far as was constructive, \ndecide to drive away from it was well, and find you had got into a cycle \nwhere you ended up back in the original one.\n\nBUT...\n\nWhat if we kept exemplars of previous successful species in a list such as \nyou were using for your TTT fitness assessments.  Then we could drive away \nfrom all of them during the EE-phase...\n\nThe other take I considered on the same thing was to wonder whether one \ncould formulate a modification of the molecular energy function (c.f. \nfitness function) that would specifically remove one minimum (peak) from \nthe landscape.  Obviously not in the general case but since we are \ndesigning that function ourselves...\n\n&gt; &gt; But people who are too different, will have\n&gt; &gt;(presumably minor) &quot;competing conventions&quot; problems and thus cannot so\n&gt; &gt;usefully &quot;merge their genetic and cultural differences&quot; with your own.  The\n&gt; &gt;Borg never mentioned that part, did they :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;The borg are overrated IMO -  they were defeated by suggesting they take\n&gt;a nap in the middle of a battle as I recall :)\n\nWell they were very opposed to speciation...\n\n         Ian\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
