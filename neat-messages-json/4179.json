You\nswitched to\n&gt; zero-G and you swi=\r\ntched to looking for oscillations. Do I have that\nright?\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of curios=\r\nity, did you try just searching for oscillations but not\n&gt; switching to zer=\r\no-G? Alternately, did you try taking some of your\nwalkers\n&gt; from zero-G and=\r\n then turning gravity on?\n&gt; \n&gt; This raises an interesting question in novel=\r\nty search research: how\ncan you\n&gt; use a good seed organism to kick-start a =\r\nprocess? If you have a\nwalker that\n&gt; moves a few steps away and then falls,=\r\n it seems that the beginning of\n&gt; novelty search will simply reward the eas=\r\ny discovery of all the points\n&gt; around center. So, instead of working on th=\r\ne walker&#39;s genome and moving\n&gt; farther out, it will revert to producing all=\r\n the &#39;fall left&#39;, &#39;fall\nright&#39;,\n&gt; etc since that is the low hanging fruit. =\r\nOnce all that low hanging\nfruit is\n&gt; gone, the genome of the walker is prob=\r\nably lost. There would be a\nchance of\n&gt; recovering it, I guess, if you peri=\r\nodically resurrected archive\nindividuals\n&gt; when the population is stagnatin=\r\ng.

I can later mix it wit=\r\nh fitness\n&gt; &gt; search once a good population has evolved, on objectives\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlike &quot;swimming&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me mention about one interesting experiment =\r\nI made with the NS\n&gt; &gt; NEVH. I restricted the substrate connectivity so tha=\r\nt output-&gt;output\n&gt; &gt; connections are not queried. Then I made the environme=\r\nnt to 0 gravity\n&gt; &gt; and removed the ground plane. The behavior characteriza=\r\ntion was\n&gt; &gt; changed like this. The behavior data is a vector of 15 doubles=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; representing the outputs. Each time an output oscillates (going to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n +treshold and then -treshold, or vice versa), its corresponding place\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nin the vector is incremented.\n&gt; &gt; So the vector is actually counting how ma=\r\nny oscillations the outputs\n&gt; &gt; did during the lifetime. A substrate oscill=\r\nating with high frequency\n&gt; &gt; is very far in the behavior space. Different =\r\noutputs oscillating are\n&gt; &gt; counted too. The behavior distance metric is th=\r\ne eucledian distance\n&gt; &gt; between these 15-D vectors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So novelty se=\r\narch now has to find new ways to oscillate the entire\n&gt; &gt; body, to do repea=\r\nting movements. In all the runs, Novelty Search with\n&gt; &gt; HyperNEAT finds wa=\r\nlking gaits 100% of the time, in the first 1000\n&gt; &gt; evaluations. There are =\r\nalso swimming gaits and all kind of stuff (I\n&gt; &gt; saw one individual actuall=\r\ny dancing :))\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So what was stopping it from walking before, is the =\r\ngravity. Keeping\n&gt; &gt; balance on one leg and trying to walk at the same time=\r\n turns out to\n&gt; &gt; be very hard task. One environmental constraint that woul=\r\nd be useful\n&gt; &gt; to make it walk is, when only one foot has stepped on the g=\r\nround,\n&gt; &gt; stick that foot to the ground. So the chance the humanoid to fal=\r\nl is\n&gt; &gt; minimized. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As for the novelty search stagnation, where g=\r\netting new behaviors\n&gt; &gt; becomes hard, the population begins to do somethin=\r\ng like a random\n&gt; &gt; probing anything that is not the same stuff. Then it be=\r\ngins to rely\n&gt; &gt; entirely on mutation to get out somehow.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nI finally borrowed a windows machine from someone and looked at\n&gt; &gt; this.

Do the points added in th=\r\ne archive tend to be\n&gt; &gt; further and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; further away from 0,0....or is it=\r\n just filling in the spaces in the\n&gt; &gt; nearby\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vicinity? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; De=\r\nspite these concerns/suggestions, it is very fun stuff to look\n&gt; &gt; at...and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; its exciting that you are hybridizing these ideas so quickly and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntesting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dig=\r\nital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: David D&#39;Ambrosio &lt;ddambro84@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Mon, 09 Jun 2008 06:=\r\n46:57 -0000\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; S=\r\nubject: [neat] Re: New file uploaded to neat\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, this looks r=\r\neally cool Petar.
