No complexification\nor simplification was performed.  White/cyan are forward links\n(exhitory/inhibitory respectively), yellow/purple are recurrent links.\n Yellow nodes are recurrent hidden and purple nodes are recurrent output.\n\nhttp://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatBrain.jpg\n\nMy fitness calculations were off before but even with the correct\nvalues my previous attempts were not close.  Perfect fitness is 2041.\n So, the fully recurrent network that did not evolve the topology,\njust the weights, was successful after about 800 generations.  Here is\nthe log:\n\nhttp://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatAndMouseLog2.txt\n\nA second run was done and reached fitness 2040 by generation 971,\nalthough it never got perfect.  Here is that log:\n\nhttp://www.redcrocodile.net/test/nolog/CatAndMouseLog3.txt\n\nSo, obviously it _can_ be done in this scenario, it is just that my\nNEAT implementation can&#39;t seem to handle evolving structure and\nweights at the same time.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nI am now testing the hard-coded recurrent networks with the most\ncomplex memory scenario that I have.  The previous one (as mentioned\nin earlier response to Derek) was simplified in that the cat never had\nto travel far and he was always never presented with an intersection\non the way to the mouse (assuming he went the right way).  I am now\nplacing the cat various distances from the mouse (who still always\nstarts in an intersection and can move 4 spaces).\n\nStay tuned for results.  In the mean time I&#39;d love to hear people&#39;s\nthoughts on the matter.\n\nMany thanks,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
