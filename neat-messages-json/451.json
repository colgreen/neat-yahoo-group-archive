The demo is available here and runs in\nWindows:\n\nhttp://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/Evolved/NEATHopper.asp\n\nThe reason I bring this program up is it is an excellent demonstration\nof how NEAT works, and how it should work.  It also has a lot of great\ninterface and visualization ideas.  I believe it would be helpful to\nplay with for anyone newly working with NEAT.\n\nI suggest running it first with only the following options checked:\n-Only draw better (only shows you when a champ improves)\n-Real-time draw  (draws at a real-world frame rate)\n-Joint limits  (doesnt let piece of the hopper move through each\nother)\n-Foot trace (shows the path it took)\n-Shadows (look nice)\n\nTo speed things up, I would also uncheck &quot;multi-run,&quot; which doesn&#39;t\nseem necessary.  (The program starts with this option checked by\ndefault)\n\nThe &quot;Forward Distance&quot; fitness measure is probably the best for\ndemonstration purposes, but I also found &quot;Standtime&quot; interesting,\nwhere\nthe hopper learns to balance without falling.\n\nThe thing that is very useful to watch in this demo is how the\nnetworks complexify as the hopper learns to get farther and farther\ndown the track.  You can actually watch the complexification by\nchoosing the &quot;Champview&quot; tab in the stats window.  I suggest sitting\ndown for a good  150 generations (which only takes a few minutes) and\nwatching how complexification contributes to function.  (Note that\nsometimes the champ becomes simpler, not because NEAT simplified the\nnetwork, but because a simpler species outpaced a more complex one,\nsince NEAT keeps lots of different complexities in the population!)\n\nThe other useful thing is the &quot;fitness spread&quot; tab, which shows the\nfitness of the entire population, color-coded by species.  So if you\nkeep this tab on, you can see species growing and shrinking over time\ndepending how good they are, and also you can see new species coming\nin, and how sometimes a new species immediately introduces something\ngood, and sometimes an old species keeps gradually improving.  It\nreally gives you a sense of how fitness sharing should work.\n(Though I don&#39;t know if Mattias used a dynamic speciation threshold,\nwhich may improve things even more)\n\nI really think that this demo can help beginners to understand NEAT in\na way that verbal explanations cannot, so I hope people take an\nopporunity to check it out.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
