I believe that mos=\r\nt NEAT implementations do not have traits and work just fine so it&#39;s certai=\r\nnly not critical.\n\nHowever, the reason I included them is that I wanted a p=\r\nlace to evolve future parameters for purposes not yet determined.  I also w=\r\nanted them to be possible to reuse.  That is, the parameters would be eithe=\r\nr node-centric or connection-centric, and more than one connection or node =\r\ncould point to the same trait, allowing a good set of parameters to be foun=\r\nd and reused.\n\nThe particular application I had in mind was adaptive neural=\r\n networks, i.e. in which connection weights change over the network&#39;s lifet=\r\nime.  In that case, each connection would have its own evolved Hebbian rule=\r\n with its own parameters (such as learning rate).  The parameters of differ=\r\nent Hebbian rules could be evolved in traits, and the connections would poi=\r\nnt to traits to assign themselves rules.\n\nThis idea was actually implemente=\r\nd. I believe it actually is fully functional in the current rtNEAT distribu=\r\ntion (by switching on a hardcoded flag that is set to off).  It did yield o=\r\nne publication in 2003 on evolving adaptive networks, which is here:\n\nhttp:=\r\n//nn.cs.utexas.edu/pub-view.php?PubID=3D131\n\nThat publication also explains=\r\n traits and even has a diagram of how they work in figure 2.   However, ple=\r\nase note that in the paper we called them &quot;Rules,&quot; since &quot;Traits&quot; is really=\r\n just a variable name in the code and not something very meaningful to some=\r\none reading a scientific paper.\n\nI also think they may have been used in so=\r\nme leaky-integrator-NEAT implementations (I think one is in the Files secti=\r\non here), although I am not completely certain whether it actually stored i=\r\nts parameters in the traits.  \n\nSo overall, yes, they did find a use, and I=\r\n think the general idea of leaving room for more (reusable) parameters made=\r\n the future expansion to adaptive networks easy.  However, they are also no=\r\nt central or essential to NEAT, and it would function normally without them=\r\n.  \n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Daniel Tuohy &lt;danielr2e@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself and a couple other guys are performing a complete o=\r\nverhaul of JNeat.\n&gt;  One thing that always seems to be under foot is the co=\r\nncept of Traits.\n&gt;  Ken&#39;s documentation mentions that these were installed =\r\nfor some future\n&gt; purposes.
