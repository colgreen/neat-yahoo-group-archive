I have made a numbe=\r\nr of changes which should address\n&gt; this problem. Please don&#39;t hesitate to =\r\nlet me know if problems of\n&gt; this sort still occur.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two representation=\r\n methods are in place:\n&gt; \n&gt; Windowed, in which a window around PacMan const=\r\nitutes the inputs.\n&gt; Each tile in the window (except under PacMan himself) =\r\nhas an input\n&gt; associated with dots/walls, power pellets, and ghosts. Users=\r\n can\n&gt; select which inputs are used through the parameters file.\n&gt; \n&gt; Globa=\r\nl, in which details of the maze are used as inputs, e.g.,\n&gt; PacMan&#39;s X and =\r\nY coordinates, ghost X and Y coordinates, ghost \nstate,\n&gt; power pellet stat=\r\ne, presence of walls or dots around PacMan. Again,\n&gt; the specifc inputs use=\r\nd are selectable through the parameters file.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this can be usefu=\r\nl and/or entertaining.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Kirk\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
