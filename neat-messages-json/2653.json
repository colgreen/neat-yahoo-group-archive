I looked at the experiments that come bundled with SharpNeat, and \n&gt;I see I have to define a function that returns fitness in Network \n&gt;Evaluator Function to do my own experiment.  How do I set a fitness \n&gt;threshold to the program, so that SharpNeatGui will know to stop when \n&gt;it has found a network of sufficient performance? \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nCurrently there is no setting to do this so you would have to modify the \ncode. One way would be to add the fitness threshold as a property on \nIExperiment, this can then be checked from Form1.SearchThreadMethod() - \nwhen the current fitenss passes the threshold just set stopSearchSignal \nto true to stop, or just have a look at the code in there that \nterminates the search thread. You can also see code in there for saving \nthe best genome - which is something you probably want to happen once \nthe threshold is passed (or target acheived).\n\n\n&gt;3.  Can I setup SharpNeat to only evolve the topology of a network, \n&gt;and determine the weights with traditional back prop ANN training?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nThere are probably a few different ways of doing this. An easy way would \nbe to set the connection weight mutation rate to 0.0 so that no CPU time \nis wasted searching weights. The evaluation function could then decode \nthe genome to something other than one of the standard ANN classes which \nsupports backprop (or just bolt backprop onto one of the existing \nclasses). You can then run backprop on each ANN as part of the \nevaluation function.\n\nIn fact you could evolve the weights AND start the backprop from the \nweights in the genome, instead of randomly generating weights (or using \none of the weight generting schemes for backprop).\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
