I wonder if some global information in addition to=\r\n \nyour \n&gt; local observations may be useful?  For example, you may divide th=\r\ne \ngrid \n&gt; up into 2x2 (quadrants), or even 3x3 (nonants?), and make \nobser=\r\nvations \n&gt; thusly.  You may even make these observations linear (rather tha=\r\nn \n&gt; binary), for example based on number of ghosts/food/etc in a \nsection,=\r\n or \n&gt; the weighted distance of all ghosts/food/etc from the center of a \n&gt;=\r\n section.  With such added global information, you&#39;d also need to \nprovide =\r\n\n&gt; input as to where PacMan currently resides (so he might know which \n&gt; se=\r\nction is most relevant).\n&gt; \n&gt; And of course, this problem is screaming for =\r\nHyperNEAT.  :)\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW - mine did crash after I hit B and waited a few gen=\r\nerations.  \nI got \n&gt; no exception dialog though, it just disappeared.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nStill, good work!\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
