What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsomething to be considered a coupled non-linear oscillators? For\nexample, I am assuming that either leaky or non-leaky neurons can be\npart of a coupled non-linear oscillator, or is it somehow more\nappropriate for the neurons to be non-leaky? I guess I am curious why\nhaving a non-leaky neuron would be the most favorable choice in such a\nmodel, or whether it is somehow a matter of definition. \n\nAlso, what are the minor adjustments to the substrate that you mention\nthat would create this kind of system?\n\nIn my experience, the leaky neurons also can produce oscillations\nreliably, but I am not sure if that is actually anything different\nfrom what you are describing or just another instance of the same\nphenomenon.\n\nThanks,\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Vinod K.\nValsalam&quot; &lt;vkv@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Jeff,\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesting work! I was also curious to see how HyperNEAT would\n&gt; perform on this domain. The videos of quadruped and hexapod gaits I\n&gt; evolved, and the paper I wrote with Prof. Risto Miikkulainen for last\n&gt; year&#39;s GECCO are available here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://nn.cs. &lt;http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?modularne&gt;\nutexas.edu/keyword?modularne\n&gt; \n&gt; With regard to the discussion about generating oscillations, I used\n&gt; neither sine wave as input nor leaky integrators. Instead, neural\n&gt; network controllers with standard sigmoid neurons were modularized to\n&gt; behave as coupled non-linear oscillators (coupled cell systems). As\n&gt; explained in the paper, and as Jean-Baptiste mentioned in an earlier\n&gt; post, such oscillators can produce synchronous and phase-related\n&gt; periodic behaviors suitable for generating gaits. They are easy to\n&gt; evolve and produce animal-like gaits such as the pronk, pace, bound\n&gt; and trot for quadrupeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; With only minor adjustments to your setup, you can convert your\n&gt; substrate configuration to represent non-linear oscillators. In fact,\n&gt; you would get a configuration similar to my modular controllers by\n&gt; restricting the network inputs to just the joint angles and producing\n&gt; angular velocities instead of angles as outputs. HyperNEAT would then\n&gt; have to evolve the modularity that I specified by hand. I think that\n&gt; would be an interesting experiment to run, and if successful would\n&gt; eliminate the need to specify the sine input. BTW, did you find that\n&gt; the other inputs (i.e. pitch, yaw, roll, and touch) were necessary to\n&gt; evolve good gaits in your experiments?\n&gt; \n&gt; Vinod\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00DE_01C99680.86208BF0\r\nContent-Type: application/ms-tnef;\n\tname=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;winmail.dat&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00DE_01C99680.86208BF0--\r\n\n"}}
