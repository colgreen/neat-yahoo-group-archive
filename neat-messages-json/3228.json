I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following all of it, but \n=\r\nI thought\n&gt; I&#39;d poke my head in the middle of it anyway. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I have rea=\r\nd up much on the concept of No Free Lunch, but is it \nbasically\n&gt; saying th=\r\nat with no other a priori knowledge one optimization \nalgorithm is\n&gt; just a=\r\ns good as another?  And Ken, are you saying this doesn&#39;t \napply to\n&gt; HyperN=\r\nEAT because the algorithm imposes spatial structure on both \nthe\n&gt; network =\r\nand the input?\n&gt; \n&gt; If entirely agree with the general point that this is a=\r\nn important \ndirection\n&gt; for encoding ANNs.  You&#39;re right about the arbitra=\r\nriness of inputs \nin ANNs\n&gt; with no inherent spatial structure, and this is=\r\nn&#39;t at all like \nbiological\n&gt; brains.  All cortical areas are structured su=\r\nch that stimuli with \nsimilar\n&gt; structure map to nearby regions of the cort=\r\nex.  For the visual \ndomain, there\n&gt; is the retinotopic map of the visual c=\r\nortex.  Basically, things \nperceived\n&gt; close together in your visual field =\r\nare mapped to processing \ncenters close\n&gt; together in the actual brain. In =\r\naudition there&#39;s a tonotopic map \nthat\n&gt; conforms to the physical layout of=\r\n the cochlea.\n&gt; \n&gt; So using that a priori knowledge, that things near each =\r\nother in \nthe visual\n&gt; field are related, and infusing that information int=\r\no your \nencoding scheme,\n&gt; seems logical.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess I don&#39;t understand N=\r\nFL very well though...perhaps I should \nread up a\n&gt; bit more on it.  I don&#39;=\r\nt understand how it&#39;s possible *not* to \ninclude a\n&gt; priori knowledge into =\r\nany optimization algorithm in practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Derek\n&gt;\n\nDerek, I think you&#39;=\r\nve pretty much got it.  As Joe said, at least \nwith neuroevolution it is vi=\r\nrtually impossible not to include prior \nknowledge.\n\nSo what&#39;s going on at =\r\nleast in my original point is that two \nalgorithms that both take the *same=\r\n* kind of prior knowledge are in \neffect back under NFL with respect to eac=\r\nh other.  Because they both \ncan include the same a priori information, the=\r\n provision of such \ninformation is not an advantage for one over the other,=\r\n and \ntherefore there is nothing else to allow one to outperform the other =\r\n\nover all possible problems.\n\nMy point was that HyperNEAT allows a new kind=\r\n of prior knowledge to \nbe included that cannot be supplied to previous neu=\r\nroevolution (or \nother ML) methods, which separates it from those algorithm=\r\ns in a way \nthat *could* allow it to perform better if used right.  Joe has=\r\n been \nconcerned in part with the &quot;if used right&quot; part, since there is no \n=\r\ntheoretical guarantee that the user will supply the right prior \nknwowledge=\r\n.  But at least the opportunity is there.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
