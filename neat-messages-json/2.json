I think Derek had a great idea starting this\ngroup.  I have been in contact with a lot of people who are working\nwith NEAT independently, and it makes sense to have a place where we\ncan pool our experience to help each other out.  The group can also\nfacilitate the discussion of ideas, both for applying NEAT and\nextending it.  I look forward to participating!\n\nAs for introducing myself, many of you already know who I am, so I\nwon&#39;t go too long on the details, but for any who don&#39;t, I am\ncompleting my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Texas at\nAustin.  I am hoping to become a professor after graduation so that I\ncan continue research into evolving increasingly complex neural\nnetworks, as well as other structures.  I don&#39;t know where I will be a\nprofessor- it&#39;s not an easy job market!  In the future, I hope to lead\nresearch towards the next generation of neuroevolution systems\nbuilding on NEAT.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
