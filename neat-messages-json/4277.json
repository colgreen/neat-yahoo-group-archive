However, usually when people attempt benchmarks they do not\n&gt; &gt; compa=\r\nre their results explicitly with others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the same time, as you k=\r\nnow, I have changed my philosophy somewhat\n&gt; &gt; since 2003 because I have re=\r\nalized that benchmark comparisons can\n&gt; &gt; lead to misunderstanding unless t=\r\nhey are controlled very carefully.\n&gt; &gt; One of the problems is the &quot;target-b=\r\nased evolution problem,&quot; which\n&gt; &gt; is one of the inspirations for novelty s=\r\nearch. In short, evolving\n&gt; &gt; to an arbitrary target can lead to misleading=\r\n intuitions about what\n&gt; &gt; is possible with a particular encoding because o=\r\nf deception. Often\n&gt; &gt; a &quot;failed&quot; encoding very well could represent the ta=\r\nrget if only it\n&gt; &gt; had been led to it through an alternative path through =\r\nthe search\n&gt; &gt; space.\n&gt; \n&gt; But isn&#39;t that the general case of getting stuck=\r\n in a particular part\n&gt; of the solution space? If a particular candidate re=\r\npeatedly fails to\n&gt; represent very simple target patterns, such as rings an=\r\nd stars, and\n&gt; complexifies to the point where it cannot revert back to a s=\r\nimpler\n&gt; morphology, doesn&#39;t that say something about the AE system?\n&gt; \n\nYe=\r\ns I agree, it&#39;s the general case of getting stuck.  Which is why I\nthink be=\r\nnchmarks are a tricky business in any field, not just in AE. \nHowever, I do=\r\n not think it is particularly important if a particular\ncandidate (which I =\r\nguess means a run of evolution) fails to represent\na simple target.  Just b=\r\necause it doesn&#39;t do it does not mean that it\ncannot do it, and if the fitn=\r\ness function does not reward the proper\nstepping stones, then it doesn&#39;t se=\r\nem very significant for the\nencoding that it did or did not end up hitting =\r\na target in one run.  \n\nThat is not to say that there are no meaningful ben=\r\nchmark experiments.\n I am just saying you have to be careful.  If you expec=\r\nt to hit a\ncertain target, you have to ask why you would expect that target=\r\n to be\nhit given the particular fitness function and what about the encodin=\r\ng\nmakes it interesting to ask that particular question. \n\n&gt; &gt; Also, another=\r\n problem with benchmarks is that they may obfuscate\n&gt; &gt; more fundamental ad=\r\nvantages of particular approaches because they do\n&gt; &gt; not focus on general =\r\ncapabilities. (Although, of course, if you do\n&gt; &gt; enough of them, perhaps g=\r\neneral capabilities start to be clearer.)\n&gt; &gt; But that is why I advocated m=\r\nore focus on looking for biological-\n&gt; &gt; like regularities in the patterns =\r\noutput by particular encodings,\n&gt; &gt; rather than looking for a single partic=\r\nular pattern, or even a\n&gt; &gt; single set of patterns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then how do you co=\r\nmpare the representational capabilities of two AE\n&gt; systems? For that matte=\r\nr, how do you go about determining the\n&gt; representational capabilities of a=\r\n single system?\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems like the approach you&#39;re advocating is to evo=\r\nlve patterns\n&gt; from a bunch of different starting points, with different\n&gt; =\r\nmethodologies (e.g. artificial selection) and just see what shakes\n&gt; out.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If I want to use a particular system to solve a particular problem,\n&gt; a=\r\nnd I know up front that particular types of patterns will be\n&gt; extremely us=\r\neful in solving the problem (e.g. bilateral symmetry),\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t it make s=\r\nense to explicitly test the system beforehand to see\n&gt; how easily such patt=\r\nerns emerge and how stable they are once they do\n&gt; emerge?\n&gt; \n\nYes I think =\r\nwe are not disagreeing that much.  If you want to be able\nto evolve bilater=\r\nal symmetry then of course you want an encoding that\nhas a high probability=\r\n of doing so.  However, the problem is that\n&quot;bilateral symmetry&quot; is not a s=\r\ningle target pattern, but rather a\nlarge set of patterns.  Therefore, if yo=\r\nu choose say five arbitrary\nbilaterally symmetric patterns and the encoding=\r\n doesn&#39;t hit them, it\ndoesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it has any intrinsic pr=\r\noblem with\nbilateral symmetry.  Even if you chose a kind of general target,=\r\n like\n&quot;anything bilaterally symmetric,&quot; you still have to ask whether the\nf=\r\nitness function actually rewards the stepping stones towards that\ngoal, or =\r\nwhether perhaps the probability of hitting it is totally\northogonal to the =\r\nfitness function (and hence the target).\n\nIn some cases (such as CPPNs), it=\r\n will be a priori obvious how often\nyou will tend to get bilateral symmetry=\r\n without even needing to run a\nbenchmark because you know how the encoding =\r\nworks.  With CPPNs, if you\nknow the mutation rate then you know that probab=\r\nility of adding\nGaussian in front of x or y, and then you have right away a=\r\nn idea\nabout the probabilities.  Thus benchmarks don&#39;t really add much in\ns=\r\nuch a case.\n\nAgain, a very carefully constructed benchmark with a rationale=\r\n about\nwhy it tests something interesting about a particular encoding can\np=\r\notentially still be revealing, but it&#39;s just that there is a real\ndanger of=\r\n doing something vacuous by accident.\n\n&gt; &gt; Like I&#39;ve said before, evolution=\r\n never\n&gt; &gt; produced a wheel but that hardly means DNA is a bad encoding.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; That&#39;s an interesting example. Do you think DNA has the\n&gt; representation=\r\nal power to express a wheel, that it is\n&gt; difficult/impossible to evolve a =\r\nwheel via gradualism, and/or that\n&gt; there hasn&#39;t been sufficient selection =\r\npressure in nature to produce a\n&gt; wheel?\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to me that DNA certa=\r\ninly has the ability to express a wheel,\n&gt; which is much simpler than many =\r\nmore complex designs that DNA does\n&gt; express. I&#39;d tend to think that wheels=\r\n would not evolve on earth\n&gt; because in general they would be maladaptive..=\r\n.the world isn&#39;t nice\n&gt; and flat like a paved parking lot, and where it is =\r\n(ice, desert),\n&gt; rolling still wouldn&#39;t be as useful as walking, slithering=\r\n, gliding,\n&gt; or flying. I don&#39;t know, though...it&#39;s an interesting question=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the environments in which Sims and others evolve &quot;walkers&quot;, they\n=\r\n&gt; are flat. But the creatures are composed of cuboids (which could still\n&gt; =\r\nform wheels, albeit not very easily). If the representation included\n&gt; obje=\r\ncts like spheres or rings and primitives, or as patterns that\n&gt; easily emer=\r\nged, it would certainly be interesting to see if rolling\n&gt; behavior evolved=\r\n in favor of crawling or scooting across a flat\n&gt; surface.\n&gt; \n\nI just respo=\r\nnded to Jeff separately with my guess on why wheels didn&#39;t\nevolve.  It is i=\r\nnteresting to speculate about it.\n\n&gt; &gt; Of course benchmarks can play a role=\r\n and I do think more comparisons\n&gt; &gt; could be done, but we also have to be =\r\ncautious about their\nmisapplication.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as people aren&#39;t making s=\r\ntrong claims about what a particular\n&gt; system can&#39;t do, I don&#39;t see the pro=\r\nblem. If a study was done where,\n&gt; for example, three AE systems were compa=\r\nred for their ability to\n&gt; evolve simple shapes such as stars, trees, and r=\r\nings, various\n&gt; symmetries, and simple controllers, I&#39;d see nothing wrong w=\r\nith someone\n&gt; stating that System A evolved solutions to certain problems m=\r\nore\n&gt; quickly than the other systems, but less quickly in others. Just as\n&gt;=\r\n long as they&#39;re not saying, &quot;System B failed to evolve a tree\n&gt; structure,=\r\n therefore System B is incapable of either representing or\n&gt; evolving such =\r\na structure.&quot;\n&gt; \n\nI think some experiments like that would be interesting, =\r\nso I agree. \nI&#39;m just saying you have to be cautious about drawing conclusi=\r\nons.  If\nsystem A evolves a star and system B doesn&#39;t, what does it actuall=\r\ny\ntell us about which system to use in any situation aside from one in\nwhic=\r\nh that exact star is needed with that exact fitness function?  It\nmay tell =\r\nus something, but we need to think about what that would be.\n\nBy the way, m=\r\ny concern with benchmark comparisons is broader than just\nAE.  The whole fi=\r\neld of machine learning abuses benchmarks to no end,\nand benchmarks get a l=\r\not more credit than they deserve.  While they\nare by no means worthless, at=\r\n this moment in time, what benchmark\ncomparisons could use is a healthy dos=\r\ne of criticism.  What I&#39;m saying\nis that while they can certainly be defend=\r\ned rationally, right now\nthey don&#39;t really need much defending because ever=\r\nyone automatically\nassumes that they are the be all and end all of machine =\r\nlearning\nresearch anyway.  In other words, the pendulum can spare to swing =\r\na\nlittle back the other way.\n\nWhat I think we need to consider in AI and ma=\r\nchine learning that\nbenchmark comparisons have made us forget is that a lot=\r\n of them time,\nour own personal ability to analyze and intuit the value of =\r\nan\napproach through our intellect often should trump benchmark comparisons.=\r\n  \n\nAs I said to Jeff at GECCO, it would be interesting to see an AI\njourna=\r\nl that explicitly prohibits reviewers from basing their accept\nor reject de=\r\ncisions on experimental results in submitted papers. \nInstead, they would b=\r\ne forced to evaluate the merits of an approach\nintellectually.  Papers woul=\r\nd not even be required to present any\nresults at all.  While it is a radica=\r\nl idea, if we had world-class\nreviewers and took the policy seriously, we w=\r\nould get a rapid\nexploration of the space of interesting ideas- something A=\r\nI is\nhandicapped from doing right now because of its obsession with\nbenchma=\r\nrks.  Benchmarks have become an excuse not to think deeply.  We\nshould not =\r\nget rid of them, but they can spare a little pruning in the\ncurrent environ=\r\nment.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
