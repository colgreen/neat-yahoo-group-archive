So let&#39;s say you get a spec, what exactly do you d=\r\no next?  \nDo you get to change some code around or add a new fitness functi=\r\non or \nperhaps sensor/output combos appropriate to that spec?

It would be cool if it was totally plug and \nplay, such tha=\r\nt your platform could be used by anyone to evolve any \ngame spec right away=\r\n with no further coding, but I&#39;m not sure from \nwhat you say how it works e=\r\nxactly.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
