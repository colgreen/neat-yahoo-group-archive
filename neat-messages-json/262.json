I had essentially discounted GA=\r\ns and was going with just ANN training.  After reading his work, I then tri=\r\ned to replicate his structure only targeting 5X5 Go instead of checkers.  A=\r\nfter many many iterations and discovering error after error in my framework=\r\n, I finally decided the fastest way to debug my framework was to replicate =\r\nFogel&#39;s experiments and then gently extend them in the directions in which =\r\nI am interested.  And then finally jump to Go.  I may do a couple of other =\r\ngames in between just to get practice generating encoding techniques.\n\n\nYou=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; I suppose your generic game player is in C++?\n\nMy framework is wr=\r\nitten entirely in Java (currently 1.4.2_02).  After doing some experimentat=\r\nion, I decided that the 5-10% I might save using C++ (or Borland&#39;s Delphi) =\r\nwould be completely wasted in my having to hand code a fragile distributed =\r\nprocessing mechanism.  And then update it frequently or resort to massive a=\r\nmounts of &quot;on-the-wire&quot; translation code for each of my architectures.  I d=\r\neplore than kind of work...I get totally demotivated with too many tangents=\r\n like that.\n\nSo, I have written my own distributed computing mechanism usin=\r\ng RMI/Serialization.  I did not find anything I was willing to use at the t=\r\nime I wrote it (this time last year).  I have had up to 6 machines working =\r\nsimultaneously playing out games and reporting back the results to the main=\r\n generation processing node.  They did 1,000 generations (150,000 games of =\r\ncheckers at 4 ply) in a little less than 6 days.  I was quite pleased with =\r\nthe efficiency.  Fogel had to wait months.  And my system is very scalable.=\r\n  I can add PIII 450 box after PIII 450 box and it scales almost perfectly =\r\nlinearly until the network itself becomes the bottleneck.  And I am using 1=\r\n0mb right now.  I will switch to full duplex 100mb just as soon as I am mai=\r\nnly focused on just experiments (as opposed to framework tangents) and have=\r\n at least 10 boxes working.\n\nAnd Sun is continuing to improve the Hotspot J=\r\nVM.  It is getting closer and closer to hand-written optimized C++ code...t=\r\nhere are many cases now, where it matches or surpasses compiler optimized C=\r\n++ code (except Intel&#39;s C++/C compiler).  An expert C++ coder doing very sp=\r\necific highly technical optimization (which generally means dropping back t=\r\no C and denormalizing classes to gain maximum efficiency) can still gain a =\r\n5-10% advantage on Sun&#39;s Hotspot JVM.  \n\nIBM&#39;s JVM actually outperforms Sun=\r\n&#39;s Hotspot in a couple of areas (one of which is float/double computation),=\r\n or did.  I will eventually be using jMocha (IBM Open Source software) to a=\r\nctually test out the ideal JVM and configuration for each node in my networ=\r\nk so as to eak out maximum speed at the node level.  First priority, I just=\r\n want to replicate Fogel&#39;s original design.  It has been a long trail getti=\r\nng here.  I am so bloody close, finally.  I am taking the week of Christmas=\r\n and the week of New Years off.  Can you guess what I will be doing that 16=\r\n days?  You get three chances and the first two don&#39;t count!  ;^)\n\nThanks t=\r\no Java&#39;s RMI code mobility, I am able to have &quot;dumb&quot; nodes that actually on=\r\nly have the Java JVM installed.  Then, I created a small batch file (4 line=\r\ns) on each node.  The batch file is fired up (or more than one, if the node=\r\n has multiple processors) and fetches its entire context from the master no=\r\nde, including the appropriate game related class files, to start processing=\r\n.  This means I can vary my experiments between player architectures and ev=\r\nen game types without having to go to each node and &quot;code update&quot; it to kee=\r\np it in version sync (if you have ever experienced this, you would know the=\r\n complete nightmare library version synchronization can end up being).  Jav=\r\na is highly valuable in this way.  It makes distributing work to other comp=\r\nuters *much* less fragile than is my experience with other languages (C++ a=\r\nnd Delphi are the two immediate ones I have presonal experience with...and =\r\na little Eiffel...I love Bertrand Meyer&#39;s work...I have read Object Oriente=\r\nd Software Construction c1997 3 times...wow, what an OO genius).\n\nI am very=\r\n close (less than 10 hours of coding time, hopefully) to having finally rep=\r\nlicated Fogel&#39;s original design (non-spatial).  And then to do the spatial =\r\nis less than 20 minutes of additional code work and about 6 days of waiting=\r\n for it to process then 1,000 generations.\n\nI am still having to do stupid =\r\ntangent work frequently.  Right now, I am on a tangent to re-write the gene=\r\nration storage mechanism as it keeps overflowing the master nodes HD with +=\r\n9GBs of data doing a 1,000 generation run (takes around 6 days).  The re-wr=\r\nite is having each generation stored in a .zip file (compression) so it wil=\r\nl reduce the amount of actual HD space used to about 20% of what it was bef=\r\nore.  Again, Java has a built-in API to handle all the zip file management.=\r\n And I intend on having the file output occuring on another thread so as to=\r\n not bog down the primary thread&#39;s job of distributing work to the other no=\r\ndes.  I have been very diligent about using Java&#39;s multi-threading techniqu=\r\nes to maximize my ability to use a Player instance in games or descendants =\r\nat the same time it is also being written out via a stream to wherever.  Th=\r\nat was more a multi-threading design technique from Effective Java than it =\r\nwas the Java language or APIs.\n\nI am having a great time with this.\n\n\nYou w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;I strongly suggest staying away from full-board Go, at least for the=\r\n next decade.  If you want some chance of success, I recommend 5x5 first-ca=\r\npture Go.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly.  Scott (a friend working with me) and I =\r\nhave both been focused on starting with 5x5 once we get to Go.  In fact, we=\r\n are going to try to use the whole &quot;3 level Go training technique&quot; (of whic=\r\nh Capture Go is the first level) to see what kinds of directions that might=\r\n take us.  As to waiting a decade...likely...and the wait will be on the me=\r\nga-computers doing the evolution...hopefully!  LOL!\n\n\nWell, I must go...Yin=\r\nyang is calling me (name of my AI/GA/ANN framework).\n\nOh, and I intend to O=\r\npen Source my entire framework under the GPL once I feel the design is suff=\r\niciently mature.  Right now, it is just a straight through hack so I can ge=\r\nt to GA/ANN experimentation.\n\n\nJim O&#39;Flaherty\n\n\n  ----- Original Message --=\r\n--- \n  From: Mitchell Timin \n  To: neat@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, De=\r\ncember 14, 2003 12:34 PM\n  Subject: Re: [neat] board games\n\n\n  --- &quot;Jim O&#39;F=\r\nlaherty, Jr.&quot; &lt;jim_oflaherty_jr@...&gt;\n  wrote:\n  &gt; Mitchell,\n  &gt; \n  &gt; =\r\nI have not spoken much in this group.

My goal\n  &gt; implemetation is Go.\n\n  You will spoil your lurke=\r\nr status with such well\n  written posts! :)\n\n  Fogel&#39;s book is what inspire=\r\nd me to work on\n  neuroevolution.\n\n  I suppose your generic game player is =\r\nin C++?\n\n  &gt; My gut feel on your assertion is that I agree.  I\n  &gt; sense th=\r\nat min/max (or some specialization of it\n  &gt; like Alpha/Beta) will likely b=\r\ne present in more\n  &gt; complex game playing ANNs.  It seems it would take\n  =\r\n&gt; an enormous amount of searching in a game space for\n  &gt; a GA to have an A=\r\nNN of any type converge to the\n  &gt; min/max mechanism regardless of the ANN\n=\r\n  &gt; meta-architecture approach.  In fact, it seems more\n  &gt; likely for an A=\r\nNN using GA to attempt to use the\n  &gt; pattern recognition approach many tim=\r\nes before\n  &gt; stumbling on a rudimentary version of min/max (it\n  &gt; would r=\r\nequire recurrent connections in the ANN and\n  &gt; in unique combinations).\n\n =\r\n A recurrent architecture, such as NEAT can create,\n  might be able to deve=\r\nlop the equivalent of 1-ply\n  look-ahead, which would be adequate for tic-t=\r\nac-toe. \n  I think this is worth attempting, and would be an\n  advancement =\r\nof the state-of-the-art. \n\n  &gt; However, I do think that it is possible for =\r\nANNs to\n  &gt; suggest moves at which to take a deeper look.  For\n  &gt; example,=\r\n in the domain of Go, there are way too many\n  &gt; possible moves for even a =\r\nfull ply search of depth 2\n  &gt; to yield any level of effectiveness.  The br=\r\neadth of\n  &gt; available &quot;legal&quot; moves in Go starts at 361 and\n  &gt; stays abov=\r\ne 100 for almost the entire game.  Worse,\n  &gt; thanks to captures and Ko, th=\r\ne number of legal moves\n  &gt; is not guaranteed to descend.\n\n  This is a very=\r\n good idea!\n\n  I strongly suggest staying away from full-board Go, at\n  lea=\r\nst for the next decade.  If you want some chance of\n  success, I recommend =\r\n5x5 first-capture Go. \n  (First-capture is the variation where the game end=\r\ns if\n  any stone or stones are captured.)  There are no KO&#39;s,\n  and clearly=\r\n finite length games, yet this game is\n  challenging.  (and you can move up=\r\n to 7x7)\n\n  Connect 4 seems like a good game to work on.  Many\n  people kno=\r\nw it.  There are several websites where one\n  can play vs. a computer.  The=\r\nre are only 7 possible\n  moves per turn.  The games are much shorter than\n =\r\n chess, checkers or Go.  Yet the game is far from\n  trivial.\n\n  &gt; As such, =\r\nsome sort of mechanism to priortize looking\n  &gt; at some subset of &quot;legal&quot; m=\r\noves is essential (if you\n  &gt; are familiar with Go, you could refer to the\n=\r\n  &gt; patterns described in &quot;Go Proverbs&quot;).  I suspect an\n  &gt; ANN that specia=\r\nlizes in small regional patterns will\n  &gt; likely be able to be evolved that=\r\n reduces the\n  &gt; &quot;legal&quot; move set substantially.  Even then, it would\n  &gt; n=\r\need to reduce it to less than 3% FOR EACH PLY DEPTH\n  &gt; to make a ply searc=\r\nh depth of 6 or 8 even reasonable\n  &gt; computationally.  That is one hell of=\r\n an efficiency,\n  &gt; +97% *accurate* reduction in legal moves.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; At t=\r\nhe present time, I am sort of seeing an ANN\n  &gt; sandwich; ANN #1 takes a se=\r\nt of all legal moves and\n  &gt; prioritizes them.  A ply manager then recursiv=\r\nely\n  &gt; calls ANN #1 until it reaches a certain depth.  Then\n  &gt; the ply ma=\r\nnager presents the resultant board state\n  &gt; to ANN #2 for a full board eva=\r\nluation.  This cycle\n  &gt; continues until a move is deemed most effective an=\r\nd\n  &gt; then utilized.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The way in which ANN #1 evolves (mutation and=\r\n/or\n  &gt; feedback on a fixed topology, direct encoding using\n  &gt; NEAT, indir=\r\nect encoding using many different types\n  &gt; of topological techniques inclu=\r\nding NEAT) can be\n  &gt; completely different from the way in which ANN #2\n  &gt;=\r\n evolves.  This produces a meta-GA GA approach; a GA\n  &gt; for discovering th=\r\ne ideal GA techinique for each of\n  &gt; the two ANNs.  As you can imagine, we=\r\n now have a\n  &gt; HUGE computational space.  And this assumes two ANNs\n  &gt; an=\r\nd some form of the min-max algorithm.  And there\n  &gt; are other &quot;techniques&quot;=\r\n for capturing static patterns\n  &gt; in a pattern matching DB that might be m=\r\nore\n  &gt; efficient in the long run.\n\n  Using more than one ANN for an applic=\r\nation makes good\n  sense.  We now know that the mammalian brain is\n  organi=\r\nzed in many distince modules that communicate\n  with each other.  We can do=\r\n that with ANNs.  In fact I\n  have run some experiments with two ANNs solvi=\r\nng my\n  4play puzzle.  (two 22 neuron ANNs instead of one 44\n  neuron ANN).=\r\n  First results were encouraging.  It is a\n  way of substantially reducing =\r\nthe number of weights.\n\n\n  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n  Mitchell Timin\n  http://annevo=\r\nlve.sourceforge.net\n\n  __________________________________\n  Do you Yahoo!?\n=\r\n  Free Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\n  http://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n        Y=\r\nahoo!

system.&nbsp; I am repli=\r\ncating the \n  experiments in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; book Blondie24 by David Fogel.&nbs=\r\np; I have \n  developed a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; framework for playing &quot;generic&quot; perfect \n =\r\n information&lt;BR&gt;&gt; non-random two player games.&nbsp; My first&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n =\r\n implementation is obviously checkers.&nbsp; My goal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; implemetation =\r\nis \n  Go.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You will spoil your lurker status with such well&lt;BR&gt;writte=\r\nn posts! \n  :)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fogel&#39;s book is what inspired me to work \n  on&lt;BR&gt;neu=\r\nroevolution.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I suppose your generic game player is in \n  C++?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; My gut feel on your assertion is that I agree.&nbsp; \n  I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sen=\r\nse that min/max (or some specialization of it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like \n  Alpha/Beta) w=\r\nill likely be present in more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; complex game playing \n  ANNs.&nbsp; I=\r\nt seems it would take&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an enormous amount of searching in \n  a game =\r\nspace for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a GA to have an ANN of any type converge to \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; min/max mechanism regardless of the ANN&lt;BR&gt;&gt; meta-architecture \n  appr=\r\noach.&nbsp; In fact, it seems more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; likely for an ANN using GA to \n =\r\n attempt to use the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pattern recognition approach many times \n  befo=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stumbling on a rudimentary version of min/max (it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; would =\r\n\n  require recurrent connections in the ANN and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in unique \n  combin=\r\nations).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A recurrent architecture, such as NEAT can \n  create,&lt;BR&gt;mi=\r\nght be able to develop the equivalent of 1-ply&lt;BR&gt;look-ahead, \n  which woul=\r\nd be adequate for tic-tac-toe. &lt;BR&gt;I think this is worth attempting, \n  and=\r\n would be an&lt;BR&gt;advancement of the state-of-the-art. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, =\r\n\n  I do think that it is possible for ANNs to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; suggest moves at whic=\r\nh to \n  take a deeper look.&nbsp; For&lt;BR&gt;&gt; example, in the domain of Go,=\r\n there are \n  way too many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible moves for even a full ply searc=\r\nh of depth \n  2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to yield any level of effectiveness.&nbsp; The brea=\r\ndth of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  available &quot;legal&quot; moves in Go starts at 361 and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\ntays above 100 for \n  almost the entire game.&nbsp; Worse,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thanks t=\r\no captures and Ko, the \n  number of legal moves&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not guaranteed t=\r\no descend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a \n  very good idea!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I strongly suggest st=\r\naying away from full-board Go, \n  at&lt;BR&gt;least for the next decade.&nbsp; If=\r\n you want some chance of&lt;BR&gt;success, \n  I recommend 5x5 first-capture Go. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;(First-capture is the variation where \n  the game ends if&lt;BR&gt;any stone o=\r\nr stones are captured.)&nbsp; There are no \n  KO&#39;s,&lt;BR&gt;and clearly finite l=\r\nength games, yet this game \n  is&lt;BR&gt;challenging.&nbsp; (and you can move up=\r\n to 7x7)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Connect 4 seems \n  like a good game to work on.&nbsp; Many&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;people know it.&nbsp; There are \n  several websites where one&lt;BR&gt;can pla=\r\ny vs. a computer.&nbsp; There are only 7 \n  possible&lt;BR&gt;moves per turn.&nbs=\r\np; The games are much shorter than&lt;BR&gt;chess, \n  checkers or Go.&nbsp; Yet t=\r\nhe game is far from&lt;BR&gt;trivial.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As \n  such, some sort of mechan=\r\nism to priortize looking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; at some subset of \n  &quot;legal&quot; moves is esse=\r\nntial (if you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are familiar with Go, you could \n  refer to the&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; patterns described in &quot;Go Proverbs&quot;).&nbsp; I suspect \n  an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ANN =\r\nthat specializes in small regional patterns will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; likely \n  be able =\r\nto be evolved that reduces the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;legal&quot; move set \n  substantially.&n=\r\nbsp; Even then, it would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; need to reduce it to less \n  than 3% FOR E=\r\nACH PLY DEPTH&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to make a ply search depth of 6 or 8 even \n  reasonab=\r\nle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; computationally.&nbsp; That is one hell of an \n  efficiency,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; +97% *accurate* reduction in legal moves.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  At the p=\r\nresent time, I am sort of seeing an ANN&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sandwich; ANN #1 takes \n  a=\r\n set of all legal moves and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; prioritizes them.&nbsp; A ply manager \n=\r\n  then recursively&lt;BR&gt;&gt; calls ANN #1 until it reaches a certain depth.&n=\r\nbsp; \n  Then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the ply manager presents the resultant board state&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; to ANN \n  #2 for a full board evaluation.&nbsp; This cycle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; con=\r\ntinues until a \n  move is deemed most effective and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; then utilized.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \n  way in which ANN #1 evolves (mutation and/or&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; feedback on a fixed \n  topology, direct encoding using&lt;BR&gt;&gt; NEAT, indi=\r\nrect encoding using many \n  different types&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of topological techniqu=\r\nes including NEAT) can \n  be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; completely different from the way in w=\r\nhich ANN #2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  evolves.&nbsp; This produces a meta-GA GA approach; =\r\na GA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for \n  discovering the ideal GA techinique for each of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n the two ANNs.&nbsp; As \n  you can imagine, we now have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; HUGE comp=\r\nutational space.&nbsp; And \n  this assumes two ANNs&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and some form o=\r\nf the min-max algorithm.&nbsp; \n  And there&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are other &quot;techniques&quot; =\r\nfor capturing static patterns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  in a pattern matching DB that migh=\r\nt be more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; efficient in the long \n  run.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Using more than one =\r\nANN for an application makes \n  good&lt;BR&gt;sense.&nbsp; We now know that the m=\r\nammalian brain is&lt;BR&gt;organized in \n  many distince modules that communicate=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;with each other.&nbsp; We can do \n  that with ANNs.&nbsp; In fact I&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nhave run some experiments with two ANNs \n  solving my&lt;BR&gt;4play puzzle.&nbsp=\r\n; (two 22 neuron ANNs instead of one \n  44&lt;BR&gt;neuron ANN).&nbsp; First resu=\r\nlts were encouraging.&nbsp; It is a&lt;BR&gt;way \n  of substantially reducing the=\r\n number of weights.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;BR&gt;Mitchell \n  Timin&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n=\r\n  href=3D&quot;http://annevolve.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;http://annevolve.sourceforge.ne=\r\nt&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;__________________________________&lt;BR&gt;Do \n  you Yahoo!?&lt;BR&gt;Fre=\r\ne Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://companion.yahoo.com/&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://companion.yahoo.com/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;To \n  unsubscribe from=\r\n this group, send an email \n  to:&lt;BR&gt;neat-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Your use of \n  Yahoo!
