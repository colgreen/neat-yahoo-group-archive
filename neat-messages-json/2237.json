That is the neuron at the top of the hierarchy.  If this is \nthe &quot;elvis&quot; neuron, even when I say &quot;elvis&quot; you get a picture of \nElvis in your head.  This is the feedback from that one neuron back \nto the outputs simulating the visual input IMO.  This feedback also \nallows us to fill in missing pieces...i.e.- i show you a picture of \nhalf of elvis&#39; face, your brain fills in the rest.\n\nIf a NEAT + Hawkins approach works in something like visual \nrecognition, this would be groundbreaking for sure.  Mainly because \nif it works there it should work in other seneory domains as well. \n\nI also think it might be necessary to seed NEAT with a somewhat more \ncomplex beginning structure here because I believe a certain minimum \nof links/nodes both recurrent and otherwise will be necessary as a \nbaseline...then let NEAT expand from there. \n\nNow if I just had the time to do it...\n\nBest,\nKevin\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jeff Haynes&quot; &lt;jeff@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am moving towards something much more complex.  I would like \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; try and implement NEAT+Hawkins(On Intelligence) ideas on how \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brain works.  This requires more complex structures that \nallow, for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instance, for recurrent connections back to *input* nodes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, outputs are inputs.  It&#39;s all a big loop.  But it&#39;s more \nthan\n&gt; &gt; just that...  When the &#39;expected&#39; input (which is an output of an\n&gt; &gt; &#39;expectation&#39; circuit) doesn&#39;t match the input, you get one \nresult. \n&gt; &gt; When it does, you get another.  But that kind of thing is VERY\n&gt; &gt; different than NEAT.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, NEAT doesn&#39;t address this specifically but I&#39;m not sure what \nyou&#39;re\n&gt; saying here.  It&#39;s certainly &quot;handled&quot; by NEAT as well as anything \nelse\n&gt; (seemingly better in some cases).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is also a strong temporal aspect to this according to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hawkins.  incorporating both the feedback and temporal aspects \ninto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a net raises the level of complexity quite a bit.  Hawkins \nteam has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; implemented a fixed structure hierarchy that is not really a \nNN.  It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uses bayesian probabilities throughout the feedback mechanism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Their early tests show some real promise in invariant visual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recognition...but I feel their structure is too constrained and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would like to see if NEAT can be applied with his concepts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated.  It may not work or may be too complex...I \ndunno...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think NEAT is what you want.  I think you want a dynamic\n&gt; &gt; network that grows during the life of the organism.  Which means \nyou\n&gt; &gt; need a set of rules governing that growth.  Evolution might best \nbe\n&gt; &gt; applied to those rules, rather than to the structure itself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I disagree.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing NEAT would \nexcel at. \n&gt; Any time you have recurrency, there are &quot;temporal aspects&quot; but \nit&#39;s just a\n&gt; higher order of topology.  In fact, NEAT is evolving rules for \nbuilding\n&gt; structure, just not at the same level you&#39;re suggesting here (a la \ncellular\n&gt; automata).  Growth over the life of the organism is interesting \nand something\n&gt; I&#39;m not experienced with.  When our brains &quot;grow&quot; is that out of \nnecessity or\n&gt; opportunity?\n&gt; \n&gt; As for Bayesian networks, I believe it&#39;s just another spin on the \nsame\n&gt; problem.  Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe anything \nthat can be\n&gt; done by a bayesian network can in theory be done with a NN.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; jeff\n\n\n\n"}}
