However, occasionally it seems that if the \nInternet goes off while wget is running, then wget hangs forever.\n\nThis may be a windows thing, windows generally seems more subject to \napplications hanging forever when the Internet goes off and on.  Maybe you \ncould have  second process monitoring wget and executing a kill if it runs \nfor more than 2 mins?\n\n         Ian Badcoe\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
