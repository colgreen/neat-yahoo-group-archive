The type of network activation in NEAT is described in the=\r\n NEAT Users FAQ at \n\nhttp://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html  \n\nUnder the=\r\n question:\n\nHow are networks with arbitrary topologies activated? \n\nThe gen=\r\neral answer is that NEAT can evolve any arbitrary recurrent topology.  The =\r\nimportant concept to understand is that activation travels the length of on=\r\ne connection very tick of the clock.  So if there is a recurrent connection=\r\n, it will travel over that connection just as it would a feedforward connec=\r\ntion.  It will take as many ticks as there are links in the chain to make i=\r\nt all the way through a particular recurrent loop or feedforward chain (or =\r\ncombination of the two).  \n\nAnother way to explain it is to point out that =\r\nthe activation process is simple:  It just sends activation from the output=\r\n of all current active nodes to the inputs of all nodes to which they conne=\r\nct in one time step.  There are no special rules for exit conditions or rul=\r\nes for how many times something may propagate.  As long as you keep activat=\r\ning the network, activation will continue to propagate, similarly to our ow=\r\nn brains.  (That is, our brains never &quot;stop&quot; until the end of life.)\n\nPleas=\r\ne let me know if you need further clarification.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Nikolai&quot; &lt;ker_31_toluca@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; i would like to ask=\r\n , which recurrent architecture is implemented in NEAT? Is it an Elman netw=\r\nork type? Or maybe Hopfield network? I have looked at rtNeat code but still=\r\n can&#39;t understand how recurrency is done, how many times does it propagate =\r\nin a loop, what is the loop exit condition, etc... ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advanc=\r\ne\n&gt; Nikolai\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
