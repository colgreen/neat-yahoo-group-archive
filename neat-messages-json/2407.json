We choose a function based on the \n&gt;problem at hand, so it doesn&#39;t seem sensible to switch to a different \n&gt;function. But often we come up with different ways of evaluating netwoks \n&gt;for a given problem and we often have discussions about what is the best \n&gt;function. What if we were to code up a few of theses different functions \n&gt;and allow NEAT to periodically switch between them. This then could be \n&gt;something akin to an extinction event occuring in nature and changing \n&gt;the fitness landscape.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n.... or if your function has a bunch of measures that are weighted to \ngive a final fitness score you could just change the weighting \noccasionally.\n\n\n\n"}}
