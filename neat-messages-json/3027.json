Lots of quick responses.  Some quick replies:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Julien - I have indeed seen the contest and I&#39;ve thought of\n&gt;  entering.  The big issues is that you get a graphic file of the\n&gt;  screen, so I would need to extract details from the graphic, or let\n&gt;  NEAT find features.  While that would be very cool if it worked, I\n&gt;  would be amazed if it could work from first principles but would\n&gt;  rather require a hearty set of primitives.  They mention the\n&gt;  possible availability of an API to extract features, but I have yet\n&gt;  to see it come to life.\n&gt;\n\nI saw a basic feature extraction algorithm up and running in Simons\noffice the other day - I think he will post it online as soon as he\nhas sorted out a bug or two.\n\nBut being able to extract information from the raw image would of\ncourse be way cooler - I think NEAT has some potential there, as it\nstarts out with minimal connectivity, and can thus potentially handle\nsuch a massive input array. (Which a standard fixed-topology net would\ncertainly not do...)\n\nAlso, Wesley, have you tried mailing Simon about your problems with\ngetting the code running? I&#39;m sure he would like to know.\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nDepartment of Computer Science\nUniversity of Essex\nColchester, CO4 3SQ, UK\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\n+44-7851-742111\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
