The papers I /have/ seen tended to \nbe unpenetrable to my mind, often I can&#39;t even determine which branch of \nneuroology thay are meant to be covering let alone understand the details.\n\nHowever, I think the central question you&#39;ve put forward (how functional \nmodules in the brain are arranged and how they communicate) is a simple \none to understand (from a big picture point of view). And I agree that \nspeculating on what mechanisms and structures might be in play may give \nsome insight into neuro-evolution and related areas. With this in mind \nI&#39;ll try elucidate my thoughts on the subject, although I&#39;m sure these \nideas aren&#39;t anything knew.\n\nI think considering specific problems such as playing chess, and \nanalysing your own thought processes whilst playing can give some \ninsight into what is going on. Actually if we are talking about \ncapitalising on symmetry I prefer to consider the game of Go, since \n(personally) I tend to always consider a chess board from one side - the \nside I am playing from. Whereas Go doesn&#39;t have this inherent sidedness \nand it is therefore probably more useful to rotate and translate the \nboard in your mind when playing. Having said that I&#39;m fairly useless at \nboth games, so what do I know ;)\n\nThe first thing to note is that I home in on small groups of pieces and \nconsider them in isolation of the rest of the board. When detecting \npatterns I won&#39;t always mentally rotate the pieces, usually I need to do \nthis at first but then learn to recognise the various patterns in their \ndifferent rotations directly. Secondly, the high level process of \nidentifying interesting groups, rotating them and deciding if they are \ninteresting is a concious process (state the obvious alert!), \nundoubtedly there is a heck of a lot of sub-concious activity (e.g. \nvisual cortex) but  I see that as mostly being much lower level \nprocesses such as building a mental model of the board from the visual \ninput - which is not what we&#39;re discussing.\n\nSo I can percieve a group of pieces, the lines they form and their \noverall shape. I may then have a memory of the shape with and an \nassociated memory of a good move (or moves) to play, or I may recall \nthat this is a shape that is no use to me (no good moves) and will then \nmove on to analysing other groups. Or I may have no memory at all of \nthis pattern, in which case I have to analyse it keeping in mind the \nrules of the game and perhaps memories of similar patterns that may \napply, considering each in turn and discounting them or flagging them as \npossible options.\n\nSome perhaps obvious notes to make at this point:\n\n1) My concious thought can generally only focus on one thing at a time. \nI can quickly switch back to very recent thoughts (short term memory), \nallowing me to consider, say,  a number of different moves and how well \nthey relate to each other. But I cannot consider them concurrently. As I \nconsider each one I am assigning a sort of rating to it, while also \ntrying to keep in mind the best rated move so far.\n\n2) My capacity to keep each of these seperate thoughts in mind is \nlimited. This becomes particularly obvious (for me) when performing \nmental arithmetic, forgetting earlier calculated values, or forgetting \nwhich part of the calculation they relate to. Some people seem better at \nmaintaining short term memory than others, although in the case of \narithmetic there is also the factor of some people memorising far more \nanswers than others(e.g. multiplication tables), thus reducing the need \nto keep loads of figures in short term memory (sub-calculations).\n\nSo it seems to me that the concious part of the brain is loading in \nsingle thoughts from the short and long term memory and acting a little \nlike a CPU loading and executing single instructions at a time. Only \ninstead of a simple instruction, the conciousness loads a chunck or unit \nof thought. These units I would expect to have a consistent structure to \nthem so that they can be read/written to memory and passed around the \nbrain using the same communication channels. This includes all thoughts, \nfrom simple sensory based information such as images, sounds, taste and \nsensation, but also including all other types of thoughts such as facts, \nlanguage elements, concepts such as magnitude, orientation, momentum, \nhardness, the list goes on.\n\nActually language is quite an interesting thing to consider. If I hear \nsome phrase and remember it I would assume that I don&#39;t remember it as a \nchunk of audio like some mental equivalent of a WAV file, instead I am \nremembering the sequence of (recognised) words. Which leads to the \nquestion - am I remebering a copy of each word&#39;s unit representation as \nrecalled from the language part of the brain, or am I remembering a sort \nof pointer to each word?\n\nAlso consider how different facts, ideas and concepts (thought units) \nbecome related in the brain. Most of the time these thought units are \njust sitting in long term memory and not taking part in concious \nthought. e.g. If I say to you &quot;think of a yellow submarine&quot; you&#39;ve just \nrecalled what a submarine is, and probably some related thoughts about \nThe Beatles. Previously those thoughts were sitting dormant in your \nmemory. So is there a direct physical connection between the phrase \nyellow-submarine, the concept of a submarine that is yellow and the \nbeatles memory? or do these memories respond to the same stimulus, e.g. \nthey had all been &#39;indexed&#39; under yellow-sub but not physically \nconnected.  I suppose something like the later approach makes sense, \notherwise you might have two unrelated memories in physically seperate \nparts of the hippocampus (or wherever memory is), which would make \nphysically connecting at some later time difficult if say some new fact \nwas introduced that linked the two.\n\nSo I would hazard a guess that thoughts are packaged up and passed \naround the brain via something analogous to a data bus. As for modules \nthat perform different functions - well perhaps these are analogous to \nthe various execution circuits in a CPU and as such they would be fixed \nstructures that operate on whatever data that is passed to them. This \nmight explain how we can apply these funtions in different contexts. \nAlthough I strongly suspect that the &#39;execution units&#39; are highly \nabstract and that new skills that are learned are actually just new \nmemories that cause a given chain of thought units to get recalled, \nperhaps some thought units specify how to combine other thoughts with \nthe execution units to achieve a result.\n\nThe area of the brain where thought units are retrieved to and processed \ncould then be said to be where conciousness lies, but that would \nprobably be a gross oversimplification.\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
