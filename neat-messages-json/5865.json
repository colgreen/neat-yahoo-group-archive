Hence the original query.\n\n&gt; My understanding was that you tried to download some papers and it\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t let you do that.\nYes, that&#39;s where my problem started. It was about a week ago, and late\none evening. So do not put too much reliance on my memory. I had\nfollowed a link, from your recent YouTube video in Melbourne, to:\n\n   http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/uncategorised/software#noveltysearch\n\nI selected a reference to a paper of interest, but can&#39;t remember which\none exactly, but the link took me to a page with the  abstract and a\nfurther link to download the paper, which required me to log in to\nmy account, via the page described in my earlier email.\n\nThis morning, I am unable to recall exactly which publication was\ninvolved, despite trying the ones I thought would be most likely.\nSo either my memory is letting me down, most likely, or the site\nhas changed (I suspect Occam would dictate the former :-)\n\nI have three days allocated to this, next week. So if I can replicate\nthe problem, I&#39;ll email directly with full details.\n\nRob Marsden\n\n"}}
