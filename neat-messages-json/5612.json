Took a look at the Netw=\r\norkX module. It looks very interesting! In my C++ version, I had added vari=\r\nable input/output connections, network within a node and seeding of the ini=\r\ntial population with the required infrastructure updates and a distributed =\r\nprocessing backend. But what you are doing goes so much farther, that I am =\r\neager to get a look at it!\n\nAndy\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_cherv=\r\nenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am almost done wit=\r\nh the basic code and I&#39;ll mention some of its features now. I decided to us=\r\ne NetworkX for the genomes, because this module has lots of useful algorith=\r\nms and allows any python object to be a node and edges can be associated wi=\r\nth anything. This makes the evolution of neural networks a tiny part of wha=\r\nt&#39;s really possible. Any graph can be evolved, including undirected graphs =\r\nand nodes/edges containing discrete one-of-N values (integers, lists of pyt=\r\nhon objects, etc). So given that an evaluation function exists for any kind=\r\n of graph, you can quickly setup evolution. Neural networks are a particula=\r\nr kind of graphs and the package will have built in code necessary to evolv=\r\ne neural networks - the initialization functions, mutators, and a C++ inter=\r\nface to a class that represents the phenotypes. CPPNs support is trivial to=\r\n make, and given that python functions themselves can be attached to nodes,=\r\n it&#39;s possible to have algorithmic nodes working with more than one variabl=\r\ne and .. well, infinite stuff. OK, I gotta go. Wish me luck debugging. Talk=\r\n to you soon. :) \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jan van der =\r\nLugt &lt;janlugt@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Peter,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sound like an ambitious a=\r\nnd noble plan.
