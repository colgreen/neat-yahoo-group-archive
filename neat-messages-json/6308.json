Our 2011 paper look=\r\ns at evolvability, which is measured as distinct behaviors that can be gene=\r\nrated from a candidate genome.  More evolvable genomes generate more distin=\r\nct behaviors.  Your paper looks at measures that are related (area covered,=\r\n distance traveled), though not identical.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, our old resu=\r\nlts and your results (both in the hard maze) looks somewhat consistent.  Th=\r\nat is, if you look at the evolvability comparison between solutions in NS a=\r\nnd fitness in the hard maze in figure 4a in our paper, you see that actuall=\r\ny the difference, though we found it significant, is not very big (26.03 vs=\r\n. 24.76).   That might be genuinely consistent even with the small differen=\r\nce (if any) you see between novelty &quot;prior to further evolution,&quot; e.g. in f=\r\nigure 5 in your paper, which shows 4.16% explored for novelty vs. 4.04% for=\r\n fitness.  I think that consistency is actually a nice hint that our setups=\r\n are compatible.\n&gt; \n&gt; But here&#39;s the interesting part: It turns out that wh=\r\nere Joel and I saw dramatic gaps was the evolvability for the whole populat=\r\nion, which is something you were not looking at, because you were looking o=\r\nnly at solutions (as in our figure 4a). If you look at figure 4b in our pap=\r\ner, which examines whole populations, you can see that the evolvability of =\r\nthe most evolvable member of the NS population is way higher than for fitne=\r\nss (about 35 vs 25).  In addition, even the average evolvability is a lot h=\r\nigher (about 20 for NS vs.15 for fitness).   \n&gt; \nThat is an interesting obs=\r\nervation. My guess is that it stems from the fact that novelty search has g=\r\nreater diversity in its population, such that you&#39;d expect higher variance =\r\nwith respect to most traits, evolvability included. But that does not dimin=\r\nish the point that you make: novelty search search populations are probably=\r\n much better positioned to adapt to an environmental change than a populati=\r\non evolved with traditional, objective-based search.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This observation=\r\n suggests that, if you think of NS as a method for gathering interesting be=\r\nhaviors (and not for solving one particular problem), then what you are get=\r\nting in aggregate is a lot of behaviors that are better for generating furt=\r\nher interesting behaviors.  The fitness-based populations lack this propert=\r\ny, even if the evolvability of a particular type of behavior is not dramati=\r\ncally different between the two.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, that still does not explain =\r\nwhy even a particular solution from NS should not be a lot more evolvable t=\r\nhan from fitness.  I still think it should be in principle, but perhaps the=\r\n hard maze is not the right domain to tease that out.  Perhaps the issue in=\r\n the hard maze is that actually none of the behaviors (as measured by last =\r\npoint visited) actually require a great deal of complexity, so you don&#39;t se=\r\ne the accumulated nasty effect of &quot;bad complexity&quot; growing on top of bad co=\r\nmplexity that fitness is expected to produce.   That is, the solution to th=\r\ne hard maze is not yet complex enough that the additional awkward structure=\r\n added in the fitness searches exacts that much of a toll on evolvability f=\r\nor the particular solution.  But I bet that if you found really radically c=\r\nomplex behaviors with NS (yet to be shown) that if fitness ever could even =\r\nreach such a behavior, its representation would be horrible and its evolvab=\r\nility therefore much lower.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this kind of comparison (on ide=\r\nntically-performaing highly complex solutions) could prove impossible to ma=\r\nke because ultimately really complex behaviors may not be possible to disco=\r\nver through fitness anyway, so you&#39;d never be able to see the example of th=\r\ne corrupted complexity in the fitness case.  \n&gt; \nI agree that it is a fasci=\r\nnating question why the novelty search organisms are not more evolvable. I =\r\nalso agree that the hard maze may be too simple a task to get at the answer=\r\n. I think there&#39;s a lot more exciting research to be done into this questio=\r\nn, and I look forward to seeing it unfold in the coming years.\n\t\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\r\n--Apple-Mail=_86D3902E-27BA-4AFA-BBDD-FDC45732395B\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=windows-1252\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html charset=\r\n=3Dwindows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=3D&quot;word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-=\r\nmode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;&quot;&gt;Hi Ken,&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Please see below.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote type=\r\n=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); position: sta=\r\ntic; z-index: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-mlmsg&quot; style=3D&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv id=3D&quot;ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;z-index: 1;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Jeff, =\r\nregarding the evolvability of novelty vs. fitness, it may be more interesti=\r\nng than I previously realized to consider your new paper with Roby in conju=\r\nnction with our 2011 paper on evolvability with novelty search:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_cec11.pdf&quot;&gt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.ed=\r\nu/papers/lehman_cec11.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These papers are complementary in the =\r\nsense that they actually both look at novelty search and fitness in the har=\r\nd maze.&nbsp; Our 2011 paper looks at evolvability, which is measured as di=\r\nstinct behaviors that can be generated from a candidate genome.&nbsp; More =\r\nevolvable genomes generate more distinct behaviors.&nbsp; Your paper looks =\r\nat measures that are related (area covered, distance traveled), though not =\r\nidentical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly, our old results and your results (both in =\r\nthe hard maze) looks somewhat consistent.&nbsp; That is, if you look at the=\r\n evolvability comparison between solutions in NS and fitness in the hard ma=\r\nze in figure 4a in our paper, you see that actually the difference, though =\r\nwe found it significant, is not very big (26.03 vs. 24.76).&nbsp;&nbsp; Tha=\r\nt might be genuinely consistent even with the small difference (if any) you=\r\n see between novelty &quot;prior to further evolution,&quot; e.g. in figure 5 in your=\r\n paper, which shows 4.16% explored for novelty vs. 4.04% for fitness.&nbsp;=\r\n I think that consistency is actually a nice hint that our setups are compa=\r\ntible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here&#39;s the interesting part: It turns out that where Joel=\r\n and I saw dramatic gaps was the evolvability for the &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\ntyle:italic;&quot;&gt;whole population&lt;/span&gt;, which is something you were not look=\r\ning at, because you were looking only at &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;=\r\n&gt;solutions &lt;/span&gt;(as in our figure 4a).
