Modularity entails a trade off \nvery like\n&gt; &gt; &gt;(5) in that the presence of modularity increases the size of \nthe overall\n&gt; &gt; &gt;search space (adding choices about how to define modules) but \nhugely\n&gt; &gt; &gt;decreases the size of the parts that are considered at one time \n(e.g. each\n&gt; &gt; &gt;modules fitness landscape is much, much smaller than the \noverall fitness\n&gt; &gt; &gt;landscape.).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In the mean time it&#39;s a good idea to investigate the limits of \ndirect\n&gt; &gt;encoding techniques such as NEAT. With a great many experiments \nand all\n&gt; &gt;ideas exhausted research can them move on to modular or indirect\n&gt; &gt;approaches, using the best direct encoding technques as a \nbenchmark.  I\n&gt; &gt;also think that NEAT could form the core of an indirect encoding\n&gt; &gt;technique in the future, finding sub-solutions that can then be\n&gt; &gt;recombined into larger solutions. I think I just walked into that \ntrap\n&gt; &gt;of thinking in a &#39;divide and conquer&#39; / engineering manner \nagain :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that I agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, let me rephrase, I agree that NEAT is an exciting technique \nand well \n&gt; worthy of all the exploration we can get.\n&gt; \n&gt; But..., I&#39;m not sure that the progression to modular systems is \nnecessarily \n&gt; a _consequence_ of sufficient non-modular research.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maybe this is the same doubt as you imply in your final sentence?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m also not sure I necessarily equate the &quot;indirect&quot; \nwith &quot;modular&quot;.  I \n&gt; mean there is some quite solid thought suggesting that indirect \nencoding is \n&gt; a major approach to modularity (e.g. in nature).  Or even, \nreversing the \n&gt; viewpoint, that by the time you&#39;ve added enough bells-and-whistles \nto \n&gt; support modularity, you will find the representations no longer \nvery \n&gt; direct.  But I think it&#39;s worth taking care to keep the concepts \nseparate \n&gt; for the moment...\n&gt; \n\nI would also point out that NEAT can be used with an indirect \nencoding.  Genes that produce &quot;proteins&quot; that then activate other \ngenes etc., can be tracked with historical markings just like any \nother kind of gene, and those markings can be used to speciate the \npopulation and start minimally.  So it&#39;s not necessary to use NEAT \nas a system for evolving modules that are composed by some higher-\nlevel system (as in Joe Reisinger&#39;s already-completed work).  \nInstead, NEAT can evolve genuine indirectly encoded structures.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
