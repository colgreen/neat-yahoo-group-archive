It&#39;s a good idea\n&gt;to lay out the different connotations &quot;modularity&quot; can have.  I\n&gt;think Joe Reisinger has done that kind of work too, so he might have\n&gt;some insight into different kinds of modularity as well.  Also,\n&gt;Richard Watson (who is not in this group as far as I know) has done\n&gt;a lot of work on modularity during his Ph.D. and Postdoc research:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/wakeley/richard/\n\nI&#39;ll check that out.\n\n&gt;Anyway, the experiment is interesting as a first stab at things.\n&gt;Yet it is strucutred in such a way that there is really only one way\n&gt;to break down the task, or am I wrong on that?  I mean, the module\n&gt;has to return the line length.  I can&#39;t think of another computation\n&gt;it could do that would provide the necessary info to the &quot;user&quot;\n&gt;network.\n\nThis may be the case, but we do not actually know until the experiment is \ntried (and whilst this started as a purely theoretical discussion, if it \nturns out interesting enough I&#39;ll look into actually trying it -- would \nanybody like to collaborate on it?).\n\n&gt;So the question is, let&#39;s say the experiment succeeds, i.e. it\n&gt;evolves the module and user to solve the problem.  What new insight\n&gt;does that provide?  I guess at minimum it&#39;s a proof-of-concept that\n&gt;it&#39;s possible.  Yet at the same time I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really\n&gt;pointing in the right direction.  For example, I *think* we want to\n&gt;move towards giving evolution in a computer the tools to develop\n&gt;modules that it can reuse and encapsulate just as in your proposed\n&gt;experiment, except that evolution would discover the breakdown\n&gt;itself.  Does this experiment give us more or less hope in that\n&gt;regard?\n\nThis is very much a proof of concept thing.  If we cannot even get this to \nwork, how can we hope to succeed with any more complex implementation?\n\nNote that it is designed to be expandable along the lines I laid out at the \nend of the post:\n\n &gt; 1) speed of solution vs non-modular approach\n &gt; 2) different dimensionality of line\n &gt; 3) let the module-&gt;user interface evolve (e.g. it could gain or lose \nconnections)\n &gt; 4) use a similar approach for different problems, possibly with more \nthan one type of module\n &gt; 5) how to create genomes for interfaces and topology...\n\nIn particular:\n\n4 would mean extension to harder problems, where I was not so strongly \nassuming a particular solution.\n3 would mean extension to more data crossing the interface (and even \nbi-directional)\n5 would be the path towards allowing the genome to choose how many modules \nand interfaces to implement\n         (and consequently getting the genomes of the separate modules and \nthe definitions together in a single interface)\n\nSo I think that, conditional upon this proof of concept working, the \n&quot;further work&quot; would move into the area we are both really interested in.\n\nNote that there is also a lot of interesting work this side of a fully \nself-modularizing system.\n\n         Ian\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\r\n\n"}}
