I guess that such a \ntopology (space) is enou=\r\ngh to solve the problem, but it restricts the \nreal power of the CPPN, to d=\r\nescribe any possible topology. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jason=\r\n Gauci&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding the number of connections, th=\r\nere are two things to note:\n&gt; \n&gt; First, HyperNEAT uses all 64 input nodes, =\r\neven the ones which cannot\n&gt; legally contain a piece.  The reason why is be=\r\ncause we wanted to\n&gt; compare HyperNEAT&#39;s approach to discovering geometric =\r\nregularities\n&gt; with NEAT-EI&#39;s approach of using a priori engineered regular=\r\nities.  \nIf\n&gt; we disabled the connections that would never be activated, we=\r\n would \nbe\n&gt; cheating, in a sense, by providing a priori domain-specific \nk=\r\nnowledge\n&gt; to the algorithm.  The only a priori knowledge needed involves t=\r\nhe\n&gt; size of the layers in the substrate and the hidden layer\n&gt; configurati=\r\non.  In this case, the extra connections have no impact \non\n&gt; the network, =\r\nbut I left them in ti keep with the spirit of the \nexperiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second,=\r\n all 64*64 + 64*1 (4160) connections in the substrate are not\n&gt; always expr=\r\nessed.  If the CPPN outputs a value with a magnitude less\n&gt; than 0.2, the c=\r\nonnection weight is forced to absolute 0, disabling \nthe\n&gt; connection.  Con=\r\nnections which are disabled are considered to not\n&gt; exist, so the 3979 numb=\r\ner implies that some of the connections were\n&gt; not expressed in that substr=\r\nate.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Gauc=\r\ni and I are pleased to share with you new results with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in =\r\nour new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conference on Artifi=\r\ncial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Critical Role of Geom=\r\netric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cool, I enjoyed the pa=\r\nper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few questions:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Was =\r\nthe 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt; &gt; * Why not a 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, o=\r\nut) - which seems more natural \nto me?\n&gt; &gt; * Was more than one CPPN configu=\r\nration tried?
