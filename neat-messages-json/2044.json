At least for\n&gt; &gt; now to play with and to see what I can do.  I&#39;ll keep this group\n&gt; &gt; posted on any progress and/or package i come up with.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve put up a release of my python-based extensible reusable etc\ngenetic \n&gt; algorithm framework. I made a stab at writing a readme file, but its \n&gt; probably horribly incomplete. So if you have any questions please ask.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that this does not contain a working NEAT implementation. It\ncontains \n&gt; stubs for adding the NN code, and has a complexifying GRN that is\nbased on \n&gt; NEAT. It ought to be trivial to add in a full NEAT implementation,\nthough, \n&gt; I just haven&#39;t found the time to do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the link:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joeraii/software.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; \n&gt; Joseph Reisinger\n&gt; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n\n\n"}}
