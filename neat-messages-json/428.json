It&#39;s true that the encoding that I used in\nmy papers and software is direct, but (Derek can correctly me if I&#39;m\nwrong) I think Derek is anticipating in the future being able to\nchange the encoding without having to write an entirely new system, \nthereby eventually getting indirect versions of NEAT.\n\nIf what I&#39;m saying sounds strange, consider that the NEAT method says\nnothing about the *mapping* between genotype and phenotype. So NEAT\ngenes could e.g. encode proteins or cell splitting rules.\n\n(I know at least one person has already written an indirect NEAT.)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
