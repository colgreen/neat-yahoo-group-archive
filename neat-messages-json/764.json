Where did you download the code that is doing \n&gt; this?  Is it my version, or maybe the version Darren recently \n&gt; uploaded to the files section that compiles under Windows?\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing you could do is comment out the depth call and just have \n&gt; the network activate some constant (e.g. 5) number of times.  It \n&gt; doesn&#39;t really need to compute depth to do XOR, or for continuous \n&gt; control experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Everybody calls me Bull in real \nlife&quot; \n&gt; &lt;robert_winkel@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I have the C++ version of NEAT, with the visualization and Guile \n&gt; &gt; routines removed, and have successfully compiled it under Cygwin \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; Windows XP.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I run the XOR experiment, I come into a bit of trouble.  \nMost \n&gt; &gt; of the time, it seems to get caught into an infinite loop and \njust \n&gt; &gt; prints &quot;** DEPTH NOT DETERMINED FOR NETWORK WITH LOOP&quot; to the \n&gt; &gt; screen.  Only once has this not happened, and has a xor_winner \n&gt; file \n&gt; &gt; been generated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m thinking that there must be something wrong with the \n&gt; NNode::depth\n&gt; &gt; () method.  Can anyone help me in this area?  Any ideas for \n&gt; &gt; alternative code for this method?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Robert.\n\n\n"}}
