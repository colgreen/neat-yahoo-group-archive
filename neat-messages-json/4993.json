I gave them 1 bit for the =\r\nbias. 2 bits for the light angle, and 3 bits for each distance ray (6 rays =\r\ntotal). They got 1 bit for the output thrust, and 1 bit for the output turn=\r\n angle.\nSo totally they have 21 inputs & 2 outputs. Each one just 1 bit.\n\nT=\r\nhe summation, in the activation function neat.c:_genome_activate(), is repl=\r\naced with NAND. If a node has only one input the node acts like a NOT.\nThe =\r\ngene weights has no impact on anything in this test.\n\nfor (n =3D 0, res =3D=\r\n 1; n &lt; nin; n++, op++)\n res =3D !(res && (*op-&gt;ptr =3D=3D 1));\n\n\nIn eco.c =\r\n(LINE 30 - 39) one can experiment with how many bits each input & output ha=\r\ns.\n\nI uploaded eco-bnn.tar.gz, to the eco folder. It contains win exe + 3 p=\r\natches for the 0.6 src release.\n\nThey learn how to follow blue light, but i=\r\nt takes longer. Train them on an empty map for faster sucess.\n\n/Magnus\n\n---=\r\n In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;snapmedown&quot; &lt;snapmedown@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What are=\r\n the thoughts on a neural network that has inputs and outputs digitized?
