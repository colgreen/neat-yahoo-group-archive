All the while I think you&#39;d\nwant to have some elitism, so you don&#39;t mutationally eradicate the best of\nwhat you&#39;ve learned so far.\n\nAnother cool idea for generating ongoing diversity, and getting the\npopulation unstuck, is Greg Hornby&#39;s ALPS method, which has some really\npromising results. I think it would be pretty interesting to see someone\ncombine ALPS with NEAT to see if ALPS works better than NEAT&#39;s diversity\npreservation method, or whether the two together work better than either\nalone, etc. \n\nhttp://idesign.ucsc.edu/projects/alps.html\n\n\nBest regards,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\njclune@...\nwww.msu.edu/~jclune\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Colin Green &lt;colin.green1@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sat, 13 Mar 2010 15:01:46 +0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Fitness Landscape Modulation\n&gt; \n&gt; This is an idea I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while. Consider a\n&gt; fitness landscape with local maxima that we tend to get stuck in. NEAT\n&gt; gives us some ways of getting out of the local high points:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Speciation. Maintains multiple search &#39;areas&#39; on teh landscape and\n&gt; balances search effort between them. However, speciation by itself\n&gt; doesn&#39;t provide a means of discovering new promising areas on the\n&gt; landscape.\n&gt; 2) Random mutations. Allow us to &#39;hop&#39; to new but relatively proximate\n&gt; points on the landscape, e.g. single new connections/nodes and random\n&gt; resetting of connections weights.\n&gt; 3) Crossover. Attempts to find new areas, but that are close to both\n&gt; parents (typically by searching in some higher dimensional space than\n&gt; either of the parents). Hence crossover provides access to a lot of\n&gt; new search space by bringing it nearer to our current search\n&gt; points(genomes) in terms of &#39;edit distance&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m proposing that another way of opening up the fitness landscape is\n&gt; to modify that landscape such that the arrangement of landscape\n&gt; barriers changes and opens up pathways to new areas, but in a way that\n&gt; still leads to promising areas. E.g. One technique I have experimented\n&gt; with is to factor the size of a genome into the fitness function,\n&gt; motivation for this comes from mathematical regularization - simply\n&gt; that simpler models/genomes are more generalised and thus fitter than\n&gt; more complex models (depending on the problem domain).\n&gt; \n&gt; If I enforce selection pressure against complexity I see the search\n&gt; becoming overly constrained, but if I lessen that pressure or remove\n&gt; it, allow search to continue for a while and then re-impose the\n&gt; pressure then I&#39;ve found that this to be successful. You can imagine\n&gt; that I&#39;ve removed a barrier in the landscape, some of the genome shave\n&gt; migrated to new areas and then I&#39;ve put back the barriers and the\n&gt; genome snow settle into new local maxima and continue searching from\n&gt; there.\n&gt; \n&gt; This idea overlaps with phased search (alternating between\n&gt; complexifying and simplifying) and could be framed as an extension of\n&gt; that approach, essentially adding more phases or more axes to the\n&gt; complex-simple axis. I also think rather than switching certain types\n&gt; of fitness criteria on/off that a smoother transition would be a more\n&gt; general solution. You can imagine the landscape as undulating and the\n&gt; genomes as ball bearings rolling around as the landscpae changes\n&gt; (except ball bearings would follow valleys instead of peaks/ridges).\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin\n&gt; \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29\n\n\n\n"}}
