I&#39;m new to this group.  I was in the process of \ndesigning an implementation of NEAT when I found this group.  It&#39;s \nexciting to see that there are so many others with similar interests.\n\nMy original interest was in using temporal difference learning to \ntrain neural networks (via backpropagation) to play games.  The \nproblem I&#39;ve encountered is that learning tends to stop at a local \noptimum (the first good linear strategy).  I am considering \nNeuroEvolution as an approach to overcoming that problem that is  \ninherent in a gradient-based technique such as backpropagation. \n\nI&#39;ve noticed that several people have tried to apply ANNs to games \nsuch as Go.  My question is:  How would I calculate the fitness of \nan ANN for such cases?  \n\nUsing TD learning, the error function is based upon whether the ANN \nwins the game or not.  The ANN can play either a previously trained \nANN, or even itself.  When evolving ANNs, fitness could be \ncalculated similarly -- by holding some kind of tournament among the \nmembers of the population or by playing a previously trained ANN.  \nHowever, I expect that if fitness is always calculated relative to \nthe other ANNs in the population, the search process would again \nbecome gradient-based and prone to getting stuck in local optima.\n\nAnother way to calculate fitness might be to use a library of \nexpertly evaluated moves (or games), and calculate the ANNs ability \nto judge them.  However, this approach suffers from three drawbacks:\n\n  1)  one needs a library of expertly evaluated moves\n  2)  those moves might not really be evaluated &quot;expertly&quot;\n  3)  the ANN may overfit the sample, resulting in poor\n      generalization\n\nAll ideas and suggestions will be appreciated.  I hope that in the \nfuture I will be able to contribute answers in return.  \n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
