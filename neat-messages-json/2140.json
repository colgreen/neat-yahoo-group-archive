I&#39;ve been\nfollowing NEAT since grad school and have just started recently working\nwith it again.  I&#39;m working on what may the overly-zealous project to\ncreate a &quot;pokerbot&quot; based on NEAT.  I&#39;ve started by essentially rewriting\nthe neat engine itself in the hopes of speeding things up a bit.  I&#39;m\nanticipating the preprocessing and gameplay of poker itself to dominate\nthe cost of this endeavor and so, to the degree possible, I sort of need\nNEAT to get out of the way (process wise!).  Thus far I&#39;ve completed the\nnetwork and most of the selection process.  I&#39;ve taken a very small bite\nout of the actual poker side of things and am leaning heavily on the\npoker-eval library (see sourceforge) for this.  I&#39;ll post code somewhere\npretty soon if anyone is interested.  I&#39;d especially like to hear from\nanyone with an in-depth understanding of complex equities in poker! \nAnyway, greetings.\n\n- jeff\n\n\n"}}
