Thus I was thinking that a \npool \n&gt; of dead species (or a token genome from each, say the species \nchamp) \n&gt; could be kept and that we could implement some mechanism for \navoiding \n&gt; the area of the fitness space represented by these genomes - using \nthe \n&gt; genome compatibility function.\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to think through the specifics on this but it seems to make \nsense \n&gt; because it forces the search into new areas (or it could if \nimplemented \n&gt; properly). The problem is how do we ensure we generate new genomes \nthat \n&gt; are sufficiently different enough from the dead species to go and \n&gt; explore new areas of the search space? The answer may lie within \nthe \n&gt; above discussion(s).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nColin, this sounds like a really interesting idea.  I need to think \nabout it also.  I like the idea of keeping away from places that \nalready got stuck.  \n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
