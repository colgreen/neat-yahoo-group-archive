I can see now that I really need to go back into\nthe message archive and acth up on some of the past CPPn discussions.\ne.g. I guess the building/structure domain would need co-evolution of\nthe substrate (positions of the nodes) and perhaps you could have two\noutputs instead of one from the CPPN, one for material strut width say\nand one for material type.\n\nThe visual rotation problem I&#39;m unfamilar with also. When you say\nmultiple variables I take that as being multiple collectors on each\nneuron (one per activation input variable/parameter), which is\nsomething that was discussed ages ago before CPPN. I&#39;ll take a look\nthrought archives on that one also.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin\n\nOn 04/12/2007, petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I remember that we discussed one issue about visual recognition with\n&gt; HyperNEAT (CPPNs) and one particular problem arised and this the\n&gt; problem of evolving the concept of rotation.\n&gt;\n&gt; CPPN-NEAT needs to be extended with neurons that have activation\n&gt; functions supporting multiple variables for input/output for such a\n&gt; thing to be achieved.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another option for a CPPN application is Alife domains, where the\n&gt; crature&#39;s genotype is a CPPN, but it is still not clear what the\n&gt; creatures would be and what should they do perform in their world in\n&gt; order to be selected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Recently I proposed that a CPPN could evolve the material properties\n&gt; for static physics objects, where the goal is to find the right\n&gt; structure for a building or a bridge, for stuff like eartquakes for\n&gt; example, to make it reliable.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are many more domains, these are just the ones I first thought\n&gt; of.\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Colin Green&quot; &lt;locster01@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The good people over at http://galaxyzoo.org/ announced today that\n&gt; each\n&gt; &gt; galaxy in their database has been categorized by 30 people (on\n&gt; average).\n&gt; &gt; Sounds like they&#39;re building up a sizeable database we might be\n&gt; able to use.\n&gt; &gt; For the uninitiated you basically log in and start looking at\n&gt; pictures of\n&gt; &gt; galaxies, classifying them as spiral (clockwise or anticlockwise) or\n&gt; &gt; eliptical. The problem they have is that some (actually a lot)of\n&gt; the images\n&gt; &gt; of galaxies are hard to classify, so they explained what to look\n&gt; for and\n&gt; &gt; opened the task up to Joe Public, the idea being that by grouping\n&gt; multiple\n&gt; &gt; answers they could determine a good answer for each galaxy. Seems\n&gt; the idea\n&gt; &gt; paid off.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now I&#39;ve looked at some of these galaxies and there&#39;s a lof of\n&gt; variation and\n&gt; &gt; general noise and mess in these images, and apart from that some of\n&gt; them are\n&gt; &gt; fairly vague. However, Joe Public + professional astronomers have\n&gt; trouble\n&gt; &gt; with some of these images also and now we potentially have a\n&gt; database (don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if it&#39;s all public yet) that quantifies which images are hard\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; clasify (by humans). An interesting question would be - How close\n&gt; can the\n&gt; &gt; best machine learning technique come to Joe Public on this task?\n&gt; Almost as\n&gt; &gt; good?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now I undertand attempts have been made to automate galaxy\n&gt; classification\n&gt; &gt; which didn&#39;t turn out well, hence the web site. But this does mean\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; will/should be a body of existing research out there detailing how\n&gt; well the\n&gt; &gt; current best known techniques can do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just a thought. There&#39;s certainly no shortage of galaxies to\n&gt; classify :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
