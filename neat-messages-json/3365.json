As I read your thoughts, some things came to \nmy mind:\n\n1. Feedback=\r\n can be achieved as adding more inputs that represent the \nACTUAL joint ang=\r\nles at the moment.\n\n2. Additional inputs can be added that are dependant on=\r\n the collision \ndetection procedure, I mean something like &quot;sense of touch&quot;=\r\n. \n\n3. It is possible to measure the energy exhausted for the muscle \nmovem=\r\nents, so that can be taken into account in the fitness function. \n\n4. The s=\r\ncalability of the substrate space (node density) is just one \nof the featur=\r\nes of HyperNEAT. It is not nessesarry to use that. The \nidea here is to use=\r\n the geometry of the body. A 100 neurons \ncontrolling the arm will not help=\r\n much. Just 3 are enough :) \n\nI will keep on working on this. It is interes=\r\nting and my primary goal \nis to achieve the same complexity and realism as =\r\nthe models used in \nNaturalMotion. I am planning to use that for computer g=\r\names \n(something that is already a fact - see Euphoria). But open source. I=\r\n \nhate this commercial shit out there.\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Stephen Waits &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Stephen Waits wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good ne=\r\nws.. it seems to run on my machine at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; After having run it for al=\r\nmost four hours.. a few random thoughts.  \nI&#39;m \n&gt; sure you&#39;ve thought about=\r\n these things much more than me, \nespecially \n&gt; since these aren&#39;t much mor=\r\ne than 2 second impulses through my tiny \nbrain :)\n&gt; \n&gt; * As Ken says, obje=\r\nctive function is going to be important, but I \nthink \n&gt; it may not be the =\r\n*most* important step toward success.\n&gt; \n&gt; * I wondered about the ability o=\r\nf your body configuration to \nactually \n&gt; stand up?  In that sense, are seg=\r\nment masses appropriate?  Joint \nlimits? \n&gt;   Joint accelerations?  Can the=\r\n muscular forces react quickly and \n&gt; forcefully enough?  For example, I ca=\r\nn recover from leaning/falling \n&gt; forward with a single leg (i.e. a &quot;lunge&quot;=\r\n).  I can furthermore \nsupport \n&gt; my entire body weight with a single leg.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; * I believe we humans have an AWFUL LOT of feedback.  Is it ten \ntimes=\r\n as \n&gt; much feedback as it actually is muscle command paths?  Something \nli=\r\nke \n&gt; that.  Anyway, seems that this task is very heavily dependent on \nlot=\r\ns of \n&gt; good feedback.  As an example, I&#39;m seeing quite a bit of this: a) \n=\r\nfind a \n&gt; position that is nearly balanced, b) hold it, c) fall over.  What=\r\n&#39;s \nyour \n&gt; feedback look like right now?\n&gt; \n&gt; * I&#39;m also seeing quite a bi=\r\nt of the weird &quot;squatting toe-stand&quot; \n&gt; position, for lack of a better desc=\r\nription.  This brings to mind \nthe \n&gt; idea of pain.  It hurts me to stand o=\r\nn my toes.  More feedback.\n&gt; \n&gt; * The problem of balance is incredibly comp=\r\nlex (like I need to \nmention \n&gt; this, right?).  There&#39;s a certain level of =\r\ngranularity that are \nprobably \n&gt; beyond simulation.  For example, we use o=\r\nur toes quite a bit when \n&gt; standing ourselves upright.  In some ways, this=\r\n extra complexity \nmay be \n&gt; necessary to efficiently stand; however, in bi=\r\ngger ways (as Ken \neludes \n&gt; to), they only complicate the search space.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * One fitness related idea I had was to reward individuals that use \nles=\r\ns \n&gt; energy.  For example, to balance, I&#39;d move my arms first, because \nit&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; easier, than moving my legs.\n&gt; \n&gt; * I&#39;d like to see you really use the=\r\n &quot;Hyper&quot; part of &quot;HyperNEAT&quot;.  \nThat \n&gt; is, evolve something simple, than i=\r\nncrease the substrate density \nwith \n&gt; 100&#39;s or even 1000&#39;s of nodes.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOverall, it&#39;s a very cool project.  I&#39;m looking forward to your \nnext \n&gt; up=\r\nload and please keep up the great work!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; --Steve\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
