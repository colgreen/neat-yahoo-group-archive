Physical world simulations come to \nmind - things like weather systems and nuclear detonations, especially \nsince actual nuclear tests are sort of frowned upon these days :)  Also \nI don&#39;t think any military organisation really wants their simulations \ndistributed over the internet... or perhaps that what SETI is /really/ \ndoing behind the scenes? ;)    I should keep schtum, I have a hunch \nthere may be some military folk on this list. :-/\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
