I enjoyed reading it although the level o=\r\nf detail was also for me partly too much. ;)\n\nBefore I comment on it and ot=\r\nher stuff let me just recall and separate the questions that we discussed.\n=\r\n\nA) What is the =3D=3D&gt; origin &lt;=3D=3D of modularity in networks (e.g. CNS)=\r\n?\n\nB) What criteria are helpful to identify modules in general?\n\nLet me bre=\r\nak down question B to \nB1) On which level do we want to identify modules? \n=\r\nB2) Should a module represent a functional unit? \n\nIn my last posting I cla=\r\nimed that using the degree of connectivity to identify modules in natural n=\r\neural networks might *not always* reveal modules that have been identified =\r\ndue to functional or anatomical criterias. But it depends, in my opinion, o=\r\nn your focus and on which level of detail you are looking at\n\nLet&#39;s say: B1=\r\n: Low level of detail, B2: Yes.\nI suppose that the columnar organisation in=\r\n sensory and motor areas (as described in the review by Leise) can be very =\r\nwell detected by your connectivity criteria. For associative areas, it is m=\r\nore complicated, I guess. It is not clear, whether a cortical column repres=\r\nents really a functional unit (see for example http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/=\r\npmc/articles/PMC1569491/) and it turned out to be difficult to identify &quot;ce=\r\nll assemblies&quot; that behave according to a &quot;representational framework&quot; (A g=\r\nood introduction is the first page of this review: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.=\r\ngov/pubmed/21040841). \n\nHere is an example of a subcortical region, where t=\r\nhe connectivity criteria would fail. Three important regions of the hippoca=\r\nmpus are called Dental Gyrus, CA3 and CA1. Neurons in CA 1 receive inputs f=\r\nrom many regions and project to some regions but they don&#39;t have recurrent =\r\nconnections (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CajalHippocampus_(modified).=\r\npng). CA 1 is defined according to anatomical properties (cell type, projec=\r\ntions, location etc.) and seem to have a specific function. It has zero wit=\r\nhin-module connectivity and high inter-module connectivity. Therefore, it w=\r\nould be not identified as a module acccording to the connectivity criteria =\r\nas each CA 1 neuron would be assigned either to CA3, DG, Entorhinal Cortex =\r\nor Septum. \n\nLet&#39;s say: B1: Higher level of detail.\n\nIn this case, I see it=\r\n like you described it:\n\n&gt; Is it just that the types of cells (or cellular =\r\nparts) matter, not the wiring itself, such that you can see modules of cell=\r\n type A as distinct from cell type B, but they are all wired up such that a=\r\n wiring diagram would make them look non-modular when in reality there are =\r\ndistinct clusters if you look at some attribute of the cells?\n\nCytoarchitec=\r\nture refers to the cell types, their layering and wiring (e.g.  http://en.w=\r\nikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area). I am simply not sure whether functions th=\r\nat have been assigned to large groups of columns could be detected with the=\r\n connectivity criteria. \n\nIf B2 is answered with No, all of this is doesn&#39;t=\r\n matter of course. \n\nThis leads to question B:\nI think the connectivity cri=\r\nteria is helpful and probably applicable on many local circuits, but the va=\r\nrious ways functions (and thereby modules) are implemented call =96 in my o=\r\npinion =96 for other profound design principles / constraints.\n\nWhich leads=\r\n to question A: \nIn this regard, the review by Leise confirmed my opinion t=\r\nhat modularity in a CNS arises from modularity of the rest of the organism.=\r\n If CNSs developed really from skin brain organisms (see: http://www.nature=\r\n.com/nrn/journal/v4/n8/abs/nrn1175.html) than the emergence of a CNS would =\r\nin actual fact more represent a decrease in modularity. \n\nHowever, the fact=\r\n that the number of connections increased more in proportion to the number =\r\nof neurons (but not in proportion to the square of the number of neurons) m=\r\night be something which can be reached in simulations by using connection c=\r\nost in a fitness function or an encoding bias (and I personally thing it is=\r\n a mixture of encoding and self-organizing mechanisms). But here I think, t=\r\nhe field lacks a formal grounding to explain in an unambiguous way why some=\r\none should implement a bias in a particular manner.\n\nI am looking forward t=\r\no your response :) \n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n"}}
