(I had some trouble understandi=\r\nng what to do with ANJI and JNEAT too.)\n&gt; \n&gt; It was designed to be able to =\r\nmodify the number of hidden layers. It was my first Java project and it was=\r\n unnecessarily complicated. However, a large chunk of the code was ported f=\r\nrom the original C++ HyperNeat. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s reusable with a bit tuning (e=\r\n.g. not mutating number of layers and their connection patterns.)\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou want it, I will email you the code.\n&gt;\n\nThank you JT. can you send a copy=\r\n HyperNeat in Java? \nThanks for sharing your codes.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
