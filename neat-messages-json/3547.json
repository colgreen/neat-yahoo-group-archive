The problem is that there are so \nmany possible spurio=\r\nus correlations between good pictures and other \nirrelevent factors that th=\r\ne classifier will not get the deeper \nconcept of what makes a good picture.=\r\n\n\nYet I agree with John in the sense that there is extremely rich and \nunus=\r\nual data in the Picbreeder database that may be useful for \nsomething beyon=\r\nd Picbreeder itself.  I just think the right way to \nleverage it is tricky.=\r\n\n\nThe idea of complexity is also quite muddy.  Unfortunately, the word \nmea=\r\nns a lot of different things.  In fact, perhaps the best formal \ndefinition=\r\n (&quot;minimal description length&quot;) is both proven \nuncomputable in general and=\r\n also does not correlate to what is meant \nby the normal intuitive use of t=\r\nhe word complexity with respect to \nevolution.  \n\nAs evolutionary complexit=\r\ny goes up in the sense we usually mean it, \nit is not just that the phenoty=\r\npe takes more bits to describe.  \nThere is also a sense of organization, i.=\r\ne. regularity, that begins \nto take hold.  That is in direct opposition wit=\r\nh the idea of minimal \ndescription length.  In fact, what we really want is=\r\n some kind of \npartnership between complexity and organization.  Unfortunat=\r\nely that \nintroduces yet another mysterious word: organization; it also \nin=\r\ntroduced a partnership between two seemingly opposing forces.  Yet \nI think=\r\n this muddiness and internal conflict is important because it \nshows that t=\r\nhis problem is extremely slippery.  It makes me wonder \nwhat is meant by &quot;d=\r\noing well&quot; for humans asked to select for \ncomplexity.\n\nIn any case, I do l=\r\nike the theme behind John&#39;s idea, but I think \nsomething more sophisitcated=\r\n needs to be done to capture the deeper \nreasons that certain pictures are =\r\nselected.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; There have been experiments where people select for complexity (in \nan=\r\n\n&gt; information theory sense) instead of fitness...and it is reported \nthat =\r\nthey\n&gt; do well. It would be interesting to see someone do that here, so \nyo=\r\nu can see\n&gt; what (selected for) complexity looks like. But, aside from that=\r\n \ncuriosity, I\n&gt; doubt it could match humans in terms of producing things \n=\r\ninteresting to\n&gt; humans....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital=\r\n Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@...\n&gt; 517.214.1060\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: petar_chervenski &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reply-To: &quot;=\r\nneat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sat, 25 Aug 2007 17:=\r\n42:15 -0000\n&gt; &gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subje=\r\nct: [neat] Re: Picbreeder comments\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evolving such a network (a netw=\r\nork that selects the parents for \nthe\n&gt; &gt; next generation) will be incredib=\r\nly hard. This is because there \nis\n&gt; &gt; some intelligence required to perfor=\r\nm a good selection. In TBE \nthe\n&gt; &gt; intelligence is the static fitness func=\r\ntion, in Picbreeder it is \nthe\n&gt; &gt; human intelligence. In fact, some pictur=\r\nes may be &quot;in order&quot; but\n&gt; &gt; still represent nothing. Perhaps some pattern =\r\nrecognition \ntechnique\n&gt; &gt; may be involved in the process, but this is stil=\r\nl not enough.\n&gt; &gt; But it is an interesting idea of NEAT controlling another=\r\n NEAT.

I&#39;d like to weigh in on it \na\n&gt; &gt;&gt; little and maybe throw in =\r\nan idea for how to make things even \nmore\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interesting...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fi=\r\nrst of all, there is always a goal.  In one case, the goal is \nvery\n&gt; &gt;&gt; st=\r\nrictly defined, in the other, it is more losely defined.  But\n&gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; is still a &#39;goal&#39;.  The goal in PicBreeder is &#39;makes me feel \ngood&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nwhich CAN be defined, it just has to be defined in terms of\n&gt; &gt; something\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; we can&#39;t see, which is the neuron firing pattern in our brains.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; My hypothesis, though, is that there is a pattern to our \ninternal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n choosing of what we like.  And I posit that it may be possible \nto\n&gt; &gt;&gt; LE=\r\nARN it.  Meaning, create a &#39;chooser&#39; network that also evolves\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;intere=\r\nsting&#39; images.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; You see, I think that &#39;recognition&#39; is a key elem=\r\nent in deciding\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to choose.  And I think that the method that =\r\nwe use to recognize\n&gt; &gt; order\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vs. chaos could be modeled.  Sure, recog=\r\nnizing the difference\n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt;&gt; two people&#39;s faces would be harder t=\r\no model, but I think it \nwould be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fairly easy to learn to model the di=\r\nfference between chaos and\n&gt; &gt; order.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m thinking you should be=\r\n able to evolve a network that tends \nto\n&gt; &gt;&gt; choose (rank higher) images o=\r\nf real-world things over images of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; random, unstructured noise.  You co=\r\nuld take many image chunks \nthe\n&gt; &gt; size\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of the PicBreeder output imag=\r\nes, all of which have some kind of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recognizability and pleasantness to=\r\n them.  Then create a large\n&gt; &gt; number\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of counter-examples that are bu=\r\nilt out of unstructured \nrandomness,\n&gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it pixels or blobs or arcs=\r\n or whatever.  Then evolve a network \nthat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; consistently recognizes the=\r\n &#39;pleasing&#39; images (ranks them \nhighly)\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recognizes the chaotic=\r\n images as such and thereby ranks them \nlower.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; When that&#39;s done,=\r\n integrate it into the PicBreeder app as\n&gt; &gt; a &#39;chooser&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which evolves=\r\n and evolves until somebody shuts it down.  \nWhenever it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; finds somethi=\r\nng that it likes more than some threshold, \nit &#39;saves&#39;\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  When i=\r\nt likes something more than an even higher threshold, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; publishes it.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I predict that there will be a sweet spot for complexity of the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PicBreeder image generating networks.  For a while, as \ncomplexity\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; grows, the chooser network will rank the images higher and \nhigher.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n But I suspect that at some point, that trend will reverse.  The\n&gt; &gt; number=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of highly ranked images as a percentage of all evolved images \nat a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; particular complexity level will get lower as the complexity \nrises\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; above that sweet spot.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would also like to mention that combi=\r\nning such a &#39;general \ncoolness\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chooser&#39; with a goal-oriented chooser c=\r\nould be quite \ninteresting.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; two could work together synergisti=\r\ncally to help walk the search\n&gt; &gt; space\n&gt; &gt;&gt; faster.  Problem may be to gen=\r\nerate that chooser correctly to \nbegin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with.  But my instincts tell me=\r\n that one that is evolved to find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regularity in an image and finds &#39;pl=\r\neasing&#39; relationships \nbetween\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them, such as the one described above, =\r\nwould be adequate to use \nin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conjunction with a goal-oriented evolutio=\r\nn of the CPPN networks \nfor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; who-knows-what.  The reason I say that is =\r\nthat I suspect that \nthe\n&gt; &gt; same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &#39;regularities&#39; that make for a &#39;plea=\r\nsing&#39; image are the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; characteristics that lead to a functional CPP=\r\nN network.
