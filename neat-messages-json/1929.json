If so, then the only difference, of course, would be\nthat the outputs are all fully connected.  I don&#39;t know if this is\nconsidered recurrent, so I wanted to clarify.\n\n2) Would you suggest that I bump up the % chance of a recurrent link\nbeing added?  At the moment I have:\n\nNew link: 10% (once inside: recurrent link: 20%, forward/lateral: 80%).\nNew node: 1%\n\nCheers,\nMike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
