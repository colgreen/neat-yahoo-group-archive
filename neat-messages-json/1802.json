You could feed it coordinates as well, but \nit \n&gt; would decide on the order it to visit them.  \n&gt; \n\nYou could also potentially let it see its own ink locally or as far \nout as you wanted (that would be the eye receptive field size).\n\nOf course, who knows if this whole &quot;roving pen&quot; idea makes &quot;better&quot; \nart or not, but it&#39;s kind of interesting because it draws sort of \nlike a human.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n"}}
