No, I don&#39;t think we can model it =\r\nas a contextual bandit problem because in that setting the agent doesn&#39;t ge=\r\nt to choose the state, whereas it does get to choose the NN topology.\n\nI&#39;m =\r\nnot aware of bandit methods that deal with flexible length representations,=\r\n and I suspect this would be the main research challenge in trying to devel=\r\nop bandit methods for GDS.  In the Bayesian optimization approaches, a prio=\r\nr is placed of the space of fitness functions, so in this case that would r=\r\nequire priors over functions whose domains are vectors of different lengths=\r\n.  I&#39;m not enough of an expert in Bayesian methods to say whether existing =\r\nmethods can deal with that, but I see no fundamental reason why it couldn&#39;t=\r\n be done.\n\n-Shimon\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Vassilis Vassiliades &lt;vass=\r\nilisvas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Shimon,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some questions regarding wha=\r\nt you said about using bandit algorithms\n&gt; to design NN/CPPN topologies.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Do you believe that in order to tackle this problem, one would need\n&gt; co=\r\nntextual bandit algorithms, where the state would be the current NN\n&gt; topol=\r\nogy?\n&gt; \n&gt; If there are actions that correspond to the addition and deletion=\r\n of nodes\n&gt; and connections, the dimensionality of the context/policy would=\r\n change\n&gt; during learning. So, I am wondering whether you know of any algor=\r\nithms or\n&gt; techniques that could deal with such problems, where the dimensi=\r\nonality of\n&gt; the state is not fixed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Vassilis\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Mo=\r\nn, Jun 17, 2013 at 2:54 PM, shimonw &lt;shimon@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I may, I&#39;d like to offer a couple reactions to your l=\r\natest message.\n&gt; &gt; This is indeed an interesting discussion that touches on=\r\n many potentially\n&gt; &gt; important issues. I hope I can offer a useful perspec=\r\ntive on these topics.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You are right that in a target-based scenario=\r\n there can be many CPPNs that\n&gt; &gt; generate the same phenotype. But the CPPN=\r\n is a genotype, not a phenotype.\n&gt; &gt; In what I&#39;m calling &quot;regular&quot; FFs, the=\r\nre are potentially many *phenotypes*\n&gt; &gt; that solve the problem, and for ea=\r\nch of them potentially many genotypes. So\n&gt; &gt; in my mind, there is still a =\r\nuseful distinction between target based FFs\n&gt; &gt; and regular FFs, though the=\r\ny are perhaps best seen as different points on a\n&gt; &gt; spectrum.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I=\r\n understand correctly, you are suggesting that the important\n&gt; &gt; distinctio=\r\nn is how the FF interacts with the search process. But to me,\n&gt; &gt; this is a=\r\n difficult criterion to use because the search process could be\n&gt; &gt; anythin=\r\ng. The space of possible black-box optimization methods is huge, and\n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nat encourages piecewise incremental progress for one method may not for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n another.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t pretend to know what kind of algorithm would gene=\r\nrate\n&gt; &gt; Einstein-level intelligence (I don&#39;t even know if this is a useful=\r\n goal).\n&gt; &gt; But as a researcher I highly respect once told me, &quot;your failur=\r\ne to imagine\n&gt; &gt; it does not constitute a proof that it cannot be done.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I think your hypothesis is quite a bold one, because it lo=\r\noks\n&gt; &gt; at the limitations of a specific class of black-box optimization me=\r\nthods\n&gt; &gt; and generalizes them to all possible black-box optimization metho=\r\nds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To give just one example of the possibilities here: algorithms =\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt; continuous-armed bandits, such as X-armed bandits and Bayesian opti=\r\nmization\n&gt; &gt; methods such as GP-UCB, can be applied to black-box optimizati=\r\non. These\n&gt; &gt; methods avoid the problem of local optima in a principled way=\r\n, by\n&gt; &gt; maintaining a posterior distribution over the global FF, and using=\r\n optimism\n&gt; &gt; in the face of uncertainty to ensure sufficient exploration o=\r\nf the solution\n&gt; &gt; space. As a result, these methods have very nice theoret=\r\nical properties,\n&gt; &gt; like guaranteed convergence to the global optimum in t=\r\nhe limit and\n&gt; &gt; logarithmic regret bounds along the way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As far as=\r\n I know, no one has tried to develop versions of these methods\n&gt; &gt; that can=\r\n discover NN topologies, and which would thus be suitable for\n&gt; &gt; optimizin=\r\ng CPPNs or other indirect encodings. But there&#39;s no a priori\n&gt; &gt; reason to =\r\nthink it can&#39;t be done. I&#39;m not saying this would necessarily\n&gt; &gt; work or e=\r\nven that it&#39;s the most promising approach to explore. I&#39;m just\n&gt; &gt; saying i=\r\nt&#39;s one example of a principled approach that could avoid all the\n&gt; &gt; diffi=\r\nculties you mention and which we currently have no strong reason to\n&gt; &gt; eli=\r\nminate from contention.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I think it&#39;s quite likely that these har=\r\nd FFs are not unsolvable, but\n&gt; &gt; just that current methods cannot solve th=\r\nem. Rather than giving up on them,\n&gt; &gt; in my opinion we should be focusing =\r\non developing better methods for them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding whether 6 nodes is=\r\n a lot to represent fracture, I think the same\n&gt; &gt; point applies: just beca=\r\nuse we can&#39;t think of a better way to do it,\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t ex=\r\nist. Our paper establishes 6 as an upper bound,\n&gt; &gt; which can be easily don=\r\ne by example. If I understand correctly, you are\n&gt; &gt; suggesting that 6 may =\r\nbe a lower bound, which is much more difficult to\n&gt; &gt; demonstrate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI could definitely imagine that a different type of network, or one with a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; different set of activation functions, might be able to make better use=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; 6 nodes. Even if it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a trade-off, and using fewe=\r\nr nodes\n&gt; &gt; means less flexibility, there may be many cases where that&#39;s a =\r\nfavorable\n&gt; &gt; trade-off. We should at least be open to the possibility that=\r\n it some cases\n&gt; &gt; the sweet spot is not a representation that requires 6 n=\r\nodes for fracture.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m looking forward to chatting more about this =\r\nat GECCO.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt; &gt; Shimon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
