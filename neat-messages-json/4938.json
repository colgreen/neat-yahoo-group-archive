We don&#39;t know\nhow most things are represented, or how those representations get\nupdated.  All we have right now are highly simplified models at various\nlevels of abstraction, but we know that these are inadequate.\n\nDon&#39;t be misled by computer scientists who give simple learning\nmechanisms fancy biological names, like &quot;neural network&quot; or &quot;genetic\nalgorithm&quot;.  These are highly simplified and abstract mathematical\nconstructs compared to the complicated and messy biological phenomena\nthey are named after.  It&#39;s like the difference between the hypothetical\ncanonball&#39;s simple 1D trajectory in a vacuum, vs. a real world\nknuckleball whose spin and trajectory can only be explained using vector\ncalculus and fluid dynamics.\n\nSo to answer your original question: no, we don&#39;t have a general purpose\nlearning rule that works like the brain, because we don&#39;t understand how\nthe brain works.\n\nAnd although brains have very powerful learning algorithms, they also\nhave a lot of built-in structure that is present from birth.  Most\nmachine learning algorithms start out with zero weights, or initial\nrandom weights, not the incredibly detailed structure produced by our\ngenes through the process of fetal development.  So don&#39;t think that\nsome simple learning algorithm is going to provide the &quot;magic bullet&quot;\nthat produces intelligent machines.  It&#39;s not going to be that easy.  It\ntook evolution a long time to come up with the structure of the\nmammalian brain.  And it&#39;s going to take us another century or two to\nfigure out how it works.\n\n-- Dr. David S.
