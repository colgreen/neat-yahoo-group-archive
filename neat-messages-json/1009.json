You would need to wait until the\n&gt; &gt;stagnant species has broken out of that stagnation, and THEN prune.  But \n&gt;I\n&gt; &gt;think your best bet is to wait until you have found an acceptable \n&gt;solution,\n&gt; &gt;and then do a phase that supports pruning in order to optimize that\n&gt; &gt;solution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes that makes more sense :)  So if some of the neutral structure\n&gt;becomes positive then you have moved into a new and better position in\n&gt;the overall search space, this warrants searching around that space for\n&gt;a while, but! you are still likely to have some of the neutral structure\n&gt;that didn&#39;t become positive. This means you are searching through a\n&gt;higher search dimensionality than you really should be - you have found\n&gt;a new promising point in the search space so you don&#39;t really want that\n&gt;speculative neutral structure, not until you start to stagnate again.\n&gt;Therefore I think it would be a refinement of the NEAT search process to\n&gt;prune neutral structure from the genomes at that point.\n\nMy question is, which is more expensive?  Continuing to search in the higher \nspace, with the ability to coopt neutral structure into useful, or the \npruning pass followed by a forward search that must then perhaps re-add \nstructure?\n\n\n\n"}}
