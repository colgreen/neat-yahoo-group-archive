There is elitism in the version \nof NE=\r\nAT you mention. Check out the species::reproduce() method. There \nis a comp=\r\narison of poolsize with 5 in order to produce the champ.. At \nleast I remem=\r\nber that :) So basically this means that when a species \nsize is greather t=\r\nhan 5, the champ is cloned into the next generation \nunchanged.\nBut when I =\r\nmake a search, I keep a list of the best ever networks \nthat appeared manua=\r\nlly, I perform a quick search over the population \nat each generation.\nYou =\r\ncan create another NEAT parameter and replace the 5 constant with \nthe vari=\r\nable, so you can tweak it later via the parameters file. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In ne=\r\nat@yahoogroups.com, Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor \n&lt;mandor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\t\t\tHi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your quick reply. I first have a very simple \nque=\r\nstion :\n&gt; Does NEAT save somewhere the best organism ever encountered ? Is =\r\n\nthere\n&gt; any form of elitism ? I can&#39;t find it in the source code (standard=\r\n\n&gt; neat).\n&gt; \n&gt; My second question :\n&gt; \n&gt; When I use NEAT for many generatio=\r\nns (2000, for instance), I get\n&gt; bigger and bigger networks\n&gt; (http://webia=\r\n.lip6.fr/~mouret/nn_cartpole_neat.pdf). This seems\n&gt; logical since NEAT doe=\r\ns not any node removing operator. I&#39;m trying \nto\n&gt; reduce the add_node and =\r\nadd_connection probabilities but I think I\n&gt; should stop the evolution some=\r\ntimes.\n&gt; =3D&gt; When should I end the evolution ? Considering that I&#39;m trying=\r\n to\n&gt; compare NEAT to some other neuro-evolution methods, I&#39;d like to use\n&gt;=\r\n the same number of generations to be as fair as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Kenn=\r\neth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m starting to evaluate NEAT for simp=\r\nle robotics problems and \nI \n&gt; &gt; need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your advices to be sure to use =\r\nthe correct starting networks and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parameters. I work on two simple pr=\r\noblems: single pole balancing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (non-markovian) and simple 3-DOF roboti=\r\nc arm control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -&gt; how could I improve these results ? =\r\nDoes someone has some \n&gt; &gt; benchmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; results on this classical proble=\r\nm ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you tried using p2nv.ne (the non-Markovian paramet=\r\ners) \ninstead \n&gt; &gt; of pole2_markov?  Perhaps they would do better.  Perhaps=\r\n a \nsmaller \n&gt; &gt; mut_weight_power (weight mutation power) would help too, s=\r\nince \nyou \n&gt; &gt; are concerned very small oscillations that may be hard to da=\r\nmp \n&gt; &gt; without our very fine-grained weight adjustments.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D&gt; I&#39;ve=\r\n tried this and I was not able to improve the results in any\n&gt; substancial =\r\nway. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Jean-Baptiste Mouret / Mandor=\r\n\n&gt; http://animatlab.lip6.fr/~mouret\n&gt; tel : (+33) 6 28 35 10 49\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
