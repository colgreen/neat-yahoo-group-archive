I wrote a NoveltyKNN class=\r\n that calculates the sample size using this formula: If the number of evalu=\r\nations+population size is known then the probability is only calculated onc=\r\ne at class construction, but as more common the case the number of evaluati=\r\nons against the archive is open ended/unknown, so I cooked up a method to r=\r\necalculate the sample size (archive_chance) periodically.  The source code =\r\nto NoveltyKNN is over on the SharpNeat forum see the zip file &quot;SharpNeatV2_=\r\nKeith.zip&quot;, here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sharpneat/DBo4CNq=\r\nNLjg\n\nI initially tried to use the threshold method you were discussing pre=\r\nviously but found it to be much less efficient/poor approximation for novel=\r\nty. I tested by simply simulating test &quot;behaviors&quot; randomly drawn from a 2d=\r\n normal distribution, and later queried and graphed what the archive though=\r\nt was novel. Probabilistic sampling approximated quite well what you would =\r\nexpect to be novel in this simple test case (high novelty scores on the tai=\r\nls, low scores around the mean) whereas the threshold method appeared to pr=\r\noduce jagged/inconsistent results by comparison, was not at all a smooth ap=\r\nproximation to the actual novelty landscape. Perhaps my implementation of t=\r\nhe threshold method was flawed, but considering the simplicity good results=\r\n using the probabilistic sampling, I decided to run with it.\n\nRegards,\nKeit=\r\nh\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Oliver Coleman &lt;oliver.coleman@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joel,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been experimenting with novelty search and have deci=\r\nded to try the\n&gt; probabilistic approach to determine if an individual is ad=\r\nded to the\n&gt; permanent archive.
