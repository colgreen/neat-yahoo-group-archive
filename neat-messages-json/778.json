Seems a little redundant to have both &lt;neurons&gt; and\n&gt;&lt;neuron&gt; tags.  Is there a particular reason why you structured it\n&gt;that way, Colin?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt&#39;s something I instinctively did. I suppose you could say it gives the xml some structure, prevents someone from mixing up the connections and neurons in a document, which would look messy. On the functional side of things it improves the performance of xpath queries against the xml since if you want to get all of the connections you query with &quot;connections/connection&quot; rather than &quot;/connection&quot; which would have to scan through ALL of the top level xml nodes, or even &quot;//connection&quot; which is even worse. This performance difference may only be slight but would become more noticeable with increased file size.\n\nAlso if you view the xml in a hierarchical tree structure(Internet Explorer does this as does XmlSpy), you can collapse/expand all of the connections or neurons together, which makes looking at the xml nicer. \n\nAnother way of looking at it is to think of an xml document as a database, you wouldn&#39;t put different data structures into the same table.\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n"}}
