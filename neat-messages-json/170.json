The\ndeck is shuffled and placed face down.  This is shown\nto the ANN.  Then one card is picked at random &\nexposed; This is shown to the ANN.  Then another card\nis picked, at random except so as NOT to form a pair\nwith the first card.  This is shown to the ANN.  Then\nthe card are turned face down again and this is shown\nto the ANN.  The ANN now picks a card; this is exposed\nand show to the ANN.  It picks a second card.  If it\nhas picked a pair it wins, otherwise it loses.  If it\nmakes an illegal or undefined pick it loses.\n\nI think its clear that the ANN must remember what it\nhas seen and act correctly upon that information.  Its\nfirst pick is always one of the card that has not been\nexposed.  Its second pick is the matching one from the\ncards that have been exposed.  Hence it needs to\nremember which cards were exposed and what their\nvalues were.\n\nFurthermore, this memory is not stored in the weights,\nsince this ANN has its weights fixed.  The memory is\nin the state of the ANN, which is a fully recurrent,\nfully connected, binary ANN.  The state consists of\nthe outputs of all of the neurons.  What is stored in\nthe weights is the strategy of how to use the state as\na memory and how to make use of that information.\n\nA friend of mine, Prof. Roderick Edwards here at U.\nVic., pointed out that the evolution software &quot;learned\nhow to learn&quot;.  This seems apt to me.  The program had\nto kill off a few millions ANNs that wouldn&#39;t quite\nplay perfectly until finally producing some that\ncould.  That was the machine learning phase, and the\nresults are fixed in the weights of the ANN.  Now the\nANN can learn what it need to when it plays this game.\n\nI&#39;m interested in finding out if this has been done\nbefore; i.e., has someone trained a recurrent ANN so\nthat it makes use of its memory while doing its job. \nI suspect some of your robots with NEAT ANN\ncontrollers qualify under this definition.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
