Did you normalize for chromosome size in your experiments,\n&gt; Joseph?  Or was N always set to 1 and the compatibility threshold\n&gt; value always set to either 3.0 or 4.0?\n\nI was actually going to chime in about this. My method was different than\nthe other two that were previously mentioned (fixed normalized\ncompatibility threshold, and fixed number of species).\n\nFor modular NEAT, chromosome and module compatibility are computed\nsimilarly to how Ken does it with NEAT, but instead of keeping a fixed\nvalue for the species compatibility threshold, mine floats. Basically,\nevery epoch approximates an &quot;average species distance&quot; value, and that is\nused to determine compatibility. So, if topologies are diverging, the\nvalue will increase with time, and if they are converging, it will shrink.\n\nWhat is nice about this is that you don&#39;t have to worry about what the\noptimal value is for species or for compatibility, it will be determined\nat runtime.\n\nThe main problem is approximating species distance. One way is to compare\nall the chromosomes. I just keep a running average of the previous 10 or\n20 values and approximate the new values from the chromosomes and modules\nthat are being added to species that generation.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
