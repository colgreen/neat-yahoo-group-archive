The result is that, despite many ge=\r\nnerations of training, the single output never comes out of the saturated s=\r\ntate of -1 or +1.\n\nMy susbstrate has inputs arranged as 11 x 5, so the typi=\r\ncal hidden layer nodes have 55 inputs. Is it usual to scale the maximum wei=\r\nght limit so as to constrain node input,such as dividing the weight limit b=\r\ny the number of nodes in the input layer of the substrate?\n\nThere is, of co=\r\nurse, the distinct possibility, that I have missed something, or some bug, =\r\nin my coding.\n\n  Rob Marsden\n\n\n"}}
