I \nsuspect that this topic may be of general interest and hope you&#39;ll \ncontinue discussion here.\n\nSeveral questions:\n\nDo you plan on using recurrent links as memory for the past period \ndata leading up to the point where you want to make a forward \nprediction?  Ie. how do you plan to present the pattern on the \ninputs?  All at once for some back period, or only a time unit&#39;s \n(day&#39;s) worth at a time, and rely on some form of net memory?  One \napproach potentially suffers from dimensionality problems, and the \nother relies on a finding a good net activation/stableization(sp?) \nfunction.\n\nHow will you scale the input data, if at all?  Do you plan to \nnormalize the data, so that the same trained net can possibly be used \nfor more than one time series (different stock)?  If so, how would \nyou normalize?\n\nYou mentioned that you&#39;ll use the stock data in your fitness \nfunction, and that you want the net to signal a &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot;.  For \nwhat time period into the future is a signal good?  And will you also \nhave a &quot;neutral&quot; or no action (zero?) signal?\n\nDo you plan on taking a pattern classifier/predictor approach, or a \ntournament approach, where different nets compete to see who &quot;makes&quot; \nthe most, or does the best over time (similar to blondie24)?\n\nI have dozens more questions, but this will do for starters!\nVery Curious,\nKarl\n\n\n\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ej_1973&quot; &lt;e.j@v...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@c...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Sounds like an interesting project; I haven&#39;t heard of someone \n&gt; doing \n&gt; &gt; stock predicition with NEAT before.  What kind of data are you \n&gt; &gt; thinking of using for input? \n&gt; \n&gt; To do the training I have written some perl scripts to site scrape \n&gt; historical price data off yahoo finance. I now have a database of \n&gt; 17,000 stocks from Europe and America, with historical end of day \n&gt; data for each. Some (e.g. IBM) going back as far as 1962. Adding \nthe \n&gt; days of trading for all these stocks gives 29 million trading days, \n&gt; with open,high,low,close and volume for each day. There should be \n&gt; plenty there for training and testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for how I&#39;m going to use this data to provide inputs to a neural \n&gt; net and use it to compose a fitness function for the GA....I have \n&gt; some well developed ideas but I don&#39;t think this is the best place \nto \n&gt; discuss them. If anyone wants to collaborate on the NEAT side of \n&gt; things I&#39;ll happily divulge my ideas to you - drop me a direct mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone wants to download the database (3 large binary files \n&gt; containing the raw data) and the C++ classes to access it drop me a \n&gt; line and we can sort out an ftp transfer. I can also share the \n&gt; scripts I used to do the site scraping, although it would not be a \n&gt; good idea if lots of people started using them - the yahoo finance \n&gt; site would grind to a halt and they&#39;d probably start making it \nharder \n&gt; to do such things in future :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m currently trying to get my head around the NEAT C++ code so I \nmay \n&gt; well come back with some questions and observations in the near \n&gt; future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Emyr\n\n\n"}}
