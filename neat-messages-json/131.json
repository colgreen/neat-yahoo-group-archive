For example,\n&gt; in Go I consider an illegal move attempt by the\n&gt; network\n&gt; to be a requested pass.  That way a network that is\n&gt; otherwise\n&gt; good can still get its due credit, and might even\n&gt; learn\n&gt; to utilize its &quot;criminal tendencies&quot; to make\n&gt; rational decisions.\n&gt; For example, although the Go network does have a\n&gt; pass output,\n&gt; it may find it easier to instead pass by trying to\n&gt; place a piece\n&gt; on an already-occupied square.  Who is to say this\n&gt; is a bad\n&gt; way to communicate a pass if it gets the job done? \n&gt; The point is to\n&gt; give the network as many opportunities to\n&gt; communicate valid moves\n&gt; as possible.\n\nI agree with Ken that a &quot;one strike and you&#39;re out&quot;\nselection pressure against illegal moves probably\nisn&#39;t going to be very fruitful.\n\nI like his approach of interpreting illegal moves as\npasses.  I&#39;d initially planned to approach Tic-Tac-Toe\nand Gomoku (five-in-a-row) by simply ignoring illegal\noutputs.\n\nIn TTT, there are nine output nodes corresponding to\nboard positions.  The game manager shows the ANN the\nboard and queries for a move, returning an array of\nvalues for each board position.  If the highest output\nvalue corresponds to an occupied space, the game\nmanager just takes the next highest output, and so on.\n\nI don&#39;t know if this is the best approach (it&#39;s\ncertainly a lot more lax than killing them, or even\ninterpreting an illegal move as a pass), and I still\nhaven&#39;t done any experimentation with it.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
