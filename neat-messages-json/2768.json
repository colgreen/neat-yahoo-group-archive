I&#39;m particularly interested \n&gt;in &quot;Darren&#39;s Program Experiment&quot; contained therein.\n\nIt&#39;s a while since I uploaded that file, and the experiment you \nmention was a little disappointing in practice.\n\nThe purpose was to use NEAT to evolve networks which would output \nprograms in a simple stack-based language to generate given sequences \nof numbers. You may be wondering: why make the network generate a \nprogram to do it rather than have the network generate the sequences \ndirectly? Mainly because it&#39;s really hard to reverse-engineer the \nalgorithms networks are using and understand how they&#39;re working, and \nit would be more practical in some ways to evolve routines in a form \ncloser to conventional programming languages.\n\nThe real difficulty comes down to finding a good representation of a \nprogram which the network can output. The Program Experiment tried to \nhave the network build up the program instruction by instruction, able \nto move back and forth through the list to change instructions as \nneeded. This was, in some ways, the inverse of the roving eye method \nfor inputs, and I had hoped it would mean a program-generator could be \nevolved incrementally. The main problem was that there was such a huge \njump in complexity required between a simple, useless program which \njust returned the average of the sequence (or some other simple \noutput, such as a counter) and a meaningful one which actually \ncalculated a value.\n\nTherefore, a better representation would have to be found where these \njumps would be minimised. One possibility which did occur would be to \nmake the transformations the network could apply to the list of \ninstructions more sophisticated, a bit like the ones ADATE applies to \nprograms it evolves.\n\nAt any rate, I now use SharpNeat (which naturally works quite well \nunder VS.NET!) although I haven&#39;t recreated anything like the Program \nExperiment yet, simply because I haven&#39;t thought of a better way of \ndoing it.\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
