I just think the right\n&gt; &gt; way\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leverage it is tricky.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of c=\r\nomplexity is also quite muddy. Unfortunately,\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; word\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmeans a lot of different things. In fact, perhaps the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; definition (&quot;minimal description length&quot;) is both proven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; u=\r\nncomputable in general and also does not correlate to what\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mea=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the normal intuitive use of the word complexity with\n&gt; &gt; re=\r\nspect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As evolutionary com=\r\nplexity goes up in the sense we usually\n&gt; &gt; mean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is =\r\nnot just that the phenotype takes more bits to\n&gt; &gt; describe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ther=\r\ne is also a sense of organization, i.e. regularity, \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; begins\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to take hold. That is in direct opposition with the idea of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; min=\r\nimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description length. In fact, what we really want is some\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partnership between complexity and organization.\n&gt; &gt; Unf=\r\nortunately\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduces yet another mysterious word: org=\r\nanization; it \nalso\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduced a partnership between two seemingl=\r\ny opposing\n&gt; &gt; forces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this muddiness and inter=\r\nnal conflict is important\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shows that this proble=\r\nm is extremely slippery.

The rule \no=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thirds, for example. Why do those rules exist? I would posit\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those rules exist because of a mathematical relationship that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; exists\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in how the signals travel around in our brain. I suspect=\r\n \nthat a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; network COULD be developed that would be able to identify =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aesthetic merit of a particular image, because I think=\r\n that \nat\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level, aesthetics is a purely mathematical funct=\r\nion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That said, I think that it would be very unlikely to b=\r\ne able \nto\n&gt; &gt; say,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;hey, that looks like a bunny rabbit that has b=\r\neen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; borgified...cool!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since our choice of what to breed for =\r\nis based partly on\n&gt; &gt; aesthetics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and partly on the emotional tie t=\r\no the objects that something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reminds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us of, there is little c=\r\nhance that a controller network could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; totally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replace the hum=\r\nan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But what if? What if a controller could be evolved whic=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; learned to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognize good image composition rules? How might =\r\nsuch a \nthing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extend\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the usefulness of PicBreeder in general?=\r\n What might it teach\n&gt; &gt; us?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What might it say about the limits of =\r\ncomputer controls? What\n&gt; &gt; might\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it say about US? Is there any mer=\r\nit at all to undertaking \nsuch\n&gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment? In my opinion, th=\r\nere is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- John\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; John, you argue persuasively fo=\r\nr your idea, and I can see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appeal. I would not dismiss the idea t=\r\nhat there is the\n&gt; &gt; possibility\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that a classifier could evolve that =\r\ndetects something \nsurprising\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about aesthetic value and thereby filte=\r\nrs the search for\n&gt; &gt; interesting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; images. It is an intoxicating idea =\r\nand I would love to hear\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and see the results of any such at=\r\ntempt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet let me give you an idea about the origin of my skept=\r\nicism.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basically jaded by the underwhelming results of past s=\r\nuch\n&gt; &gt; efforts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a friend of mine tried to evolve a neur=\r\nal network \nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; detect good music in a similar approach to yours. I ha=\r\nve heard\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other attempts like that one (usually they seem to be=\r\n with\n&gt; &gt; music). I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize these stories are only anecdotal, yet I d=\r\nraw a lesson\n&gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them which shows the danger in such an approach=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution likes to cheat and get by easy. If you want it to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; learn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something deep and general, it tries to learn some cheap tri=\r\nck \nto\n&gt; &gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as well without having to deal with the deep stu=\r\nff. In\n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; words, like lightning, it takes the path of least re=\r\nsistance.\n&gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with training to detect artistic quality is=\r\n that there\n&gt; &gt; may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predominant correlations among pictures or son=\r\ngs that we deem\n&gt; &gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are really not the reason they are good=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For exampele, &quot;good&quot; songs may tend to have a lot of C notes,=\r\n \nnot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because C makes a good song, but rather because it happens to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; appear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot in a particular genre, perhaps because it is the base=\r\n \nnote\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some scale. Thus, an evolved classifier will simply pre=\r\ndict \nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anything with a lot of C&#39;s is good, missing the deeper rea=\r\nsons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entirely. Or, in Picbreeder, you may notice if you look closely\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many (though not all) of the published images have some sort=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; circular formation near their center. For example this =\r\nobject\n&gt; &gt; may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a nose, an eye (in a profile), a cockpit window, an=\r\n iris, a\n&gt; &gt; keyhole,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a sun, a moon, a fingernail, etc. Therefore, a =\r\nclassifier would\n&gt; &gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well to learn to predict that any picture wit=\r\nh a small circle \nin\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; middle is good, again missing the point.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the reason such projects have failed in the past is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of just such spurious correlations. The question is how to =\r\npush\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution to learn the deeper meaning of &quot;good,&quot; which is so\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; profoundly slippery.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, I would not say it is a l=\r\nost cause. Yet it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certainly a grand challenge and will not succumb=\r\n easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moody friends.
