In fact\n&gt;&gt;with co-evolution the networks will normally (I think) end up playing\n&gt;&gt;within a very narrow range of game strategies - which means they perform\n&gt;&gt;poorly when played against humans or even simple algorithmic strategies\n&gt;&gt;they have never encountered before. Although I&#39;m happy to be proved\n&gt;&gt;wrong on this, that partly my experience so in some limited Tic-Tac-Toe\n&gt;&gt;co-evolution experiments I&#39;ve been working on (more on those another time).\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I was talking to somebody on a newsgroup about just this point (it wasn&#39;t \n&gt;you, was it?)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nNope, not me. I have just recently started lurking in newsgroups again \nso maybe you&#39;ll see this subject start up again. I&#39;ve been experimenting \nwith tic-tac-toe (TTT), evaluating players against what I call a pareto \ndominance chain (I need to check this terminology, I suspect it&#39;s \nwrong). It goes something like this:\n\n1) In the first generation all players play each other and the best one \nbecomes the first entry in the &#39;pareto dominance chain&#39; (to be honest \nthough picking a random player is just as good).\n2) All subsequent evaluations are made by playing each entry in the \nchain. Fitness against each entry is multiplied by that entry&#39;s index+1, \nsince later entries are deemed to be better players, and therefore \nscoring points against them is mostly better than points against earlier \nentries, mostly.\n3) If 1 or more players in a gen beats all of the entries in the chain \nthen one of these is selected to be a new entry on the end of the chain. \nIf there is more than one candidate with the same high score then just \npick one at random (actually pick the last one I think, this doesn&#39;t \nmatter).\n\n\nI think Ken & Risto use a dominace chain in &quot;Competetive Coevolution \nthrough Evolutionary Complexification&quot; (2004), but this is only for \nmonitoring progress of the co-evolution search proper. I instead use \nthis as the basis for evaluation. This has a few side effects:\n\n1) Populations cannot ebb and flow between a few strategies, e.g. \nstrategy A beats B, B beats C and C beats A. Repeat ad infinitum.\n2) Fitness is relative to the dominance chain, and so a higher fitness \nimplies a better genome overall not just within the context of the \ncurrent population.\n3) Evaluation is reasonably fast.\n\nWell ok it&#39;s not quite this straightforward. As you might expect there \nis a quick run of new entries into the dominace chain  early on and the \nfrequency of new entries drops off as &#39;better&#39; players are appended, \nthus inceasing the threshold for entry onto the chain. Actually this is \npossibly a beneficial circumstance because if the chain gets long then \nevaluation will take longer.\n\nIn my first experiments the chain length maxed out at around the \nmid-20&#39;s in length and the populations best players were poor. So why \ncan&#39;t they beat the still relatively poor players in the chain? I \nhypothesized that they probably could, given enough time, but because of \nthe narrow range of strategies represented by the chain most beneficial \nmutations/crossovers (against other strageties) are being discarded \nbecause the fitness function doesn&#39;t evaluate these aspects of play yet.\n\nSo how can I modify evaluation to &#39;catch&#39; more of these beneficial \nmutations? I obviously need a wider range of strategies to play against. \nPerhaps several dominance chains and some technique for ensuring they \nare representing different strategies, at least to some degree - this \nseems potentially difficult and/or conceptualy messy.\n\nFortunately there is a technique that allows me to evaluate against a \nwider range of strategies using the dominancce chain I have in place, \nconsider this... If two ANN&#39;s play TTT they will always play the same \nsequence of moves - so when evaluating them we just play two games - \nwith each playing first. Ahh you say, but what if I rotate one of the \nplayer&#39;s view with respect to the other player? In fact there are four \nrotations * one flip (or viewing the board from the underside) * playing \n1st/2nd = 16 possible relative views of the board. Playing ANN&#39;s in all \n16 configurations gives a much better indication of their relative \nstrength and also causes the ANNs to play a different/wider set of \nstrategies.\n\n\nI currently have a search running using this technique and the dominance \nchain is 48 in length and best fitness is still improving at a steady \nrate. Unfortunately evaluation is now quite slow but this is more to do \nwith the complexity of the genomes since I have optimised the game code \nto execute at several 100k games/sec (48*16=768 games/evaluation doesn&#39;t \nsound /too/ bad to me). A rather slow pruning phase is now underway so \nmaybe speed will pick up again later (optimisation of pruning code may \nbe on the cards here).\n\nPerformance of the best genome so far is mediocre - looking at results \nagainst a random player they are roughly equal to the solutions evolved \nusing Derek & Philip&#39;s approach of evolving against fixed strategies. \nBut don&#39;t forget that no knowledge of TTT is inherent in the system, so \nI&#39;m quite happy with this result so far.\n\nApart from further optimisation of SharpNEAT then I&#39;m also considering \ncorrupting the concept of the dominace chain by limiting it&#39;s length to \nsay, 30, thus dropping older, poor entries on the chain. Although this \nwould open the door for the &#39;C beats A&#39; scenario it&#39;s now more like &#39;Z \nbeats A&#39; and this is less likely now that there is a large difference in \nplaying ability between the two ends of the chain. So new strategies may \nstill beat the latest entry, but to get placed on teh chain new \nstrategies must be ALL current entries on the chain.\n\n\nThis is mail is getting lengthy, I feel another article coming on :)\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
