If I evolve them for 1000 generations, it just won&#39;t\n&gt; get there.  It got the solution once but I&#39;ve since added another\n&gt; input so the previous genome is invalid to the project.\n\nOkay.  At this point I&#39;d like to ask a couple of questions.  What do\nyour fitness curves look like?  Is the population improving at all? \nIs it gradual or spiky?\n\nThanks for explaining your domain a bit more.  In an earlier mail you\nsaid you had some success with XOR and &quot;several other tests that\nactually relate to my\nproject&quot;.  What were those?  Were they similar implementations of this\ndomain that simply had smaller mazes?\n\n&gt; If he sees the mouse he can catch it just\n&gt; fine but as soon as the mouse goes out of view, it collapses.  I&#39;ve\n&gt; used incremental learning to teach one thing at a time but when I\n&gt; setup the out-of-sight mouse experiment, it just won&#39;t converge.\n\nAt this point I&#39;d kind of like a visualization of the maze.  I&#39;m\nhaving a bit of a hard time understanding what&#39;s going on here.  Have\nyou done any crude animations to visualize the behavior here?  Could\nyou post a BMP of what a sample maze looks like?\n\nBy &quot;collapse&quot;, what do you mean?  What are the starting conditions? \nDo the cat and mouse start out in random positions in the maze?  Do\nthey always have a forward velocity, and the neural network outputs\nonly control left or right turns at intersections?  You say as long as\nit &quot;sees the mouse&quot; it can catch it.  So presumably there&#39;s an input\nfor whether or not the mouse is in line-of-sight, correct?  What are\nthe other inputs?\n\nI guess my initial reaction is that since the algorithm has worked on\nother tasks, the first place to look might be the domain\nimplementation.\n\nIt could also be that your fitness gradient is too steep.  For\nexample, we had very good success evolving active vision (or a roving\neye) controlled by an evolved neural network, that roams across a\nblack and white 2d surface and recognizes simple shapes (squares,\ntriangles, etc.).  We also did a few experiments with sans-serif\nletters that worked reasonably well.  When we made the jump to\nfingerprint classification, we were able to evolve networks that could\nonly distinguish between a handful of prints.  Anything approaching a\nmedium to large database and so far our system has hit a wall.\n\nNow there are tons of variables, both algorithm-specific and\ndomain-specific, that can be adjusted.  But sometimes the domain is\njust really, really hard.  Our own approach is to scale back to\nshapes, and incrementally increase the difficulty of the domain by\nadding in additional noise (pixel noise, decreased contrast) to see\nwhere we hit that wall and try to isolate the variables we need to\ntweak to get over those humps.\n\nIt&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s also interesting. :)  I&#39;d like to know more about\nyour specific domain, and maybe others on the list will have thoughts\nabout what might need to be changed where to achieve success.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
