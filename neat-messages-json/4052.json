In addition, a navigator=\r\n that reached the goal (and\nrotated x degrees while doing so) would appear =\r\nthe same as a navigator\nthat sat at the initial location and spun x degrees=\r\n.\n\nThis goal/non-goal conflation is an example of harmful conflation, and\na=\r\n way of combating it is to simply provide more information (or more\nrelevan=\r\nt information) in the behavioral characterization of an\nindividual. It is n=\r\not always obvious what the most relevant\ninformation is for a given domain,=\r\n e.g. in biped walking, although one\ncan usually make an informed hypothesi=\r\ns - for example, the final\nlocation of a biped walker after an evaluation m=\r\nay differentiate\na successful walker from a biped that cannot walk (because=\r\n a\nsuccessful walker will travel further), whereas using the angle of a\nbip=\r\ned&#39;s head as a novelty measure will probably not be effective since\nhead an=\r\ngle probably has no relation to behaviors of interest.\n\nHowever, I don&#39;t th=\r\nink it is accurate to say that the objective\nfunction is embedded within no=\r\nvelty search; novelty search searches\nonly for novel behaviors, ignoring an=\r\ny notion of better and worse with\nrespect to the goal. I think what you are=\r\n saying is that you still\nhave to have some criteria for termination (i.e. =\r\na routine that\nrecognizes a successful individual). \n\nIt is important to di=\r\nfferentiate an objective function that provides a\ngradient towards *better*=\r\n individuals that is used in typical\napproaches from a binary &quot;have we foun=\r\nd the goal yet&quot; function that\ndoes not actively bias the search. One of the=\r\n key arguments in the\npaper is that the bias of the objective function ofte=\r\nn keeps search\nfrom reaching the goal.\n\nJoel\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Rafael C.P.&quot; &lt;kurama.youko.br@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; But didn&#39;t the agent reached=\r\n the goal just because the goal is very\n&gt; different from the start position=\r\n? It&#39;s like the objective function was\n&gt; embedded in the novelty function. =\r\nIf the goal was similar to the start\n&gt; position in novelty space, it probab=\r\nly would perform worse than random\n&gt; search. But anyway, I think the agent =\r\ncouldn&#39;t stop searching by\nitself when\n&gt; reached the goal unless you told h=\r\nim to stop there, &#39;cause he would\nstill\n&gt; try novel behaviors after that.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; On Wed, May 14, 2008 at 2:39 PM, Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Peter, there is no indication that the maze solvers produced by\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; novelty search are any less &quot;smart&quot; than those produced by\n&gt; &gt; fitness-=\r\nbased search. As we mention in the paper briefly under\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Typical Solutio=\r\nn,&quot; solutions from both methods just go straight to\n&gt; &gt; the goal. In other =\r\nwords, they do not take meandering paths; they\n&gt; &gt; take the most rational p=\r\nath and appear goal-oriented. So there is no\n&gt; &gt; discernible quality differ=\r\nence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, it&#39;s an interesting issue because it gets to the que=\r\nstion of\n&gt; &gt; what it means to be smart vs. lucky. In general, if an animal =\r\nhas a\n&gt; &gt; behavior that gets the job done consistently, one could say the a=\r\nnimal\n&gt; &gt; just &quot;happens&quot; to do the right thing, or one could say the animal=\r\n is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;smart.&quot; In fact, I think these are one and the same and the\n&gt; &gt; di=\r\nstinction does not really add insight into the inner workings\n&gt; &gt; of the an=\r\nimal&#39;s mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One of the reasons we get stuck on the issue of whethe=\r\nr something is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;really&quot; smart is because of the allure of the adaptive =\r\nhypothesis in\n&gt; &gt; evolutionary theory: We try to explain everything we see =\r\nin nature in\n&gt; &gt; terms of some kind of adaptation, and as soon as you assum=\r\ne that what\n&gt; &gt; you are seeing is the result of an adaptation, you are susc=\r\neptible to\n&gt; &gt; the idea that it must be &quot;good&quot; in some way (which equates t=\r\no &quot;smart&quot;\n&gt; &gt; when decision-making is at issue). Yet what novelty search sh=\r\nows is\n&gt; &gt; that a non-adaptive process can in many cases produce equivalent=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; behaviors, which really turns the adaptive hypothesis upside-down, and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; makes the interpretation of the &quot;value&quot; of a behavior more confusing.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Yet at the end of the day, if it works it works, regardless of why it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; became the way it did.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, so on the question of time series=\r\n, I would not be concerned\n&gt; &gt; with this issue of whether it is really smar=\r\nt. However, another\n&gt; &gt; consideration is whether there is sufficient domain=\r\n constraint to make\n&gt; &gt; this search something other than exhaustive enumera=\r\ntion. Novelty\n&gt; &gt; search relies on the properties of the domain (i.e. the e=\r\nnvironment)\n&gt; &gt; to create a useful landscape for the search. Something with=\r\nout any\n&gt; &gt; environmental constraint may not make a good search space. So f=\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; example searching through all possible pictures hoping to find Mona\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Lisa one day may not be a good idea because just about anything you do\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; genetically produces something &quot;novel.&quot; In other words, there is no\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;collapse&quot; of multiple genetic points into fewer novelty points (or\n&gt; &gt; mo=\r\nre accurately, there may not be cases of novelty points clustered\n&gt; &gt; close=\r\nr together in behavior space than the corresponding genomes in\n&gt; &gt; genome s=\r\npace).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Still, I am not sure about time series, because the distribu=\r\ntion of\n&gt; &gt; input precursor series may be thought of as a kind of constrain=\r\nt,\n&gt; &gt; since there are some precursor series you would never see. So it may=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; actually work...I&#39;m not sure, but it&#39;s an interesting possibility.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n=\r\n&quot;petar_chervenski&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Ken,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when you mentioned that Tyler used no inputs but just internal\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; pattern generation, it reminded me about a question I wanted to ask\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; you a few days ago.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In novelty search, it searches for new =\r\nbehaviors, right.

How much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this depends upon the environment and the inputs p=\r\nrovided? Is it the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same with fitness-based search?

In f=\r\nact, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; currently trying to provide the best answer=\r\ns to these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing research, but=\r\n some general principles might help for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; now:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; First, the archive in novelty search does not not need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contain=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every point ever visited. Therefore, it tends to grow much\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slower\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the #of evaluations. However, if it is i=\r\nndeed getting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; big\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then it is not unreason=\r\nable to collapse some of the archive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; points,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; althou=\r\ngh there is no standard method yet for how that should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; done. But we have reason to believe there will be effective\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simple ways to do that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, the=\r\n issue of one individual looking different just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of a phase difference in effectivley the same behavior is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; complicated. For certain phase disaparities, the two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won&#39;t look all that different, but it is true that at some\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disparity, they may look very different. Yet it is not clear\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether that fact is actually problematic to the novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; se=\r\narch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not, because it would simply reward both ty=\r\npes of behavior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the phas=\r\ne difference is a result of some\nuseful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; genotypic change, whi=\r\nch could make it a stepping stone to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bett=\r\ner. Or, it is possible that it is superfluous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply takes some extra time exploring the area around the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; phase-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shifted individual. So it is hard to say a prio=\r\nri whether it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major concern. We will hav=\r\ne better answers to such questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tec=\r\nhnique is further explored.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I agree th=\r\nat it would be nice to be able to say the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase-shi=\r\nfted individuals are largely the same if that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n what you want to say. And for that, you would need a\npattern-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; matching metric to compute behavioral distance, i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sophisiticated than simple Cartesian distance. The=\r\nre are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such metrics available. However, i=\r\nt&#39;s important to recognize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not evident a=\r\nt this point that ignoring the phase\nshift\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually =\r\nbetter than taking it into consideration, because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into consideration just means adding more information to the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; novelty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; landscape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So =\r\noverall I think novelty search is a very promising\n&gt; &gt; &gt; direction\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go for such problems, but it is still in the realm of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; research\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is no existing precedent),=\r\n so it will involve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considerable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trial and error to get=\r\n it right until all these issues are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fleshed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out mo=\r\nre clearly. Ultimately, though, if our hypothesis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n novelty vs. fitness is correct, novelty search may turn out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the *only* way to get certain highly complex types of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beh=\r\navior to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolve in some domains, which is a sobering thought.=\r\n But if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true, then there is not much to=\r\n do other than try it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com &lt;neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;peterber=\r\nrington&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;peterberrington@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read Ken&#39;s latest paper on novelty search and its a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascinating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new approach.

The behaviour of a Tori is currently\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repr=\r\nesented\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a list of 20 base 4 variables multiplied by the =\r\namount\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps the Tori is evaluated =\r\nfor. The novelty search method\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the 2=\r\nd maze navigation is fairly simple; if theres a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ending\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we add that point to a list of d=\r\niscovered behaviours. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (I imagine) because a point isn&#39;t a lot of information to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hold.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I want to know is how I can compare the =\r\nbehaviour\nof 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ragdoll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; controllers for novelty; i=\r\ns there any compact encoding\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work? Sin=\r\nce it often takes 25 000 seperate evaluations to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful behaviour out of this right now, theres going to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some way to store 20k seperate behavi=\r\nours in some way that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; easy to compare; what if a Tori has identical behaviour to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does things a couple of time steps=\r\n later instead?
