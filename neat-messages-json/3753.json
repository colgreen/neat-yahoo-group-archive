Two points which I rely on are (1)\n&gt; Gener=\r\nations were occuring much more rapidly for microorganisms (and \non\n&gt; a much=\r\n smaller genome), so a billion years is a long time and (2) \nThe\n&gt; search s=\r\npace isn&#39;t being searched for, say, a human-like solution \nall\n&gt; at once.  =\r\nRather, it is searched through gradual complexification, \nso\n&gt; that by the =\r\ntime humans are about to emerge, things like legs, \nlungs,\n&gt; and circulator=\r\ny systems have already been sorted out.
