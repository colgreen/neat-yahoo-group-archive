This is extremely vast space. NEAT searches \nthrough=\r\n the genotype space of the well known NNs even in novelty \nsearch and indir=\r\nect encodings like HyperNEAT. The difference is how \nfitness scores are ass=\r\nigned and what is being evaluated. The \nphenotypes are evaluated, not the g=\r\nenotypes. It is important no note \nthat you can have any number of genomes =\r\ncollapsing to the same \nphenotypic behavior. But in NS you are looking for =\r\nnew behaviors, not \nnew genomes. \nI agree that this map can be solved by ju=\r\nst sticking to a wall but \nwhat is more important is that if you try fitnes=\r\ns search on the same \nmap, you will be unable to solve it no matter how lon=\r\ng you wait. I \nwrote this simple demo just to see this idea in action. Of c=\r\nourse \nthere is no practical application :) \nAs I mentioned before some tim=\r\ne, sticking to the maze domain may not \nbe the best way to study this new a=\r\nlgorithm. But it is good for \ndemonstration purposes. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, kelly parker &lt;bigblockfw@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; after thinking ab=\r\nout it that last post may still be a bit obscure.\n&gt; \n&gt; if the bot were give=\r\nn the ability to &quot;stick&quot; to a wall and follow \nit around one of the things =\r\nyou might want to give the bot is the \nability to avoid crashing. Crashing =\r\nbeing death you have mutually \nexclusive things that can happen. crash or f=\r\ninish. It seems \nreasonable to me to give the bot that knowledge right up f=\r\nront. \n&gt; It has proximity sensors(I assume the yellow lines are not ray \ngu=\r\nns...) and we know crashing will never provide us with a desired \nresult.\n&gt;=\r\n Now, the bot can map the maze by following the wall. \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, by exhaus=\r\ntively traversing the maze it will always find the \nred dot on the first pa=\r\nss. \n&gt; \n&gt; Great, so what&#39;s the point of trying to &quot;learn&quot; what can be done =\r\n\nwith exhaustive search?\n&gt; \n&gt; This connects the dots for what Ken has been =\r\nsaying about domains \nproviding &quot;acceptable behaviors&quot; that limit the novel=\r\nty.\n&gt; In this case the solution will be novel every time you move the dot \n=\r\nor change the maze but the bot will still find the dot on the first \ngenera=\r\ntion.\n&gt; We have thus restricted the novelty to the point that AI is \nactual=\r\nly pointless.\n&gt; Now push that into a 3,4, or 5 dimensional space.\n&gt; \n&gt; By &quot;=\r\nproperly&quot; identifying and supplying these &quot;domain acceptable \nbehaviors&quot; an=\r\ny space should be manageable.\n&gt; \n&gt; hopefully that made a bit more sense.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 5/28/08, kelly parker bigblockfw@... wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n From: kelly parker bigblockfw@...\n&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: The NS 2D maze=\r\n demo\n&gt; To: neat@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, May 28, 2008, 10:16 AM\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             I understand but the adm=\r\nittedly obscure point I was \ntrying to make is by changing the overall conc=\r\nept of what the bot is \ntrying to learn WE learn a lot of interesting thing=\r\ns about novelty \nsearch.

Coming to the red \ndot simply \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; triggers &quot;You found the solution!&quot; thing, nothing more. It is \n&gt; \n&gt; inter=\r\nesting that, when I remove random walls from the maze during \nthe \n&gt; \n&gt; nev=\r\ner-ending loop of displaying the solution, although it doesn&#39;t \n&gt; \n&gt; reach =\r\nthe goal every time, it still avoids the walls, it almost \nnever \n&gt; \n&gt; cras=\r\nhes (colliding with a wall means death in this version).

But sometimes individuals do get \n&gt; \n&gt; confused wh=\r\nen some walls are gone, which implies that it is the \n&gt; \n&gt; particular genot=\r\nype that is important.
