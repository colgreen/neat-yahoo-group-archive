In general it shows how HyperNE=\r\nAT&#39;s capability to input and output at higher resolutions (i.e. higher dime=\r\nnsionalities) than regular neural networks translates into an new ability t=\r\no transfer without changing representation.  It is compared to several well=\r\n-known reinforcement learning algorithms.  By publishing in JMLR on a well-=\r\nestablished reinforcement learning benchmark (i.e. RoboCup Keepaway) we are=\r\n once again hoping to bring ideas in indirect encoding to wider audiences t=\r\nhan the traditional evolutionary computation and GDS communities.\n\nVideos o=\r\nf evolved HyperNEAT Keepaway behavior described in the paper are also avail=\r\nable at:\n\nhttp://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperneat-keepaway.html\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
