If you gift your TWEAN with a range of\n&gt;activation functions then the lines between the two domains become even\n&gt;more blurred. From the posts so far I take it that GP&#39;s evolve tree\n&gt;structures, whereas neural nets tend to have, well,  interconnected\n&gt;networks of nodes. But are the two approaches really that different?\n\nThey&#39;re not _all_ that different, but there&#39;s some differences of history, \nattitude etc etc.\n\nI would not say it was true that TWEANs are a subset of GP, I would say \nthat TWEANs are analogous to a subset of GP.\n\nIs that useful?  The resemblance is sufficient to be interesting...\n\n         Ian\n\n&gt;Colin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
