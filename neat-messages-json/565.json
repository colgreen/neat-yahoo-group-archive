Xin Yao is a great speaker and a \n&gt; highly motivating and encouraging supervisor as well and yes it\nsure \n&gt; is very hard to catch him. I am currently writing a paper with him \n&gt; which of course deals with the group&#39;s favourite topic - \n&gt; neuroevolution, but from an ensemble learning perspective. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll second to Kennon&#39;s view on this MSc programme. It indeed is \n&gt; intellectually stimulating.\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; Arjun\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Kennon Ballou &lt;msc92klb@c...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; (a bit off-topic, my apologies)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; xin yao is one of my lecturers here at birmingham :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; he is a very good speaker. i say that he&#39;s my lecturer; \n&gt; unfortunately \n&gt; &gt; after the first two weeks he got someone else to cover the rest\nof \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; lectures this term (Yong Liu, who despite being the co-creator of \n&gt; &gt; negative correlation learning, and quite a brilliant and nice\nguy, \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; not a particularly good lecturer.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i see this is why my coursemate (whose project Xin is\nsupervising) \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; never see him, since he&#39;s off wasting time at these stupid \n&gt; conferences \n&gt; &gt; in america :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; by the way, if any of you are looking for an MSc programme, mine \n&gt; so far \n&gt; &gt; has been excellent - it has been a very good overview of \n&gt; evolutionary \n&gt; &gt; computation, neural computation, nature inspired optimisation, \n&gt; etc. a \n&gt; &gt; large portion of the faculty here is involved in naturally \n&gt; inspired \n&gt; &gt; methods including neuroevolution, and it has been very \n&gt; intellectually \n&gt; &gt; stimulating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -KB-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah the guy giving the NN tutorial is Xin Yao, who is famous \n&gt; for his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1999 pre-NEAT paper on neuroevolution, &quot;Evolving Neural \n&gt; Networks,&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which was and probably still is the most comprehensive review\nof \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; field.  But unfortunately at least in past years it looks like \n&gt; his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tutorial is mostly from that era, so it&#39;s missing a lot of the \n&gt; recent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developments in the field like NEAT.  (Of course this year\ncould \n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different.)  Still, I recommend checking it out since he&#39;s a\nwell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; known researcher and his perspective may be useful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   k e n n o n  b a l l o u\n&gt; &gt;   msc natural computation : the university of birmingham\n&gt; &gt;   http://studentweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/~msc92klb/\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
