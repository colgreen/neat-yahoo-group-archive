It&#39;s\nproba=\r\nbly not unfair to say that life got in the way (two job changes,\nbuilders r=\r\nipping house apart, kids being kids, the usual stuff).\n\nBut that&#39;s neither =\r\nimportant nor relevant right now.\n\nThose with elephantine memories may reca=\r\nll my on-off obsession with\nbeating the bookies in the fixed-odds football =\r\nbetting market through\nthe cunning application of AI. Last week I finally f=\r\nound myself in the\nblissful position of having a dual-CPU work machine with=\r\n Visual Studio\n.NET 2005 installed, something that just screamed for a reop=\r\nening of\nmy NEAT files.\n\nSo far, I&#39;ve downloaded Colin&#39;s latest SharpNEAT s=\r\nource, upgraded it\nto .NET 2.0 (largely painless) and developed an experime=\r\nnt that uses\nmy venerable result and odds files. I&#39;ll describe the approach=\r\n taken\nanon, but I thought I&#39;d share some observations:\n\nSharpNEAT: I hadn&#39;=\r\nt realised until I started coding against it what a\nreally nice job this is=\r\n. I mean, I knew it was good, but the ease of\nincorporating a model, once I=\r\n finally got around to it, was still a\nsurprise. I&#39;d guess it took about 8 =\r\nhours&#39; effort to get the thing\nrunning from the end of the download.\n\nPart =\r\nof the exercise was to get myself back up to speed in the C#\nstakes: I hadn=\r\n&#39;t written any code in .NET for about 18 months. I\nreplaced the progress fo=\r\nrm graph controls with ZedGraph (from\nSourceForge) ones as an exercise.\n\nNe=\r\ntwork evolution. I speculated last year on the value of starting\nwith a spa=\r\nrsely-connected network (or one with no connections at all).\nI&#39;m extremely =\r\nhappy with the limited practical experience I&#39;ve had\nwith this approach: th=\r\ne early generations, while fairly stupid,\nevaluate at a tremendous rate, so=\r\n complexities that allow some\nreasonable attempt at the problem are quickly=\r\n reached. Playing with\nspecies numbers via the compatibility threshold is, =\r\nI&#39;m sure, going to\nbe instructive once I&#39;ve worked out what I think it&#39;s te=\r\naching me!\n\nArchitecture. Despite the complete lack of activity on the codi=\r\nng\nfront, I&#39;ve continued to evolve my thinking on this. What I decided to\nd=\r\no for this first cut was to evolve a model that would form its own\nopinions=\r\n about the relative strengths of teams. I therefore decided to\nadd some out=\r\nputs to the networks and save them against the team(s)\ninvolved inthe match=\r\n being evaluated. These saved outputs would then\nform part of the input for=\r\n the next match that involved that team. I\nhoped that the more successful n=\r\networks would learn to calculate a set\nof &quot;ratings&quot; for each team. Since ra=\r\ntings need to change with results,\nI also added the team&#39;s most recent resu=\r\nlt (epxressed as a goal\ndifference) and the network&#39;s most recent predictio=\r\nn to the inputs. I\nhave in the past expressed a liking for the idea of a &quot;c=\r\nonfidence&quot;\nvalue as a separate output, so I put one of those in too...\n\nThe=\r\n inputs currently look like this:\n\nHome team block:\n    Last result, last p=\r\nredicted win chance & confidence\n    &quot;memory block&quot; (4 numbers, four becaus=\r\ne it seemed like a nice number)\nAway team block:\n     As above\nA value to i=\r\nndicate the division in which the match takes place, to\ngive the network a =\r\nchance to arrive at a sensible number for\nnewly-promoted teams\n\nThe network=\r\n is then given a chance to relax over multiple steps (takes\nabout 4 or 5 ty=\r\npically - those that fail to converge within 10 steps\nare penalised)\n\nOutpu=\r\nts currently look like this:\nHome win, Away win and Draw probabilities & co=\r\nnfidence factors (6 outputs)\nHome team &quot;memory block&quot; (4)\nAway team &quot;memory=\r\n block&quot; (4)\n\nEach network evaluation consists of a &quot;calibration&quot; period, co=\r\nnsisting\nof eight years of results being pushed through to develop the mode=\r\nl&#39;s\n&quot;memory&quot;, then a further four seasons for which odds are available are\n=\r\nrun through. Networks are, by and large, assigned a fitness according\nto th=\r\ne profit they make.\n\nResults to date: The best network I&#39;ve evolved so far =\r\nmanaged to take\nan initial stake of 1,000 and, subject to staking limits of=\r\n a 50\nmaximum, generate a profit of about 10,000. I&#39;m rather pleased with\nt=\r\nhat :-) The champion networks tend to have very few hidden nodes (one\nto fo=\r\nur) but a forest of interconnections on the output layer,\nprobably somethin=\r\ng that stems from &quot;relaxing&quot; over multiple steps.\n\nQuestions to be answered=\r\n:\n1. Is the best network overfitting/memorizing the profitable bets?\nQuite =\r\npossibly - I need to source some more recent data for testing.\n2. How robus=\r\nt is the calibration/memory aspect? Would the network\narrive at the same re=\r\nsult if, say, the first seasons&#39; data were excluded?\n3. Will I continue to =\r\nhave time to build a front end for the &quot;final\nsolution&quot; network and have it=\r\n ready to test with real money next\nseason? (I&#39;m prepared to bankroll a prm=\r\nising candidate to the tune of\n100 quid or so, for the entertainment if not=\r\nhing else).\n\nWell, I came back with a monster. If you&#39;ve reached the end, y=\r\nou have\nmy congratulations (and sympathy for the loss of time it&#39;s caused).=\r\n\nI&#39;d welcome any comments, suggestions, or other feedback.\n\nIt&#39;s nice to be=\r\n back.\n\nMike\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
