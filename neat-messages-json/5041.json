My initial thoughts on how to do\n&gt; this relatively ef=\r\nficiently are as follows:\n\nHi!\n\nUsing brain during xmas has led me to this =\r\nconclusion.\nI&#39;ve identified four types of networks that potentially could b=\r\ne nice to\nevolve.\n\n1:\nFirst is the Feed Forward network. This kind of netwo=\r\nrk is very fast to\ncompute. nice :)\n\n2:\nAdd memory of old activations of si=\r\nze N to each node in the Feed Forward\nnetwork and allow genes to go from th=\r\nese old computed values. This kind of\nnetwork does not contain any loops so=\r\n it is as fast to compute as the Feed\nForward network. super nice :)\n\n3:\nNe=\r\ntworks containing short circuit loops. Looping is needed to compute these\nk=\r\nind of networks which can make them slow. :(\n\n4:\nAdd memory of old activati=\r\nons to network type 3 and you get this kind of\nnetwork.\n\nDunno what network=\r\ns 2,3 & 4 are called but I think they all fall under the\ncategory recurrent=\r\n networks, but I do feel they have different properties when computing them=\r\n so I&#39;ve separated them into three types. Feel free to educate me about the=\r\nir names if anyone knows!\n\nOne can also have two bit flags so one can choos=\r\ne if nodes with zero inputs, and nodes with zero outputs should be allowed =\r\nto exist.\n\nNetwork types 1 & 2 I support in my implementation, and later I =\r\nprobably will add support for 3 & 4 to make it complete.\n\n/Magnus\n\n\n"}}
