One\nreason for the=\r\n timing is that I will be giving a keynote talk about\nHyperNEAT at the Inte=\r\nrnational Conference on Neural Networks (ICANN)\nin Prague next week, and I =\r\nfelt it would be good to have this more\ncomprehensive reference available f=\r\nor that.  If you happen to be going\nto ICANN, I will be giving the talk on =\r\nthe last day at 9-10am.\n\nThe article is a detailed synthesis of the work of=\r\n David D&#39;Ambrosio,\nJason Gauci, and myself from 2007.  However, it goes int=\r\no greater\ndepth and includes a lot more HyperNEAT pattern visualization and=\r\n\nanalysis than the conference papers.  People in this group interested\nin H=\r\nyperNEAT may in particular find the visualizations intuitively\ninteresting.=\r\n  \n\nThe 39-page paper is called, &quot;A Hypercube-Based Indirect Encoding for\nE=\r\nvolving Large-Scale Neural Networks,&quot; and is available here:\n\nhttp://eplex.=\r\ncs.ucf.edu/publications.html#stanley.alife09\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
