Although the\n&quot;babies stolen&quot; parameter in my C++ NEAT is a kind of\nsuper-elitism, where champions of top species get to\nhave disproportionately many babies, although they are\nnot clones.\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;blue5432@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Just wondering if anybody&#39;d done any sort of ablation\n&gt; testing with elitism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last night we inadvertently disabled the elitism\n&gt; functionality in our implementation and we were trying\n&gt; to figure out why it wasn&#39;t working (several runs in a\n&gt; row could not solve XOR and the overall population was\n&gt; bloating badly).  Philip found the problem, enabled\n&gt; elitism, and it worked like a dream...solved for XOR\n&gt; in 20-30 generations, with very small topologies.\n&gt; \n&gt; So we sort of inadvertantly did an ablation test for\n&gt; elitism. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;m wondering how crucial an aspect of NEAT in\n&gt; particular and GAs in general, elitism is.  It\n&gt; certainly seems incredibly important, at least with\n&gt; XOR...so much so that removing it effectively broke\n&gt; the algorithm.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also wondering if anyone had implemented elitism\n&gt; differently than the original NEAT study (the fittest\n&gt; members of species due to produce 5 or more offspring\n&gt; in the next generation are copied over unchanged), and\n&gt; what their experiences/thoughts might have been.\n&gt; \n&gt; Derek\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
