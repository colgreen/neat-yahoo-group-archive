But \nthere is =\r\nanother question. Can we compare the genotype complexity for \nboth models, =\r\nwhat if the CPPN encodes a very complex function with \nmany dimentions and =\r\nthe other method that produces the same results \nhas less genes? I don&#39;t se=\r\ne any info about genotype complexity on \nPicbreeder. And because most of th=\r\ne interesting pictures have very \nlong lineages, probably the mutation rate=\r\ns are high too, it is \npossible that these examples have very complex genom=\r\nes. More complex \nthan it could be done with another method, cellurar growt=\r\nh for \nexample. Consider the square shape that Robert evolved. For a human&#39;=\r\ns \nperception it is very simple but there may be about hundreds of \nconnect=\r\nions in the CPPN. \n\nBy the way we should make difference between CPPN outpu=\r\nt images, when \nwe concern *bodies*. Because in the physics sense, a CPPN c=\r\nan easily \ncreate hundreds of separate objects in one snapshot. There is a =\r\n\ndifference between the raw CPPN snapshot and a physical body in the \nsense=\r\n we want it to be. If I say &quot;here is an apple&quot; I usually mean \none object. =\r\nBut a CPPN with structure capturing a repetition \nregularity can make infin=\r\nite number of apples. \n\nAnother thing I&#39;d like to discuss is how does it fi=\r\nt into the fitness \nsearch. Suppose we need to evolve a &quot;creature&quot; with a s=\r\nkin preserving \nthe inner body intact. I really believe that all first moti=\r\nfs of skin \nwill fail. But on the other hand, Novelty Search would search t=\r\noo \nvast space before it ever finds the right motif. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeff, that&#39;s a =\r\ngood thought experiment for testing my claim.  There\n&gt; are many considerati=\r\nons, and although I may not hit all of them, I\n&gt; think in general it can be=\r\n refuted:\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally, I think HyperNEAT (i.e. NEAT with CPPNs) already\n=\r\n&gt; approximately follow the scenario that you outline:  It discovers \nkey\n&gt; =\r\nmotifs (whether they be skin or something else) early in evolution \nand\n&gt; t=\r\nhen as the overall body plan is deformed, the original motifs are\n&gt; often p=\r\nreserved (which again includes skin).  The main idea is that\n&gt; skin is like=\r\n a kind of surrounding motif for the overall shape, and \nif\n&gt; the pverall s=\r\nhape is warped through some kind of mutation in the\n&gt; internal CPPN, then h=\r\nowever the shape is surrounded will naturally\n&gt; warp in the same way.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIn fact, you can see this happen consistently in Picbreeder.  It is\n&gt; possi=\r\nble to consider the simple black outline of many of the color\n&gt; figures as =\r\na &quot;skin.&quot;  You can notice that it is special by noting \nthat\n&gt; often the ou=\r\nter band is black but everything structure inside is\n&gt; color.  Then, if the=\r\n shape of the overall image warps, so does the\n&gt; outer membrane.\n&gt; \n&gt; Howev=\r\ner, you might say that such a &quot;skin&quot; is not complex enough to \nbe\n&gt; convinc=\r\ning.  Perhaps skin should have multiple parts, i.e. its own\n&gt; special struc=\r\nture.  In fact, if you look closely, you can find many\n&gt; such examples.  Fo=\r\nr example, there are often double-layer outer\n&gt; membranes that form, such a=\r\ns in this image:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D317=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a clear outer structure that surrounds the complex \ncurvatur=\r\ne\n&gt; of the object.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, perhaps more interestingly, you can get several=\r\n layers of color\n&gt; bands, but only on the outer membrane, such as in this i=\r\nmage that \nends\n&gt; in a light blue that becomes green, then becomes yellow, =\r\nbefore\n&gt; sinking into the inner-body color of orange:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreede=\r\nr.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D4227\n&gt; \n&gt; To show that the outer membrane=\r\n warps easily and naturally \nregardless\n&gt; of shape changes (even complex on=\r\nes), I further evolved that image \nto\n&gt; get a new shape, and you can see th=\r\nat the outer membrane has the \nsame\n&gt; motif nevertheless, nicely warped to =\r\naccommodate the new overall \nshape:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showg=\r\nenome.php?sid=3D5635\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also important to note that outer membranes=\r\n in nature are not\n&gt; uniform covers and often transition into something els=\r\ne on the\n&gt; surface.  For example, consider lips and eyes.  Or perhaps even =\r\nmore\n&gt; importantly, consider fingernails, where the outer cover actually\n&gt; =\r\nfalls *under* something else (i.e. the nail), violating the covering\n&gt; rule=\r\n.  I point these exceptions out because in Picbreeder you also\n&gt; often see =\r\nalmost consistent outer motifs that are broken in a couple\n&gt; places.  While=\r\n these locations often are arbitrary, the point is \nthat\n&gt; such a capabilit=\r\ny could be exploited if it actually mattered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving from 2-D to 3-D s=\r\nhould not matter in the case of skin, just \nas\n&gt; moving CPPNs from 2-D to 4=\r\n-D continues to allow all the same\n&gt; regularities.  So when you see example=\r\ns in 2-D, they are also \npossible\n&gt; in 3-D for the same reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most =\r\nof these outer skin motifs can arise early when the shape is\n&gt; simple and a=\r\nre then easily preserved.  However, they are not always\n&gt; preserved.  For e=\r\nxample, the multicolor skin above evolved into a\n&gt; different multicolor ski=\r\nn in one lineage:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://picbreeder.org/search/showgenome.php?sid=3D42=\r\n28\n&gt; \n&gt; This phenomenon is expected from the analogy with nature, just as\n&gt;=\r\n scales can evolve into fur, or fur into uncovered skin, all still\n&gt; servin=\r\ng the role of outer membrane.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it&#39;s important to note that skin=\r\n or an outer membrane is not\n&gt; really any different from any other CPPN-gen=\r\nerated motif, in that it\n&gt; can be preserved, warped, or changed in its inte=\r\nrnal structure.  So \nI\n&gt; don&#39;t think there is really anything special going=\r\n on in the \nargument\n&gt; compared to the discovery of symmetry or other conve=\r\nntions.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello all-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ken has challenged us all many times to th=\r\nink about whether there \nis any\n&gt; &gt; need for a process of development. The =\r\nidentity of cells in\n&gt; developmental\n&gt; &gt; processes is determined by local c=\r\nontextual information whereas \nKen\n&gt; &gt; advocates skipping that by letting c=\r\nells determine their identity\n&gt; via giving\n&gt; &gt; them their objective coordin=\r\nates. The question is whether we lose\n&gt; anything\n&gt; &gt; important to the evolu=\r\ntion of complexity by skipping this step.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think it is a fascinat=\r\ning question and, unable to come up with \na good\n&gt; &gt; reason why development=\r\n matters myself, but wanting to give the\n&gt; argument a\n&gt; &gt; rigorous evaluati=\r\non, I have been asking many people in our field \nwhether\n&gt; &gt; they can descr=\r\nibe something unique that a developmental process\n&gt; provides. No\n&gt; &gt; one ha=\r\ns come up with  a reason that compels me, so I have become a\n&gt; strong\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\ndvocate of the lack of a need for an unfolding process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, i=\r\nn the course of watching a keynote on development in \nnatural\n&gt; &gt; systems a=\r\nt this year&#39;s gecco, an argument in favor of development\n&gt; occurred\n&gt; &gt; to =\r\nme that may have merit. I am interested to hear what y&#39;all \nthink\n&gt; of it.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The argument is this: it might be easier to evolve certain large-\n=\r\nscale\n&gt; &gt; properties when the organism is simple and small and then \nscale/=\r\ngrow\n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; up, rather than incorporating them into an already complex =\r\n\nphenotype. I\n&gt; &gt; think an example illustrates the point best. Imagine evol=\r\nution\n&gt; figuring out\n&gt; &gt; how to put a coat of skin on an organism. It is no=\r\nt that hard to\n&gt; figure out\n&gt; &gt; what the shape of that skin should be when =\r\nthe embryo has only a \nfew\n&gt; cells.\n&gt; &gt; Once that simple and small coat of =\r\nskin has formed, it can follow\n&gt; the simple\n&gt; &gt; rule of keeping the layer o=\r\nf skin the same thickness, and adding \ncells\n&gt; &gt; within that layer to grow =\r\nto cover any arbitrary shape that the\n&gt; phenotype\n&gt; &gt; becomes. This simple =\r\nrule could produce a skin shell for a bat or \na\n&gt; jaguar.\n&gt; &gt; Now consider =\r\nhow hard it would be for 3D hyperneat to create a \nskin\n&gt; shell\n&gt; &gt; for a b=\r\nat or a jaguar. The mathematical function to create such\n&gt; outlines is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nvery complex (although it is less so if it is a composition of \nother,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nalready created functions that produced the rest of the body). \nStill, it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; seems that this task might be harder for hyperneat than following\n&gt; the =\r\nsimple\n&gt; &gt; developmental rules outlined above.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do you think? =\r\nI would happily be convinced that this \nargument is\n&gt; &gt; without merit, so p=\r\nlease let me know if you see any problems with \nit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; jclune@\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
