The worst that can happen is that an individual\n&gt; user simply doesn&#39;t publish something because their personal goal\n&gt; wasn&#39;t satisfied.  However, that has no effect on the collective\n&gt; dynamic, which is that what *is* published is fodder for everything\n&gt; else.\n\nOk. I was focused more on your human in the loop, not your Web 2.0 humans in\nthe loop. I see where you are coming from.\n\n&gt; I do consider Golem to be TBE, yes, because it has an explicit\n&gt; goal.  Sure, there are many ways to achieve the goal, but the goal\n&gt; is what makes it TBE.\n\nYeah, but life (and picbreeder images) have a goal too: yield lots o copies.\n\n&gt; Actually this project does use almost the exact same encoding as\n&gt; Picbreeder, which is why I mentioned it.  It uses DelphiNEAT, which\n&gt; is where the idea for CPPNs was inspired.  I guess I&#39;m not sure what\n&gt; you mean when you say you don&#39;t see the difference between this and\n&gt; Picbreeder, where we have distinct objects like cars, insects, and\n&gt; faces.  You don&#39;t a see difference between those pictures and the\n&gt; ones on this site?\n\nI do see this difference (the lack of recognizable objects) now that you\npoint it out. I also agree that the lack of them is probably due to the\naveraging. But I wonder whether each user has a short term goal for a while\nthat allows them to go off in a direction towards something they glimpsed in\na pattern. I see something like a car and I keep selecting for the\ncar-looking images till I get the image. That can&#39;t happen in the Delphi\nproject cause my desire to go off in a direction is prevented by the group.\nIf I am on the right track, then maybe the branching possibilities are more\nthe key ingredient in the difference between the projects than the\ngoallessness. But I also agree that many users do not have goals (or keep\nthem around for long). So there is a lot of selection for abstract things\nlike coolness, complexity, and whatever makes up our concepts of beautiful,\ninteresting, etc. \n\nAnyway, I understand why you made your original claim. I agree with you that\nsome of the elements of the type of IEC to which you refer are analogous to\nsome of the elements of natural selection. :-)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
