This kind of search is really \ninnovative concept that needs to be explored. But I have several \nquestions about it. \n\nIt is obvious that you have to define what is a network&#39;s behaviour \nin the task domain and find a way to measure distance between two \nbehaviours. I think this is the hardest part of setting up a novelty \nsearch. For example, in the task domain of maze navigation, you can \nsimply say that a robot&#39;s ending point is its behaviour, but I can \nargue that this is not all, but the way the robot reaches this point \ncan also be considered a behaviour. For example the robot may go from \npoint A to point B straight forward, but it can reach the same point \nby going forward and spinning. Your model will consider both as the \nsame behaviour while it is obvious the behaviours are different. \n\nAnother thing is that as the task becomes more complex, it is nearly \nimpossible to define what a behaviour *is* and how to measure \ndistance between them. Consider the tennis playing robot. Or the \ncheckers playing network. How can you define the behaviour then? And \nmore, how can you measure *distance* between behaviours? It&#39;s like \nyou have two persons that you know very well and you try to say &quot;the \ndistance between your behaviours is 56.1 units&quot;... I don&#39;t say it is \nimpossible, it is just too hard. \n\nThe simplest approach is to track the network&#39;s output pattern and \nhave this as its behaviour. But then a slight change will mean a \ndifferent behaviour and the algorithm will end up adding and adding \nmore members to the pool, nearly every new thing in fact, thus the \nalgorithm will end up as a slightly optimized version of exhaustive \nsearch. \n\nBut it is really interesting to see novelty search combined with \nCPPN/HyperNEAT on tasks like my biped or just regular NEAT with \nnovelty search on the cool demos I saw in DephiNEAT like the Hopper \nand the snake. \n\nBy the way I support the idea that novelty search should sometimes be \nbiased with fitness-based search, once a good number of approximate \nsolutions is found. Especially in domains where the search/behaviour \nspace is vast. \n\nI believe that the search space that NEAT searches directly (the \ngenotype space) is much more big than the behaviour space, simply \nbecause many many different structures/weight configurations can \nrepresent the same exact behaviour. The task domain can restrict the \npossible behaviours further, but not in all task domains. But even if \nthere are infinite possible behaviours in a space, novelty search is \nstill better than random search because it searches explicitly for \nnew behaviours, so new genomes that do the same thing will not be \nrewarded. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.com&gt; com, &quot;Kenneth\nStanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Joel Lehman and I are excited to announce our new publication to\n&gt; appear in the Eleventh International Conference on Articifial Life\n&gt; (ALIFE XI), called &quot;Exploiting Open-Endedness to Solve Problems\n&gt; Through the Search for Novelty.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper is here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://eplex. &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/publications.html#lehman.alife08&gt;\ncs.ucf.edu/publications.html#lehman.alife08\n&gt; \n&gt; Direct link: http://eplex.\n&lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_alife08.pdf&gt;\ncs.ucf.edu/papers/lehman_alife08.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; This paper is about a new kind of search (which works with NEAT) \nthat\n&gt; abandons the longstanding notion in all of machine learning that the\n&gt; gradient of search should be measured with respect to the ultimate\n&gt; objective. In other words, it entirely abandons objectives and\n&gt; thereby also abandons fitness functions as the impetus for search. \n&gt; Yet remarkably, we still show that such an algorithm can perform\n&gt; *better* than one that actually tries to achieve the objective! I\n&gt; believe this strange result has fascinating implications for machine\n&gt; learning, artificial life, and even biology.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lately on this forum we have often discussed the nagging problem \nthat\n&gt; the fitness function often does not properly recognize or reward the\n&gt; stepping stones on the way to the solution. I went as far as\n&gt; suggesting that the fitness function can become an *obstacle* to\n&gt; success (e.g. when we discussed creativity in Picbreeder).\n&gt; \n&gt; While this discussion was largely philosophical, Joel Lehman and I\n&gt; decided to make it concrete and actually introduce an algorithm that\n&gt; makes an automated evolutionary process in *any* domain behave like\n&gt; humans in Picbreeder, that is, like open-ended evolution. This\n&gt; approach is called &quot;novelty search.&quot; The algorithm simply searches\n&gt; for behavior that is novel with respect to what has come before.\n&gt; \n&gt; The benefit of this approach is that it is immune to deception \nbecause\n&gt; it does not even try to achieve the objective. I know it seems\n&gt; strange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact it is far more\n&gt; effective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive landscape \nthan\n&gt; fitness-based search. \n&gt; \n&gt; In other words, what we are saying is that to achieve some of the \nmost\n&gt; ambitious objectives we might have for evolution, we must abandon\n&gt; trying to explicitly achieve them. To quote from the end of our\n&gt; Discussion section:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;In summary, almost like a riddle, novelty search suggests\n&gt; a surprising new perspective on achievement: To achieve\n&gt; your highest goals, you must be willing to abandon them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe this lesson is true in practice and is therefore beyond a\n&gt; philosophical curiosity. In fact, we are instinctively familiar \nwith\n&gt; it in life in general when people say things like &quot;You are trying \ntoo\n&gt; hard&quot; or when we focus so much on something so far ahead of us in \nlife\n&gt; that we forget completely to solve the short term problems that \nstand\n&gt; in our way. It is no less true in evolution or search in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; For NEAT, novelty search should open up new opportunities for\n&gt; discovery that were previously closed off to us. \n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this work.\n&gt;

I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; believe this strange result has fascinating impli=\r\ncations \n  for machine&lt;BR&gt;&gt; learning, artificial life, and even biology.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lately on this forum we have often discussed the naggi=\r\nng problem \n  &lt;BR&gt;that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the fitness function often does not properly=\r\n recognize or \n  reward the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stepping stones on the way to the solut=\r\nion. I went as far \n  as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; suggesting that the fitness function can b=\r\necome an *obstacle* \n  to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; success (e.g. when we discussed creativit=\r\ny in Picbreeder).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; While this discussion was largely phi=\r\nlosophical, Joel Lehman and \n  I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; decided to make it concrete and ac=\r\ntually introduce an algorithm \n  that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; makes an automated evolutiona=\r\nry process in *any* domain behave \n  like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humans in Picbreeder, tha=\r\nt is, like open-ended evolution. \n  This&lt;BR&gt;&gt; approach is called &quot;novelt=\r\ny search.&quot; The algorithm simply \n  searches&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for behavior that is no=\r\nvel with respect to what has come \n  before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The benefit o=\r\nf this approach is that it is immune to \n  deception &lt;BR&gt;because&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it=\r\n does not even try to achieve the objective. I \n  know it seems&lt;BR&gt;&gt; str=\r\nange but, counterintuitively, we show that in fact it \n  is far more&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; effective at solving a difficult problem in a deceptive \n  landscape &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fitness-based search. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In other \n  words, wha=\r\nt we are saying is that to achieve some of the &lt;BR&gt;most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  ambitiou=\r\ns objectives we might have for evolution, we must abandon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  trying=\r\n to explicitly achieve them. To quote from the end of our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  Discus=\r\nsion section:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;In summary, almost like a riddle, \n  novelt=\r\ny search suggests&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a surprising new perspective on achievement: \n  T=\r\no achieve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; your highest goals, you must be willing to abandon \n  the=\r\nm.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I believe this lesson is true in practice and is \n  th=\r\nerefore beyond a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; philosophical curiosity. In fact, we are \n  instin=\r\nctively familiar &lt;BR&gt;with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it in life in general when people say \n  =\r\nthings like &quot;You are trying &lt;BR&gt;too&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hard&quot; or when we focus so much =\r\non \n  something so far ahead of us in &lt;BR&gt;life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that we forget compl=\r\netely to \n  solve the short term problems that &lt;BR&gt;stand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in our way=\r\n. It is no less \n  true in evolution or search in general.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n For NEAT, novelty \n  search should open up new opportunities for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; d=\r\niscovery that were \n  previously closed off to us. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I look=\r\n forward to hearing your \n  thoughts on this work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ken&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_000D_01C8B351.74460D50--\r\n\n"}}
