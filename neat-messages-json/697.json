Did you see the demo of their evolution:\n\nhttp://www.naturalmotion.com/pages/technology_hiw.htm\n\nIt&#39;s very strange that it&#39;s walking well after only 20 generations.  \nIt makes you wonder what constraints they put in there.  However, it \ndoes show this pursuit is feasible.  But it clearly needs the right \njoint controls, fitness function, and possible constraints.  For \nexample, maybe it must be impossible for it to move both legs \nforward at the same time?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ai_junkie_dot_com&quot; &lt;fup@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; I think you guys might be interested in taking a look at this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.naturalmotion.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; They have had considerable success with evolving human motion. \nThere&#39;s\n&gt; not a lot to read but you&#39;ll enjoy watching the demos.\n\n\n"}}
