More on that below...\n\nOops, forgot to expand on that.\n\nAveraging is just a side-effect of having arbitrary-scale enlargement.  In \norder to pull off what it is I&#39;m trying to do, I need to have one part that \ntakes in the inputs and uses them as parameters to define a &#39;curve&#39; that \napproximates the shape of those inputs.  The curve would be continuous, \nwhereas the inputs are not.\n\nThen, to query that model, that curve, I want to be able to specify an \n&#39;area&#39; of that curve.  And I want the output to be the average hight of the \ncurve within that area.\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to the current way that enlargement is done.  \nThey use &#39;splines&#39; to describe the curvature of the inputs, and then output \na smaller portion of the curve in order to extract the output pixels.  \nMathematically, it can be done.  It just may take a whole LOT of topology to \npull it off.  I&#39;m okay with that!  As long as I&#39;m not throwing more topology \nat it than is necessary.\n\n\n\n"}}
