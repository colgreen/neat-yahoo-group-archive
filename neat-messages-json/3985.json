In such methods, the\n world is overlaid with a (ususally 2d) force field, where each point\n has an associated vector that influences the movement of the robot.\n Having obstacles emit a repulsive field and targets an attractor field\n solves some navigation problems elegantly.\n\n The big difference is of course that position-based multiagent\n hyperneat encodes a complete behaviour rather than just a force\n vector.\n\n\n &gt;  For example, in soccer, the roles are assigned based on a kind of\n &gt;  virtual configuration of players that may never actually exist on the\n &gt;  field after the initial kickoff. As a result, if e.g. a forward drops\n &gt;  back momentarily to play defense, he does not suddenly switch roles\n &gt;  and *become* a fullback. Rather, he goes back to being a forward.\n\n On the other hand, in ant societies, I think at least some of the\n role-switching (fight, gather food, feed the young etc.) is done\ndepending on where the ant happens to be\n (relative to breeding grounds, enemies, food etc.) rather than who it grew up\n as. The same would go, I guess, for soldiers in a battle situation. I\n guess that in most scenarios, there are some aspects of any role that\n are defined a priori and some that are situation-dependent.\n\n By the way, it&#39;s a very interesting idea, and a good paper!\n\n Julian\n\n\n\n &gt;  What would happen if your role in soccer switched instantaneously with\n &gt;  your position? Then the team could end up with problems where e.g.\n &gt;  everyone on the team becomes offense at the same time by accident\n &gt;  simply because they momentarily moved up the field. Then who will go\n &gt;  back to defend? It seems there is a use to roles defined a priori.\n &gt;\n &gt;  Yet I imagine in other domains role makes more sense based on current\n &gt;  position alone. So it is probably domain-dependent, and an\n &gt;  interesting issue to think about.\n &gt;\n &gt;  ken\n &gt;\n &gt;  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@...&gt;\n &gt;  wrote:\n &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;  &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; One thing I thought about when I read the paper was, what would\n &gt;  &gt; happen if the CPPN generates the connectivity patterns depending on\n &gt;  &gt; the relative positions of each individual in realtime while on the\n &gt;  &gt; field? It would require a great deal of computation time (it has to\n &gt;  &gt; rebuild the phenotype once per timestep per individual) but it may\n &gt;  &gt; show interesting results.\n &gt;  &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; Peter\n &gt;  &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@&gt; wrote:\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio and I discuss the potential for HyperNEAT\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; controlling multiple heterogeneous agents in this new\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; paper, &quot;Generative Encoding for Multiagent Learning,&quot; to appear at\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; GECCO 2008:\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=28#dambrosio.gecco08\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; Direct Link:\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/dambrosio_gecco08.pdf\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; We also have a nice sample of videos that depict various evolved\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; teams in action:\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/multiagenthyperneat\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; The interesting idea in this paper is that just as a single\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; connective CPPN can encode how a single network varies over space,\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; it can also encode how a *set* of networks (each representing the\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; policy of one agent on the team) varies over space. In this way,\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT can learn an expression that encodes how policies vary\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; over the team geometry. For example, in a soccer team agents vary\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; from defensive to offensive as you move away from the goal. Part\n &gt;  &gt; of\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; the power of this approach is that it means basic skills can be\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; learned and shared among the whole team, since the CPPN encodes how\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; those skills vary across the field.\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; ken\n &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n &gt;  &gt;\n &gt;\n &gt;  \n\n\n\n --\n Julian Togelius\n IDSIA\n Galleria 2\n 6928 Manno-Lugano\n Switzerland\n julian@...\n http://julian.togelius.com\n http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n +41-764-110679\n +46-705-192088\n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nIDSIA\nGalleria 2\n6928 Manno-Lugano\nSwitzerland\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\nhttp://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n+41-764-110679\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
