But I get the general \nidea.\n\n\tOver on the GP mail list we had a discussion of co-evolution and one of \nthe examples that was brought up was a case where the guy had far too many \ntest cases to evaluate them all against each individual, so he set up the \nset of test cases to evolve for their ability to distinguish solutions, \nwhilst the solutions were evolving to solve them.  Obviously there&#39;s a rick \nthere of the test-cases focusing in on a limited domain (which happens to \nwork well at one point in history) and the solutions losing the ability to \noperate outside that domain.  ISRT this was avoided by (i) always including \na set of randomly chosen test-cases, (ii) scoring the test-cases in a way \nthat favours those who test different aspects from the bulk of the test-cases.\n\n\tThat last point might be achieved by particularly rewarding a test-case \nfor any solutions it could separate but other test-cases not?\n\n\tIan\n\n\n\nLiving@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \nhttp://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
