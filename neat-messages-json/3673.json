So if, in the same network that now contains A-&gt;C-&gt;B, the\nal=\r\ngorithm happens to choose A-&gt;B for a new node again, it is\nguaranteed to fi=\r\nnd the innovation with new node C... and thus we would\nget two nodes with t=\r\nhe same ID.\n\nIs this the intended behavior, or am I reading this wrong?\n\nTh=\r\nanks,\n\n--Rob\n\n\n\n"}}
