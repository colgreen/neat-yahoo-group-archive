Starting to get some nice results now.  Actually I was just \nlooking at Mattias&#39; pole balancing demo - on the DelphiNEAT web site \nMattias mentions poor performance on this problem as well. Mattias, did \nyou ever resolve this problem? Could this be because of the initial \npopulation that you are using?\n\n&gt;  What is the fitness function being used in \n&gt;the no wiggle pole balancing?  Is it the Gruau one used in our \n&gt;paper?  Because the fitness numbers I&#39;m seeing don&#39;t look familiar \n&gt;to me in that experiment.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes I tried to set it up as described in the paper, except I am not \nperforming the generalization tests on the generation champion. Are the \ngeneralization tests reflected in the fitness score?\n\nWhat I normally see is the fitness rising to between 10.0 and 10.09. \nThis corresponds with a network that has run the full 100000 timesteps \nsince the f1 fitness component comes to [((100000 / 1000) * 0.1)=10  ] \nbut the f2 component=0.0 to 0.09 due to wiggling.  Perhaps it&#39;s the \ninitial pop again - if it is more conducive to generating wiggling \nsolutions then f1 will quickly rise, once this happens you are unlikely \nto find non-wiggling solutions from a population of wiggling ones, the \nsearch is stuck in a local maximum.\n\nOr maybe it the lack of generalization tests is keeping poor solutions \nin the population tat otherwise would have been culled?\n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
