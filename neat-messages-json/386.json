Just to \nexplain where I&#39;m coming from. I sat down last night with the \nintention of porting one of the available NEAT projects (yours, \nJNEAT, etc) to C#. However, for now I have decided to attempt my own \nimplementation rather than a direct port, for my own education as \nmuch as anything. I also have a quantity of existing code that can \nbe restructured to implement NEAT so hopefully it shouldn&#39;t actually \nrequire much effort.\n\nAnyway, I was looking through your code and couldn&#39;t quite determine \nhow you treat node genes and specifically input node genes during \nevolution.\n\nSome questions then:\n\n1) I see from your recent email that you (optionally) allow input \nnodes to be removed. Do you also allow input nodes to be added?\n\n2) Can I assume that you do not allow connections back *to* input \nnodes? and that therefore the connections you generate during \nevolution ignore input nodes as possible targets?\n\n3) How do you &#39;inject&#39; input signals into a network? Do you simply \nobtain a list of all the input nodes (in the order they exist within \nthe genome) and directly set their output value? \n\n4) Not really a question, just an observation. In your original NEAT \npaper you do not mention whether both node and connection genes \nfeature in the compatibilty function. A brief look at your code \nseems to indicate that only connection genes are considered. I guess \nthis makes sense so long as mutation never changes a connection&#39;s \nend points - the connections therefore describe the network, the \nnode genes are just placeholders. In fact I see you combined the \nfunction of node gene and working neuron, thus increasing \nefficiency - as there is no need to rebuild nn&#39;s at each evaluation.\n\n\nAny assistance gratefully received!\n\n\nIn case others are interested I have been working with C# for my day \njob for about 9 months. I have a tendency to avoid MS products but I \nhave to say I have been pleasantly surprised with the whole C#/.Net \nmodel. It is very much like java (and syntactically like C++) but is \nincredibly easy to code, MS have really put some though into the \nlanguage identifying and addressing problems with Java/C++. \n\nSpeed wise some rough tests showed that compiled C# runs at about \n80% the speed of optimised C++. I would imagine this is on a par \nwith a modern Java VM. When I originally started tinkering with \nEANN&#39;s I developed with KDevelop (C++ IDE) on Linux, however I found \nI spent 90% of my time addressing issues with the IDE, the various \nC++ libraries (including a bug in the STL!), memory leaks and silly \nhidden bugs that seem inherent to large C++ projects. My experience \nwith C# thus far has been a breath of fresh air in comparison, many \nof the sources of silly bugs are immediately highlighted (if you can \nafford Visual Studio that is!) and the .Net framework has proved \nvery robust.\n\nIn terms of a platform for experimentation I think it is ideal. I \nshould also point out that the SDK(including a C# compiler) and the \nframework itself are freely available and that there is an open \nsource IDE (SharpDevelop) if you don&#39;t wan&#39;t to pay for Microsoft&#39;s \nIDE. It&#39;s certainly worth a look anyhow if you haven&#39;t already.\n\nCheers,\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
