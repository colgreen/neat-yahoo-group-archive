My implementation will cope with both a fixed and dynamic\ncompatability threshold so I can control the number of species to a\ncertain degree. \n\nI find that with a fixed CT, the number of species decline eventually\nto just a few, after intially having many (tens/hundreds).\n\nThoughts, opinoins etc very much welcomed.\n\nCheers\n\nMatt\n\n\n\n"}}
