We now invite you to try the next level in\ngame-based benchmarking: the General Video Game Playing Competition.\n\nYou participate in the competition by submitting a controller that can\nplay not just a single game, but any game that adheres to certain\nstandards. Submitted will be tested on a battery of unseen games,\nwhich they cannot have been optimised for; therefore, this competition\nwill test general-purpose video game playing skill rather than tweaks\nand tricks for  a single game. The competition is built around a\nframework that can play any game encoded in the Video Game Description\nLanguage. The software package includes 10 games, mostly\nreimplementations of classic 2D arcade games, that you can train your\ncontroller on.\n\nLearn more about the competition and what you need to do to get\nstarted with your own agent here:\nhttp://gvgai.net/\n\nThe competition will run at the IEEE CIG conference for the first time\nthis year, and we anticipate that the competition will keep running\nand developing for several years.\n\nWe hope you will be interested in participating!\n\nJulian, on behalf of the GVG AI team: Diego, Spyros, Julian, Tom and Simon\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssociate Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark\nmail: julian@..., web: http://julian.togelius.com\nmobile: +46-705-192088, office: +45-7218-5277\n\n"}}
