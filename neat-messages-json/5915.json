I think the best thing, is for me to zip up what I have and send it to=\r\n you - but it may take a few days until I get time.  I will also look at up=\r\ndating svn (if I can remember how) so that the community can use it too.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Feel free to email me &#39;mattsimm69&#39; and I use google as my mail provider =\r\n- sure you can work it out :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;roncking2001&quot; &lt;roncking@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Group,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;v=\r\ne discovered the HyperNeat capable version of Neat4J on sourceforge, in the=\r\n svn repository. All of the HyperNeat related enhancements are hard for me =\r\nto understand how to use. There&#39;s two partially complete examples, Chess, a=\r\nnd FTSE, but there&#39;s no config file for them. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Has anyone used thi=\r\ns version, and can give me an example of how to use the hyperneat features?=\r\n I want to do vision type experiments with it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Ron\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
