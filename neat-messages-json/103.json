I&#39;ve had some\ninteresting discussions with Ken about this, but I\nthought I&#39;d open it up to the group as well, and see\nif anyone had any thoughts on it.\n\nI really like some of the work Sean Luke has done:\n\nhttp://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/papers/\n\nHis and Liviu Panait&#39;s paper &quot;A Comparison of Two\nCompetitive Fitness Functions&quot; really got me thinking\nabout the best way to evaluate the fitness of\ncompeting individuals.\n\nHe compares different approaches to pairing which\nindividuals compete directly with which, in various\ndomains.\n\nThere&#39;s the K-Random Opponents approach, in which each\nindividual plays a random number of other individuals\nin the population (e.g. In a population of 100\nindividuals, each individual might play 5 random\nopponents, then all individuals&#39; fitnesses are ranked\nbased on their performance).  The extremes of this\ngeneral approach are Round Robin, in which each\nindividual plays every other individual in the\npopulation, and Random Pairing, in which each\nindividual only plays one other random individual per\ngeneration.\n\nThey compared this approach to a Single-Elimination\nTournament approach, and found that SET performs\nreasonably well by comparison, depending on the\nnoisiness of the domain.\n\nUnfortunately, they only delve into the dynamics of\none-population competitive coevolution.  I was hoping\nto find many more permutations on various competitive\ncoevolutionary strategies, but I haven&#39;t seen too\nmany.\n\nRosin and Belew have done some interesting work as\nwell, but I&#39;ve griped to Ken about their conceptual\napproach.\n\nThey employ two-population competitive coevolution,\nbut each generation, the two populations take turns\nbeing designated the &quot;host population&quot; and the\n&quot;parasite population&quot;, even though logically they&#39;re\ncompeting within the same domain (which biological\nhosts and parasites are not).\n\nIt seems to me that the distinction between\ninterspecies (foxes and rabbits) competition and\nintraspecies competition (rabbits and other rabbits)\nis a crucial one.  The mathematical dynamics are\ncompletely different, aren&#39;t they?  \n\nEven at the most basic level, if F is the number of\nindividuals in the fox population and R is the number\nof individuals in the rabbit population, then if R=0,\nF will eventually dwindle to 0.  That is, a population\nof rabbits can survive without foxes, but not vice\nversa.  However, when you&#39;re talking about two\npopulations of rabbits, the existence of one isn&#39;t\ncontingent on the existence of the other.  In fact, if\neither population is eradicated, most likely the other\nwill flourish.\n\nBasically, I believe there&#39;s a fundamental difference\nin populations competing for the same resource, and in\nsituations where one of the populations *is* the\nresource for the other.\n\nBut it&#39;s not just a matter of semantics.  I think\nthere are underlying inefficiencies in the way Rosin\nand Belew evaluate individuals each generation (i.e.,\nan individual&#39;s fitness as a &quot;parasite&quot; is never\nevaluated).\n\nAnyway, Rosin and Belew&#39;s research has inspired me to\nthink a lot about this subject as well, and as I&#39;ve\nsaid, Ken and I have hashed some of this stuff out\ntoo. :)\n\nBut I was wondering if anyone else had directly worked\nwith competitive coevolutionary paradigms or had any\nthoughts about constructive approaches to the problem.\n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
