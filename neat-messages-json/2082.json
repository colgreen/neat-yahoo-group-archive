I am writing my Master Thesis with my\n&gt; good friend =\r\nMathias who is also a student here ;-). As you probably\n&gt; already noticed t=\r\nhis thesis is about poker (Texas Hold&#39;em) and GAs.\n\nHi Lars...welcome to th=\r\ne group. :)  Yes, we are very interested in\napplying neuroevolution to Poke=\r\nr in general and Texas Hold &#39;Em in\nparticular.  It&#39;s nice to hear you&#39;re wo=\r\nrking on this problem, and\nthat you&#39;re already familiar with the work of th=\r\ne Alberta group.\n \n&gt; We just recently discovered NEAT (sadly :-() \n\n\nWhen i=\r\ns your thesis due? ;)\n\nBefore I comment on the rest of your mail, I have a =\r\nfew questions:\n\n1) You don&#39;t say how well your evolved networks perform...h=\r\now are you\nevaluating the performance of your resulting networks?  Are you\n=\r\nplaying them on the Poki server?\n\n2) Is the domain limit/pot limit/no limit=\r\n?  Maybe you mentioned this\nand I missed it, but it&#39;s a pretty big deal.  I=\r\n think it would be much\nmore difficult to gauge fitness as the amount to be=\r\n able to bet in a\nsingle turn increases.  Limit is probably the least noisy=\r\n of the three\nvariations.\n\n3) Do your networks use recurrent connections?\n\n=\r\n4) So do your networks always play 10 opponents?  If players are\neliminated=\r\n at a table (they run out of money), do the networks play\n9-way hands?  Do =\r\nthe winners eventually play heads up?\n\n&gt; and yesterday we finished\n&gt; a new =\r\nplayer based on jNEAT. The player ANN takes the following\n&gt; inputs:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 =\r\npot / bet\n\nThis seems fine.\n\n&gt; 1 position\n\nIs this relative or absolute?  I=\r\nf this input is just an integer value\nbetween 0 and 9 that may not be as us=\r\neful as knowing it&#39;s distance to\nthe button each hand.\n\n&gt; 9 player actions =\r\nthis round\n\nSo all the actions are taken and then input to the network on i=\r\nts turn?  \n\n&gt; 9 player passive / aggressive index\n&gt; 9 player tight / loose =\r\nindex\n\nHow are you getting these values?  Are you using other networks for\n=\r\nopponent modeling, as Billings et al are doing?\n\n&gt; 2 suit count (4 or 5 siu=\r\nted cards)\n&gt; 2 connector count (4 or 5 connected cards)\n&gt; 4 card associatio=\r\nns (pair, two pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind)\n\nWell, the problem I =\r\nsee with this representation right off the bat is\nthat there is no informat=\r\nion about the order/strength of the cards,\nunless I&#39;m not understanding.\n\nW=\r\nould the network receive the same input for a pair of jacks as for a\npair o=\r\nf 2&#39;s?  If so, the representation is seriously flawed.\n\nAlso, connectivity =\r\nis important, but again rank is also important. \nA/2/3/4 is much worse than=\r\n 8/9/10/J not only because it&#39;s lower but\nbecause the latter is open-ended =\r\n(a straight can be made with a 7 or\nQ, while for the first one a straight c=\r\nan only be made with a 5).\n\nPhilip and I have talked over the representatio=\r\nn of Hold Em a bit.  I\ndon&#39;t have any easy answers, but I do think you need=\r\n at least one\ninput for the strength of your best combination.  So an input=\r\n for\npairs might tell the network it has a pair, and another input would\nsc=\r\nale between 0 and 1 to indicate the strength (and you might want to\nskew th=\r\nis toward higher pairs).\n\n&gt; 2 hole cards in use ( are we using 1 or 2 hole =\r\ncards in our hand?)\n&gt; 3 game stage (FLOP/TURN/RIVER)\n\nThese seem all right,=\r\n though possibly superflous.  Others may have thoughts.\n\n&gt; The outputs from=\r\n the ANN are straight forward:\n&gt; 3 neurons:\n&gt; FOLD | CALL | BET/RAISE\n\nYep.=\r\n..sounds good. \n\n&gt; The 50 players play against each other and a pot-odds-pl=\r\nayer\n&gt; (PO-player) - five of each at each table. They play 600 hands but no=\r\nt\n&gt; at one table only - we mix them between the tables five times such\n&gt; th=\r\nat they get to meet different individuals from the entire\n&gt; population.\n\nHo=\r\nw often do you switch them?  It often takes a while for someone to\nget a re=\r\nad on another player, and in this case they are playing full\ntables.  If th=\r\ne individual networks are having to assess the\ntightness/looseness aggressi=\r\nveness/passiveness of the players at their\ntable, this is a big burden on t=\r\nhe network, and if they are switching\nopponents every 10 hands or so, it is=\r\n even more difficult.\n\n&gt; The reason we have the PO-players at each table is=\r\n for the players to\n&gt; be forced to learn faster and play tighter from the v=\r\nery beginning.\n\nYes, this makes sense.  And personally I would not remove t=\r\nhis player\nfrom your evolutionary runs.  It makes sense to have a hand-code=\r\nd\nstandard in among the other players as a baseline.  It&#39;s performance\nacro=\r\nss generations should give you a decent idea of how your algorithm\nis progr=\r\nessing.\n\n&gt; A major concern is the fitness: We have talked about it for hour=\r\ns and\n&gt; days but we always come back to the cash of the player. If we canno=\r\nt\n&gt; apply expert knowledge - we cannot think of anything else than the\n&gt; am=\r\nount earned after x hands.\n\nWell, that is the standard of fitness for real =\r\nPoker players, isn&#39;t it? :)\n\nI would think this would make the most sense a=\r\ns the primary fitness\nvalue.  Another alternative would be to simply play a=\r\nn elimination\ntournament and then assign fitness based on the place each ne=\r\ntwork\nfinished.  It depends on whether you want to evolve networks geared\nm=\r\nore toward tournament play or come-and-go style Poker.\n\n&gt; 1) Is it possible=\r\n to achieve results with a 45-&gt;N-&gt;3 ANN in NEAT?\n\nI wouldn&#39;t see why not.  =\r\nHave you achieved any results?  I think you\ncould reduce your input space f=\r\nor opponent actions, especially since\nin cases where the network is playing=\r\n heads up, 24 of your inputs\naren&#39;t even going to be used each hand.\n\n&gt; 2) =\r\nAny general comments regarding the population size for the above\n&gt; ANN?\n\nI =\r\nwould think the general consensus would be that large populations\nare bette=\r\nr for difficult problems, and in the case of NEAT tolerate\nhigher mutation =\r\nrates and more diversity.  But it kind of depends on\nyour computational res=\r\nources, doesn&#39;t it?  How long does a run with\n600 individuals take?\n\nAlso, =\r\nyou mention Fogel and his evolved Checkers player.  Those runs\nonly had a p=\r\nopulation of 30.\n\n&gt; 3) Any parameters we should put in a particular favoura=\r\nble setting?\n\nParameters like mutation rates and speciation variables seem =\r\npretty\nidiosyncratic to me.  Again, if it&#39;s a large population, it&#39;s more\nt=\r\nolerant to higher mutation rates and greater speciation, but I do\nthink the=\r\nre&#39;s a certain amount of hand tuning of these parameters that\nyou just can&#39;=\r\nt get around.\n\nAnyway, it&#39;s nice to hear someone working on this.  We&#39;re de=\r\nfinitely\ninterested in hearing more.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
