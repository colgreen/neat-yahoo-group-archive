If the parents are of equal fitness then matching \ngenes \n&gt; are selected from randomly (50% chance of getting gene from either \n&gt; parent), and ALL of the excess and disjoint genes from both \nparents are \n&gt; included.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now I&#39;m trying to sort this out by going back to Ken&#39;s NEAT \npapers \n&gt; for an explanation on the crossover technique, but I&#39;m having \n&gt; difficulty. From &quot;Competitive Coevolution through Evolutionary \n&gt; Complexification&quot;, section 3.2, paragraph 4:\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------\n&gt; &quot;Through innovation numbers, the system now knows exactly which \ngenes \n&gt; match up with which (Figure 4). Genes that do not match are either \n&gt; /disjoint/ or /excess/, depending on whether they occur within or \n&gt; outside the range of the other parent&#39;s innovation numbers. When \n&gt; crossing over, the genes with the same innovation numbers are \nlined up \n&gt; and are randomly chosen for the offspring genome. Genes that do \nnot \n&gt; match are inherited from the more fit parent, or if they are \nequally \n&gt; fit, from both parents randomly. Disabled genes have a 25% chance \nof \n&gt; being reenabled during crossover, allowing networks to make use of \nolder \n&gt; genes once again.&quot;\n&gt; -----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;m doing a couple of things wrong:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) When genes match I take the gene from the fittest parent. \nWhereas I \n&gt; should be randomly selecting from both parents. Right? Currently I \nonly \n&gt; to this if both parent are equally fit.\n&gt; 2) I am always including *all* excess and disjoint genes from the \nleast \n&gt; fit parent.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nRight on #1: You should be taking the matching genes from both \nparents, selecting at random.\n\nOn #2, it is true that I didn&#39;t take *any* of the excess or disjoint \ngenes from the least fit parent.\n\n&gt; However I am not 100% sure how original NEAT works w.r.t this \nsecond \n&gt; point...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Genes that do not match are inherited from the more fit parent, \nor if \n&gt; they are equally fit, from both parents randomly.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So just to be clear on this, this is saying that excess and \ndisjoint \n&gt; genes from the least fit parent are not used, right? and if both \nparents \n&gt; are equal, should I take all of the excess and disjoint genes from \nboth \n&gt; parents or just some percentage of them? I think the \nterm &#39;randomly&#39; in\n\nYes this is correct: When they are equally fit you use all the \nexcess and disjoint genes in the offspring.\n \n&gt; this senetence is confusing me, does it mean that I should only be \n&gt; selecting a sub-set of the excess and disjoint genes from both \nparents, \n&gt; or is it merely alluding to the fact that the excess and disjoint \ngenes \n&gt; are distributed acrosss the two parents, and that therefore we are \n&gt; selecting them from whichever parent they happen to be on, but \nit&#39;s not \n&gt; actually a random selection as such.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Something about this doesn&#39;t seem right to me. It means that the \n&gt; crossover almost always only combines weight values, not \ntopolgies. e.g. \n&gt; in my OCR experiment, if two different genomes have each \ndiscovered a \n&gt; distinct beneficial input-output connection then the only way we \ncan \n&gt; combine the two genomes to get the benefit of both connections is \nif \n&gt; they happen to have the same fitness, right?\n&gt; \n\nYes right, there is a potential missed opportunity.\n\n&gt; If this is the case then I would have thought it would be better \nto use \n&gt; excess and disjoint genes from the least fit parent more often, \nlike \n&gt; when the parent are unequal.\n&gt; \n\nI agree, actually.  You really don&#39;t want to overemphasize the \nparticulars of my implementation.  It was done that way primarily to \navoid the possibility of bloat.  And it does reduce bloat somewhat, \nbut at the expense of what you say: you lose opportunities to \ncombine disjoint structures.  I don&#39;t want people to feel compelled \nto follow my exact implementation decisions, since I think these \npossibilities and trade-offs certainly deserve to be explored.  \nObviously being the first to make such a system, I had to make a \nlarge number of specific implementation decisions with no precedent \nwhatsoever, so it&#39;s not surprising in retrospect if a few could be \ndone better or differently.   So absolutely feel free to follow your \ngut instinct about what would work best.\n\nken\n\n\n\n"}}
