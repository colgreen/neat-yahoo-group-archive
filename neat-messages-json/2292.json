And I&#39;m wondering \nexactly how to approach it.\n\n\tLet me summarize NEAT-style speciation, then it will be easier to point \nout where my situation diverges.\n\n--\n\nSpecies are each defined by an exemplar.  This is an individual chosen for \nuse in comparisons.  Any individual within some threshold similarity to the \nexemplar is potentially member of the species.\n\nIndividuals are assigned to the first species that they match and remain in \nthe species.  Some implementations allow for periodic regeneration of species.\n\nBecause traditional NEAT is generational, exemplars are drawn from the \nprevious generation (is this right, I think the original paper is vague on \nthis and I know it because it was discussed here previously, but I forget \nthe details).  Each exemplar is one random (fittest?) member drawn from \neach species in the previous generation.\n\nAny new individual that fits no species becomes the exemplar (and \npresumably first member) of a new species.\n\nAny exemplar that matches no individuals from the new generation represents \na species going extinct.\n\nThe purpose of speciation is to assign offspring between groups of \nindividuals in a manner other than their simple proportion in the \npopulation.  Offspring are assigned to species based on the &quot;adjusted \nfitness&quot; which is the maximum fitness seen in the species, divided by the \nnumber of members it has.  Offspring are assigned to each species according \nto the proportions of their adjusted finesses (in chemical/physical speak, \nit&#39;s a partition function).\n\n--\n\n\tOK, now where I differ is my system is continuous, I create one new \nindividual at a time, present it to the population, and somebody dies as a \nresult.\n\n\tNow no part of the standard evolution scheme is incompatible with this, I \ncan pick individuals from species probabilistically, according to the \nadjusted fitness of the species.  I can introduce individuals one at a time \nand assign then to species.  I can spawn new species when an individual is \ntoo different from any existing species...\n\n\tBut the one question that is not answered is: Who dies?\n\n\tAt present I kill the least-fit member of the population.  But what is \nsuited when their are species.  I see three plans:\n\n1) kill the population loser\n2) kill the species loser in the species getting the offspring\n3) kill the species loser in a random species\n4) (FOUR plans, I said FOUR) kill a completely random individual\n\n\tWhat do people think?  Ken, I&#39;m particularly interested in your take on \nthis because you must have just done something similar for NERO...?\n\n\tIan\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
