The\nresults were apparently mixed, with some seeming to work and so=\r\nme not\nworking at all.  However, she had not required the students to\nimple=\r\nment speciation because of time constraints in the semester, so\nthese were =\r\nNEAT implementations without species.  Based on that fact\nthat some seemed =\r\nto work okay anyway, I&#39;d guess that with a full\nimplementation of NEAT, it =\r\nmight work pretty well.\n\nOf course, there are some new issues that come up.=\r\n  For example, each\nnode has a different identity.  Also, maybe more intere=\r\nsting, it is\nnot clear what topology should begin evolution in the initial\n=\r\npopulation (or if perhaps the initial population should contain a\nvariety o=\r\nf simple topologies).\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lancersolurus&quot; &lt;g=\r\naming@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I uploaded a version of Mat&#39;s NEAT program that will =\r\ncompile under \n&gt; Visual Studio 2005. All I did was fix in-loop variable cre=\r\nations (a no-\n&gt; no from 2005 onward) and adjust some of the internal settin=\r\ngs. Enjoy...\n&gt; \n&gt; A question, has anyone attempted to mix NEAT with a FSM?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Lancer Solurus\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
