I&#39;d be\ninterested in se=\r\neing how well it works. \n\nOne issue may be that some individuals simply nev=\r\ner encounter the\nsituations that others do.  Therefore, some of the behavio=\r\nr\ncharacterization will be blank.  How do you think such blank areas can\nbe=\r\n rectified when comparing two individuals?  For example, perhaps you\ntook a=\r\n right turn when you could, but I never encountered an\nopportunity to turn =\r\nright.  Do we consider this behavior different? \n(I am assuming we would ju=\r\nst ignore that dimension of behavior, but\nperhaps you have another idea)  I=\r\nn general, I like your idea and think\nit should be an effective general app=\r\nroach.\n\nIt may also be possible to characterize behavior in more general\nte=\r\nrms.  Even though evaluation is inherently noisy, it is possible\nthat a gen=\r\neral characterization may filter out much noise.  For\nexample, perhaps some=\r\nthing like counting how many door an individual\nenters or how much food it =\r\neats could give a general sense of its\npersonality even though it would var=\r\ny slightly in any given lifetime.\n\nThese are important issues if NS is to b=\r\ne used directly in an\ninteractive/coevolutionary world, so it&#39;s good to thi=\r\nnk about them.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar=\r\n_chervenski@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all, \n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking of how to characte=\r\nrize behavior of an agent in a \n&gt; complex dynamic world. As you all know, t=\r\nhe 2D maze world in the \n&gt; demos is a static one. It doesn&#39;t interact with =\r\nthe agent. Thus it is \n&gt; possible for Novelty Search to exploit the static =\r\nenvironment and \n&gt; develop behaviors that are not successful or meaningful =\r\non even \n&gt; slightly different maze configurations. I don&#39;t say that NS does=\r\nn&#39;t \n&gt; find general solutions able to navigate most mazes. I mean that &quot;bor=\r\nn \n&gt; to solve only this particular maze&quot; solutions appear often. \n&gt; \n&gt; Furt=\r\nher, what if I add more agents, in a realtime interavtive \n&gt; environment li=\r\nke the one in NERO? While trying to generalize \n&gt; everything I see in terms=\r\n of behavior characterization, it was \n&gt; difficult to just say &quot;the agent d=\r\noes this!&quot; and use it as BC. It is \n&gt; because the real world environment is=\r\n not static, it interacts with \n&gt; the agent, so it becomes something like n=\r\noisy evaluation when I try \n&gt; to evolve one. The same individual could appe=\r\nar more and less novel \n&gt; every time. \n&gt; \n&gt; So one day, I was observing my =\r\ndog.. Let&#39;s think of my dog as a \n&gt; complex biological agent in a real worl=\r\nd interactive environment.. If \n&gt; you try to make a summary of its behavior=\r\n, how can you do it? One may \n&gt; suggest to put the dog in various situation=\r\ns and observe its \n&gt; reactions, finally collecting a summary of what it doe=\r\ns in those \n&gt; situations. While this seems like the solution, it is not. Be=\r\ncause in \n&gt; order to compare different dogs, you will have to put all of th=\r\nem \n&gt; through the same tests in order to avoid the noisy evaluation. And \n&gt;=\r\n this brings us to a static environment again, because we know what \n&gt; exac=\r\ntly is going to happen to all agents, in order to see their \n&gt; reactions. W=\r\nhile realizing that, I arrived on a better idea that I am \n&gt; going to talk =\r\nabout now. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a complex interactive world, a little is known what exa=\r\nctly can \n&gt; happen to an agent. Further, the agent has a limited set of act=\r\nions \n&gt; that it can take. A behavior characterization taking into account t=\r\nhe \n&gt; actions only is not enough, because it is not known what happened to =\r\n\n&gt; the agent before that action. So one solution I came up with is this \n&gt; =\r\none. You have a list of all possible and/or performed actions for the \n&gt; BC=\r\n. For each action, a summary or a more detailed list of situations \n&gt; must =\r\nexist. So basically let&#39;s say that we have a simple robot that \n&gt; can go fo=\r\nrward, fire a rocket and turn left/right. With rangefinger \n&gt; sensors or wh=\r\natever. Instead of tracking only *what* it did during \n&gt; its lifetime, the =\r\nsystem now has to track also in what circumstances \n&gt; the particular action=\r\n took place, and add that to the summary of \n&gt; behavior. This can be the in=\r\nputs at that particular timestep, for \n&gt; example. Or the relative positions=\r\n of other agents that it may \n&gt; interact with. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does it make sense? Su=\r\nppose you try to characterize a driver in a \n&gt; city traffic conditions. Any=\r\nthing can happen. But if you also track \n&gt; what the driver *sees* in the pa=\r\nrticular moments when he acts, in \n&gt; addition to what actions he takes, it =\r\nis a lot easier to distinguish \n&gt; between different driving behaviors.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I will be happy to hear your thoughts about this. Perhaps it is \n&gt; nothing=\r\n new, but I didn&#39;t see any discussion about it. Though it is \n&gt; an importan=\r\nt issue about how to use Novelty Search for multi-agent, \n&gt; coevolutionary,=\r\n and some real-world applicatons. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
