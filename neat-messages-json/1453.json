Have you \n&gt;considered getting a Ph.D? :P  Seriously, that is good research \n&gt;getting to the bottom of these questions.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAhh shucks, well it&#39;s very kind of you to say so. Yeh I have toyed with \nthe idea of going back to university, I guess I&#39;d need to do an MSc or \nsomething before a Phd - and it just so happens there is a decent course \npractically on my doorstep at Birmingham. Perhaps I&#39;ll look into it a \nbit further, check out the implications, etc. Trouble is you see the IT \njob market is pretty buoyant in the UK so there&#39;s [potentially] quite a \nfew opportunities there also. hmm.\n\n&gt;I think your proposed changes to SharpNEAT make good sense.  I also \n&gt;do not kill off the top species, so I came to the same conclusion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, and you still get to search through varied topologies because of \nspeciation. It&#39;s just that in a worse case scenario a large proportion \nof the population (the best species) could be stuck in a local optima \nuntil one of the other species finds a better solution.\n\n&gt;But the idea of only adding a % of excess and disjoint genes I am \n&gt;unsure about.  If a complex of genes has formed that are all \n&gt;interdependent, that could be a bad move.  Maybe safer would be to \n&gt;just make adding *all* the excess and disjoint genes probabilistic.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nGood point.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, the real question of how to do it can only be \n&gt;addressed through comparisons of the types you&#39;ve been doing, i.e. \n&gt;runs with one method vs. runs with another.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI suspect results will vary depending on the problem domain. e.g. the \nsimple-ocr domain will probably benefit from inheriting single \nconnections because it doesn&#39;t require any complex arrangement of \nconnections, quite often a single connection between a pixel input and \nan output has an immediate beneficial effect, later additions of more \nsingle connections can then refine the solution further.\n\nBut simple-ocr is probably un-characteristically simple in that respect, \nso as a hunch I would expect your suggestion of &quot;all or nothing&quot; \ninheritance to be the better technique in general.\n\n&gt;It seems though that the most important conclusion so far is that \n&gt;phasing is a very good idea.  But it would be good to get more \n&gt;results backing that up so we can be confident about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh, I&#39;ll be going back over some of the other problem domains already \nimplemented in SharpNEAT to see if the positive results seen so far can \nbe duplicated.\n\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
