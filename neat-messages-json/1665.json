I read it really fast just to \nget the main idea, so it&#39;s possible I missed this, but I didn&#39;t see \nany explanation of what S2, S3, C2, C3, and T2, and T3 were?  Also, \nit would be beneficial to have some discussion of cases (such as S3, \nI believe) where the match % was bad.  What did those shapes or \norientations look like and why did it fail on them?\n\nAnyway, I think it&#39;s really good work and a great start for this \nkind of research.  It&#39;s interesting that you don&#39;t need all the \npossible transformations to be able to succeed.  Of course, they may \nstill offer advantages for more complex images.\n\nI wonder how good these would be at finding a particular shape in a \ncrowded picture of shapes.  The ones you described that search by \njust going to one corner sound like they wouldn&#39;t be that good at a \ngeneral &quot;find the shape&quot; task, but maybe if the task was explicitly \nto search they would evolve scanning strategies?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Derek James &lt;djames@g...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; A draft of our (Derek and Philip) paper &quot;Evolving a Neural Network\n&gt; Active Vision System for Object Recognition&quot; has been uploaded in \nthe\n&gt; Files section of the group (it&#39;s called\n&gt; &quot;james_patternrec_04_draft.pdf&quot;).
