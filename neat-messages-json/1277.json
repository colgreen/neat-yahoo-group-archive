Then he studied the degrading behaviour of\n&gt; the net as its weights \n&gt; were damaged in some way (zeroed or randomised...?)\n&gt; \n&gt; \tTo his surprise, some of the outputs from the\n&gt; &quot;dying&quot; network were good \n&gt; phases representing &quot;improvisation&quot; on the training\n&gt; set.  But only some of \n&gt; them.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tSo his general approach is to take the output from\n&gt; a damaged network and \n&gt; feed it through another (healthy) network.  The\n&gt; damaged section produces \n&gt; variations on the basic data, and the healthy\n&gt; section screens them for quality.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tObviously this is very vague, I&#39;ll try to find the\n&gt; original article, but \n&gt; since he&#39;s exploiting it commercially, the details\n&gt; there are not complete \n&gt; either...\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI don&#39;t think he uses a TWEANN approach, just the\n&gt; weights...\n&gt; \n&gt; \tIan Badcoe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Living@Home - Open Source Evolving Organisms - \n&gt; http://livingathome.sourceforge.net/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
