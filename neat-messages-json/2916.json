So unless the \ncycling happened extreme=\r\nly fast, evolution would not appear real-time.\n\nHowever, there are recent e=\r\nvolutionary selection methods that are \nbased on reinforcement learning tha=\r\nt perhaps could be complementary \nwith rtNEAT even if it was running on onl=\r\ny one body at a time.  For \nexample:\n\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shimon/pubs=\r\n/whitesonjmlr06.pdf\n\nThis paper covers several topics, but the relevant one=\r\n is &quot;online \nevolutionary computation,&quot; which uses a reinforcement-learning=\r\n \nstrategy to decide who should be in control of the single body at any \non=\r\ne time.  This technique combined with rtNEAT could perhaps yield \nreal-time=\r\n learning off a single individual body.\n\nStill, it is a general rule that t=\r\nhe less time individuals spend on \nthe field, the less fast evolution can p=\r\nrogress.\n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Richard Gong&quot; &lt;gongrichard@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was reading about rtNEAT, and I noticed that it needs multi=\r\nple \nagents to be tested simultaneously. What if it&#39;s a two player game, \nl=\r\nike computer against human? Can rtNEAT be applied there? I&#39;m thinking \nit&#39;d=\r\n be really slow, since each genome would have to be tested out one \nat a ti=\r\nme against the human, before you can get a score.\n&gt; \n&gt; Richard\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
