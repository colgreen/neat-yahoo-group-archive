This is something NaturalMotion uses. \nThey are basically models of damped torsional springs.\n They simply continuously add torques to a joint to\nmaintain a desired angle and can be used effectively\non controlled and uncontrolled joints.  \n\nI&#39;m using something like this in my project.  Open\nDynamics Engine has joints with &quot;motor&quot; parameters;\neach joint can have a desired velocity and max torque.\n I use the current joint angle and desired joint angle\n(output from neural net) to compute the desired\nvelocity at the controlled joints.  The uncontrolled\njoints simply try maintain their initial angle.\n\nTyler\n\n--- Mitchell Timin &lt;zenguyuno@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; In a similar vein, I noticed that the physical model\n&gt; is not accurate, because the final &quot;good&quot; walker has\n&gt; it&#39;s feet well to the right & left of the center of\n&gt; gravity, and yet there is no side-to-side wobble. \n&gt; Furthermore the motion of each leg appears to be\n&gt; planar.  Two legs each doing planar motion in\n&gt; different planes will not be stable in the real\n&gt; world;\n&gt; it will wobble from side to side with increasing\n&gt; amplitude.  I think the demo is &quot;rigged&quot;.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
