I see the distinction \nnow.  \n=\r\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I see what you&#39;re saying- no one thought to really explore the\n&gt; &gt;  int=\r\neraction of the two different time scales.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apparently... I&#39;d really li=\r\nke to know if the stuff is out there\n&gt; somewhere. It would be embarrassing =\r\nto go and publish more papers \non\n&gt; algorithms based on this idea if it tur=\r\nns out to already have been\n&gt; done.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  But don&#39;t most of the older TWE=\r\nANN neuroevolution algorithms \nhave a\n&gt; &gt;  different topological mutation r=\r\nate from the weight mutation \nrate? In\n&gt; &gt;  other words, while they do not =\r\nexplicitly enact two different \ntime\n&gt; &gt;  scales (as you thought to do), is=\r\n not the effect the same \nimplicitly?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I&#39;m not certain about this i=\r\nssue because I don&#39;t remember \nprecisely\n&gt; &gt;  how people set their relative=\r\n mutation rates for different \ntypes of\n&gt; &gt;  changes in various systems, bu=\r\nt I would guess that most have \nweights\n&gt; &gt;  changing more often than topol=\r\nogies. At least that is how NEAT \nwas\n&gt; &gt;  originally set up, and it seemed=\r\n to straightforward thing to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Or do you feel that perhaps havin=\r\ng different mutation rates is \nnot\n&gt; &gt;  really the same as having explicitl=\r\ny differing time scales that\n&gt; &gt;  separate periods of weight an topology se=\r\narch?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. It&#39;s not the same thing at all. In the algorithms you menti=\r\non,\n&gt; even if the topology mutation rate is set very low, the problem is\n&gt; =\r\nthat each new topology is evaluated immediately, before a good set \nof\n&gt; we=\r\nights has been found. As topology mutations are typically very\n&gt; disruptive=\r\n, this makes it hard for a new topology to survive. The\n&gt; reason these algo=\r\nrithms work at all is probably that they are\n&gt; population-based and have a =\r\nrather low selection pressure. If you \njust\n&gt; perform topology and weight m=\r\nutations in a hill climber, and \nevaluate\n&gt; the fitness of the network afte=\r\nr each topology mutation, the hill\n&gt; climber will not work at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n memetic climber evaluates the fitness of a new topology only \nafter\n&gt; some=\r\n local search to find better weights for the new topology. This\n&gt; way, far =\r\nmore new topologies can be accepted. So the real \ndifference\n&gt; to the algor=\r\nithms you mention is not the proportion of weight or\n&gt; topology mutations, =\r\nbut that they essentially treat both types of\n&gt; mutations the same way, ins=\r\ntead of interleaving local with global\n&gt; search.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I understand it, y=\r\nou solve the problem with topology mutations \nin\n&gt; two ways in NEAT (if I r=\r\nemember the details right, was a while \nsince I\n&gt; read the NEAT paper last =\r\ntime). The most important method is\n&gt; innovation protection, where you allo=\r\nw a new topology to live on \nfor a\n&gt; while even if it is initially substand=\r\nard. Innovation protection \nis a\n&gt; very similar idea to the memetic climber=\r\n, and is the most important\n&gt; prior work I&#39;ve been able to find (and is of =\r\ncourse cited as such \nin\n&gt; the paper). The other method is that you design =\r\nyour topology\n&gt; mutations to be as non-disruptive as possible, as is the ca=\r\nse with\n&gt; link splitting. Obviously, this works really well; what I&#39;m tryin=\r\ng \nto\n&gt; do is isolate a core mechanism and understand it properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n more I try to explain this, the clearer it is that I lack the\n&gt; proper ter=\r\nminology...\n&gt; \n&gt; Julian\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  ken\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  --- In neat@...=\r\nm, &quot;Julian Togelius&quot; &lt;julian@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I think that some=\r\n people did see themselves as taking the \nnext step\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; when neuroevol=\r\ntuion algorithms started proliferating in the \n90s.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I think a lot =\r\nof those early algorithms were motivated by \npeople who\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; saw themse=\r\nlves as cutting backprop completely out of the \nloop. You\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; know, if=\r\n you look back at some of the papers on \nneuroevolution at\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; that ti=\r\nme, some would evolve topology and combine it with \nbackprop,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; and =\r\nsome would simply evolve everything (weights and \ntopology, which\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; =\r\nare sometimes called TWEANNs for topology and weight \nevolving\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; art=\r\nificial neural networks). Probably some of those people \nevolving\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; =\r\nTWEANNs saw themselves as taking the next step you \ndescribe. (Xin\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yao&#39;s 1999 review covers a lot of those methods from that \ntime)\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; The difference is that no one did it with a population of \none, bu=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; that probably just did not occur to them because as soon as \nyou=\r\n go\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; to a non-gradient type of problem (like evolving topologies)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; populations seem natural at first thought. Of course what \nyou&#39;ve\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  &gt; &gt; shown is that you can make it work at least in some cases \nwithout =\r\na\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; population.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Actually, the big difference is that w=\r\ne&#39;re doing it at \ndifferent\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; timescales. This is really the whole rea=\r\nson it works.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; The simplest extension is to mutate both topolo=\r\ngy and weights \nat the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; same timescale, either in the very same mutat=\r\nion or in \ndifferent\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; mutation types (say, half of the time it mutate=\r\ns topology and \nhalf of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; the it mutates weights). The algorithm we ca=\r\nll &quot;simultaneous \nclimber&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; in the paper does just that: it applies b=\r\noth topology and \nweight\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; mutation at the same time. It doesn&#39;t work =\r\nat all - in fact \nit&#39;s much\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; worse than a simple hillclimber that onl=\r\ny searches weight \nspace. The\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; reason is that topology mutations are =\r\ndestructive, and needs \nto be\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; offset with local weight search to exp=\r\nlore the potential of \nthe\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; topology, otherwise no topology mutations=\r\n would survive.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Tino and me have been trying to work our way =\r\nthrough the \nreferences in\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Yao&#39;s paper, but many of the early TWEANN=\r\n papers are very \nhard to get\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; hold of (Journal of Parallel Computing=\r\n from 1990 etc.). What \nwe&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; found are examples of either evolving =\r\ntopologies and using \nbackprop to\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; set the weights, or evolving topol=\r\nogies and weights at the \nsame time\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; (i.e. topology and weights are t=\r\nreated the same way, and \ntopology\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; changes are not followed by any k=\r\nind of weight search before \nthe new\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; topology is evaluated). So what=\r\n puzzles me is why people have \nnot\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; simply tried replacing backprop =\r\nwith evolution, while keeping \nthe idea\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; that topology changes are ev=\r\naluated only after a period of \nweight\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; search.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Either =\r\nthis has been done in one of these papers we haven&#39;t \nfound or\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; gotte=\r\nn hold of yet, or the idea wasn&#39;t so obvious after all...\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Jul=\r\nian\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; --\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  &gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; IDSIA\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Galleria 2\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; 6928 Manno-Lugan=\r\no\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Switzerland\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; julian@\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; http://julian.togelius.com\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  &gt; http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; +46-705-19=\r\n2088\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Julian Togelius\n&gt; IDSIA\n&gt; Galleria 2=\r\n\n&gt; 6928 Manno-Lugano\n&gt; Switzerland\n&gt; julian@...\n&gt; http://julian.togelius.co=\r\nm\n&gt; http://www.idsia.ch/~togelius\n&gt; +41-764-110679\n&gt; +46-705-192088\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
