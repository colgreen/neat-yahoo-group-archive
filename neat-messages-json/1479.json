So this network is trying to determine if\n&gt; something is an A?  \n\nYeah.  The network basically has five outputs, four which control its\nmovement and a fifth for affinity.  The output for the affinity neuron\nbasically indicates its confidence that this is the letter it&#39;s been\nevolved to identify.  So when shown an &quot;A&quot; it should output a value\nclose to 1; when shown any other letter, such as a &quot;Y&quot;, it should\noutput values close to 0.\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a video like that.\n&gt; It&#39;s very interesting.  How complex is the network?\n\nSince the eye input resolution is 7x7, there are 49 input nodes for\nthe visual input.  We started as NEAT does, with no input nodes, fully\nconnected, so the initial topology has about 300 genes.  We used a\nblended approach with a bias toward pruning, so I believe this network\nis about 280 genes, with about 20 hidden nodes.\n\n&gt; Another thing I&#39;m wondering is if the fact that the eye always zooms\n&gt; into the upper left corner means it is basing its final decision\n&gt; only on the appearance of that small part of the letter?  That is,\n&gt; is memory (i.e. recurrent connections) important at all?  If you cut\n&gt; out the recurrent connections what would it do?\n\nWell, we can do a run where we disable recurrency.  Not having\nperformed these experiments, I&#39;d guess that it would function much the\nsame.  I don&#39;t think recurrency is doing much here.\n\nOne thing I failed to note, but should probabably be fairly\nclear...the left window of the movie shows a top-level view of the\nbehavior of the eye.  The line in the circle indicates the eye&#39;s\norientation, and it&#39;s actually upside down and fully zoomed out at\nstep 1.  The right window is what the eye is seeing as it moves\naround.  You can see that for an &quot;A&quot; it always zooms in on the upper\nportion and you see exactly the same pattern in that window by the end\nof its steps.\n\nSo we think that initially the eye is just identifying the upper left\nbound of whatever symbol is in its visual field, and as it zooms in it\ntries to identify the inverted V at the top of the &quot;A&quot;.    I think\nit&#39;s basing its affinity output based on whether or not it finds that\nsingle feature.\n\nWe&#39;re pretty happy with the results so far, but the behavior is pretty\nsimplistic.  If there were samples that varied in two areas of the\nimage, so that it needed to analyze two parts of the image to make a\ncorrect identification, this sort of behavior obviously wouldn&#39;t do.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
