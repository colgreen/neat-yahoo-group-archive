We probably did not\nleverage this capabil=\r\nity in this paper because we only have one\noutput, but if there were many o=\r\nutputs (as there are many inputs and\nhidden nodes) then it might save some =\r\ncomputation time.\n\nAnyway, like Jason said, this setup is based on an intui=\r\ntion about\nseparability, so I am suspecting that there are pros and cons to=\r\n both\nalternatives (i.e. using z vs. having 2 outputs) that are\ndomain-spec=\r\nific.  This paper does not constitute an exhaustive study\nof the issue.  Ho=\r\nwever, it does show that the multi-output approach,\nwhich is perhaps not th=\r\ne one that first comes to mind, can work.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Jason Gauci&quot; &lt;jgmath2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Stephen,\n&gt; \n&gt; Great questio=\r\nns!  We&#39;ll have to think about some of them for awhile\n&gt; but here&#39;s a few a=\r\nnswers:\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason why I chose to use a separate output for each conne=\r\nction\n&gt; layer instead of using a 3-dimensional CPPN is because I wanted to\n=\r\n&gt; separate the network for each layer.  If you use the 3-D CPPN method,\n&gt; t=\r\nhen the two layers are only distinguished by the values of &#39;z&#39;. \n&gt; Because =\r\nI&#39;m only using two layers, I wanted to make sure that each\n&gt; layer did some=\r\n unique processing.  If there was only one output, it\n&gt; would be harder for=\r\n the connection layers to distinguish themselves as\n&gt; they would be too dep=\r\nendent.  In the worst case, z1 and z2 inputs are\n&gt; not used and the two lay=\r\ners are exactly the same. I haven&#39;t done any\n&gt; empirical tests on which met=\r\nhod is better so I do not have any\n&gt; evidence to back my claim, but it&#39;s my=\r\n intuition.\n&gt; \n&gt; I haven&#39;t tried any computer opponents other than Xchecker=\r\ns.  I have\n&gt; had my friends and people in the lab play against the HyperNEA=\r\nT\n&gt; opponent and it is definitely better than all of us :-).  I would like\n=\r\n&gt; to release a binary version so people can play the opponents at\n&gt; differe=\r\nnt generations and see the change in performance.\n&gt; \n&gt; One active area of i=\r\nnterest is to figure out how good a HyperNEAT\n&gt; player is in a global sense=\r\n.  In Chellapilla & Fogel&#39;s paper, they\n&gt; played human opponents in checker=\r\ns on MSN Gaming Zone online and got\n&gt; an expert rating on that game server.=\r\n  The problem with this is that\n&gt; it is very time consuming to play games b=\r\ny hand. It would not be\n&gt; feasible for me to test several individuals in th=\r\nis way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have experimented with coevolution, but I need to solve the\n=\r\n&gt; aforementioned problem before I can say anything about the performance\n&gt; =\r\nof the evolved individuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Stephen Waits=\r\n &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Apr 11, 2008, at 9:38 PM, Kenneth Stanley =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jason Gauci and I are pleased to share with you new results wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNEAT  in our new paper to appear in the Twenty-Third AAAI\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2008), &quot;A Case Study on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Critical Role of Geometric Regularity in Machine Learning.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nCool, I enjoyed the paper, thanks Jason and Ken.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few ques=\r\ntions:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Was the 4in/2out CPPN arbitrarily chosen?\n&gt; &gt; * Why not a=\r\n 6in/1out (xyz, xyz, out) - which seems more natural to me?\n&gt; &gt; * Was more =\r\nthan one CPPN configuration tried?
