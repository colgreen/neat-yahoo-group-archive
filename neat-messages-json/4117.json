I am currently experime=\r\nnting with my NEVH project \ncombined with novelty search. It is actually a =\r\ntypical example of an \nindirect encoding combined with novelty search but t=\r\nhat didn&#39;t make \nit walk yet. It is a very ambitious goal, though. I just l=\r\nike to see \nthe ragdoll do new moves every time. Once I get something satis=\r\nfying \nenough (I am tweaking the behavior characterization/distance a lot) =\r\nI \nwill upload this too. \n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Sta=\r\nnley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Peter C, great upload!
