I love multi-agents and seeing your videos\nwas fun indeed. \n\n&gt; Mattias, you&#39;re pretty spot on with your characterization of method\n&gt; 1a.  Just to be clear though, the actual r(x) function tells the CPPN\n&gt; where it is within an agent, while it is the actual x value that\n&gt; allows for role differentiation. \n&gt;\n&gt; As for method 1b, I actually tired it while doing preliminary\n&gt; experiments for the paper.  The results were not quite as good as the\n&gt; r(x) method, which is why we chose to pursue r(x).  The reason for\n&gt; difference is that in the r(x) method, the x means both position\n&gt; within the team and position within the world.  HyperNEAT can exploit\n&gt; this by relating agent position in the team to agent position in the\n&gt; world.  For example agents on the left need to turn right to reach the\n&gt; center, and vice versa.  Using method 1b decouples the idea of team\n&gt; position and world position, so it is more difficult, but not\n&gt; impossible, for HyperNEAT to make these kind of discoveries.\n\nExcellent, that answers that question then. And your explanation makes sense.\n\n&gt; I am curious about method 2, it does seem a bit like &quot;naming&quot; the\n&gt; agents which has shown to be useful in multiagent scenarios.  It is a\n&gt; bit more than that as the names have real meanings and are not\n&gt; arbitrarily assigned.   I would imagine, for HyperNEAT at least, that\n&gt; it would be more difficult to find global patterns across agents with\n&gt; method 2, since the CPPN does not have access to that geometric\n&gt; information.\n\nI&#39;m pretty certain that HyperNEAT could use the information in method 2 to\nevolve networks that solve the problem, but I&#39;d guess it would be slower,\nbut without specific tests, it would be hard to know. \n\nThanks for your feedback,\nmattias\n\n\n"}}
