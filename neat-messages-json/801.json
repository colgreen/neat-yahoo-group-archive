This week\nthere \n&gt; are a few nice performance improvements and additional\nconfigurability \n&gt; in the GUI. I have also made the decision to start releasing under\nthe \n&gt; GPL/LGPL. See www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com for details.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stuff in the pipeline:\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Realtime network visualization in the simulation projects using\na \n&gt; color range to indicate neuron activation and signal strength in \n&gt; connections. If all goes to plan then this same network drawing\ncode \n&gt; should also appear in the main exe, showing the structure of the\nbest \n&gt; network. Hopefully ready in about 1 week.\n&gt; \n&gt;  - Distributed NEAT. I have been casting an eye over the \n&gt; network/remoting support in .Net. I think two distinct approaches\nare \n&gt; required. 1) Client/Server where folks can connect in to a server\nand \n&gt; choose to dedicate CPU timer to a specific problem, kind of how \n&gt; distributed.net works (worked?).  2) master/slave - slave machines \n&gt; directly controled by a master, this more like the beowulk\narrangemet \n&gt; typically used in research set ups.\n&gt; \n&gt; Along with this weeks performance improvements, a scalable\ndistributed \n&gt; approach should provide a nice boost for researching more CPU\nintensive \n&gt; problems. Well that&#39;s the plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n\n\n"}}
