My puzzle is, =\r\nfor example, a problem, such as the XOR\n&gt; problem, can be approximated sati=\r\nsfactorily by a 3-layers ANN with 4\n&gt; hiden nodes. After being trained, whe=\r\nn we want to get the output of\n&gt; a input such (0,0), we only need to do mat=\r\nrix multiplication:[1,2]*\n&gt; [2,4] ,4+1 times logsin() and several times of =\r\naddition operation.\n&gt; But with a arbitrary topology ANN, we must calculate =\r\niteratively\n&gt; until the output of all the nodes no longer changed,\n\nThis is=\r\n the &#39;generalized&#39; approach to activating, that works for\ncontrollers and f=\r\nor recurrent networks, etc.  If you will look through\nthe archives of this =\r\nlist, you will find numerous discussions on this\ntopic.  The proposed alter=\r\nnative is to have an algorithm that analyzes\nthe dependencies of the nodes =\r\nand produces a &#39;firing order&#39;.  Then, as\nlong as the network is not recurre=\r\nnt, you can activate it in just as\nmany steps or calculations as the tradit=\r\nional 3-layer network.\n\nFor more details about the rammifications, when to =\r\nuse it and when not\nto, and all that good stuff, just read the archives.  :=\r\n)\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
