For the first, I did already try assigning\n&gt; &gt; each individual to the closes matching species, rather than the first\n&gt; &gt; that is close-enough.  But that had the effect of making it hard to\n&gt; &gt; reduce the number of species when it was too high.  This was because\n&gt; &gt; all existing species continued to receive some proportion of new\n&gt; &gt; individuals, however wide the threshold is set.  This makes it hard\n&gt; &gt; to drive them to extinction.  Two points arise from this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1a) in the traditional scheme, reduction of species number tends to\n&gt; &gt; happen by crow-baring all new individuals into the first few species,\n&gt; &gt; so that the last few go extinct.  This is not what I intuitively\n&gt; &gt; thought was happening and I&#39;m not sure I like it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Isn&#39;t that handled by the assignment of number of offspring to a\n&gt;species?  If species X is sceduled for extinction, then the number of\n&gt;offspring that it is allowed to have in the next generation is a\n&gt;specific number.  Of course, if the mating of two others result in\n&gt;creating an offspring that should rightly be in species X, then so be\n&gt;it.  But the longer species X goes without improvement, the bigger its\n&gt;penalty, the fewer offspring it can have.  The fewer offspring it can\n&gt;have, the less likely its individuals will reproduce.  Over time, the\n&gt;species is penalized out of existence.  If it comes back because of\n&gt;happenstance, that&#39;s okay.\n\nMy system is continuous, rather than generational.  So that makes \nthings a little different, e.g. a species doesn&#39;t lose all its \nmembers at once and have match new individuals to survive...\n\nIt certainly would be the case, if the main place each species got \nmembers from was its own reproduction, that reducing that \nreproduction to zero was the way to drive the species extinct.  My \nobservation is that this is not what happens, however.  The species \nare more similar than that, so that when an individual is walking the \nordered set of species, looking for a match, it is by far the most \ncommon occurrence that it gets placed in an early one, even if its \nparent species was a late one.\n\nObviously this is a very complex issue, not least because the total \ndiversity between the species depends on the speciation strategy, and \nthe assignment to species depends on the speciation-threshold, which \nin turn is adjusted based on the number of species observed and \ndesired.  That&#39;s why I mentioned that I hadn&#39;t got my good \nthreshold-control in place when I tried this before -- it might work \nfar better now I have more robust threshold control.\n\nBut, what all this has lead me to understand is that we are now \ncontrolling the diversity in the population.  We are observing a \ncertain degree of diversity arising, and we are adjusting the \ndefinition of a species accordingly, but we are not actually \ncontrolling the diversity.\n\nDoes anybody have a theory that the search is selecting a good level \nof diversity itself?  I don&#39;t see that myself.\n\nThis does begin to sound like a really strong argument for ES-like \n&quot;variance&quot; parameters...\n\n&gt;But that presumes that reproduction is on a species by species basis.\n&gt;That is, species X has a fitness of N that is adjusted by the\n&gt;population size and the time since last improvement.  Based on\n&gt;calculations, it is determined that the species should have P\n&gt;offspring in the next generation.  So, you generate 1 or 2 through\n&gt;elitism, some percentage through weight mutation, and the rest through\n&gt;crossover, with a percentage of those being to an extra-species mate.\n&gt;Every offspring that is NOT due to crossover with an extra-species\n&gt;mate is guaranteed to be in the same species as it was before, is it\n&gt;not?\n\nIf one were taking the closest match (which if you recall, is what \nstarted this part of the discussion) then you might be right, but \ntaking the first match, as current systems do, means that most of \nthose offspring go into species near the top of the list.\n\n&gt;If those offspring created through extra-species mating should be in a\n&gt;new species, so be it.  The question of species is one of how much\n&gt;diversity of structure is still close enough to be similar?  The\n&gt;number of species then really just controls who mates with whom.  But\n&gt;isn&#39;t that a bit of a backwards and/or arbitrary way of doing so?\n\nThat&#39;s one angle on species.  Another angle is that some sort of \nbroad distance metric should be used - that&#39;s the current \nscheme.  And yet another angle is that surely it is the species own \nbusiness what it contains?  e.g. one of the points of species is to \nallow them to diverge, but how can they ever diverge if we offer them \nall individuals from the same pool?\n\nIt gets horribly circular, where the diversity of the pool depends on \nthe range of species, but the range of species depends on the \nthreshold and the diversity of the pool, and the threshold depends on \nthe diversity of the pool...\n\nI&#39;m getting quite convinced that rather than using explicit \ncomparisons to assign individuals to species, it would be better to \ndefine a species logically, and any offspring of the species would by \ndefinition belong to it.  Species would have to be first generated by \na deliberate copy of a member out of another species, optionally with \nmutation on the way, or _HEAVY_ mutation.  Cross-species breeding has \nto be regarded as an attempt to merge from one species to another (or \nelse to merge them both into a new species) and needs to proceed via \nmultiple attempts to cross-breed (which in turn requires a random \ncomponent, to allow for different selections of features of from each \nparent) and some generations of selection on the target species to \nallow the new stuff to &quot;bed down&quot;.\n\n&gt;It would be a pain in the butt, computationally speaking, but perhaps\n&gt;the decision of who should reproduce with who should be determined\n&gt;through some algorithm.\n\nThis is kinda what I&#39;m planning, only without the algorithm :)\n\n&gt;   Some genetic similarity metric (much like the\n&gt;species control is now) coupled with a social status metric (fitness).\n&gt;  A mating &#39;ritual&#39; (algorithm) allows them to pair up based on &#39;best\n&gt;match&#39; with some inherent flexibility to allow for search space\n&gt;flexibility. Then instead of keeping a number of species, and worrying\n&gt;about how many there are, you simply forgoe the &#39;species&#39; metric, and\n&gt;adjust the mating algorithm so that it maintains genetic diversity.\n&gt;\n&gt;First, track each distinct topology.  Each time a new topology is\n&gt;created, calculate its difference to every other topology that\n&gt;currently exists in the population.  If a topology disappears and\n&gt;re-appears, then you still have the difference metric to those that\n&gt;were processed before, so you only have to recalculate it for those\n&gt;topologies that appeared while that topology was not present in the\n&gt;population.\n\nI&#39;m also kinda suggesting that, only instead of tracking the \ntopology, I&#39;m just making the species more independent so their \ntopology can diverge more...\n\n&gt;Then, devise a simple formula that combines the topology difference\n&gt;metric with the difference in fitness metric.  Bias it so that it\n&gt;always tries to seek someone close to themselves, but better than\n&gt;themselves.  For each individual, create a list of who they would most\n&gt;like to mate with.\n\nHmm, I know you are taling about individuals instead of species, but \nI have an argument that you should always try to merge less-fit \nspecies into more fit ones.\n\nThe reason for this is that the purpose of the less-fit species is to \nexplore some other strategy than the main stream more-fit \nspecies.  And that extra exploration makes good when either (i) the \nless-fit species surpasses the main-stream (becoming fitter), or (ii) \nwe successfully merge something different that the less-fit species \nhas discovered back into the main-stream (increasing its fitness by \ngiving it something it wouldn&#39;t have discovered on its own).  As an \nexample of how the latter might happen, say we create the less-fit \nspecies by deletion of an important but non-crucial subsystem.  The \nless-fit species is now forced to re-evolve a replacement for that \nsubsystem.  The main-stream can never do that, because it has no \ndrive to replace a functional subsystem.  But the less-fit species, \nin evolving a solution to the same problem again, may come up with a \nsolution that either solves the same problems better, or else solves \na partially non-overlapping area set of problems.  In either case \nmerging the new subsystem back into the main stream will (_if_ it can \nbe done) lead to a fitter main-stream.\n\n&gt;Then go through and assign pairs.  For the sake of argument, no\n&gt;individual can mate more than once (or maybe twice?).  Once you have a\n&gt;list of pairs, decide which pairs to breed based on the idea of\n&gt;maintaining genetic diversity.\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s just an idea.  I&#39;m not sure if it has any benefits over the\n&gt;existing system or not.  Nor do I have a clear idea of how it might be\n&gt;implemented.  But maybe there is merit to the idea.  Anybody have any\n&gt;thoughts or comments?\n\nI&#39;m still contemplating my next move, but it sounds like we&#39;re coming \nat the same limitations with different approaches?\n\n         Ian\n\n\nIn fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n___________________________________________________________ \nHow much free photo storage do you get?
