The new individual is placed in \nthe\n&gt;=\r\n first species with a representative that is within the compatibility\n&gt; dis=\r\ntance.  \n&gt; \n&gt; One other thing some people don&#39;t realize is that my implemen=\r\ntation\n&gt; sorts the genomes in each species in order of their fitness, which=\r\n\n&gt; means ultimately that the representative becomes the individual with\n&gt; h=\r\nighest fitness.\n&gt; \n\nThis issue is something I was thinking of very often. B=\r\necause one \nspecies can be defined as a group of genomes that have many mat=\r\nching \ngenes close to each other (with respect to the global compatibility =\r\nthreshold), it is possible that the representative of a species could \nbe k=\r\nind of generalized data across all members of the species, not \njust one ge=\r\nnome. \n\nFor example, the representative can be recomputed every generation,=\r\n in \na process where all members mate into one single individual which \nbec=\r\nomes the representative of the species. All genes should be allowed \nto be =\r\ninherited in an iterative process resulting in a genome that \ncarries all c=\r\nomplexity of all individuals of the species. Can this be \nconsidered a good=\r\n representative? Or maybe just regular mating, where \nexcess/disjoint genes=\r\n are inherited from more fit members. I don&#39;t \nknow what effect this could =\r\nhave. And it is important that the weights \nof matching genes should be ave=\r\nraged during mating.\n\nThe idea is that the representative of a species can =\r\nbe not just a \ngenome that is existing as a member, but a special genome th=\r\nat is only \nused during clustering, as the &quot;overall picture&quot; of genetic dis=\r\ntance. \n\nDoes it make sense? \n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
