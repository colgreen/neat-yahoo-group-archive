Admittedly, I\n&gt; &gt;know nothing about it otherwise, but from your description it \nsounds\n&gt; &gt;like simple hill climbing, i.e. make a tweak, see if you improved,\n&gt; &gt;and if not go back to where you were.  Is there any real\n&gt; &gt;difference?  Hill climbing is known to get stuck on local\n&gt; &gt;optima...well that&#39;s an understatenent...it *does* get stuck on\n&gt; &gt;local optima.  That&#39;s one reason having a population is helpful.\n&gt; &gt;So I am just wondering how Thaler&#39;s thing differs from hill \nclimbing?\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I have gathered, it isn&#39;t.  But because he is climbing \nthe CURRENT \n&gt; hill, he may avoid some of those pitfalls.  Instead of taking a \nlook at the \n&gt; landscape of 100 input samples and then walking in the &#39;average&#39; \nuphill, it \n&gt; walks up the hill of the current situation.  For a real-world \nsituation, the \n&gt; fitness landscape would tend to move fairly smoothly, shifting the \npeak (for \n&gt; example) left and right, and so the hill climber is constantly \nfollowing \n&gt; that peak.  Yes, it could get caught in a local optima...until it \nfinds a \n&gt; situation in which that optima is far from optimal, which could \njolt it out \n&gt; of that optima with enough force to let it find a better optima \nsomewhere \n&gt; else.  That is how his robotic controller works, anyway.\n&gt; \n\nI think I&#39;m still not getting something.  What&#39;s good about the \ncurrent hill?  I thought the whole problem usually is to find the \nright hill with no prior information.  Is he assuming we already \nstart with a solution?  And if so, then what&#39;s the point?  Just to \ntrack a slowly moving landscape?  There are probably better ways to \ndo even that; for example, particle swarm optimization. \n\nI guess I&#39;m missing the big picture.  His method wouldn&#39;t e.g. \ndiscover a biped walking network right?  It sounds like it just \ntakes some preconstructed solution and gets &quot;creative&quot; on it by \nrandomly messing it up and hoping something interesting pops out.  \nIs that the big idea?\n\n&gt; The self-training network is nothing more than a network that \nimplements \n&gt; back-propagation on itself.  Not really that earth-shattering.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creativity machine is nothing more than an exploration of the \nspace \n&gt; around the error-minimized solution.  The base network represents \na \n&gt; mathematical model of a problem space.  For a given input, it has \na given \n&gt; output.  But making minor tweaks to the model lets you explore the \n&gt; surrounding environment.  You get things that are closely related \nto the \n&gt; original model, with the mathematical shape of the tweak being \nalmost the \n&gt; same, but just enough different that you get a &#39;novel&#39; output that \nis often \n&gt; relevant and appropriate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think having a random input node would be an improvement even to \nThaler&#39;s \n&gt; work.  The connection weight will encapsulate the width of \nthe &#39;relevance&#39; \n&gt; range that is viable to explore.  Then, the network will always \ntend to give \n&gt; &#39;creative&#39; but relevant output.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I agree with what Derek later said...that site is so full of hype\n&gt; &gt;and hyperbole that I can hardly believe this guy is really on the\n&gt; &gt;ball and not just a nut.  But then again, they say genius is\n&gt; &gt;difficult recognize...\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone that is dependant on and trying to attract investors is \nleft with \n&gt; little choice.  They have to make a good impression on people with \nthe cash. \n&gt;   And what works on them doesn&#39;t always work on the people with \nthe \n&gt; knowledge and understanding of the work being done.  That, and \nwhat he is \n&gt; doing is easily reproduced, which he would prefer not to have \nhappen.  So he \n&gt; doesn&#39;t spell out the details, for fear of being copied.  Can&#39;t \nblame the \n&gt; guy for that. :)\n\nI don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still skeptical about his sanity.  I would expect \ntechnology investors to be paranoid about people who claim to have \nthe ultimate solution to AI. \n\nActually, interestingly, there was a guy I met an AI & Games \nconference who contacted me earlier in the year asking for my \nprofessional assessment of Thaler&#39;s work.  I didn&#39;t know anything \nabout Thaler at the time, but I looked at his website and told the \nguy I couldn&#39;t evaluate it well because there isn&#39;t any technical \ninformation but that the claims sound unrealistic.  \n\nAll government funding agencies have grant reviews done by academic \npeers.  Are there really investors out there who put millions of \ndollars down without consulting an expert just because someone \nclaims to have discovered the key to intelligence?\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
