And I have tested it.  The reason I stopped\n\nYes. There is a slight difference between the two, as I understand it, but\nit is not that relevant for this conversation.\n\n&gt; There are a couple reasons that singlepoint crossover in NEAT makes\n&gt; less sense. First, my feeling is the building blocks hypothesis\n&gt; doesn&#39;t make as much sense with NEAT, so I don&#39;t think those analogies\n&gt; really work when reasoning about its crossover operator.  Because\n&gt; crossover almost always happens between individuals in the same\n&gt; species, they do not have totally separate modules representing\n&gt; different things.  That is, you are not looking at things like one\n&gt; organism with wings and one with arms.  Such exotic difference are\n&gt; likely to exist only beyond species boundaries, where NEAT rarely mates.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead, mating in NEAT, like in nature, is between individuals with\n&gt; generally similar genes that represent generally similar &quot;body plans.&quot;\n&gt;  So when I talk about alignment issues, I am speaking on a\n&gt; gene-by-gene basis, not a module-by-module basis, because generally\n&gt; insofar as there are modules, they are shared by those who are mating.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense.\n\n&gt; In fact, I am somehat skeptical of the building blocks hypothesis with\n&gt; respect to mating in GAs in general, but that is a broader topic.\n&gt; When it comes to NEAT, in any case, it doesn&#39;t really work that way.\n\nKeki Burjorjee at Brandeis would heartily join you in your skepticism. He is\ntrying to show that such skepticism is justified in his PhD dissertation.\n\n&gt; Second, genes NEAT genomes are actually ordered from oldest to newest\n&gt; gene, which makes singlepoint crossover have a strange meaning:  It\n&gt; means, in effect, take all the older genes from one parent and all the\n&gt; newer genes from the other and concatenate them.  Intuitively I don&#39;t\n&gt; see a really useful reason to do that.\n\nMight that be one reason why it works so poorly? If you think of a P-NEAT\nsubstrate for a checkers board evaluation, maybe it would be better to take\ncontiguous regions instead of ordering based on age.\n\nIt would be an interesting area for someone to conduct research.\n\nThanks again for clarifying these issues. \n\n\n\n"}}
