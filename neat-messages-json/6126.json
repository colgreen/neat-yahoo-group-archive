Oftentimes something looks significant on a plot with var=\r\niance, especially if you use such a generous variance indicator as standard=\r\n error. What would be the harm in also including a p-value in addition to y=\r\nour visualization of the data and variance? Do you have any modern stats ar=\r\nticles that argue in favor of this practice? I am asking because as a revie=\r\nwer I would complain if I saw this practice, and if I am incorrectly compla=\r\nining I&#39;d like to know so I do not make unjustified requests/complaints in =\r\nmy reviews. I do know that some statisticians do advocate not using p-value=\r\ns, but I wasn&#39;t under the impression that the alternative was simply to rem=\r\nove a p-value and leave in an typical plot with average+/- some indication =\r\nof variance. I assumed that there was something else, more complicated, tha=\r\nt they would substitute in place of the p-value. \n\nHere are some good paper=\r\ns on the subject. Some are more focused on inference in biology, but it app=\r\nlies just as well for our research.\n\nhttp://warnercnr.colostate.edu/~anders=\r\non/PDF_files/TESTING.pdf\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/=\r\nS0378112703003311\n\nhttp://www.jstor.org/stable/3803089\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm=\r\n.nih.gov/pubmed/17944619\n\nhttp://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/6/136=\r\n3.abstract\n\n\n"}}
