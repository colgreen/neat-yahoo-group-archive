If such a node is present in the \nge=\r\nnome, then just add new innovations like it is a novel one, \nothwerwise use=\r\n the existing innovation numbers/node ID.\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Rob&quot; &lt;auto_phile@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve been looking at the=\r\n jneat code, specifically\n&gt; Genome.mutate_add_node, to try to understand ho=\r\nw innovations work in\n&gt; this case. \n&gt; \n&gt; If the connection to add a new nod=\r\ne to is A-&gt;B, we look through the\n&gt; list of innovations to see if there&#39;s a=\r\nlready been a new node\n&gt; innovation for A-&gt;B, provided the innovation for A=\r\n-&gt;B itself is the\n&gt; same as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there&#39;s no matching innovation, t=\r\nhen we can create a new node C,\n&gt; connection A-&gt;C-&gt;B, and create a new node=\r\n innovation.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, if there is a matching innovation, then create a=\r\n node with\n&gt; the node ID from the innovation (call it C), and connect A-&gt;C-=\r\n&gt;B.\n&gt; \n&gt; The issue that I see is that A-&gt;B still exists (whether enabled or=\r\n\n&gt; disabled). So if, in the same network that now contains A-&gt;C-&gt;B, the\n&gt; a=\r\nlgorithm happens to choose A-&gt;B for a new node again, it is\n&gt; guaranteed to=\r\n find the innovation with new node C... and thus we \nwould\n&gt; get two nodes =\r\nwith the same ID.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this the intended behavior, or am I reading this =\r\nwrong?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; --Rob\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
