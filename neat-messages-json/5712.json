Every time a new gene appears through a complexifying mu=\r\ntation, the historical marking counter for that type of gene is incremented=\r\n by 1.  For example, if it is a connection gene, then the connection gene c=\r\nounter is incremented by 1.  When genes are inherited from parents by their=\r\n offspring, their historical markings never change.
