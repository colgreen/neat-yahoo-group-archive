The question is more, why a specific implementation (that Ken h=\r\nas obviously in mind, my impression was he thought about approaches similar=\r\n to LEO) is better than another.\n\nMy question to Ken would be here: what is=\r\n the additional ingredient that makes a bias in the encoding better / more =\r\nplausible than *any* implementation of the bias in the fitness function?\n\n\n"}}
