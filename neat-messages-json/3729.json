Of course you \ncan always speculate on how a little can be converted =\r\nto a lot by \ntalking about fractals and subroutines (after all, that&#39;s just=\r\n \ncompression), but when you realize that we are talking about \n*searching*=\r\n a space of such mappings, it becomes far more complicated \nand profound.  =\r\nThe problem then becomes compounded by the fact that \nnot only must the rep=\r\nresentation be efficient but it must also warp \nin meaningful ways, e.g. a =\r\nbiped should have biped children.  How \ndoes natural evolution manage to in=\r\nduce such a nicely structured \nsearch space?

I \n&gt; enjoyed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  having the=\r\n opportunity to ask my question to such illustrious\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  scientists, but =\r\nlike you, I was kind of disappointed with their\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  answers. Like you sa=\r\nid, they sort of answered accurately, but \n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  was no real insig=\r\nht or thoughtfulness in what they said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  It&#39;s interesting that =\r\nyou point out this exchange because I \n&gt; think it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  highlights a weakn=\r\ness in how biologists have been dealing with \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  question of comp=\r\nlexity. It&#39;s such a fundamental question yet it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  hasn&#39;t really receiv=\r\ned the treatment it deserves, even from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  field&#39;s luminaries. I th=\r\nink part of the problem is that a \ngenuine\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  treatment requires a kind=\r\n of algorithmic and representational \n&gt; theory,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  which is perhaps bet=\r\nter attacked from a computational \n&gt; perspective,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  putting evolutiona=\r\nry computation researchers at an advantage \n&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  we think about=\r\n search spaces, encodings, mappings, etc. \n&gt; routinely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, I thi=\r\nnk you&#39;re right that EC researcher probably come at the\n&gt; &gt; problem from an=\r\n angle that might be more productive, but I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; especially disappointed i=\r\nn Wolpert, who was the main voice for\n&gt; &gt; developmental biology on the pane=\r\nl. Your question gets to issues \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; a developmental biologist shoul=\r\nd primarily be interested in.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even if he didn&#39;t have specific insi=\r\nghts related to the \ndevelopment \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the human brain, he should have =\r\nbeen able to give other examples \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; which he was more familiar.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, I recently read Pasko Rakic&#39;s 1995 paper &quot;A small \nstep =\r\n\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; expansion during evolution&quot; from Trends in Neuroscience:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=3DArticleURL&_udi=3DB6T0V-\n&gt; 3Y6PFXS-\n&gt;=\r\n \n1P&_user=3D10&_rdoc=3D1&_fmt=3D&_orig=3Dsearch&_sort=3Dd&view=3Dc&_acct=\r\n=3DC000050221\n&gt; \n&_version=3D1&_urlVersion=3D0&_userid=3D10&md5=3D4eba37dec=\r\n70f1bb0d9022402f97ae\n&gt; e43\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s the abstract:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The more =\r\nthan 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface without a\n&gt; &gt; comparable in=\r\ncrease in its thickness during mammalian evolution is\n&gt; &gt; explained in the =\r\ncontext of the radial-unit hypothesis of cortical\n&gt; &gt; development. Accordin=\r\ng to the proposed model, cortical expansion \nis\n&gt; &gt; the result of changes i=\r\nn proliferation kinetics that increase the\n&gt; &gt; number of radial columnar un=\r\nits without changing the number of \n&gt; neurons\n&gt; &gt; within each unit signific=\r\nantly. Thus, mutation of a regulatory \ngene\n&gt; (s)\n&gt; &gt; that controls the tim=\r\ning and ratio of symmetric and asymmetric \nmodes\n&gt; &gt; of cell divisions in t=\r\nhe proliferative zone, coupled with radial\n&gt; &gt; constraints in the distribut=\r\nion of migrating neurons, could \ncreate \n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; expanded cortical plate w=\r\nith enhanced capacity for establishing \nnew\n&gt; &gt; patterns of connectivity th=\r\nat are validated through natural \n&gt; selection.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m personally work=\r\ning under the assumption that the cortical\n&gt; &gt; minicolumn is the primary mo=\r\ndule, that repeatable bit of code that\n&gt; &gt; Dawkins talked about, and there =\r\nare a number of good work by\n&gt; &gt; biologists out there, including Rakic, who=\r\n give support to such an\n&gt; &gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Perhaps they were just being=\r\n curt or did not take the audience\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  seriously enough to elaborate the=\r\nir thoughts. Yet I find that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  explanation doubtful given that we were=\r\n after all at \na &quot;debate&quot; \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  evolution and complexity, which i=\r\ns precisely the substance of \nmy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  question. I also agree that Dawkins=\r\n seemed closest to really\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  thinking about it, so I&#39;d guess Dawkins wo=\r\nuld be very \ninterested \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  our area of EC if only there was an op=\r\nportunity to tell him \nabout\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  it. But I don&#39;t think he has a great de=\r\nal of experience with it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  beyond his old Blind Watchmaker demo.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I guess you didn&#39;t have a chance to corner him and talk things \nover?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; :) Dawkins does seem like he would be interested in a lot of the \n&gt; work=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; being presented at GECCO. Did he just show up for the panel, or \nwas \n=\r\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; around the conference at all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was also thought the othe=\r\nr really interesting exchange was at \n&gt; 33:45\n&gt; &gt; in the video, when the qu=\r\nestion of whether or not you could \nevolve a\n&gt; &gt; mouse with feathered wings=\r\n came up, and Wolpert and Jones both \nsaid\n&gt; &gt; no, while Dawkins seemed to =\r\nsay probably not, but not for any of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; reasons the other guys came u=\r\np with.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --Derek\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
