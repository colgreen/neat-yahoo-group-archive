This is a major shift from the NE\n&gt; &gt; techniques I have seen to date.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a very interesting issue. I am not sure though whether\n&gt; functionality cannot be encoded in a self-organizing system. It&#39;s a\n&gt; really good question. Does anyone have thoughts on this? It seems\n&gt; that a self-organizing system that produces repeating patterns can\n&gt; encapsulate functionality within those patterns, although this might\n&gt; be more difficult than having it learn the functionality through\n&gt; further experience.\n\n\nYes, if I rememeber correctly an example of repeated basic functionality \ncan be found in the human retina. The input from red, green and blue \nreceptors (cones) is adjusted by a simple hard wired neural net within \nthe retina. So say a mutation occurs that makes a larger retina with \nmore cone cells, you would see them all wired up the same. But when it \ncomes to the more complex functionailty, say,  in the visual cortex, \nthen the neural structures there are probably more like a blank canvas \nand the ability to actualy interpret images is learned. Perhaps there is \nsome high level structure that corresponds to the different stages of \nimage interpretation - line detection followed by object detection, etc. \nand this high level structure aids the type of learning that occurs in \nthat part of the brain.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Paradoxically, learning itself is a functionality which requires\n&gt; some kind of initial pattern (perhaps a pattenr of learning rules),\n&gt; but it may be a simpler initial pattern, and so easier to self-\n&gt; organize. There has been a fair amount of work on evolving adaptive\n&gt; neural networks that can adapt their functionality during their\n&gt; lifetime. For example, see our paper, &quot;Evolving Adaptive Neural\n&gt; Networks with and without Adaptive Synapses&quot;:\n\nI actually know very little about adaptive networks and what the current \nstate of research in this area. I&#39;ll certainly read the paper as a starter.\n\n\n&gt; Anyway, ultimately there may be an important union between adaptive\n&gt; neuroevolution and self-organization in indirect encoding.\n\nCertainly that&#39;s where I would like to see NE research shifting towards. \nAll of a sudden I feel like I don&#39;t know much about either area. :)\n\nColin\n\n\n"}}
