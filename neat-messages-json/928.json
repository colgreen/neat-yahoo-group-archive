This \nincludes a best genome window and a window for monitoring the best \ngenomes from a selected range of species, you can also set this window \nto monitor the best N species.\n\nNew network visualization tool (bin/NetworkViewer.exe). Currently this \nloads and displays SharpNEAT network XML. There are plans turn this into \nan editor and to support loading/saving of other network and genome file \nformats\n\nImportant Notice. There currently exists a problem in the genome \ncrossover code that allows multiple connections to accrue between two \nneurons, or between a single neuron in the case of recurrent \nconenctions. This will have some detrimental effect on searches, \nalthough how much of an effect is not known. This problem is being \nworked on.\n------------------\n\nRegarding the last point, I was intending to resolve this problem today \nbut I&#39;m still deciding on the best way to do this. I was going to try \nand maintain a full history of all additions, which would solve the \nproblem and actually it sounds like a better strategy. Unfortunately if \nI do it this way then the problem re-appears when you distribute a \nsearch over multiple PCs - or at least the using the way I was thinking \nof doing distribution anyhow.\n\n\n"}}
