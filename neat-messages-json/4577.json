I hope it helps\nothers e=\r\nvolve ambulating creatures with HyperNEAT as well.  It really\nhelps to have=\r\n the example you have now provided that shows how such a\nsubstrate might be=\r\n set up.\n\nI answer your questions on the biped below:\n\n--- In neat@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Ken-\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We have actually=\r\n been running biped evolution experiments recently at\n&gt; &gt; UCF because we wo=\r\nuld like to use it as a test domain in the future as\n&gt; &gt; well.  In our effo=\r\nrts, we have learned a couple things that may answer\n&gt; \n&gt; That is exciting =\r\nthat you are working on bipeds. I am anxious to see\nyour\n&gt; results. Since y=\r\nou mention it as a test bed, I am curious to hear\nwhat you\n&gt; are comparing =\r\nyour results to. Is Tyler Streeter&#39;s work considered\nthe best\n&gt; EC has to o=\r\nffer? How about for CS in general? Do you have quantitative\n&gt; benchmarks yo=\r\nu can use, such as speed, from another system?\n&gt; \n \nI think it&#39;s difficult =\r\nto find a good benchmark.  There are some\npublications citing successful bi=\r\nped walking, such as Reil and\nHusbands, but no one seems to be able to repr=\r\noduce their results with\nthe same setup.  In fact, I have never heard of an=\r\nyone reproducing\ntheir results although I know several who have tried; I wo=\r\nuld be\ninterested to hear from anyone who has.  There are some other works\n=\r\nthat produced bipeds as well, though I don&#39;t know the citations\noffhand.  B=\r\nut they usually involve some kind of hand-designed aspect\nor a &quot;hand of God=\r\n,&quot; which means something that holds the biped up\nwhile it is learning, kind=\r\n of like training wheels.  That makes\ncomparison with such systems kind of =\r\napples and oranges if you don&#39;t\napply such techniques.  And I think ideally=\r\n we&#39;d like to be able to\njust tell evolution to go and let it do its own th=\r\ning.\n\nGiven the anecdotal difficulty of the problem, for now I would\nconsid=\r\ner it a success to get any biped to walk without any special\ntricks.  I do =\r\nnot see the biped so much as a benchmark as I see it a\ngateway to more inte=\r\nresting domains.  If you can evolve a biped, then\nyou can probably evolve a=\r\n lot of other creatures and also make bipeds\nthat do increasingly interesti=\r\nng things.  It also validates a method&#39;s\nability to produce complex control=\r\nlers.  \n\n&gt; That&#39;s cool that leaky integrators are working well for you. I\ns=\r\nhould point\n&gt; out that I did not try leaky integrators in my setup, so I do=\r\n not\nknow that\n&gt; they do worse in my setup. I was simply hypothesizing that=\r\n leaky\nintegrators\n&gt; were one thing that was obviously different between Pe=\r\nter&#39;s setup and my\n&gt; own, and therefore may have been part of the cause of =\r\nthe difference in\n&gt; results that we saw. I think it would be interesting to=\r\n try my setup\nwith\n&gt; Leaky Integrators. \n&gt; \n&gt; To get your oscillations, do =\r\nyou also need recurrence?\n&gt; \n\nYes, recurrence is necessary to get oscillati=\r\nons with leaky\nintegrators, which brings up an interesting issue for HyperN=\r\nEAT: The\nsubstrate must include some sort of recurrence in its architecture=\r\n.  I\ndon&#39;t think many aside from Peter have played with recurrent\nsubstrate=\r\ns.  Of course, it should be possible and interesting to try.\n\n&gt; &gt; Second, t=\r\nhe model morphology is critical.  You cannot simply expect\n&gt; &gt; any biped to=\r\n walk.  Great care is necessary to ensure that everything\n&gt; &gt; about the mod=\r\nel makes sense and is proportionate.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree. I&#39;ll be morphology makes=\r\n an even bigger difference in the biped\n&gt; domain, which is harder and more =\r\nunstable. Out of curiosity, how are you\n&gt; tuning morphology? By hand? Via e=\r\nvolution?\n&gt; \n\nWe&#39;ve been optimizing morphology by hand, but I can imagine i=\r\nt would\nbe interesting to do it with evolution as well.  There are a lot of=\r\n\npossible ways that could be set up.  The reason we&#39;re doing it by hand\nis =\r\nso that we can get an intuitive understanding of the relationship\nbetween b=\r\niped morphology and performance.\n\n&gt; A final question: if morphology is crit=\r\nical, how will you compare your\n&gt; results to others. Are you trying to use =\r\nthe exact same morphology\nas other\n&gt; papers?\n&gt; \n\nLike I said, at the moment=\r\n our focus is not on comparison.  What we\nwant is a concrete understanding =\r\nof the domain: What makes it hard,\nwhat are the keys to making it work, wha=\r\nt makes it most interesting,\netc.  Perhaps we will think about comparison l=\r\nater.  But I think at\nthe moment the interesting question is why so many ha=\r\nve trouble with\nthis problem.  Even Tyler Streeter only got his biped to wa=\r\nlk a few\nsteps before falling.  We want to master the domain completely so =\r\nthat\nin the future anyone can play with it easily and use it as a gateway\nt=\r\no more interesting and complex control problems.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
