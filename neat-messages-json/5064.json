If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the same champion stick ar=\r\nound unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new individuals occasionally c=\r\nome in with the same fitness as the champion, but it would be very surprisi=\r\nng if that is happening on every single generation.  Yet that would seem to=\r\n be the only possibility with the number of champion nodes going up so rapi=\r\ndly even while fitness is flatlined.  So what is going on during the fitnes=\r\ns plateau?  Which genomes exactly are being measured to get the node counts=\r\n?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hel=\r\nlo all-\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently tha=\r\nt the number\n&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of t=\r\nime\n&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory=\r\n of the\n&gt; run. \n&gt; \n&gt; See here, for example\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune=\r\n/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometimes it gets really pathological, wi=\r\nth almost 25 CPPN nodes being added\n&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt; \n&gt; Oddly, an=\r\nd interestingly, the runs in this second figure where the CPPN node\n&gt; count=\r\n linearly increases are in a changing environment and those runs where\n&gt; th=\r\ne CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt; enviro=\r\nnment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt; \n&gt; One problem is that it m=\r\nakes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt; populations with 200-node =\r\ngenomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt; evolution can make too much pro=\r\ngress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt; seen fitness continue to incr=\r\nease even with such large genomes).\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tried dropping the MutateAd=\r\ndNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt; that definitely changes the slope=\r\n of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt; increases. The good news is that it d=\r\noes not affect fitness to much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Jeff Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; jclune@=\r\n...\n&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
