I am\n&gt;&gt; now using MATLAB_NEAT to do some work by modifying the\n&gt;&gt; XOR_EXPERIMENT, but I found that the node output will always be\n&gt;&gt; positive in the program, then how can I emulate a curve with negetive\n&gt;&gt; values?\n&gt;\n&gt; For that you&#39;ll need to change the activation function to something \n&gt; that goes from say [-1,1].  You could transform a [0,1] activation \n&gt; function to this by 2*(x-0.5).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ken told me I should always try to get better individuals higher\n&gt;&gt; fitness values, but when I employ the method that XOR_EXPERIMENT\n&gt;&gt; uses, I found it is difficult to locate a proper constant from which\n&gt;&gt; the error is substracted for random output patern. Is there any rules\n&gt;&gt; to determine the constant?\n&gt;\n&gt; IIRC, fitness needs to be positive in NEAT for fitness sharing (and \n&gt; hence, speciation) to work right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, you&#39;ll need to come up with a constant that works.  That depends \n&gt; on your problem - but shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to determine.  Note \n&gt; that you should be subtracting the RMSE though, not the Error.  So, \n&gt; run all of your fitness evaluations, computing RMSE, then subtract \n&gt; each RMSE from some constant.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve never used Ken&#39;s or Matlab NEAT though, so I cannot speak to the \n&gt; specifics of each.  So what I&#39;m telling you may or not make sense in \n&gt; your environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Don&#39;t hesitate to keep asking questions though.  There are lots of \n&gt; kind and helpful people on this mailing list.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get you \n&gt; up and running.\n&gt; --\n&gt; Stephen Waits\n&gt; steve@... &lt;mailto:steve@...&gt;\n&gt; http://swaits.com &lt;http://swaits.com&gt;/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
