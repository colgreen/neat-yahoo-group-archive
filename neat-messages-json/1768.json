You can try reducing the population size.  It really \n&gt;  doesn&#39;t have to be big to be effective.  Just remember that the \n&gt;  number of species should be roughly popsize/12. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  -See the question on the NEAT Users Page FAQ: \n&gt;  &quot;NEAT takes up too much memory. Can I save memory somehow? &quot;\n&gt;  It is aimed at my C++ code but I think the same principle can \n&gt;  probably be applied in JNEAT.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  -Use a memory monitor and figure out exactly when the memory is\n&gt;  overflowing.  Is it right when the pop is created or does it \n&gt;  gradually build up over generations?\n&gt;  \n&gt;  -Try a computer with more memory. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  ken\n&gt;  \n&gt;  --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Reuben Grinberg &lt;reuben.grinberg@y...&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Hey Guys,\n&gt;  &gt; \n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m using jNeat and I just modified the code so I could do \n&gt;  &gt; pole-balacing. It works fine, and now I&#39;m trying to use image \n&gt;  input. \n&gt;  &gt; Right now the input is small-ish - 30 x 50 = 1500. I generated one \n&gt;  &gt; random genome, and am using that as the starting genome file. Now \n&gt;  I&#39;m \n&gt;  &gt; getting OutOfMemory errors.
