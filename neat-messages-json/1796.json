I&#39;d like to work\n&gt; on it a bit. The GUI is nice, although there are some ways it can be\n&gt; simplified. Eventually it might be good to merge JNeat&#39;s GUI and logging\n&gt; stuff and ANJI&#39;s codebase. I&#39;ve also thought about trying to use JmDNS\n&gt; (i.e. zero-conf or Rendezvous) and RPC/CORBA so that multiple machines\n&gt; running JNeat will be able to work on the same problem, speeding up\n&gt; evolution a lot.\n&gt; \n\n.................................\n..................................\n\nYou can make it without some problem from me.\n(I at the moment not having any the time of an access\njust to Internet to open a plan) \nokay also use of JmDNS ,RPC/CORBA  even if I do not \nknow very well. \n\n\n(I hope alone, of being able to make something in future \nin order to improve jneat)\n\nCiao \n          Ugo\n\nPS: \n\n1) I do not have Internet to house and before next\nthe 8/10 days I will not be able to answer to you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
