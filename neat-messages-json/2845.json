Nothing like a trial by fire I\nsuppose.\n\nAnyw=\r\nay, I&#39;m slowly making progress, but I&#39;ve been stuck for hours on\nwhat I&#39;m s=\r\nure is a really simple fix, so I turn to you guys for help...\n\nI wrote the =\r\nfollowing code into Form1.cs, after the\nstopSearchSignal=3Dtrue; line of th=\r\ne btnSearchStop_Click function:\n\n\nSaveBestNetwork(&quot;-local file name-&quot;);\n\t\t\t=\r\n\nINetwork nt =3D ea.BestGenome.Decode(selectedActivationFunction);\n\t\t\t\nINet=\r\nworkEvaluator.ExtractNetworkPerformance(nt);\n\n\n\nWith the goal of having sha=\r\nrpNEAT automatically write the best network\nto a file and run my ExtractNet=\r\nworkPerformance function right before\nit closes.  The ExtractNetworkPerform=\r\nance function is very similar to\nthe regular EvaluateNetwork function in al=\r\nl the experiment&#39;s folders,\nin that is accepts an INetwork as input and pus=\r\nhes signals through the\nnetwork.  The difference is that I&#39;m not calculatin=\r\ng a fitness level,\nonly recording the output signals and writing them to a =\r\nfile so I can\nlater take a look at what the most fit network&#39;s decisions we=\r\nre.\n\nThe problem is that when I try to compile the above code, I get the\ner=\r\nror: &quot;An object reference is required for the nonstatic field,\nmethod, or p=\r\nroperty\n&#39;SharpNeatLibExperiments.INetworkEvaluator.ExtractNetworkPerformanc=\r\ne(SharpNeatLib.NeuralNetwork.INetwork)&#39;(CS0120)\n\nCould someone please let m=\r\ne know what&#39;s wrong?  I&#39;ve been banging my\nhead against this for an entire =\r\nday now.\n\nThanks,\nMatt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
