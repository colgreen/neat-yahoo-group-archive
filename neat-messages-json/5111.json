Which definition you choose generally d=\r\nepends on the type of problem you are trying to solve.  For example, a navi=\r\ngating robot will receive new inputs and need to produce new outputs on eve=\r\nry timestep and the timesteps may be related, so a timestep may just be mov=\r\ning activation the length of one connection.  Whereas in a classification p=\r\nroblem you are only interested in the final output of the neural network an=\r\nd the order of the data is not important, so a timestep would be activating=\r\n the network without changing the inputs until a solution is produced.  \n\nQ=\r\nuerying a CPPN in HyperNEAT is much like a classification problem (i.e. wha=\r\nt weight should this connection be?) so it uses that definition of a timest=\r\nep.  Personally I have seen several activation schemes used, although I am =\r\nsure there are more: activating the network a fixed number of times, activa=\r\nting the network some calculated number of times to ensure all signals prop=\r\nagate to the output, or activating the network until it relaxes (i.e. the n=\r\neuron signals stop changing within some delta).  The important thing that l=\r\ninks these methods is that the inputs of the network do not change until th=\r\ne connection weight is assigned.  At that point network signals are cleared=\r\n and a new input is provided.  The CPPN may still have recurrent connection=\r\ns, but they are cleared every time there is a new input.  By activating the=\r\n CPPN in this way, the order that the connections are queried is irrelevant=\r\n.\n\nDavid\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jtoddowen&quot; &lt;jtoddowen@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  My understanding of recurrence and\n&gt; ne=\r\nuron links in NEAT is that during each timestep new input data is\n&gt; present=\r\ned to the ANN and travels to the next neuron until ultimately\n&gt; reaching th=\r\ne output.  Therefore, using the NEAT structure at\n&gt; http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~=\r\nkstanley/neat.html\n&gt; &lt;http://www.cs.ucf.edu/%7Ekstanley/neat.html&gt;  it woul=\r\nd take 3 timesteps\n&gt; for activation from input 1 to traverse neurons 16, 26=\r\n9 and then 5,\n&gt; although data is also going directly from 1 to 5 (through a=\r\n direct link)\n&gt; in one step.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the above is correct, how do the Hyper=\r\nNEAT timesteps work?  Using the\n&gt; model from http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperN=\r\nEATpage/HyperNEAT.html\n&gt; &lt;http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/HyperNEAT.h=\r\ntml%20&gt;  does [0, 0.5,\n&gt; 1 , 1] get input, then [0.5, 0, 1, 0.5] next?  If =\r\nso, it would seem to\n&gt; me the order you traversed the points in the substra=\r\nte would affect the\n&gt; output.  Or, do you keep the &quot;state&quot; of each link act=\r\nivation stored\n&gt; separately from one input substrate to another (one checke=\r\nrboard play to\n&gt; another); in other words, are you keeping (4096 + 64) &quot;sta=\r\ntes&quot; for each\n&gt; timestep?\n&gt; \n&gt; --Todd\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
