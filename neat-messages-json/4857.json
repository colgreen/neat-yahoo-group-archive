Most times after evolution the value of most constant outp=\r\nut nodes is 0.5, the default value indicating no connection was made to tha=\r\nt output node.\n\nMy question is, are there any parameters I should be playin=\r\ng with to increase exploration on these constant outputs, or is there a bet=\r\nter way to evolve constant outputs together with changing outputs?\n\nPlaying=\r\n with the starting connection proportion and add connection mutation rate s=\r\neem to help, but not much.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n\n"}}
