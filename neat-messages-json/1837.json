(You can find them here \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2003/lecturer.shtml ).\n\nAt various points, he discusses consciousness and how certain parts of \nthe brain seem to take part in it, but others don&#39;t. This of course \nraises the question of why some areas of the brain don&#39;t need (or \ngenerate) consciousness, and why some do, and he does mention the idea \nof listing out all the parts believed to be connected to consciousness \nand those unconnected to it, and seeing if that gives any insight into \nwhere consciousness originates or what it actually does. (As far as I&#39;m \naware, nobody has yet made a list like this, although I&#39;d be interested \nto see one if anyone knows of one.)\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
