In bacteria the DNA is replicated serially=\r\n and the reproduction time is proportional to DNA length. Eukaryotes on the=\r\n other hand, have a parallel DNA replication mechanism and reproduction tim=\r\ne is independent of DNA length. This produced wildly different results in D=\r\nNA content. Most bacteria have very lean genomes. In eukaryotes on other ha=\r\nnd, most of the DNA holds various forms of junk. A striking example of this=\r\n is an amoeba having 200 times the DNA length of a human. Eukaryotes, of co=\r\nurse, got way more sophisticated than bacteria. There are too many other va=\r\nriables here however for us to put it down to the lack of complexity penalt=\r\ny.\n\n\n"}}
