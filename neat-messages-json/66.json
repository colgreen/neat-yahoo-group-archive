Just clone it?  In Ken&#39;s original\n&gt; implementation there&#39;s a very small interspecies\n&gt; mating rate, which won&#39;t apply most of the time.  I\n&gt; believe Ken said that he simply used a clone in this\n&gt; case, but I was wondering if anyone else handled this\n&gt; differently (perhaps allowing the lone individual to\n&gt; mate with a random individual from the last species it\n&gt; belonged to, or something).\n&gt; \n\nI should clarify a couple things about the way I\nhandled speciation.  There are two important properties\nof a species: 1) How many members it contains in\nthe current generation and 2) How many *offspring* it\nis allotted in the next generation.\n\nItem 2 is more important for the purposes of reproduction.\nThat is because even if there is only one member in\nthe current generation, as long as it is allotted several\noffspring in the next generation, there is room to\nclone *and* to create mutated offspring as well,\ni.e., there is room for exploration.\n\nSo here&#39;s how I did it:  If a species is alotted at least \n5 offspring (called expected_offspring in my implementation),\nthen its champion is cloned.  So if there is only one \nmember, it will be cloned.  However, it then has at least\n4 more offspring remaining, and these are *not* clones.  They\nwill generally be mutations of the lone member.\nHowever, if the species is allotted 5 or fewer offspring,\nthere will be no clone whatsoever, and the lone member\nlikely will be mutated into something else.  \n\nBut that makes sense because if the species is not allotted\nsome minimum number of offspring, then it probably isn&#39;t\ngood enough to deserve to be cloned, since it&#39;s not very\npromising anyway.  Keep in mind that fitness sharing ensures\nthat even a species with a single member gets fair chance\nto be allotted offspring.  In fact, allotted offspring is\nnot correlated with the current species size.\n\nOf course, there is a question where you want to set the \nthreshold.   Maybe less or more than 5...though it probably \ndoesn&#39;t matter that much.  \n\nPerhaps more interesting would be to\nup the chances of an interspecies mating for species with\nonly one current member, as Derek suggested.  That wouldn&#39;t \nchange the cloning criteria (e.g., greater than 5 alotted \noffspring), but it would mean that for those that weren&#39;t\ncloned, they have a chance of being more than mere mutations\nof the current champion.  However, although this idea\nmay be worth exploring, it doesn&#39;t matter that much since\nin the next generation, the species will have grown if\nit was promising, and mating will begin to happen anyway.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
