I&#39;m hoping to start a phd in\nfall &#39;05\n&gt; &gt; (since i missed the app deadlines for this next year). Any\nsuggestions at\n&gt; &gt; universities in the US doing interesting work? (UT already turned\nme down\n&gt; &gt; once ... I wonder if I should reapply?)\n&gt; \n&gt; I think there was a thread about this before, but I don&#39;t remember.\nI&#39;ve\n&gt; met with both Rik Belew at UCSD and also Jordan Pollack who is at\n&gt; Brandeis. Both of them seem to be doing research that you would be\n&gt; interested in. Also there is a group in Florida I think, with Annie\nWu,\n&gt; but I&#39;m not too familiar with her work.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, I&#39;m hoping to find some position next year (fall &#39;04) as a\nresearch\n&gt; &gt; assistant or something ... any suggestions about places that might\nhire\n&gt; &gt; non-phds?\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to look into some corporate research labs. I know IBM\n&gt; Research hires even undergrad interns, and I&#39;m pretty sure there are\na few\n&gt; other places around the country. As for academic labs, I&#39;m not sure\nwhat\n&gt; the policies are like. Ken might be able to add some insight.\n&gt; \n\nYeah this issue has come up before and it&#39;s a tough issue in the US\nsince for whatever reason, schools in the US with this kind of\nresearch are few and far between.  The places Joe mentioned are\ndefinitely options, though I don&#39;t know that Annie Wu has done any\nneuroevolution.  However, she is interested in encodings.  There is\nalso Darrell Whitley&#39;s group in Colorado.  He is the one who coined\nthe term &quot;competing conventions.&quot;  I think it&#39;s definitely worth\nreapplying to UT with your new credentials from the UK.  Risto&#39;s group\nis unquestionably at the lead in the US in evolving neural networks.\nThere is also the possibility I will be a prof somewhere, which would\ncreate another place, but I don&#39;t want to jinx myself!\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
