I am of course ignoring the influence of \nweights here. After one timestep, we get:-\n\nx-1-n-n-n\n\nAfter another, we get:-\n\ny-x-1-n-n\n\netc. etc.\n\nAlso bear in mind that with the &quot;roving eye&quot; the inputs do change \nbetween each evaluation. The network itself returns instructions to \nthe test loop saying &quot;move my window left&quot; or &quot;move my window up&quot; etc. \nuntil it eventually returns one saying, &quot;I&#39;ve seen enough and I know \nwhat the shape is.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s important to remember that the network is only reset/cleared at \nthe beginning of a test on a particular shape, and during that test \nthe repeated evaluations don&#39;t include a reset.\n\nTo pull this together, you&#39;d get a loop along the following likes:-\n\n---\nReset network.\nChoose random shape and random location for window.\nSet timesteps to 0.\nDo\n   Evaluate network.\n   If result command is &quot;move window&quot;, then move window\nUntil result command is &quot;stop&quot; OR timesteps&gt;maximum\nIf timesteps&gt;maximum then mark network as failure.\nIf result command is &quot;stop&quot; then check whether reported shape is correct.\n---\n\nI hope that clarifies it.\n\nSo you&#39;re correct that propagation through the network is not complete \nat each timestep. But I don&#39;t see why you claim NEAT cannot converge \nunder these circumstances.\n\n--Darren\n\n"}}
