When the vali=\r\ndation scores \nstart\n&gt; &gt; &gt;going down, you stop evolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am usi=\r\nng SharpNEAT and am new to all this so I would \nappreciate a\n&gt; &gt; little mor=\r\ne detail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have implemented two interface, IExperiment and \nINetw=\r\norkEvaluator.\n&gt; &gt; Neither interface appears to have any concept of a genera=\r\ntion or \nof a\n&gt; &gt; champion. It looks to me like I might want/need to subcla=\r\nss\n&gt; &gt; SingleFilePopulationEvaluator so that I can override\n&gt; &gt; EvaluatePop=\r\nulation. I can then call the superclass&#39; \nEvaluatePopulation\n&gt; &gt; and after =\r\nit completes do my validation testing on the\n&gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm&#39;s BestG=\r\nenome. I was then thinking\n&gt; &gt; that once I wished to stop evolution, I coul=\r\nd set the\n&gt; &gt; EvolutionAlgorithm SearchCompleted boolean. Finally, I can mo=\r\ndify\n&gt; &gt; SharpNeatGui&#39;s SearchThread to check the ea&#39;s SearchCompleted \nfla=\r\ng so\n&gt; &gt; that the thread will stop.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Am I on the right track here? =\r\nHow have others handled cross-\nvalidation\n&gt; &gt; and prevention of over-fittin=\r\ng?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Hello Peter,\n&gt; My name is Krasimir=\r\n Trifonov and I am also new in the group.
