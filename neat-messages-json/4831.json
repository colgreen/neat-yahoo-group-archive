Japan, on\nMSNBC, New Scientist etc. It&#39;s weird how easy it is to get attention\nfor something which is not even really research in my view, whereas\nit&#39;s much harder to get attention for more interesting stuff.\n\nDzafar: Now it&#39;s past the first deadline, but the second deadline is\nin about two week&#39;s time... We will change the interface slightly, but\nonly through introducing some new information that the agent can\nchoose whether to use or not.\n\nKen: It seems Jan Koutnik hasn&#39;t put his HyperGP paper online. You can\nmail him and ask. There&#39;s a very short description in our Mario paper:\nhttp://julian.togelius.com/Togelius2009Super.pdf\nFeeding the fine-grained visual information to the agent would\ncertainly be very interesting, and maybe not much harder than the\nchunky feed we have now, at least with HyperNEAT/HyperGP. Maybe we\nshould extend the interface to include this...\n\nJulian\n\n2009/8/7 dzafar.sadik &lt;dzafar.sadik@...&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Julian\n&gt;\n&gt; When are You planning to release stable version of Mario game sources that\n&gt; won&#39;t be changed before the competition (18 September)?\n&gt;\n&gt; And one more question that should be probably asked on google groups :-)\n&gt; Could I deliver my neural network in binary format?\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nJulian Togelius\nAssistant Professor\nIT University of Copenhagen\nRued Langgaards Vej 7\n2300 Copenhagen  S\nDenmark\njulian@...\nhttp://julian.togelius.com\n+46-705-192088\n\n"}}
