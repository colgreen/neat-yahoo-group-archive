In other words, make it like a robot on wheels with a\nheading.  The sensors would be relative to the heading, instead of\nalways pointing in the same direction, i.e. the robot could turn\naround.  I find that kind of sensor array is much more natural than a\nstaticly positioned sensor array, which forces the NN to have to learn\nbasically the same rule over and over again for each sensor.  With\negocentric sensors, the robot can just say &quot;if the target is in the\nforward sensor, go to it.&quot;  The other sensors then just tell it how to\nturn.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Colin Green &lt;cgreen@d...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ok there is another release on the SharpNEAT web site \n&gt; http://www.cgreen.dsl.pipex.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; This includes a deterministic prey capture evaluator as described\nin my \n&gt; previous email. I normally see this solved within 100,000\nevaluations \n&gt; (see new eval counter in the GUI) using the default search\nparameters. \n&gt; Once this task is solved the evaluator switches to the old \n&gt; non-deterministic approach (random start positions, varying prey\ninitial \n&gt; moves and speed) - unfortunately this part didn&#39;t work at all well,\nI \n&gt; didn&#39;t see any improvement, in fact the networks lost some of their\nold \n&gt; ability, presumably because the random trials don&#39;t test every bit\nof \n&gt; functionality and therfore some can be lost from one generation to\nthe \n&gt; next.\n&gt; \n&gt; It did just occur to me though that the non-deterministic trials\ncan be \n&gt; made deterministic very easily by resetting the random number\ngenerator \n&gt; before each set of trials. I just tried this and it does seem to\nwork - \n&gt; the best fitness stabilizes whereas before it could be seen to vary\n- \n&gt; but the best fitness now seems stuck at 61 and 63 out of 64 in the\ntwo \n&gt; trials I am running\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway there is a saved network in the zip that performs perfectly\non \n&gt; the pre-determined tests. In the prey capture evaluator click on\nthe \n&gt; &quot;Initialise [Deterministic]&quot;  button - this loops through the 16\nstart \n&gt; positions. If you then set the prey initial moves to 3 and the\nspeed to \n&gt; 0 and click on the &#39;Step&#39; button to see the deterministic trial. \nYou \n&gt; can of course still run the preycapture simulation automatically\nbut \n&gt; this uses random start positions (distance 0-4) and therefore you\nmay \n&gt; not see perfect results.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin.\n&gt; \n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Kenneth Stanley wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Hey Colin, just out of curiosity what was the fine tuning that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;improved things?  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Hi Ken,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll probably write up what I did in detail on the web site, just \n&gt; &gt;quickly though I had a think about what you said about\nrandomization in \n&gt; &gt;the trials, so whereas before I used 100 randomized trials and\ngradually \n&gt; &gt;increased the difficulty by giving the prey 0 to 4 initial moves an\nthen \n&gt; &gt;increasing it&#39;s speed, I am now running 32 predefined trials. 16\ntests \n&gt; &gt;with the prey starting within sensor range and not moving and\nanother 16 \n&gt; &gt;using the same start positions but allowing the prey 3 initial\nmoves. \n&gt; &gt;The initial moves are also deterministic in that the prey moves\ndirectly \n&gt; &gt;away from the agent and this also has the effect of moving the prey\nout \n&gt; &gt;of sensor range - by then though the agent has received inputs with\nthe \n&gt; &gt;prey&#39;s location, so it has chance to remember where they prey was\nseen. \n&gt; &gt;These tests are passed 100% but do not produce a perfect agent -\nit \n&gt; &gt;still can&#39;t chase moving prey with a 4 move head start in all test \n&gt; &gt;cases, although it does perform pretty well actually :). Anyway\nthis \n&gt; &gt;situation should be resolvable by extending the trials to contain \n&gt; &gt;further more difficult tests or by switching completely to a more \n&gt; &gt;difficult trial  i.e.incremental evolution.  In fact I may be able\nto \n&gt; &gt;revert to my original randomized trials once a good population has\nbeen \n&gt; &gt;found.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Colin.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
