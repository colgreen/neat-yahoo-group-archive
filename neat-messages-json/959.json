You can still represent the full range of values AND \nreduce precision at the same time. This is sort of what is already done \nin Kens NEAT by the using the weight mutation exponent (I think that&#39;s \nwhat it&#39;s called). This effectively defines the size of weight \nmodifications, a larger weight mutation value gives you less possible \nvalues between the minimum and maximum weight, hence reducing the search \nspace. I might be wrong on this one with reagrds to Ken&#39;s NEAT, but the \nidea stands - if you only allow a limited set of values for connection \nweights you limit the search space. You wouldn&#39;t want to limit it too \nmuch, otherwise you might not be able to fully explore the important \nareas of, say, the sigmoid activation function.\n\nColin\n\nUmer Iqbal wrote:\n\n&gt; Since, natural neural networks work good enough :), couldn&#39;t \n&gt; decreasing our precision and allowing multiple connections be a better \n&gt; way of making ANNs?\n&gt; I dont have any idea how this might be achieved.. but I believe that \n&gt; the simpler we keep our domain and smaller our search space, the \n&gt; easier it would be to come up with solutions..\n&gt; If we could give higher probability of changing weights than adding \n&gt; new connections, we would in effect be searching in a concentrated \n&gt; part of the search-space first before moving to higher levels..\n&gt; That brings me to another idea that I once had: Shouldn&#39;t we decrease \n&gt; the precision of our weights?\n&gt; Since searching in let&#39;s say 15 digits after decimal would be many \n&gt; times more difficult than searching in 8-10 digits after decimal.\n&gt; And the results would not differ much.\n&gt; What do the others say?\n&gt; Can we achieve this somehow?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Umer..\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
