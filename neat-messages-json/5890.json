Because recent work has shown that phenotypic/behavioral diversity is=\r\n more effective than genotypic diversity, many people may be switching to p=\r\nhenotypic diversity and abandoning genomic diversity: this work suggests th=\r\nat both may be important. For example, mutations that affect a representati=\r\non deeply may initially hurt the organism&#39;s ability to do something behavio=\r\nrally different/interesting, for the same reason that such mutations hurts =\r\nfitness (e.g. they cripple the organism). Protecting that innovation for a =\r\nwhile may thus pay off.  \n\nI haven&#39;t read your paper yet. But following you=\r\nr argumentation, when profound differences in the genetic code have also a =\r\nrelatively large influence on the phenotype, protecting the phenotypic/beha=\r\nvioral diversity should do the job!? \n\n&gt; In other words, because selection =\r\nwill quickly work to eliminate deep changes, we should probably protect the=\r\nm for a while if we want to see better representations emerge.  \n\nI was won=\r\ndering, whether it could be beneficial to protect phenotypic diversity in C=\r\nPPNs (e.g. in HyperNEAT). Instead of measuring the similarity of the genome=\r\ns, the similarity of the produced patterns could be used to determine which=\r\n individuals belong to which species. The idea is that relatively similar g=\r\nenomes can nevertheless produce differing patterns. Separating them would a=\r\nllow to better exploit the potential of the same genetic code. \n\nBest,\nMart=\r\nin \n\n\n"}}
