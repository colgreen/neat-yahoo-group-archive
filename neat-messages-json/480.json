This is one good reason to use a dynamic\n&gt;speciation threshold: then you could set the target number of species\n&gt;to 10.  The NEAT FAQ explains how to do this.  The problem is in a\n&gt;population with 70 species and 150 networks, you will have a lot of\n&gt;species with 2 or 3 members- not enough to have any real diversity\n&gt;with those tiny species.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOK I need to look into this. I&#39;m not sure what the spread across the \nspecies was - but I agree it seems a high number.\n\n&gt;&gt;Sorry, amalgamate isn&#39;t the right word. Yeh I did mean the\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;refreshing \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;(normalizing?) of the innovation ID&#39;s per generation. I currently \n&gt;&gt;generate a random population by linking each output to a single, \n&gt;&gt;randomly chosen input. My innovation ID&#39;s are being incremented \n&gt;&gt;during this phase - so yeh, I need to change this.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m still not 100% sure I know what you mean.  (For example, the word\n&gt;&quot;normalize&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to fit with what I thought we were talking\n&gt;about) I want to make sure I understand it so that we can catch any\n&gt;potential problem, so could you describe in a little more detail\n&gt;exactly what you do each generation with the innovation ID&#39;s?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSure. This is basically the technique mentioned in the recent \ncoevolution paper (section 3.2, paragraph 3). For each generation two \nlists are maintained, one that stores all of the new connections that \narose from mutations(not those associated with new nodes) and another \nfor all of the new nodes.  I then check the first list to see if any of \nthe connections have the same source and target neuron ID - if so I \nensure that like connections are given the same innovation ID.\n\nFor new nodes I do a similar thing though I&#39;m not sure if you are doing \nthis part - Because new nodes are always added by replacing an existing \nconnection I can therefore check to see if any of the new nodes are \nconnecting from and to the same nodes (by following the two new \nconnections) - and once again ensure that like nodes have the same ID. \nAt this point I can assume that the two new connections associated with \nthe neurons also match - and therefore allocate them like innovation IDs \nalso. I also have to be carefull at all times to make sure that the \nconnnections point to the the updated node IDs!\n\nHope that makes sense. The two lists are thrown away and started again \nper generation, so if the same innovation occurs in different \ngenerations then it will be allocated a different innovation ID and the \nmatching algorithms used by the compatibilty function and recombination \nwill treat them as being different.\n\n&gt;&gt;Thinking about thia again I realise that what I said isn&#39;t 100% \n&gt;&gt;correct. What I actually do is pure roulette wheel selection - but \n&gt;&gt;then the offspring get added to the existing population (therefore \n&gt;&gt;increasing it&#39;s size by 2x). I then cull the least fit 50%. So in \n&gt;&gt;effect I have implemented elitism - but the fittest individuals are \n&gt;&gt;not guaranteed to be selected for reproduction. This final point is \n&gt;&gt;what I&#39;m intending to change.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You do this on a per-species basis right?  In other words, you cull\n&gt;the least fit 50% of each species as opposed to the least fit 50% of\n&gt;the population?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nKen I&#39;m going to take a fresh look at this, it&#39;s code I wrote last year \nand I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s ideally suited to NEAT and it could actually be \nplain wrong! The selection is done per species, I loop through each \nspecies and perform roulette wheel selection to generate offspring. \nAsexual & sexual repro are seperated so that a proportion are created \nasexually (they are mutated) and the reaminder are created via \ncrossover. I use adjusted fitness to determine how many offspring should \nbe generated for each species.  Then I cull of the worst 50% from the \npopulation as a whole - is this bad? I guess this will lead to entire \nweak species being culled which yeh is just plain wrong. \n\nColin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
