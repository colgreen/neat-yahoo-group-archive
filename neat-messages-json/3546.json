This is because there is\n&gt; some intelligence required to perform a good selection. In TBE the\n&gt; intelligence is the static fitness function, in Picbreeder it is the\n&gt; human intelligence. In fact, some pictures may be &quot;in order&quot; but\n&gt; still represent nothing. Perhaps some pattern recognition technique\n&gt; may be involved in the process, but this is still not enough.\n&gt; But it is an interesting idea of NEAT controlling another NEAT. A\n&gt; population of &quot;selector&quot; networks, each one running an evolution.\n&gt; This will take A LOT of CPU time, but it is good for experimenting\n&gt; with. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;John Arrowwood&quot; &lt;jarrowwx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Ken,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You had talked (at length...) about the merits of the human-chooser\n&gt;&gt; verses the goal-oriented evolution.  I&#39;d like to weigh in on it a\n&gt;&gt; little and maybe throw in an idea for how to make things even more\n&gt;&gt; interesting...\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; First of all, there is always a goal.  In one case, the goal is very\n&gt;&gt; strictly defined, in the other, it is more losely defined.  But\n&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; is still a &#39;goal&#39;.  The goal in PicBreeder is &#39;makes me feel good&#39;\n&gt;&gt; which CAN be defined, it just has to be defined in terms of\n&gt; something\n&gt;&gt; we can&#39;t see, which is the neuron firing pattern in our brains.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My hypothesis, though, is that there is a pattern to our internal\n&gt;&gt; choosing of what we like.  And I posit that it may be possible to\n&gt;&gt; LEARN it.  Meaning, create a &#39;chooser&#39; network that also evolves\n&gt;&gt; &#39;interesting&#39; images.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; You see, I think that &#39;recognition&#39; is a key element in deciding\n&gt; what\n&gt;&gt; to choose.  And I think that the method that we use to recognize\n&gt; order\n&gt;&gt; vs. chaos could be modeled.  Sure, recognizing the difference\n&gt; between\n&gt;&gt; two people&#39;s faces would be harder to model, but I think it would be\n&gt;&gt; fairly easy to learn to model the difference between chaos and\n&gt; order.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m thinking you should be able to evolve a network that tends to\n&gt;&gt; choose (rank higher) images of real-world things over images of\n&gt;&gt; random, unstructured noise.  You could take many image chunks the\n&gt; size\n&gt;&gt; of the PicBreeder output images, all of which have some kind of\n&gt;&gt; recognizability and pleasantness to them.  Then create a large\n&gt; number\n&gt;&gt; of counter-examples that are built out of unstructured randomness,\n&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; it pixels or blobs or arcs or whatever.  Then evolve a network that\n&gt;&gt; consistently recognizes the &#39;pleasing&#39; images (ranks them highly)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; recognizes the chaotic images as such and thereby ranks them lower.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; When that&#39;s done, integrate it into the PicBreeder app as\n&gt; a &#39;chooser&#39;\n&gt;&gt; which evolves and evolves until somebody shuts it down.  Whenever it\n&gt;&gt; finds something that it likes more than some threshold, it &#39;saves&#39;\n&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt;  When it likes something more than an even higher threshold, it\n&gt;&gt; publishes it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I predict that there will be a sweet spot for complexity of the\n&gt;&gt; PicBreeder image generating networks.  For a while, as complexity\n&gt;&gt; grows, the chooser network will rank the images higher and higher.\n&gt;&gt; But I suspect that at some point, that trend will reverse.  The\n&gt; number\n&gt;&gt; of highly ranked images as a percentage of all evolved images at a\n&gt;&gt; particular complexity level will get lower as the complexity rises\n&gt;&gt; above that sweet spot.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I would also like to mention that combining such a &#39;general coolness\n&gt;&gt; chooser&#39; with a goal-oriented chooser could be quite interesting.\n&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; two could work together synergistically to help walk the search\n&gt; space\n&gt;&gt; faster.  Problem may be to generate that chooser correctly to begin\n&gt;&gt; with.  But my instincts tell me that one that is evolved to find\n&gt;&gt; regularity in an image and finds &#39;pleasing&#39; relationships between\n&gt;&gt; them, such as the one described above, would be adequate to use in\n&gt;&gt; conjunction with a goal-oriented evolution of the CPPN networks for\n&gt;&gt; who-knows-what.  The reason I say that is that I suspect that the\n&gt; same\n&gt;&gt; &#39;regularities&#39; that make for a &#39;pleasing&#39; image are the same\n&gt;&gt; characteristics that lead to a functional CPPN network.  But I&#39;m\n&gt; sure\n&gt;&gt; you would know better based on your experiences working with them.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Just thought I&#39;d throw that out there for you to think about.\n&gt;&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; John Arrowwood\n&gt;&gt; John (at) Hanlons Razor (dot) com\n&gt;&gt; John (at) Arrowwood Photography (dot) com\n&gt;&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; http://arrowwood.blogspot.com\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
