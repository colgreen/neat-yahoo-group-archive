The demo is available here and runs in\n&gt; Windows:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/Evolved/NEATHopper.asp\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I bring this program up is it is an excellent demonstration\n&gt; of how NEAT works, and how it should work.  It also has a lot of great\n&gt; interface and visualization ideas.  I believe it would be helpful to\n&gt; play with for anyone newly working with NEAT.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suggest running it first with only the following options checked:\n&gt; -Only draw better (only shows you when a champ improves)\n&gt; -Real-time draw  (draws at a real-world frame rate)\n&gt; -Joint limits  (doesnt let piece of the hopper move through each\n&gt; other)\n&gt; -Foot trace (shows the path it took)\n&gt; -Shadows (look nice)\n&gt;\n&gt; To speed things up, I would also uncheck &quot;multi-run,&quot; which doesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem necessary.  (The program starts with this option checked by\n&gt; default)\n&gt;\n&gt; The &quot;Forward Distance&quot; fitness measure is probably the best for\n&gt; demonstration purposes, but I also found &quot;Standtime&quot; interesting,\n&gt; where\n&gt; the hopper learns to balance without falling.\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing that is very useful to watch in this demo is how the\n&gt; networks complexify as the hopper learns to get farther and farther\n&gt; down the track.  You can actually watch the complexification by\n&gt; choosing the &quot;Champview&quot; tab in the stats window.  I suggest sitting\n&gt; down for a good  150 generations (which only takes a few minutes) and\n&gt; watching how complexification contributes to function.  (Note that\n&gt; sometimes the champ becomes simpler, not because NEAT simplified the\n&gt; network, but because a simpler species outpaced a more complex one,\n&gt; since NEAT keeps lots of different complexities in the population!)\n&gt;\n&gt; The other useful thing is the &quot;fitness spread&quot; tab, which shows the\n&gt; fitness of the entire population, color-coded by species.  So if you\n&gt; keep this tab on, you can see species growing and shrinking over time\n&gt; depending how good they are, and also you can see new species coming\n&gt; in, and how sometimes a new species immediately introduces something\n&gt; good, and sometimes an old species keeps gradually improving.  It\n&gt; really gives you a sense of how fitness sharing should work.\n&gt; (Though I don&#39;t know if Mattias used a dynamic speciation threshold,\n&gt; which may improve things even more)\n&gt;\n&gt; I really think that this demo can help beginners to understand NEAT in\n&gt; a way that verbal explanations cannot, so I hope people take an\n&gt; opporunity to check it out.\n&gt;\n&gt; ken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
