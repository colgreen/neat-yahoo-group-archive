Since XOR \nhas traditionally been the first test, most bugs or problems end up \nbeing exposed and fixed during XOR.  For those of you who have been \nthrough this process, can you comment briefly on what you remember \nabout how the problems you encountered that initially stopped you \nfrom solving XOR?  For example, was it weight mutation parameters \nbeing too high/low, problems with the speciation setup, etc...?  I \nwould like to compile people&#39;s experiences with this and put it in \nthe FAQ since it seems to inevitably come up whenever someone tries \nto write their own version of NEAT, and it would be great if we \ncould prevent people from having to go through the same trial and \nerror process each time by having a record of the usual problems \nthat came up.  Thanks very much, I appreciate any recollections :)\n\n(For those who don&#39;t remember what the problem was with their XOR, \nusually it was manifested as hitting a plateau level and not being \nable to get over it.  Then usually you fixed a few things and \nsuddenly NEAT could easily cross the plateau.)\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
