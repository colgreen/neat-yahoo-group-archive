All of the main math libraries with matrix\noptimizations have support for sparse matrices and a handful of\nstandard compressed formats, CSR being the main format:\n\n    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_.28CSR.2C_CRS_or_Yale_format.29\n\nE.g. CUDA has support, as does Intel MKL, ATLAS, OpenBLAS, etc. E.g.:\n\n    https://developer.nvidia.com/cusparse\n    https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/471374\n\nHowever, the performance compared to dense matrices is far less in\nterms of number of connections handled per sec, because fundamentally\nthe data is no longer in contiguous chunks that can be loaded,\noperated on, and stored, in efficient hardware vector operations. But\nthere is still a boost to be had, especially on GPUs where you have\nlots of parallel compute units as well as vector instructions.\n\nIt may also be possible to analyse the connectivity graph to assign a\nlayer number to each node, and then use one matrix between each pair\nof layers that are connected, because in NEAT we have no restriction\non which nodes are connected to each other (e.g. layer 1 connecting\ndirectly to layer 10, or in even layer 10 connecting to layer 1 (as an\naside, in sharpneat I define depth in cyclic nets as the minimum\nnumber of hops to get to a node from the input layer). The idea/hope\nbeing that each intra-layer matrix would be dense enough that we could\nuse dense matrix format with zero weights for the absent connections.\nHowever, unless they are reasonably dense then this won&#39;t outperform a\nsingle large sparse matrix.\n\nWe could also conceive of modifying NEAT so that it evolved structure\nmore conducive to the optimizations that are available, so e.g.\nevolving actual layers where connectivity is strictly enforced to be\nbetween adjacent layers. My hunch is that there may be merit to this\napproach.\n\nIn HyerNEAT we get to define the substrate by hand, so the networks\ntend to be more regular and dense, so I believe dense matrices could\nbe a big boost in running the final networks, but not CPPNs because\nthey have the above discussed problems - since CPPNs are essentially\nNEAT but with the added problem of allowing different activation\nfunctions per node (maybe I should call that heterogeneous node\nactivation functions).\n\nI&#39;m working towards experimenting with some of the above ideas, but my\ncurrent focus is on a large scale code re-organisation so I&#39;m not\nworking on these ideas right now.\n\nWhile I&#39;m here - where can I find a high level description of your K^2 graphs?\n\nColin\n\n"}}
