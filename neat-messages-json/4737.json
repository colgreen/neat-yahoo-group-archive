I think there is enough precedent for =\r\nstep 1 that it could be realistically achieved.  Of course, step 2 is more =\r\nspeculative.\n\nFor step 1, my question is whether it is necessary to regard =\r\nthe individual robots that make up the full organism as being separate for =\r\nthe purposes of evolving the controller?  That is, would it not work to sim=\r\nply regard it as a single whole and ignore the individual separations?  Tha=\r\nt way you could just evolve one monolithic controller for the assembly.  Ho=\r\nwever, I can imagine that it might not be possible to do that depending on =\r\nyour communication constraints.  In any case, HyperNEAT can represent it ei=\r\nther way.  If the identity of each robot matters, you can certainly input t=\r\nhe location along the organism to the CPPN as additional information, and t=\r\nhat could indeed be helpful.  \n\nStep 2 (evolving the morphology) sounds ver=\r\ny interesting butis a much more open problem.  I think interleaving might b=\r\ne more effective than simply doing a meta-search in which every potential m=\r\norphology is evaluated through an entire evolution run to find a controller=\r\n for it.  That sounds very expensive.  After all, in nature both brain and =\r\nbody evolve together so presumably it can happen here too.  \n\nAlso, the rep=\r\nresentation of the morphology (i.e. how it is translated from the CPPN outp=\r\nut) will be very critical and deserves careful thought. \n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;evertwh2004&quot; &lt;evert@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am in=\r\nvolved in a modular robotics project (www.symbrion.eu), where we are develo=\r\nping robots that can hook onto each other to create &#39;organisms&#39; that consis=\r\nt of linked robots. The robots can manipulate the link(s), e.g., to lift ea=\r\nch other. Recently, Jeff Clune (hi Jeff) introduced me to hyperNEAT, and it=\r\n looks like just the ticket to address two issues that we have to tackle. S=\r\no here I am, excited newbie and all.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, I want to try and use hype=\r\nrNEAT to evolve gaits for organisms with pre-defined shapes (e.g., spiders,=\r\n snakes). The idea is to develop a single genome that determines the weight=\r\ns for neural nets in each of the individual robots that make up the organis=\r\nm, so I would expect to pass the coordinates of nodes within the individual=\r\n NN, but also about the location of the individual in the organism (possibl=\r\ny related to some central node or whatever).\n&gt; \n&gt; The next step will be to =\r\nuse hyperNEAT&#39;s CPPNs to evolve morphologies for organisms. I&#39;m thinking of=\r\n a 3D grid where the CPPN assigns some value to each cell which defines, ac=\r\ncording to some threshold, whether a robot goes in that spot or not. The fi=\r\ntness of the CPPN would be the level of success in evolving a gait for the =\r\nresulting shape as described above. Another method of combining morphology =\r\nand gait development would be to interleave them in some way (waves hands).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So...does that sound like a good plan, are there any pointers to rela=\r\nted work? Do&#39;s and don&#39;ts? Expressions of interest, ridicule or awe?\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nIA,\n&gt; \n&gt; Evert Haasdijk\n&gt; VU Amsterdam\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
