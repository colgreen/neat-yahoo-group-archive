For\nexample, if you wanted a repeating sub-module that included different\nactivation functions, those activations should  come from the CPPN\ngenerating that sub-module. Otherwise we are more or less back to a direct\nencoding (or, a generative encoding trying to appropriately map onto a\nseparate generative encoding that is changing across evolutionary time).\n\nVery cool that you have already tested it and it works. :-)\n\n\n\n\nCheers,\nJeff Clune\n\nDigital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n\njclune@...\n517.214.1060\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: Kenneth Stanley &lt;kstanley@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sat, 19 Jan 2008 21:40:39 -0000\n&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [neat] Re: HyperNeat\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve read through all the messages on this thread and Luca can\n&gt; correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I believe that what Colin suggested is\n&gt; what Luca also means to suggest, i.e. that CPPNs could in some way\n&gt; define the activation functons in the substrate as well as the\n&gt; connection weights.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s a good question and several people have touched on ways to do\n&gt; this.  My view is that the best way is to include a separate CPPN\n&gt; output that determines activation functions in the same CPPN that\n&gt; defines connection weights.  It is true that that output is\n&gt; overspecified because it returns a value for 4 inputs instead of 2,\n&gt; but you can just make a convention that you only read it e.g. when\n&gt; the last two are both (0,0).  Note that this is just an arbitrary\n&gt; convention, but it removes the overspecification.  The reason I think\n&gt; this approach is better than coevolving is that the mathematical and\n&gt; geometric reltationships that describe the regularities in the\n&gt; connection weights end up in the hidden nodes of the CPPN, and these\n&gt; very same relationships are likely relevant to the pattern of\n&gt; activation functions in the substrate as well.  So if you separate\n&gt; out the CPPN that determines activation functions, then it cannot\n&gt; take advantage of what is known internally from generating connection\n&gt; weights, and vice-versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; We have already tried this approach as a way of generating node\n&gt; biases (which is sometimes an important capability) and we have found\n&gt; it to work effectively.  That is, the node bias is determined by a\n&gt; second CPPN output that is read for the node at x1 y1 when x2=0 and\n&gt; y2=0.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hi Colin-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That does make sense. It would be really cool to see how either of\n&gt; those\n&gt;&gt; suggestions works. Even cooler would be a comparison of the two. My\n&gt; guess is\n&gt;&gt; that the separate, co-evolved strategy would work better because it\n&gt; would be\n&gt;&gt; less constrained.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do you have any test problems in mind? Problems that require the\n&gt; use of many\n&gt;&gt; different types of activation functions?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Cheers,\n&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; jclune@...\n&gt;&gt; 517.214.1060\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Colin Green &lt;locster01@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Reply-To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Date: Sat, 19 Jan 2008 16:18:50 +0000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &quot;neat@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [neat] Re: HyperNeat\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Luca,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you suggesting a fixed network structure? And then we get the\n&gt; activation\n&gt;&gt;&gt; function for each node by querying a CPPN?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Technically CPPN would be the wrong term there but hopefully you\n&gt; all\n&gt;&gt;&gt; understand what I mean. Ken and others, another way of looking at\n&gt; it is that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the CPPN as well as outputting connection strength between two\n&gt; nodes, also\n&gt;&gt;&gt; outputs a value which tells us what activation function to use\n&gt; (although\n&gt;&gt;&gt; each connection has two end points of course). A better way to do\n&gt; this might\n&gt;&gt;&gt; be to have an entirely separate co-evolved genome that describes\n&gt; a network\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that accepts a single substrate coordinate and outputs parameters\n&gt; for a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; parameterised activation function.
