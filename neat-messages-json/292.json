The graphics are quite valuable,\nin my opinion.  I would like to add graphics to some\nof my own projects; I&#39;m currently seeking a\ncollaborator to take on that responsibility.\n\nSome of those applications are new, right?  Like for\nexample the &quot;Obstacle Navigator&quot;.  I have not seen\nthat before.  I think that&#39;s a very interesting\napplication.\n\nHere is a suggested extension of the &quot;Obstacle\nNavigator&quot; problem which would require the ANN to make\nactive use of memory:  When the navigator gets to the\nend of the path it is required to return to the\nstarting point.  The fitness is reduced by the time or\nnumber of steps taken to return, hence the ANN needs\nto be able to remember the way back and not have to\nfeel its way.  Basically, the robot navigator feels\nits way out, but then returns much more quickly by\nremembering the path and following its memory model.\nI think this is a challenge that NEAT would be capable\nof, and it will be an impressive feat (A NEAT FEAT).\n\nAnimals do that all the time, of course.\n\n=====\nMitchell Timin\nhttp://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFree Pop-Up Blocker - Get it now\nhttp://companion.yahoo.com/\n\n"}}
