There is also some benefit to\npurging the record of past genomes as the population evolves away from\nolder structures. Perhaps each genome in the history could have a\ndecaying cache hit count. And perhaps we could draw some ideas from\ngarbage collection algorithms where objects exist in one of  2 or 3\ngenerations - (1)high turnover, (2)been around for a while and (3)\nstructures that seem to stick around.\n\nI reckon with a bit of thought a fairly simple scheme could eliminate\n90 to 95% of the redundant evaulations. Motivation would of course be\ngreater if that 10% was shown to increase as time went on or with\nlarger pops, etc.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
