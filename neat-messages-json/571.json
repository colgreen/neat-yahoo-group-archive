I&#39;m hoping to start a phd in fall &#39;05\n&gt; (since i missed the app deadlines for this next year). Any suggestions at\n&gt; universities in the US doing interesting work? (UT already turned me down\n&gt; once ... I wonder if I should reapply?)\n\nI think there was a thread about this before, but I don&#39;t remember. I&#39;ve\nmet with both Rik Belew at UCSD and also Jordan Pollack who is at\nBrandeis. Both of them seem to be doing research that you would be\ninterested in. Also there is a group in Florida I think, with Annie Wu,\nbut I&#39;m not too familiar with her work.\n\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m hoping to find some position next year (fall &#39;04) as a research\n&gt; assistant or something ... any suggestions about places that might hire\n&gt; non-phds?\n\nYou might want to look into some corporate research labs. I know IBM\nResearch hires even undergrad interns, and I&#39;m pretty sure there are a few\nother places around the country. As for academic labs, I&#39;m not sure what\nthe policies are like. Ken might be able to add some insight.\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
