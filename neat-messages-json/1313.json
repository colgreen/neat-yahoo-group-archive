It is still making improvements, \nand \n&gt; maybe i&#39;ll see magic when i get home again, but i&#39;m still \ndissapointed. \n&gt; The chance of adding a node is set to 2%, so i&#39;m crossing my \nfingers \n&gt; that it&#39;s just being slow and carefull.\n&gt; Is there any science to prdicting the size/complexity of a domain \nbefore \n&gt; starting? My experiment is to find a network that solves a cross \n&gt; product. that seems really simple, but it is proving difficult.\n&gt; chad\n\n\n"}}
