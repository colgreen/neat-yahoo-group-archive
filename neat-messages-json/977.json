The likelihood of a neuron being able\n&gt; to be coopted into useful service is much higher than the chances of finding\n&gt; a use for the appendix.  So the analogy doesn&#39;t quite hold.\n\nI don&#39;t think Colin and Ken were arguing exclusively for a single\nneuron to be adapted.  I think they were referring to whole chunks of\nnetworks suddenly being connected and becoming useful, which *would*\nbe akin to an appendix suddenly springing into service.\n\nBut again, if we&#39;re just talking about a single neuron, why not just\nallow for a single mutation to bring about that new functionality,\ninstead of keeping redundant features around, waiting for them to be\nconnected?  The former is much more efficient than the latter.\n\nIf you&#39;re talking about just connecting a single neuron into the\nnetwork that was just hanging around unconnected beforehand, that&#39;s\nlogically equivalent to mutating a new neuron and two connections\nbetween two existing neurons, right?  Why not add this type of\nmutation to your GA, rather than have a whole bunch of neurons that\ndon&#39;t do *anything* until a connection mutates to link them up with\nthe rest of the functioning network?\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
