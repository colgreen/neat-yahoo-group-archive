I have read the FAQ on this web page : http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanle=\r\ny/neat.html but I have not found answers to my problems.\nI converted the Bu=\r\nckland implementation from C++ to C (I am not comfortable with C++) : https=\r\n://github.com/alinehuf/neattest. \nI tried the XOR test as decribed by Stanl=\r\ney in &quot;Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies&quot;, but I had a=\r\n really poor result. My program found a solution 981 times out of 1000 test=\r\ns (98%) and it tooks an average of 184 generations and a solution has 5 hid=\r\nden nodes=85\n\nI tried to change my implementation to make it look more like=\r\n the Stanley&#39;s neat 1.1 (reproduction and delta coding). In his article &quot;Ev=\r\nolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies&quot; he said that NEAT can=\r\n solde the XOR problem 100% of the time, in an average of 32 generations an=\r\nd 2,35 hidden nodes=85 but even with the modifications the results of my pr=\r\nogram are always disappointing (100% solution found in an average of 130 ge=\r\nneration and with 5 hidden neurons)=85 \n\nBuckland uses parameters quite dif=\r\nferent from those of Stanley especially concerning the penalization or bonu=\r\ns awarded to the species :\niYoungBonusAgeThreshhold =3D&gt; 10\ndYoungFitnessBo=\r\nnus =3D&gt; Stanley 1.0  - Buckland 1.3\niOldAgeThreshold =3D&gt; Stanley 15   - B=\r\nuckland 50\ndOldAgePenalty =3D&gt; Stanley 0.01 - Buckland 0.7\nI tested both se=\r\nts of parameters without any significant difference in the average result f=\r\nor the 1000 tests.\n\nI tried different variations in reproductive functions,=\r\n speciation, mutation ... but without more success.\n\nWhen I look at my log =\r\nfile, I realize that the best species (or best genome) dies regularly. Some=\r\ntimes the best species doesn&#39;t evolve for some generation and is fatally pe=\r\nnalized. The best species doesn&#39;t reproduce and then the best fitness disap=\r\npears=85\n\nMy goal is to use NEAT to evaluate the final positions of games i=\r\nn General Game Playing. If NEAT can predict the score, then I hope to be ab=\r\nle to use the network generated to evaluate non-terminal positions. But for=\r\n the moment, I do not manage to achieve satisfactory results with the simpl=\r\ne XOR problem and I do not know what could be the problem. Do you have any =\r\nadvice or tips?\n\nBest regards,\nAline Huf.\n\n\n"}}
