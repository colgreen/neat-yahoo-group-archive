During a NEAT search my intention was \nto not mutate any of the neuron functions once a neuron had been \ncreated, primarily because most of the functions are distinct from one \nanother and therefore there is no smooth transition from one function to \nanother. Thus most such mutations would be detrimental.\n\nBut could we actually provide a smooth evolutionary path between the \ndistinct functions? One way to do this would be to calculate all of the \nfunctions all of the time and then apply a weighting to each one. We can \nthen mutate the weights applied to each function and thus provide a \nsmooth pathway between any one function and another. This also \nintroduces the intriguing possibility of finding compound functions that \ndescribe shapes we might not have deemed useful previously.\n\nThis is all inspired by thinking about how biological neurons might \nwork, although I don&#39;t know if this is what actually happens.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
