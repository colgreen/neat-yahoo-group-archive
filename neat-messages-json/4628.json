It&#39;s the most extensiv=\r\ne study published on the effect of varying geometry on HyperNEAT performanc=\r\ne.  Some of its results are quite interesting.  \n\nFor example, it suggests =\r\nthat HyperNEAT is still significantly better than a direct encoding encodin=\r\ng even if its geometry is randomized! (Although it is still worse than an e=\r\nngineered geometry.)  Jeff and I have discussed how to interpret this resul=\r\nt and my own opinion is that most randomized geometries nevertheless still =\r\nhave some useful geometry, and something is better than nothing.  So it sug=\r\ngests that you don&#39;t have to necessarily hit on the &quot;perfect&quot; substrate geo=\r\nmetry to get traction out of HyperNEAT.\n\nYet I think a big question that em=\r\nerges from this result is whether it is somehow tied specifically to the qu=\r\nadruped domain.  It is possible that it has something to with the fact that=\r\n a quadruped can get along pretty well if all its legs move in tandem, so y=\r\nou have the opportunity to represent that repetition regardless of how the =\r\nlegs are organized geometrically.  It is possible that other types of syste=\r\nms are less geometrically forgiving, though that remains to be seen.\n\nOf co=\r\nurse, in practice, if the right geometry is even partially clear, the resul=\r\ntant informed substrate configuration is probably going to be better than a=\r\n random geometry.  The &quot;engineered&quot; geometries (meaning they are designed b=\r\ny a human to make sense) still outperform the random ones in the paper, eve=\r\nn as the random ones outperform the direct encoding.\n\nAnyway, in my view, t=\r\nhe most important implication is that geometry matters.  If you can constru=\r\nct a sensible geometry, HyperNEAT will indeed take advantage of it to learn=\r\n the task.  And even if it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s better than having no geomet=\r\nric knowledge at all.\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all-\n&gt; \n&gt; Below is a link to a new HyperNEAT paper t=\r\nhat I will present at GECCO 2009\n&gt; this summer. It studies how sensitive Hy=\r\nperNEAT is to different geometric\n&gt; representations of the same problem.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I am especially excited about this paper because it was nominated for th=\r\ne\n&gt; Best Paper Award in the Generative and Developmental Systems track. If =\r\nyou\n&gt; are going to GECCO this year, and enjoyed the paper, please keep it i=\r\nn mind\n&gt; when casting your ballot.\n&gt; \n&gt; The paper can be viewed here:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nhttps://www.msu.edu/~jclune/webfiles/publications/Clune-HyperNEATSensitivit=\r\ny\n&gt; ToGeometry.pdf\n&gt; \n&gt; Abstract:\n&gt; \n&gt; HyperNEAT, a generative encoding for=\r\n evolving artificial neural networks\n&gt; (ANNs), has the unique and powerful =\r\nability to exploit the geometry of a\n&gt; problem (e.g., symmetries) by encodi=\r\nng ANNs as a function of a problem&#39;s\n&gt; geometry. This paper provides the fi=\r\nrst extensive analysis of the\n&gt; sensitivity of HyperNEAT to different geome=\r\ntric representations of a\n&gt; problem. Understanding how geometric representa=\r\ntions affect the quality of\n&gt; evolved solutions should improve future desig=\r\nns of such representations.\n&gt; HyperNEAT has been shown to produce coordinat=\r\ned gaits for a simulated\n&gt; quadruped robot with a specific two-dimensional =\r\ngeometric representation.\n&gt; Here, the same problem domain is tested, but wi=\r\nth different geometric\n&gt; representations of the problem. Overall, experimen=\r\nts show that the quality\n&gt; and kind of solutions produced by HyperNEAT can =\r\nbe substantially affected by\n&gt; the geometric representation. HyperNEAT outp=\r\nerforms a direct encoding\n&gt; control even with randomized geometric represen=\r\ntations, but performs even\n&gt; better when a human engineer designs a represe=\r\nntation that reflects the\n&gt; actual geometry of the robot. Unfortunately, ev=\r\nen choices in geometric\n&gt; layout that seem to be inconsequential a priori c=\r\nan significantly affect\n&gt; fitness. Additionally, a geometric representation=\r\n can bias the type of\n&gt; solutions generated (e.g., make left-right symmetry=\r\n more common than\n&gt; front-back symmetry). The results suggest that HyperNEA=\r\nT practitioners can\n&gt; obtain good results even if they do not know how to g=\r\neometrically represent\n&gt; a problem, and that further improvements are possi=\r\nble with a well-chosen\n&gt; geometric representation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As always, I =\r\nlook forward to any questions or comments you may have.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Jeff=\r\n Clune\n&gt; \n&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt; \n&gt; jclune@..=\r\n.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
