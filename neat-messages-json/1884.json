I tend to forget him because I \nhardly \n&gt; ever met him.  But of course you are quite right, and he has a \nwhole group \n&gt; using ANN&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m looking forward to the CIG conference, by the way, even \nthough my\n&gt; &gt;own contribution might not be the most exciting stuff around it \nlooks\n&gt; &gt;like there will be lots of interesting papers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ones I saw looked very good.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a welcome contrast, because I reviewed a couple for a \ngraphics/games \n&gt; conference just before, and they were frankly lame.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ian\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Julian\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
