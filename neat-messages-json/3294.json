We can speculate on the =\r\nright approach in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; case \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and I have my hunches) but we won=\r\n&#39;t know until we do some \n&gt; &gt; experiments \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and try ideas out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To give some of my thoughts, perhaps the most obvious thing is \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nimilar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to what you suggest:  Have two separate input sets, one for \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;type A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; info&quot; and one for &quot;type B info.&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nway this would look is e.g. if A was 2D and B was 2D then \nthe \n&gt; &gt; CPPN \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; would have 4 inputs, 2 represent A source nodes and 2 \n&gt; representing =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; B \n&gt; &gt; &gt; soource nodes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then, I would still have only one=\r\n set of outputs.  I am still a \n&gt; &gt; little \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unclear on why you say th=\r\ne outputs are from the second \n&gt; substrate?  \n&gt; &gt; In \n&gt; &gt; &gt; my understandin=\r\ng, this is still all one substrate, it&#39;s just \nthat \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; collects=\r\n inputs from two different sources.  But it can still \n&gt; exist \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with =\r\nonly one set of outputs.  So if the outputs are 2D, the \nCPPN \n&gt; &gt; would \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; have 2 more inputs representing the output area for a total of \n6 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n inputs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (and one output representing the weight of a connection in t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If there was a hidden layer you could ha=\r\nve it exist in either \nthe \n&gt; &gt; same \n&gt; &gt; &gt; geometry as A, the same geometr=\r\ny as B, or the same geometry as \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; outputs.  (For example by int=\r\nroducing a z dimension to any of \n&gt; &gt; these)  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Or you could have each=\r\n kind of hidden layer all at once.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, as you note, the=\r\nre are a lot of ways to do something \n&gt; &gt; like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this.  I think it wil=\r\nl be a great issue to explore, but it may \n&gt; &gt; require \n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with=\r\n a very simple domain that isolates the issue \n(i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; orthogonal inpu=\r\nt types) so we can concentrate on that rather \nthan \n&gt; &gt; on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; specif=\r\nic domain with its own complications.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One other issue to note =\r\nis that even if two sets of inputs are \nin \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effect unrelated, it may =\r\nnot necessarily hurt antyhing to put \n&gt; them \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same geomet=\r\nry.  For example, they could be two separate \n&gt; planes \n&gt; &gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the s=\r\name cube.  On the face of it, it seems like that could \ncause \n&gt; &gt; &gt; proble=\r\nms, but we don&#39;t yet know whether the situation is that \n&gt; &gt; difficult \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; to deal with in practice.  There could also be hidden \n&gt; relationships \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are not obvious but still exploitable in a surprising way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Thomas Johnson&quot; \n&lt;thomas.j.johnson@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HyperNE=\r\nAT folks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s the recommended strategy for handling inp=\r\nuts that \n&gt; &gt; represent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that are not geometrically =\r\nrelated?
