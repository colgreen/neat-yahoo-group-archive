In a stagnant situation, you do not have information (i.e. a\n&gt; gradient) suggesting which direction is right to go.  Therefore, the most\n&gt; principled response is to expand your options while never putting all your\n&gt; eggs in one basket.  When fitness is stagnant, we cannot know if further\n&gt; search within the currently dimensionality might eventually find a solution,\n&gt; or if the current dimensionality is insufficient and contains no solution at\n&gt; all.  In the latter case, the number of nodes and connections would need to\n&gt; ascend to higher dimensionality.  Because we do not know which case we are in\n&gt; when stagnation occurs, the best idea is to try both:  Some species start\n&gt; arriving with bigger networks while others keep searching in the same old\n&gt; spaces.  Thus, we would expect the *range* of sizes to increase along with the\n&gt; average size.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your situation with nondeterminism is probably somewhat similar, causing the\n&gt; average size of solutions to go up because of stagnation.  However, because\n&gt; the champion will keep changing with the randomized evaluation, you will\n&gt; observe this phenomenon in the champion itself.  The more noisy it is, the\n&gt; more it is probably observable (i.e. because the more &quot;random&quot; it is who\n&gt; happens to look best at any given time, in effect leading to a kind of\n&gt; sampling of the population through the champion).\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, that may not be a complete explanation for the steep angle of the\n&gt; incline.  I would guess that nondeterminism is also causing a general\n&gt; unhealthiness about the evolutionary process overall. Nondeterminism is highly\n&gt; destructive to evolutionary algorithms.  This issue is controversial (even\n&gt; within my own group!) but my personal opinion is one should avoid\n&gt; nondeterminism unless it is absolutely essential.  For example, you can choose\n&gt; a random order of examples but then subject everyone to the same random set -\n&gt; a kind of &quot;deterministic randomness.&quot;  Of course, you are banking on the\n&gt; impartiality of randomness to give you maximal generality, but it will often\n&gt; be outweighed by its unhealthy side effects on the population.  So I&#39;m\n&gt; guessing that part of the phenomenon is just a side-effect of an inconsistent\n&gt; evaluation scheme leading to relative chaos.\n&gt; \n&gt; There may also be more to it; it merits further investigation as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hello Ken-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I am plotting the number of CPPN nodes in the generation champion.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This fitness function is not deterministic (here I am running the bit\n&gt;&gt; mirroring problem, and I randomly generate 10 different sets of inputs per\n&gt;&gt; organism per generation). If you look closely at the fitness graph of the\n&gt;&gt; first image you can see that the fitness line is jumping around a lot\n&gt;&gt; (though the variation is low).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In the second plot, interestingly, the two runs that have a constant\n&gt;&gt; environment (which happens to be deterministic) do not see the huge increase\n&gt;&gt; in CPPN number (it levels out at a healthy level of about 30). The changing\n&gt;&gt; environments, however, have the runaway CPPN bloat.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Is there something in NEAT that causes bloat unless you have elitism\n&gt;&gt; counteracting it? If so, my non-deterministic environments might prevent\n&gt;&gt; elitism from fighting bloat.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Have any of you ever turned off elitism and looked at the effect on genome\n&gt;&gt; size? This may be affecting NEAT as much as HyperNEAT. Alternately, have any\n&gt;&gt; of you looked at genome size in non-deterministic environments?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also of interest: I tend to plot the genome node number only for the\n&gt;&gt; champion, which may be held down due to elitism (when fitness flat lines).\n&gt;&gt; Have any of you plotted the average number of genome nodes?

If you have elitism, wouldn&#39;t the same champion stick around\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unchanged?  Perhaps you are seeing that new individuals occasionally come in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with the same fitness as the champion, but it would be very surprising if\n&gt;&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is happening on every single generation.  Yet that would seem to be the only\n&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility with the number of champion nodes going up so rapidly even while\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fitness is flatlined.  So what is going on during the fitness plateau?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Which\n&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes exactly are being measured to get the node counts?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ken\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Jeff Clune &lt;jclune@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello all-\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been noticing in many of my HyperNEAT runs recently that the number\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of CPPN nodes is shooting up as a steep linear function of time\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (generations), and is relatively unaffected by the fitness trajectory of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; run. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See here, for example\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-1.png\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets really pathological, with almost 25 CPPN nodes being\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; added\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every 100 generations, such as here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.msu.edu/~jclune/delme/CPPN-Node-Bloat-2.png\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oddly, and interestingly, the runs in this second figure where the CPPN\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; node\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; count linearly increases are in a changing environment and those runs where\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the CPPN node count flatlines (at a healthy level) are in a constant\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; environment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are any of you seeing such bloat?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One problem is that it makes the runs slow to a crawl, because running\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; populations with 200-node genomes is really slow. Moreover, I doubt\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolution can make too much progress with that many nodes (although I have\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen fitness continue to increase even with such large genomes).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have tried dropping the MutateAddNodeProbability from 0.03 to 0.003 and\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that definitely changes the slope of the line, but it still linearly\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; increases. The good news is that it does not affect fitness to much.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts? \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Clune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Digital Evolution Lab, Michigan State University\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jclune@\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; www.msu.edu/~jclune\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
