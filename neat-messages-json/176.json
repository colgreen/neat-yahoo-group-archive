Aren&#39;t\n&gt; patents  supposed to \n&gt; contain/define something that is unique and distinct\n&gt; from what has been \n&gt; done before. \n\nWell, they *should* be, but I&#39;ve heard quite a bit of\ncirticism of our patenting procedures (e.g., the U.S.\nPatent Office has apparently issued patents for how to\nmake toast and techniques for swinging on playground\nswings).\n\n&gt; Nothing wrong with a healthy dose of skepticism, it\n&gt; is the basis of \n&gt; scientific discovery after all. I suspect you may be\n&gt; jumping the gun \n&gt; though, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a thouroughly nice chap.\n\nI don&#39;t know how *nice* he is, but maybe you&#39;re right.\n At least there are some references for his\ncredentials.  He does use very broad, grandiose\nrhetoric regarding neural networks (e.g., he calls\nneural networks &quot;brains&quot;, &quot;The brains will be trained\nto solve a famous engineering problem: balancing an\ninverted pendulum.&quot;).  I suppose he does so in order\nto try to impress prospective investors.\n\nFair enough.  \n\nDerek\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nExclusive Video Premiere - Britney Spears\nhttp://launch.yahoo.com/promos/britneyspears/\n\n"}}
