So please feel free=\r\n \nto share your thoughts.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that opening the a=\r\nrchives to public \nviewing was probably not the best idea in retrospect.  T=\r\nhere is one \ngood motivation for doing so, which is that it makes them \npot=\r\nentially searchable from outside engines.  However, on balance I \nbelieve i=\r\nt is now apparent after we have run this experiment for a \ncouple months th=\r\nat this benefit is outweighed by the downsides:\n\nIn particular I think open=\r\ning the archives has significantly \ndeterred non-members from joining the g=\r\nroup.  The surface-level \neffect of this deterrence is simply that the grou=\r\np grows less \nquickly.  However, there is a more concerning secondary effec=\r\nt, \nwhich is that when you do not join, you are less likely to post even \ni=\r\nf you have something worth contributing, because it would require \njoining =\r\nto do so.  Therefore, the net effect is stagnant growth and \na general sque=\r\nlching of broader discussion and fresh new input from \noutside.\n\nI also bel=\r\nieve there is a more subtle tertiary effect on existing \nmembers, which is =\r\nthat now that you don&#39;t need to log into yahoo to \nview the latest messages=\r\n, you are more likely not to post something \nthat you think of offhand, bec=\r\nause that would require logging in.  \nIn the past, since you had to log in =\r\nin order to view the archives, \nyou were already logged in once ideas poppe=\r\nd into your head, but now \nyou are likely not logged in, and therefore it i=\r\nsn&#39;t worth going to \nthe trouble just to make a casual point.  I know that =\r\nI have found \neven myself falling into that kind of pattern and not posting=\r\n since \nI wasn&#39;t logged in.  Again, the net effect is muting discussion. \n\n=\r\nThe statistics appear to back up this theory.  Of course, statistics \nprove=\r\n correlation and not causality, but the argument for causality \nis strenghe=\r\nned by the precise alignment between the time that we \nopened the archives =\r\nand the time that membership growth and posting \nsuddenly plummeted.  Here =\r\nare the numbers:\n\nNew Members by Month\n--------------------\nOct: 11\nNov: 14=\r\n\nDec: 5\nJan: 4\nFeb: 3 (so far)\n\nNew Posts by Month\n------------------\nOct: =\r\n76\nNov: 77\nDec: 25\nJan: 38\nFeb: 22 (so far)\n\nBoth statistics show a sudden =\r\nand dramatic drop right at December, \nright about when we opened the archiv=\r\nes.  That seems to support the \nidea that doing so had a negative effect on=\r\n overall participation.  \nOf course there are other possible explanations s=\r\nuch as the natural \nebb and flow of discourse or just a general downward tr=\r\nend as people \nchange interests, but the coincidental correlation in timing=\r\n makes \nit likely that even if those are true, they probably are not the \no=\r\nnly contributing factors.\n\nMy view is that this group is first and foremost=\r\n a discussion group, \nand only secondarily a reference site.  It&#39;s nice to =\r\nbe able to \nsearch for old discusison, but what we&#39;re really here for is to=\r\n \ninteract with each other in the present.  Therefore, it doesn&#39;t make \nsen=\r\nse to sacrifice the interactive quality for a slightly more \nconvenient ref=\r\nerence, at least in my opinion.\n\nSo I am recommending we close the archives=\r\n to the public again and \nreturn to our old system.  However, since we have=\r\n been genuinely a \nthriving community for several years now (just look at m=\r\nost yahoo \ngroups and we are almost unmatched in consistent quality content=\r\n and \nfriendly discussion), it is only right to let everyone have their \ntw=\r\no cents before such a decision is made, so we can decide together \nrather t=\r\nhan make a unilateral decision.  Derek will ultimately \ndecide what to do b=\r\nased on your input.  If no one has input, it will \njust be a decision betwe=\r\nen myself and Derek, which is fine, but this \nis your opportunity to partic=\r\nipate.\n\nken\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
