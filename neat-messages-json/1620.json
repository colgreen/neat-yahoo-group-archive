The NEAT mutation rate indicates the probability\nof a given individual being mutated.\n\nWe&#39;ve actually done a little testing both ways, and it doesn&#39;t appear\nto make much of a difference...which I think tends to confirm that\nNEAT is overall a very robust algorithm.\n\nJust as when we added a mutation to delete connections, we observed\nlittle change in performance across runs (the big difference was the\nsize of the resulting champion networks).\n\n&gt; So I have started devising a GA for searching connection mutaion\n&gt; schemes. SharpNEAT is (fingers crossed) currently geared up for this\n&gt; type of meta-GA because I already have all of the NEAT parameters\n&gt; encapsulated in a NeatParameters class that is passed into the NEAT\n&gt; algorithm, which itself is encapsulated in an EvolutionAlgorithm class.\n\nWell good luck with that, and let us know how it turns out. :)\n\nIt&#39;s interesting, as Yuri points out, you&#39;ve got parameters for your\nmeta-mutations, which I suppose you could have a meta-mutation system\nfor as well.  And one for that one...it&#39;s turtles all the way down!\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
