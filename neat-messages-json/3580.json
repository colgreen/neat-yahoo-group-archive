I&#39;ve been \ndiscussing\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n&gt; this with my friend and we don&#39;t understand how innovation \nnumbers\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\nare\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; assigned to mutations.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Suppose a mutation links no=\r\nde n to node m. If another mutation\n&gt; &gt;  linking\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; these nodes occurs =\r\nin the same generation, they are both \nassigned\n&gt; &gt;  the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; same innova=\r\ntion number, this part was clear. But what if a \nmutation\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; linking th=\r\ne same nodes occurs 100 generations later? Is it \nassigned\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; the same =\r\ninnovation number or a different one?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve read Stanley&#39;s ori=\r\nginal C++ code and it seems that the new\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; mutation is assigned a new =\r\ninnovation number, which makes \nsense to\n&gt; &gt;  me,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; because the two ge=\r\nnes are not homologous and tracking homology \namong\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; genes is the who=\r\nle point of innovation numbers, right? But \nlooking\n&gt; &gt;  at\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a Python=\r\n and a Java implementation, both have a global list of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; mutations and=\r\n will assign the same innovation number to a \nmutation\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; linking the s=\r\name nodes. In this case, don&#39;t innovation numbers\n&gt; &gt;  become\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; useles=\r\ns? All we need to know to align genes for reproduction is\n&gt; &gt;  which\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;=\r\n nodes are getting linked by a certain mutation. Also we could \nbe\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; a=\r\nligning genes that have completely different roles in \ncompletely\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; di=\r\nfferent network architectures. It seems wrong to me.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; So does =\r\nanyone know how this should be done and why?\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; C=\r\narolina\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
