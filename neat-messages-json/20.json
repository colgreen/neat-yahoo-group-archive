And an output for each\n&gt;type of shape to be identified?\n\nNo, there were five inputs, which formed the viewing window arranged like\nthis:-\n.#.\n###\n.#.\n\n(where # is an input cell, and . is just a spacer.)\n\nThere were eight outputs:-\n1. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square left\n2. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square up\n3. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square right\n4. If &gt;.5, network wants to move one square down\n5. If &gt;.5, network has decided it knows which shape it is seeing\nThe remaining three outputs are only used if output 5 is high. If it is, the\nmaximum one is taken to be the decision of the network:-\n6. Shape is circle.\n7. Shape is diamond.\n8. Shape is square.\n\nEssentially the network is run repeatedly, moving the viewing window around\nas requested, until output 5 goes high. In practice, if it took longer than\n200 loops, that was taken to be a failure.\n\n&gt;I was wondering if you did a comparison with networks\n&gt;that looked at the entire grid at once (i.e. with 64\n&gt;inputs).\n\nNo, as the point was to see whether the network could evolve to solve this\nproblem at all, and what strategies it would use to nagivate over the shape\nfrom its random starting position.\n\n&gt;&gt;However, this\n&gt;&gt;produced a form of network memory which Kenneth\n&gt;&gt;seemed quite interested in,\n&gt;&gt;where long strings of nodes would form a kind of\n&gt;&gt;short-term memory rather\n&gt;&gt;than loops.\n&gt;I don&#39;t quite understand what you mean here.  Can you\n&gt;explain?\n\nWell, memory between timesteps was a required feature of this problem.\nObviously, if the network couldn&#39;t remember anything about what it had seen\nbefore, it was unlikely to do very well. NEAT, as you know, detects\nrecurrence - neurons connected back to themselves - and this is usually the\nway memory seems to evolve, as the same information will get looped back\ntime after time. However, my experiments also showed long chains of neurons,\nwhich weren&#39;t part of loops, which seemed to be performing a similar\nfunction of keeping information in the network for a future time step. Now,\nI wouldn&#39;t have thought this was necessarily unusual, but Ken picked up on\nit.\n\n--Darren\n\n\n"}}
