Then place a random timer in each neuron, when a\ntimer fires that neuron becomes a real neuron and tells surrounding\nneurons not to fire. I appreciate it puts time back into the\ndevelopmental process, which could slow things down (one of the wins\nof CPPNs was the elimination of iterative developmental processes).\n\nRegards,\n\nColin\n\n"}}
