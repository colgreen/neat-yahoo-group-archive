I\ndid however promise Der=\r\nek to share my additions to ANJI when I was\ndone and this would indeed be t=\r\nhe time, but I am not sure whether to\nshare my ideas about ANJI via the dis=\r\ncussion group or in private\ne-mails, because it would be about ANJI and Jav=\r\na and not so much about\nNEAT.
