This effectively forbids the \n&quot;both these neurones are always on and hence develop a weighting \nbetween them&quot; scenario.\n\n\tIt is also the way that biological neurones work.\n\n\tIs Hebbian learning directional?  e.g. if a and b are on together \nthen does that create as much of a a-&gt;b weight as a b-&gt;a \nweight?  That sounds like more of a classifier approach than a controller...\n\n\tHow about if only some of the neurones were Hebbian.  Sort of have \nnon-H in the body of a &quot;module&quot; and then H nodes to wire up the \ninputs and outputs.\n\n\tIan\n\n\n"}}
