However, conceptually the problem is hard bec=\r\nause you are looking at nothing but weight patterns.  You could measure ave=\r\nrage distance on weight-weight pairs, but that might not be meaningful enou=\r\ngh to tell you much.  It&#39;s a lot like measuring evolvability in Picbreeder =\r\n- how would you decide if one image is sufficiently different from another =\r\nto be considered a new kind of image?  You might consider image matching al=\r\ngorithms, which could perhaps give a bit deeper insight than just pixel-by-=\r\npixel (or weight-by-weight) matching (except that in substrates you&#39;d be ma=\r\ntching images in 4D or 6D rather than 2D).  Still, it&#39;s an interesting idea=\r\n to try to measure in any case.\n\nBest,\n\nken\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;martin_pyka&quot; &lt;martin.pyka@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Sebastian\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks for the=\r\n link. But I am more interested in measuring evolvability in the substrate =\r\nitself rather than the behaviour that is generated by a neural network base=\r\nd on the substrate.
