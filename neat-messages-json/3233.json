As soon =\r\nas I \nget through this next milestone, I&#39;ll release a 1.1 version which has=\r\n \nsupport for multi-individual experiment evaluations and a better \nrandom =\r\nnumber generator with some different random distributions to \nplay with, an=\r\nd a few bug fixes.\n\nI have a few suggestions which might improve the perfor=\r\nmance of your \napp:\n\nFirst off, you have to account for the mutliplication =\r\neffect.  \nBasically, with a 11x11 input grid, you have potentially 121 link=\r\ns \ngoing to a single hidden node.  The problem with this is that there \nis =\r\nso much magnitude there that it can mean that your sigmoids always \noutput =\r\nhigh values because you are operating at the far reaches of \nthe sigmoid do=\r\nmain.  Also, it restricts your system to having to make \na distinction betw=\r\neen .9990 and .9991 . This can explain the erratic \nbehvaior.  in my GECCO =\r\npaper I mentioned that I fixed this by scaling \ndown the inputs so that ins=\r\ntead of putting a 1.0 for each input that \nis filled in, I put a fraction b=\r\nased on the number of nodes. In \nanother experiment I&#39;m running, I decided =\r\nto take a different route \nand instead I divided all of the link weights by=\r\n N (in your case, \n11.0).  This seemed to produce values which were in the =\r\ndomain [-5,5] \nthe majority of the time.  If this still produces high value=\r\ns, you \ncan try dividing by N*N.\n\nWhen your roving eye zooms in, do you cha=\r\nnge N?  It seems like that \nwould be the right thing to do, but I don&#39;t thi=\r\nnk you are doing \nthat.  What I think you should do is create substrates fo=\r\nr N=3D22, \nN=3D11, N=3D5.  Then, when your eye zooms in, just switch the su=\r\nbstrate \nthat you use to one with a smaller N.  Hopefully this will let \nHy=\r\nperNEAT handle the granularity of the data, something which it&#39;s \nalready v=\r\nery good at.  I would suggest not to use a roving eye at \nall, but since I =\r\nalready did that in the GECCO paper, I think that \nthis approach would be m=\r\nore interesting.\n\nAlso, be careful about using Z for each layer.  You are i=\r\nn some sense \nsaying that the output layer is the &quot;negative image&quot; of the i=\r\nnput \nlayer.  Of course, the neural network will eventually learn anything,=\r\n \nbut it&#39;s harder to bootstrap when the initial conditions are a little \nwa=\r\ncky.\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; \n&lt;petar_chervenski@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am experimenting with my implementation of Hype=\r\nrNEAT in C++. The \n&gt; application is a roving eye visual discrimination syst=\r\nem. \n&gt; The CPPNs use sigmoids, gaussians and sine activation functions. \nTh=\r\ne \n&gt; substrate space is 3D cartesian. \n&gt; The results are a bit disappointin=\r\ng, so I am looking for answer \nwhy. \n&gt; I set up the substrate like this - t=\r\nhe inputs are organized in a \nNxN \n&gt; grid on the Z =3D=3D -1 plane, N is cu=\r\nrrently 11. The hidden nodes are \n&gt; arranged in a circular manner on the Z =\r\n=3D=3D 0 plane, and the outputs \n&gt; are arranged the same on the Z =3D=3D 1 =\r\nplane. \n&gt; The eye learns to distinguish between a square and a circle very =\r\n\n&gt; easy, but things got weird when I increased the complexity of the \n&gt; tas=\r\nk - it had to learn to distinguish the target shape regardless \nof \n&gt; its p=\r\nosition. \n&gt; It never learned that. The eye is moving and zooming chaotic, \n=\r\nwithout \n&gt; concentrating on the shape&#39;s corners or something like that, but=\r\n \n&gt; switches state and flees when some pixel on the retina is set.. I \n&gt; ho=\r\npe you can imagine this. \n&gt; I hope you may help me find what is the problem=\r\n. The problem may be \n&gt; the substrate configuration or dimensionality, or t=\r\nhe NEAT \nparameters \n&gt; (which I checked and didn&#39;t find anything strange)..=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Peter\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
