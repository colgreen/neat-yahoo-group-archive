For example, take\n&gt;&gt;some regulatory pathway &#39;A&#39; that is very short but highly conserved\n&gt;&gt;across several different modules. A mutation on &#39;A&#39; will then affect\n&gt;&gt;all of those modules. Whereas a mutation in as less-conserved process,\n&gt;&gt;say &#39;B,&#39; would have a smaller phenotypic effect.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thus not only the mechanism of crossover and DNA transcription, but\n&gt;&gt;also development itself affects what we think of as phenotypic\n&gt;&gt;mutation.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi Joe,\n&gt;         I&#39;m afraid I cannot follow you here.  Do you mean for nature or \n&gt;software?\n&gt;\n&gt;         Ian\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nHi Ian,\n\nSorry, I meant in biology this kind of thing is common. I think its \nimportant to point out this difference though, since a \ndirect-development system has little or no concept of \ngenotype-&gt;phenotype mapping, it is more or less impossible to establish \nmutation rates on a per-module basis. Rather the best you can get is on \na per-gene basis. There is actually some neat work involving bacteria \nand how they change kinetic parameters (i.e. metabolic rates and such) \nvs. how they change behavioral parameters that is along this line.\n\nJoe\n\n"}}
