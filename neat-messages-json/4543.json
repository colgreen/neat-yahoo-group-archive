One example cheap solution for good stability is \nensuring th=\r\nat the compatibility threshold is adequate to the limits of \nthe system. Ma=\r\nybe something like analyzing the whole population each \ngeneration (in case=\r\n of generational approach) and determining the best \ncompatibility threshol=\r\nd in a more sophisticated way than simply \nraising and lowering it. \n\nPeter=\r\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nPeter, yes, that is another way that it could be done that I forgot \nto\n&gt; m=\r\nention:  You could characterize species by some kind of \nconsolidated\n&gt; sta=\r\ntistic like their mean weights on shared dimensions or something\n&gt; like tha=\r\nt.  It may again lead to some kind of stability, or maybe it\n&gt; has another =\r\nbenefit.  It does seem more principled in terms of\n&gt; characterizing what a =\r\nspecies is.  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I am not sure if it would have any benefit towa=\r\nrds\n&gt; performance, which is probably the most significant issue.  Although\n=\r\n&gt; it would make more sense in principle, it may simply not be as good \nas\n&gt;=\r\n forcing species to cluster around their champions.  It is an \nempirical\n&gt; =\r\nissue and I do not know the answer to it.  \n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;petar_chervenski&quot; &lt;petar_chervenski@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Ken,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My implementation currently chooses a single representative of=\r\n \neach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; species and new individuals in the population are compared wit=\r\nh \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; list of representatives in order.  The new individual is place=\r\nd \nin \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first species with a representative that is within the=\r\n \ncompatibility\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distance.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One other thing some people =\r\ndon&#39;t realize is that my \nimplementation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sorts the genomes in each sp=\r\necies in order of their fitness, \nwhich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means ultimately that the rep=\r\nresentative becomes the individual \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highest fitness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; This issue is something I was thinking of very often. Because one \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n species can be defined as a group of genomes that have many \nmatching \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n genes close to each other (with respect to the global \ncompatibility\n&gt; thr=\r\neshold), it is possible that the representative of a species \ncould \n&gt; &gt; be=\r\n kind of generalized data across all members of the species, not \n&gt; &gt; just =\r\none genome. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, the representative can be recomputed eve=\r\nry \ngeneration, in \n&gt; &gt; a process where all members mate into one single in=\r\ndividual which \n&gt; &gt; becomes the representative of the species. All genes sh=\r\nould be \nallowed \n&gt; &gt; to be inherited in an iterative process resulting in =\r\na genome that \n&gt; &gt; carries all complexity of all individuals of the species=\r\n. Can this \nbe \n&gt; &gt; considered a good representative? Or maybe just regular=\r\n mating, \nwhere \n&gt; &gt; excess/disjoint genes are inherited from more fit memb=\r\ners. I don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; know what effect this could have. And it is important tha=\r\nt the \nweights \n&gt; &gt; of matching genes should be averaged during mating.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The idea is that the representative of a species can be not just a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; genome that is existing as a member, but a special genome that is \nonly =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; used during clustering, as the &quot;overall picture&quot; of genetic \ndistance.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does it make sense? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Peter\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
