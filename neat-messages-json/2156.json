I made the assumption that as the \n&gt;output signal is between 0 and 1, that the input signals should also \n&gt;be beween 0 and 1.  This is why I divided the number by 10 when \n&gt;setting the value.\n&gt;\n&gt;After removing the divide by 10, the network learned to reach 100 \n&gt;fitness which is what I wanted to achieve.  The only thing still \n&gt;puzzling me is that I&#39;m not sure that I understand why there is a \n&gt;different between dividing the input signal by 10 and not dividing.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Chris,\n\nAs you probably noticed most of the SharpNEAT experiments scale inputs \nto the 0..1 range as you did, although I generally consider this to be \nnot /that/ important. The reason being that the input signals get scaled \nby the connections feeding the signals into the network proper (input \nnodes don&#39;t apply an activation function). By default SharpNEAT has a \nconnection weight range of -5.0 to 5.0, thus scaling by up to 5x is \npossible and scaling down is also possible with weigths &lt;1.0. Note that \nthe +-5.0 range roughly ties in with the activation functions available, \nthey generally give a minimum output(of zero) for inputs of &lt;=-5.0 and a \nmax output(of 1.0) for &gt;=5.0.\n\nIt&#39;s not immediately clear to me why your experiment should succeed by \nusing input signals over the range 1..9, I would guess that by not \nscaling the inputs down that the input signals are more likely to \ngenerate values at the far ends of the activation function, thus pretty \nmuch reducing the function to a step function - which might be a more \nappropriate function for the sequence problem.\n\nAnother important point is that the version you have contains a couple \nof significant bugs that will be hindering sharpneats ability to find a \nsolution. I&#39;ll send you a link to the current code base just in case you \nwish to switch over to that - if anyone else is interested in this then \nlet me know.  I&#39;ll try and get round to a new release some day soon, honest!\n\nColin.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
