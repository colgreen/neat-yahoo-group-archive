But my problem is that I am not so strong in\n&gt; C++ . So I think I will try to install an older compiler and get the\n&gt; code working without having to modify it (to much). But it would be\n&gt; great if somebody would publish an 3.x enabled version of the C++ NEAT\n&gt; package.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mikkel Baun Kjaergaard\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
