The results are very good, the\n&gt; progress of the search is much slower than the existing code that used\n&gt; only random tests, typically it takes about 12 hrs now to achieve\n&gt; maximum fitness, whereas before it took about 1-2hrs. But the quality of\n&gt; the evolved networks at the end of the process is much higher, in fact\n&gt; the networks are near-perfect, although not quite 100% perfect, most\n&gt; likely due to non-determinism creeping back into the system as the\n&gt; difficulty level is increased (the prey begins to move in a\n&gt; non-deterministic manner).\n\nI&#39;m a little confused.  You initially pose a random evaluation set to\nthe evolving networks, then as there are failed tests, you replace the\nrandomized instances with the failed ones?\n\nAnd so when you have evolved your networks, to test them, do you do so\nagainst a randomized test set?\n\n&gt; Following a bit more experimentation I hope to put together another\n&gt; write-up on all of this to fill out the details.\n\nI&#39;d look forward to that.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
