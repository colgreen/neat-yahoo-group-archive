It&#39;s important to note that the information in a substrate is m=\r\nore than the information in a graph (e.g. node coordinates matter), so I am=\r\n not sure that usual graph descriptions would be sufficient.  Also, ideally=\r\n, such a language would be able to express things in a compact way, like sa=\r\nying where a row or sheet of neurons is located and to what other neurons i=\r\nt connects as a group.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, as I mentioned, we are working on =\r\nan XML format, but right now it can only express certain types of networks =\r\nand not others.  It may take a week or two because of travel, but I will di=\r\nscuss my students if they feel like the format should be released, or if pe=\r\nrhaps it is still too unfinished to be worthwhile (which may be the case). =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; I do believe that it is ultimately a good idea to try to adopt some =\r\nkind of XML standard for describing substrates.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nea=\r\nt@yahoogroups.com, &quot;evertwh2004&quot; &lt;evert@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n&#39;m starting some HyperNEAT experiments trying various substrate designs.
