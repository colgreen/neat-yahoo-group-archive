I&#39;ve just switched over SharpNEAT zip file to include\na \n&gt; minor change - the prey capture sim now shows the sensor range of\nthe \n&gt; agent by colouring grid squares light grey.\n\nColin,\n\nThe prey capture is a nice demo- showing the sensor range definitely\nhelps too.  You mentioned your imperfect results and I was thinking\nthis may be due to your style of evaluation as opposed to your NEAT\nimplementation.  For example, do you start each trial from a random\nposition (either the prey or the predator)?  Or is something\nrandomized about the prey?  Randomization can cause noise in the\nevaluation, which means something looks like a champ might just be a\nlucky break, which can wreak havoc with fitness consistency.  It\nsometimes makes more sense to make things deterministic, even if that\nis counterintuitive.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
