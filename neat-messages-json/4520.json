You&#39;ve been a great help in\n&gt; developing my understandings of NEAT.  (I hope that is a compliment).\n\nThanks. ego boosts always welcome :)\n\n&gt; Are you saying (in effect) that Lp Norms are a good collection of &quot;distance&quot;\n&gt; metrics for genomes?\n\nI&#39;m saying that the current compatibility scheme in NEAT is\neffectively using the L1 norm (Manhattan distance), and I&#39;m now\nhypothesising that this is better than the L2 norm (Euclidean\ndistance). I don&#39;t recall this ever coming up so maybe Ken S went\nthrough this thought process right back in the beginning of NEAT.\n\nI must admit to not having much of a maths background so I had to look\nup Lp norms - maybe there is a case for some other value of P? Such as\n&lt;1 or the number of genes.\n\n\n&gt; I think these may have value in roulette wheel application to allele pattern probabilities.\n\nSo you think there is some research into biological genetics that\ncould give us some answers?\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
