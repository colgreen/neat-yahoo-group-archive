At some future point a-&gt;b is again chosen to be\n&gt; broken (in a different genome(?)) will it again be\n&gt; given c as the node id that is put between a and b or\n&gt; will it be some new node d?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a feeling I&#39;m missing something obvious but the\n&gt; &quot;mutate add node&quot; situation hasn&#39;t clicked yet as far\n&gt; as if/how it needs to be tracked/checked for &quot;same\n&gt; innovation&quot; situations.\n&gt; \n\nWhen a new node is added, a record is kept with the following \ninformation: \n\n-The in-node\n-The out-node\n-The old connection innovation number\n-The innovation numbers assigned to the 2 new connections\n-The id assigned to the new node\n\nWhenever a new node is added, all such records that are kept are \ncheck for a match on the first 3 items.  If it matches it means it&#39;s \nsplitting the same link.  In that case, it is assigned the same id \nas the prior node that split the same link.  Also the two new links \n(around the new node) get the same innovations numbers as in the \nprevious matching split.\n\nA list of such records is kept either for the current generation, or \nforever.  You can look at my NEAT code to see how I keep the \nrecords.  They are &quot;class Innovation,&quot; which is the structure that\nholds information on innovations that have come before.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
