Also included are Visual C++ files for editing source (although you can&#39;t use these to compile NEAT). As this is just a copy of my own NEAT folder, it has my experiments and gene files included. Also includes the weight capping feature and dynamic compat_thresh. This version fixes a problem I introduced into genetics.cpp. \n\nYou can access this file at the URL\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/files/neatwin2.zip \n\nTo learn more about file sharing for your group, please visit\n\nhttp://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/files\n\nRegards,\n\nzysyshelp &lt;zysyshelp@...&gt;\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
