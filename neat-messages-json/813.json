Possibly the original work to which\n&gt; they refer might have some applications for us. OTOH,\n&gt; whatever their topology was NEAT might be able to\n&gt; evolve it, without knowing what they did. I have no\n&gt; doubt that NEAT can evolve nets with short term\n&gt; memory. What is not clear is how much memory, i.e.\n&gt; given a reasonable amount of time for evolution, how\n&gt; much data can be stored and retrieved. It would also\n&gt; depend on the manner of retrieval.\n&gt; \n&gt; =====\n&gt; Mitchell Timin\n&gt; http://annevolve.sourceforge.net\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
