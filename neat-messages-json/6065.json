Indeed,\nKen, you are the living proof that one can publish novel ideas with\nqualitative results only(*) and, though getting such papers accepted may be\nfrustrating, it is the price to pay to avoid getting *any* random ideas\npublished. However, look at the benefit: once accepted, how many works have\nbeen following the original idea of novelty search or CPPN?\n\nMoreover, let&#39;s keep in mind that for a conference/journal, there are\nseveral reviewers per paper, and then it is up to the editor or\ntrack/conference chair to check reviews for inconsistent or controversial\npapers, and ask for complementary reviews if needed -- As an example with\nthe GECCO 2013 ALIFE track, we provided at least 5 reviews per paper, and\nup to 7 for controversial papers. ie. decisions end up as the results from\nthe combined work of individual reviewers and editors, rather than being\nnot just be numerical sum&averaging. In the end, a rejected paper may be so\nbecause it has failed to convince the majority of reviewers, would it be\nbecause it is too weak or out of topic wrt. the conference/journal, but\ndefinitely not because a single reviewer killed the paper.\n\nOf course, the fact that canonical, syntactically-correct, papers with\nquantitative results are more likely to get accepted is not a good thing\neither. If you look at the vast number of publications per year in our\nfield, there is already quite some noise (ie. papers that will be forgotten\nfor good or bad reasons), and few papers are actually used to inspire new\nresearch in the years after - which can be seen more or less as an a\nposteriori relevant evaluation of a paper&#39;s contribution.\n\nIt seems to me that the problem is not about accepting more or less papers\nwith or without qualitative results only, but about leaving more room/time\nto presentation and discussion around novel works, would they be with\nquantitative or qualitative results -- On the one hand, the current oral\npresentation format in conferences, IMHO, partly fail to provide this\nspace: leaving 5 minutes for question is a bit ridiculous IMHO. On the\nother hand, the poster sessions in most AI/EC conferences often leaves me\nvery frustrated (2 hours for more than one hundred posters, combined with a\nsocial event), with the very notable exception of the PPSN conference\n(Parrallel Problem Solving from Nature). At PPSN, there are only posters: a\nconference chair (who read your paper) does approx. 3 minutes personal\npresentation/interpretation for a dozen of posters, and then you have ~2\nhours to wander around and visit posters, which often leads to you\nselecting 2-3 posters (There are several such sessions a day, in sequential\norder, without any particular topic for a session). The time for discussion\nis therefore significant enough to have a true scientific interaction.\n\nA decent poster session with a lower selection rate (~50%? unlike PPSN)\nwould possibly enable to take some risks with accepting contributions, and\ngiving anyone the opportunity to present new ideas, without removing the\nfact that if you want to get your work accepted for a conference talk or a\njournal publication (with high selection rate), you have to work hard to\nconvince reviewers and editors (as it is already the case for many\njournals). To some extent, this is already done elsewhere, for example in\nthe annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (thousands of\nattendants, many many posters, keynote talks).\n\nBest,\n\nNicolas\n\n\n(*) don&#39;t get me wrong, you also published many very good papers with\nquantitative results ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\n2013/4/22 Julian Togelius &lt;julian@...&gt;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip-snip&gt;\n&gt;\nOn 21 April 2013 01:18, Ken &lt;kstanley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;snip-snip&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--20cf306f71fc3499aa04daf29193\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s really great =\r\nwe can have this conversation here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While I agree that pa=\r\npers with few results and very good ideas should be published occasionally,=\r\n I don&#39;t think things should be made easier.
