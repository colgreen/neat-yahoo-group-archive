E.g. if you take \n&gt; an XOR network you would expect to see a chequered pattern with 4 \n&gt; squares - a perfect network would have straight edges, but in reality \n&gt; the edges will likely be smooth and curved if you have used a continous\n&gt; activation function instead of a step.\n\nThat would be nice to see, yeah.\n\n&gt; Other thoughts:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Render color images by using, say, three outputs to describe Red, \n&gt; Green, Blue or Hue, Luninence, Saturation. In fact there are loads of \n&gt; other color systems, and I guess not all of them use three values.\n\nThat&#39;s allready in there, but it looks to crappy so I &quot;hid&quot; the checkbox\nthat enables colors. The reason it looks crappy is that each output is too\nunrelated, so that it looks like three overlain images in red, green and\nblue. Possibly HSV would work better than RGB - I haven&#39;t tried it.\nShouldn&#39;t take more than a minute to code, I have the algos at home from\nprevious experiments.\n\n&gt; 2) Real-time moving images that represent the changing outputs.\n\nI&#39;ve allready done that with my previous experiments, see\nhttp://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/EvolvedFilms/\n\n&gt; 3) Use hidden nodes as the data source. This is a development of the \n&gt; anaysis idea - if I have a network with loads of output and hidden \n&gt; nodes, I can still visualize the signals being generated on specfic \n&gt; nodes by slecting the as a signal source.\n\nAh, yeah, that would work for analyzing networks. However, since this is\npractically restricted to 2 input networks, it would perhaps not be that\nuseful.\n\n&gt; 3) 3D is harder to imagine, however if you apply a step function to\n&gt; your \n&gt; one output value you can potentially use the threshold point to\n&gt; describe \n&gt; the surface of a shape, or a more often it would probably be a curved\n&gt; plane.\n\nI have just the thing to visualize 3d images;\nhttp://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/3DTexture/\n\nI&#39;ve intended to evolve something for it, but I haven&#39;t had the time.\n\n&gt; Combine the lot to get 3D movies of morphing shapes!\n\nAh, even at 128x128x128x3 bytes (6.3 meg) per &quot;frame&quot;, that would be hard\nto upload to the gfx card at any speed ;)\n\ncheers,\nmattias\n\n\n\n"}}
