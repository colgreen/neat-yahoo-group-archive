I imagine what you are suggesting goes beyond the\n&gt; typical idea of island models or other diversity mechanisms where the\n&gt; environment within each geographical niche is typically the same.\n\nFor starters I was thinking of a homogeneous space and investigating\nthe dynamics that emerge. Later on we can imagine adding structure to\nthe geo-space, and islands would be an important form of structure -\nthey foster diversity, but to allow some mixing we could connect\n&#39;islands&#39; with &#39;causeways&#39;, or just put an wall between two regions\nwith a small opening.\n\n\n&gt; That is, one of the most interesting things from an evolutionary perspective\n&gt; about different geographical regions of the world is that what strategies\n&gt; are adaptive changes between them. In other words, altitude and temperature\n&gt; and chemical composition vary with geography, which might correspondingly\n&gt; vary the attractors for optimizing fitness. In this way, across all\n&gt; different geographies you might encounter a wide range of cool strategies\n&gt; that are all locally well-adapted.\n\nYes and I see this as a later research spin-off, building on work that\nfocuses on a simple homogeneous space. But you could certainly imagine\nsmooth transitions in the parameters to allow agents to evolve in\n&#39;easier&#39; environments and gradually migrate (and coloniose) more\ndifficult regions in the space. That&#39;s like a form of incremental\nevolution where traditionally we artificially &#39;bumped up&#39; the object\nfunction&#39;s difficult as the population fitness passed certain\nmilestone thresholds.\n\n\n&gt; If I correctly recall an earlier discussion, you were at one point\n&gt; interested in different geographical niches where selection would vary among\n&gt; them, e.g. there would be some differences between the environments within\n&gt; each niche. That way, the overall search might be more non-objective because\n&gt; it is not driven to any one super-organism but in finding interesting\n&gt; solutions within all of the different niches.\n\nThat&#39;s right. That idea was very similar and a variation on this\ncurrent one (i.e. another spin-off research direction), the idea there\nwas two have multiple objective fn&#39;s related to what you wanted to\nachieve, so if I want a walker then I might measure (1) ability to\nachieve a standing position, (2) distance traversed in N seconds, (3)\nenergy expended. Measure all three seperately, and then place the\ngenom ein a 3D cube where each metric represents an axis in 3D space.\nNow we can reproduce amongst genomes in similar parts of the space and\nhopefully we get genomes migrate towards the corner of the cube that\nrepresents high fitness in all three metrics - but before then we get\ncolonies in all other corners (good on some metrics, not on others),\nand maybe some in the middle (mediocre on all metrics).\n\n\n\n&gt; In Ken and I&#39;s virtual creature paper, novelty was measured in how different\n&gt; a virtual creature&#39;s morphology was from others in the population, using a\n&gt; coarse small-dimensional space of morphologies (e.g. their height and mass).\n\nI see that as behavioural (or &#39;strategy&#39;) space, which is orthogonal\nto geo-space, e.g. a single piece of land can have plants on it that\ncompete with each other for sunlight, water and ground nutrients, but\nthey don&#39;t compete with mammals for sunlight, and mammals don&#39;t\ncompete with insects, etc. So in any one region in geo-space we can\nhave a range of diverse survival strategies, some of which directly\ncompete (e.g. lions and hyenas) and some which largely don&#39;t care\nabout each other (lions versus plants)\n\n\n&gt; However, instead of a morphology space where the underlying evaluation\n&gt; environment is uniform (e.g. the world any creature is evaluated in is\n&gt; exactly the same), you could also have something like you are suggesting,\n&gt; where the evaluation environment varies over a space (e.g. some environments\n&gt; in one part of the geographic space could be hilly and others in a different\n&gt; area, flat).\n\nAll good and valid variations, with a common root - a simple\nhomogeneous geo-space. Baby steps.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
