He proposes \nseveral things, including a temporal aspect to how we learn \neverything from any sensory system.  They have done some preliminary \nwork on implementing his ideas (of which temorality is one aspect) \nand have had some early good results.  I tend to agree with all his \nbasic ideas: brain operates with one algorithm only: brain is \norganized into a hierarchy: time matters in learning: memory is \ncritical to learning: and that feedback is critical in the network \nto learning.\n\nI have also partially implemented some of his ideas in a very simple \nvisual recognition system..early results are interesting, but I have \nto a do alot more work yet.  it does show some capability for \ninvariance, which is pretty cool.\n\n--Kevin\n\n\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Jim O&#39;Flaherty, Jr.&quot; \n&lt;jim_oflaherty_jr@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Colin,\n&gt; \n&gt; You wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; It occured to me that real world neural nets exist in 3D due to \n&gt; physical constr[ai]nts - there are only 3 spa[t]ial dimensions!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not studied the biology of neurons enough to be very \nconfident of \n&gt; this speculation.  I think *time* might be another dimension of \nphysical \n&gt; neurons.  In other words, there are likely nuances in a physical \n&gt; neuron&#39;s firing and the *timing of the receptivity* of a \n&gt; related/connected neuron that had some level of influence on the \n&gt; evolution of the neurons and organ.  And therefore, likely have a \n&gt; reasonable influence on the emergent effects produced.  Which in \nturn \n&gt; effected the further evolution of both the neurons and organ.  A \nstrange \n&gt; loop, so to speak.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you mention later, the neurons which are modeled in the ANNs we \nhave \n&gt; been using in NEAT are very simple compared to physical neurons.  \nThe \n&gt; idea that *all* the neurons activate in sequence (activation wave) \n&gt; before another activation wave begins is not very similar to \nnature at \n&gt; all.  However, the amount of computing capacity required to \nsimulate the \n&gt; highly parallel, massively distributed and mildly chaotic \n(inherent \n&gt; noise) nature of physical neurons means it is much more difficult \nto \n&gt; simulate their behavior than the simple approach currently used.\n&gt; \n&gt; Haven&#39;t some experiments been done where they added the time \ncomponent \n&gt; to the model and then were able to do some very sophisticated \nlearning \n&gt; with very few neurons, compared to the simpler activation wave \nmethod?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Jim\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Colin Green wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Philip Tucker wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [...]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) I&#39;m sure real neural networks have clusters.  It&#39;s debatable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whether this is a necessary feature or simply a byproduct of \nbiology -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it&#39;s much easier for two neurons in close spatial proximity to \nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connected than those farther apart.  But do neural networks \nhave hubs?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not sure but I thought I&#39;d add that the clusters in mammalian \nbrains are\n&gt; &gt; arranged in columns. The neural column is, I think, the basic \nunit of\n&gt; &gt; repetition, and interconnections within a column have been \nobserved to\n&gt; &gt; be far more numerous than those between columns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) The NEAT paradigm is not biased toward either of these \nnetwork\n&gt; &gt; &gt; features.  Any node has an equal chance connecting to any \nother node\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (excepting the initial connections between input and output \nnodes).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which would be more like the case /within/ a neural column, for \nexample,\n&gt; &gt; which contains far more neurons (approx. 100k is a figure I \nrecall) than\n&gt; &gt; any NEAT evolved ANN I&#39;ve ever seen. If clustering is a strategy \nfor\n&gt; &gt; dealing with complexity, and our ANN&#39;s don&#39;t get very complex \nthen it&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; not clear that it would be a useful strategy to engineer into \nNEAT. On\n&gt; &gt; the other hand clustering may happen at numerous levels, so \ne.g.a neural\n&gt; &gt; column may contain sub-clusters, some of which may contain very \nsmall\n&gt; &gt; groups similar in size to our ANN&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite this lack of bias in the evolutionary model, do \nclusters or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hubs emerge?  If they are crucial features of an effective \nnetwork,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; should we build such biases into the evolutionary process?  For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, the likelihood of a connection being added between \ntwo nodes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be proportional to the connectivity distance between the \ntwo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (this could be based on a unidirectional or bidirectional \ntraversal of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connections).  Or, the weight could be proportional to this \ndistance. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As an alternative to connectivity distance, we could give the \nnodes a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spatial layout, perhaps on a 2-dimensional surface, and have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connection mutation be relative to that spatial distance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As an aside, laying neuron&#39;s out in a grid space, 2D, 3D or \notherwise\n&gt; &gt; (why not 4D or more?) is something I&#39;ve considered when thinking \nabout\n&gt; &gt; indirect encodings. &#39;growing&#39; neurons within a limited space is \none way\n&gt; &gt; of preventing an indirect encoding from growing ANN&#39;s too large \nto\n&gt; &gt; simulate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually when I started out doing work on neuro-evolution my \nfirst\n&gt; &gt; instinct was to use grid layouts (I used hexagonal grids) and the\n&gt; &gt; question of how many dimensions I should use came up. It occured \nto me\n&gt; &gt; that real world neural nets exist in 3D due to physical \nconstriants -\n&gt; &gt; there are only 3 spacial dimensions! - and this presents a limit \nto the\n&gt; &gt; amount of connectivity a biological neural net can achieve, \nbecause of\n&gt; &gt; the physical size of neurons and their connections and the \nlimited space\n&gt; &gt; available. Therefore it makes sense to connect more to your \nneighbours\n&gt; &gt; than to distant neurons.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course the ANN&#39;s in NEAT are effectively dimensionless, any \nneuron\n&gt; &gt; can connect to any other without any limits or concept of \nrelative\n&gt; &gt; distance and the lack of this restriction is one of the benefits \nwe have\n&gt; &gt; over biology. Perhaps though clustering is not just a strategy \nfor\n&gt; &gt; dealing with physical limitations, but actually has other \npositive side\n&gt; &gt; effects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Trying to engineer some kind of clustering factor into NEAT is an\n&gt; &gt; interesting idea. I don;t think it&#39;s a substitute for the  \nexisting\n&gt; &gt; modular NEAT approaches because there is no repetition of\n&gt; &gt; clusters(unless maybe you can identify them), but it may be a \nmore\n&gt; &gt; efficient way of evolving small ANN&#39;s in general.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Colin\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Expanding on the 4D comment above - when I started out with\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Philip\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Philip Tucker\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ptucker@g... &lt;mailto:ptucker@g...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; YAHOO!
