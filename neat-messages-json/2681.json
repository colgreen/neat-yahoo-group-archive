But it seemed to work pretty well because if=\r\n you zoomed in\n&gt; &gt; really close on its output you could see artifacts of th=\r\ne little\n&gt; &gt; tricks it learned to fill in gaps, i.e. the assumptions it was=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; making about details at the higher resolution.  And those\n&gt; &gt; assumpti=\r\nons looked pretty smart actually.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent!  More examples of it b=\r\neing successful.
