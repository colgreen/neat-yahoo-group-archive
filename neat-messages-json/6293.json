Very interesting\nindee=\r\nd! I have a few questions and comments as well:\n\n1) Network activation: I t=\r\nhink there are two ways of updating the states of\nthe neurons: (i) synchron=\r\nous and (ii) asynchronous.\n\nThe asynchronous update is basically what is do=\r\nne in networks with layers,\nwhere a signal starting at the input layer at t=\r\nime t arrives at the output\nlayer at the same timestep. The synchronous upd=\r\nate is what most people\nimplement in networks with a free topology, where t=\r\nhe neuron inputs at time\nt produce the output at time t+1. This delay can b=\r\ne interpreted as the time\nfor a signal to be propagated from a presynaptic =\r\nneuron to a postsynaptic\none. Consequently, in order to express causality o=\r\nf firing, in the hebbian\nrule the presynaptic activity should be taken from=\r\n time t-1, while the\npostsynaptic activity should be taken from time t.\n\nI =\r\nwas wondering whether you experimented with this. In your paper you say\ntha=\r\nt the network is activated 15 times, so are you using the synchronous\nstate=\r\n update?\n\n2) Have you experimented with learning rules other than the stand=\r\nard\nHebbian one? For example, the rules of the original Adaptive HyperNEAT\n=\r\npaper, or by adding a weight decay to the equation of the standard Hebbian\n=\r\nrule.\n\n3) I was wondering whether you thought of any other tasks to evaluat=\r\ne your\napproach. For example, line orientation maps develop in the primary =\r\nvisual\ncortex, and as you say in the paper, these topographic maps are foun=\r\nd in\nall sensory systems. So, would it be sensible to have a task in which =\r\nyou\n&quot;use&quot; other feature detector cells, let&#39;s say from the primary auditory=\r\n\ncortex, and a topographic map is then self-organized to encode sound\nfrequ=\r\nencies?\n\n4) I believe line orientation maps exist at the lowest level of a\n=\r\nhierarchical architecture, and as information moves to higher levels, more\n=\r\nabstract concepts can be encoded. These abstract concepts can fuse\ninformat=\r\nion from all sensory systems, e.g., how does a dog looks like,\nsmells like,=\r\n sounds like, etc. I believe that using HyperNEAT with such\nhierarchical ar=\r\nchitectures (and not just for developing a controller) is a\npromising appro=\r\nach and I look forward to seeing it mature.\n\n\nVassilis\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 28, 20=\r\n14 at 12:47 PM, Sebastian Risi\n&lt;sebastian.risi@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Kenn=\r\neth Stanley and I are pleased to announce our new GECCO paper (to\n&gt; appear)=\r\n, &quot;Guided Self-Organization in Indirectly Encoded and Evolving\n&gt; Topographi=\r\nc Maps&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *PDF: *http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/risi_gecco14.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; This=\r\n paper introduces the idea that HyperNEAT can be seeded with a lateral\n&gt; in=\r\nhibitory connectivity pattern, which then allows the weights from the\n&gt; inp=\r\nuts to the hidden layer of an ANN to self-organize to form a genuine\n&gt; topo=\r\ngraphic map of the input space.

The proposed approach draws on HyperNEAT&#39;s ability to generate a pat=\r\ntern of weights across the connectivity of an artificial neural network (AN=\r\nN) based on a function of its geometry. Validating this approach, the affer=\r\nent weights of an ANN self-organize in this paper to form a genuine topogra=\r\nphic map of the input space for a simple line orientation task. Most intere=\r\nstingly, this seed can then be evolved further, providing a method to guide=\r\n the self-organization of weights in a specific way, much as evolution like=\r\nly guided the self-organizing trajectories of biological brains.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;C=\r\nheers,&lt;br&gt;Sebastian&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sebastian Risi&lt;br&gt;Assistant Professor =\r\n&lt;br&gt;IT University of Copenhagen, Room 5D08&lt;br&gt;Rued Langgaards Vej 7, 2300 C=\r\nopenhagen, Denmark&lt;br&gt;email: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:sebastian.risi@...&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sebastian.risi@...&lt;/a&gt;, web: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.se=\r\nbastianrisi.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.sebastianrisi.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nmobile: &lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;tel:%2B45-50250355&quot; value=3D&quot;+4550250355&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;+45-5=\r\n0250355&lt;/a&gt;, office: &lt;a href=3D&quot;tel:%2B45-7218-5127&quot; value=3D&quot;+4572185127&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;+45-7218-5127&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n=\r\n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/bl=\r\nockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--047d7bdc9146809a3204f859098c--\r\n\n"}}
