If you get this wrong then the\n&gt;&gt;system performs a very inefficient search of the search space, e.g.\n&gt;&gt;always connecting to the &#39;outer&#39; neurons at the ends of the 1D space.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;At the moment I am addressing that by limiting all fIDs to a range of 0 - 1.\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, for the boards, I start the system with the 4 build-in boards (mine, \n&gt;yours, empty, our-of-range) positioned evenly through the range (.125, \n&gt;.375, .625, .875) so I know there are no outrageously large gaps...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI think the problem grows with the size of the genome. As you branch off \n(branch in 1D space?) into new areas of space it becomes more difficult \nto think of a scheme that would result in attempts to connect into those \npotentially far away areas that isn&#39;t also really bad at exploring local \nspace. There&#39;s probably a really simple elegant solution. Oh and I was \nnever quite sure how many dimensions would work best, or in fact why I \nshould use one continous space of N-dimensions at all.\n\n&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t say whether this works due to other problems with my set up, but\n&gt;&gt;it&#39;s definitely something I would like to get back to someday if I get time.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         It&#39;s good to know that great minds continue to think alike :)\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis is probably an indication that there is some underlying fundamental \nunified system that we are converging upon.... just kidding! Actually \nI&#39;m glad you put a smiley on the end of that sentence.\n\n&gt;         This idea of offsetting the fIDs to give local connections and \n&gt;modularity is one that I haven&#39;t considered so much.  I have considered a \n&gt;plan where nested data structures use multiple fIDs to identify the \n&gt;separate parts.  e.g. if we have something roughtly equivalent to:\n&gt;\n&gt;struct Coord {\n&gt;         float x;\n&gt;         float y;\n&gt;         float z;\n&gt;};\n&gt;\n&gt;         Then a fID on the outer item (the Coord) identifies it as a \n&gt;coordinate, and separate fIDs on the x, y and z identify them.\n&gt;\n&gt;         Whether in this scheme you need fIDs for &quot;name&quot; as well as &quot;type&quot; \n&gt;I do not yet know (e.g. my_pos and your_pos are both &quot;coords&quot; but that \n&gt;doesn&#39;t mean no system would need to distinguish between them).\n&gt;\n&gt;         I have gone into this in some detail in the Manifesto for Evolving \n&gt;Agents.  I&#39;ve put that on hold for a while so I can work on SLEAT, but I \n&gt;still intend to finish it one day :)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nJust think of all the sidetracks as building up knowledge and code as a \nbasis for the other stuff. ;)\n\nColin.\n\n\n&gt;         Ian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In fifteen minutes, everybody will be in the future.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\t\t\n&gt;___________________________________________________________ \n&gt;To help you stay safe and secure online, we&#39;ve developed the all new Yahoo!
