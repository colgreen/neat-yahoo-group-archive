Am I right when I seem to \n&gt;notice more than one recurrent connections on the same link to \n&gt;itself?  (i.e. double loops)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAhh yes, well spotted. I think the code that checks for duplicate \nconnections isn&#39;t checking for recurrent connections.\n\n&gt;Also, I think more important than distinguishing strength through \n&gt;color is distinguishing excitatory from inhibitory.  Then strength \n&gt;could be thickness.  If thickness gives too much clutter, you could \n&gt;make the scale of widths very small, like only thickness between 1 \n&gt;and 3 or even 1 and 2.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYeh ok I&#39;ll try limiting the width by scaling it down to a small range. \nRight now the weights range from -5(blue) to +5(red). 0=turns out to be \npurple on the scale which isn&#39;t ideal. I also tried mapping weight to a \nhue in the hue/saturation/brightness system but it generates to many \ncolors to be useful.\n\nColin.\n\n\n"}}
