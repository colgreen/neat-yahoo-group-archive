[neat]\n&lt;neat@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m curious, how do you think evolution with a random uniform mutation distribution\n&gt; compares to RMS-Prop or regular SGD?  Would it tend to act like GD and kind of slow\n&gt; down on shallow gradient dimensions, or would it be more even-handed like\n&gt; RMS-Prop, or perhaps something in the middle?\n\nRandom mutation doesn&#39;t have that specifc flaw of GD that RMSProp is\nsolving, namely that GD is really slow escaping locations with very\nlow gradient. Random search ignores the gradient so can&#39;t get stuck in\nthat way.\n\nRMSProp doesn&#39;t ignore the gradient, but it does sort of ignore its\n/magnitude/ (but not the sign). I say &#39;sort of&#39; because fluctuations\nin the magnitude do affect the path it takes.\n\nRandom search will of course travel in the wrong direction 50% of the\ntime (w.r.t. a given axis), and it has the same issues around choosing\na good step size, i.e. we have to experimentaly find good weight\nmutation deltas. Good step sizes are not discovered automatically.\n\nFinally, random search has no equivalent of RMSProp&#39;s &#39;per variable&#39;\nlearning rate. Hence it has that problem of trying to use a step size\nthat is good for all of the variables, but the success of RMSProp\nsuggests that the &#39;one step size fits all&#39; approach is problematic.\n\nColin\n\n"}}
