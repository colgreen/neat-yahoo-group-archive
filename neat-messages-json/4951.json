I apolo=\r\ngize for that.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for getting different results when reloading genomes=\r\n, the most common reason for this error have been conflicting or missing pa=\r\nrams.txt files, as Colin suggested.  The only other situations I&#39;ve run int=\r\no have been accidentally using different substrates and recently when someo=\r\nne created their visualizer project the references to SharpNeatLib got mess=\r\ned up.  That last one seemed like a special case, but you can test for it b=\r\ny using this code outline to load and test a genome in your main class.  Yo=\r\nu can also use MessageBox.show() in your visualization project with this co=\r\nde to see if that produces the correct fitness value.\n&gt; \n&gt; NeatGenome testG=\r\nenome;\t\t\n&gt; try\n&gt; {\n&gt; \tXmlDocument XML =3D new XmlDocument();\n&gt; \tXML.Load(te=\r\nstGenomeFilename);\n&gt; \ttestGenome =3D XmlNeatGenomeReaderStatic.Read(XML);\n&gt;=\r\n }\n&gt; catch (Exception e)\n&gt; {\n&gt; \tSystem.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Problem loading g=\r\nenome: &#92;n&quot; + e.Message);\n&gt; \tSystem.Environment.Exit(1);\n&gt; }\n&gt; YourNetworkEv=\r\naluator eval =3D new YourNetworkEvaluator();\n&gt; double fitness =3D eval.netw=\r\norkEvaluate(testGenome.Decode());\n&gt; System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Fitness:  &quot; +=\r\n fitness);\n&gt; \n&gt; Failing that, your method #3 was correct.  The process for =\r\nloading a genome is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Setup experimental parameters.\n&gt; 2. Load the X=\r\nML into a genome.\n&gt; 3. Decode the genome into a CPPN (as an INetwork)\n&gt; 4. =\r\nUse your Substrate to query the CPPN, producing a NeatGenome or INetwork th=\r\nat will be used in the domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; So that seems OK.  You can try dumping =\r\nthe INetworks produced by the substrate (i.e. the actual ANNs being evaluat=\r\ned) of the best genomes to XML and compare those to the networks you get fr=\r\nom loading the genomes back in during visualization and putting them throug=\r\nh the substrate.  If they are the same, perhaps some of the domain paramete=\r\nrs are different?  If they are different, check that the substrates and rel=\r\nated parameters are the same (using YourNetworkEvalutor.substrate can help =\r\nwith this issue).\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know how things go,\n&gt; David D&#39;Ambrosio\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel&quot; &lt;daniel_kuppitz@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No, I=\r\n use the same params.txt in each project. But what I found out now is that =\r\nI&#39;ve mixed up the constructor parameters; instead of passing the 9 as the o=\r\nutput neuron parameter I passed it as the hidden neuron parameter. After ch=\r\nanging that I got one OutOfMemoryException after another. There&#39;s a bug in =\r\nSubstrate.cs in line 133:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for (uint outputs =3D 0; outputs &lt; outpu=\r\ntCount; output++, coordinates[2] +=3D outputDelta)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; should be\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; for (uint outputs =3D 0; outputs &lt; outputCount; outputs++, coordinates[=\r\n2] +=3D outputDelta)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m quite sure that I never touched this line=\r\n of code. Unfortunately my initial problem is back - the visualizer produce=\r\ns different outputs.
