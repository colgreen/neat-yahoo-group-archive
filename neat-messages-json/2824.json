For example, \nChris =\r\nChristenson had some success with it, but I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s \nstill reading =\r\nthis group.\n\nIn any case, the number of generations (and hence the length o=\r\nf \ntime) it takes to solve a problem depends on problem difficulty, so \nit&#39;=\r\ns difficult to give an accurate estimate, but 7 hours is probably \na reason=\r\nable expectation for the problem you cite.  \n\nIn fact, supervised classific=\r\nation problems tend to be faster than \ncontrol problems since they don&#39;t in=\r\nvolve a domain simulator, so you \ncan expect it to be possibly a lot faster=\r\n.  However, if you use BP \nyou have to factor in the time that adds to each=\r\n evaluation, \ndepending how you fold it into your procedure.\n\nI&#39;m also gues=\r\nsing you will not need two hidden layers of 8 hidden \nnodes each to solve y=\r\nour problem.  NEAT usually discovers that it \ntakes a lot less than you exp=\r\nect to solve problems that seem like \nthey should be difficult.\n\nFinally, N=\r\nEAT has been applied to real world industrial problems in \nsimulation, but =\r\nI&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s been literally used in e.g a \nreal factory or somethin=\r\ng like that.  But a 300 instance \nclassification sounds fairly straightforw=\r\nard. \n\nken \n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimike002@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry , just to clarify for (3) if we took an example with \n&gt; say 300=\r\n training samples, with say 100 samples in the test set.\n&gt; Just to try and =\r\nget an idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;aimike002&quot; &lt;aimik=\r\ne002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi I&#39;m taking a look for possibly using in for my Mas=\r\nters \nproject,\n&gt; &gt; which  needs evolving the architecture for a neural net =\r\nfor a \nreal\n&gt; &gt; world application. \n&gt; &gt; I have read some of Ken Stanley&#39;s p=\r\napers on the web but beyond \nthat\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m a beginner, so if I may ask some =\r\nbeginner&#39;s questions:\n&gt; &gt; 1) I think my neural net may be evolved using GAs=\r\n , but fine \ntuned to\n&gt; &gt; optimise using standard BP (ie hybrid approach). =\r\nHas anybody \nelse been\n&gt; &gt; down that path using NEAT, taking e.g. the weigh=\r\nts evolved using \nNEAT\n&gt; &gt; & feeding them into some standard BP software?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2) Has NEAT been used in any &#39;real world&#39;/industrial \napplications yet?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and a &#39;how long is a piece of string question&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)  As =\r\nyet  have no feel for how long the evolution might take. \nI&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; ran a fe=\r\nw of the downloaded sample executables they seem to take \nquite\n&gt; &gt; a while=\r\n to run. My neural net has 8 inputs, one output and if we \nguess\n&gt; &gt; at a f=\r\ninal neural net of 2 hidden layers with 8 nodes per layer. \nIf we\n&gt; &gt; used =\r\nsay a 2GHz PC doing nothing else - could we guess at 7 hours\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. an o=\r\nvernight run) to evolve or is it more likely to be \nseveral\n&gt; &gt; days? Would=\r\n appreciate any best guesses or experience on this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in adva=\r\nnce\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mike\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
