You can recognize that in the paper itself. For example, what working mem=\r\nory is and how it works is part of ongoing research and we are far away fro=\r\nm understanding it. So one could guess that Spaun could help us to better u=\r\nnderstand how working memory works. But what becomes apparent in their pape=\r\nr is that they &#39;just&#39; implemented their own model of working memory. Thus, =\r\nno further insights about this cognitive ability can be gained. \n\n&gt; and whe=\r\nther that means we should question our devotion to neuroevolution as one of=\r\n the quickest paths to AGI. \n\nI totally agree with that. I can perfectly li=\r\nve with the fact that hand design can be in some cases faster than a neuroe=\r\nvolution approach. But I think, we all are interested in neuroevolution in =\r\norder to learn something about the basic principles nature uses to build co=\r\nmplex network and thereby complex behavior?! \n\nAlthough I find it quite har=\r\nd to incorporate the methods that have been developed in this field (e.g. N=\r\nEAT and CPPNS) into my studies that aim to understand natural brain by buil=\r\nding artificial models, I think in the long run only an unbiased search thr=\r\nough topologies can help us to find the biological concepts through which c=\r\nomplex behavior can be implemented. I think, we still understand too less a=\r\nbout the brain in order to build it in an objective driven approach. Instea=\r\nd, an evolutionary approach could even constrain the search space in order =\r\nto find scalable and plastic networks that can handle complex tasks. Admitt=\r\nedly, developing the right methods to do that is a difficult task on its ow=\r\nn.\n\nBest,\nMartin\n\n\n\n\n"}}
