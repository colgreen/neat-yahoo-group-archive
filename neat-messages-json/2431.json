Well, for example, each evolving species is a population, \n&gt;with a variety of different individuals in it, that&#39;s how its search \n&gt;works, but as soon as we assign species by direct comparison, we \n&gt;suddenly define the members of the species as all being similar to \n&gt;some degree (and we also prevent any other species from exploring the \n&gt;same individuals).  So I wonder if we hamper our species by being too \n&gt;precise in how we assign individuals.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI don&#39;t think the degree of precision is ever problem but the means of \ncomparison may be.\n\n&gt;Anyway, to get back a point or two.  &quot;Species&quot; created by comparisons \n&gt;would seem better named as &quot;categories&quot; to me, e.g. because that&#39;s \n&gt;what we did, we categorised the population...\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe terms species and speciation fit in nicely with what we&#39;re doing. \nIt&#39;s just that right now we speciate based upon the results of a \ncomparison.We&#39;re splitting hairs a bit here eh :)\n\nTo recap, the main idea I&#39;m getting from this discussion is that we \nmight see benefits from more clever speciation techniques. I suspect the \ncurrent scheme is fine for the plain old non-modular NEAT genome because \nit is so small and the same structures are likely arrived at \nindependently via different lineages - and we want to keep those similar \nstructures in the same species, otherwise we have redundant species.\n\nHowever,  I suspect the sorts of issues you raise become relevant when \nusing indirect encodings where small changes in the genome are able to \ncause dramatic changes. You maybe need some way of tagging bits of the \ngenome as being more important when comparing (evolved comparison \nweights), and ultimately you might want to shortcut the comparison \nprocedure by setting species ID&#39;s once a species has existed for some \namount of time - this means from now on you don&#39;t bother comparing with \na genome that doesn&#39;t have that ID. This is a bit more like nature then \nin that we have hard lines drawn between groups - once you draw the line \n(define a species) there is no crossing back into another group.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
