But things got \ncomplicated \n&gt; m=\r\nainly because there is no way to make a matrix-like input layer, \nand \n&gt; to=\r\n place the hidden and output nodes in positions that are \nmeaningful. \n&gt; An=\r\n intuitive idea is to put the output at the center and the inputs \nand \n&gt; h=\r\nidden neurons around it, but then it becomes not a visual field, \nyou \n&gt; kn=\r\now, a grid of inputs. The solution was to add an extra dimention \nand \n&gt; to=\r\n put the hidden and output nodes behind the input layer, not on \nit. \n&gt; I t=\r\nhink this is good, even in reality there are only 3D neural \n&gt; networks, 2D=\r\n is just a simplification. \n&gt; Someone had mentioned that a roving eye is a =\r\ncontroller and a \n&gt; classifier at the same time. I guess it is hard for Hyp=\r\nerNEAT to \nfigure \n&gt; out how to control the eye at first. This is very impo=\r\nrtant. \n&gt; Currently I am trying out Jason&#39;s suggestion about it (normalizin=\r\ng \nthe \n&gt; inputs to avoid the multiplication problem.), but it still doesn&#39;=\r\nt \n&gt; learn to find the shape on the field. \n&gt; Perhaps I should not use a ro=\r\nving eye at all? \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:neat%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt; com, \nStephen Waits\n&gt; &lt;steve@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On May 1, 2007, at =\r\n4:51 AM, petar_chervenski wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; substrate space is 3D=\r\n cartesian.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Have you tried it on a 2D space?
