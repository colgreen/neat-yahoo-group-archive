I&#39;m not sure if it has any benefits over the\n&gt; &gt;existing system or not. =\r\n Nor do I have a clear idea of how it might be\n&gt; &gt;implemented.  But maybe t=\r\nhere is merit to the idea.  Anybody have any\n&gt; &gt;thoughts or comments?\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;m still contemplating my next move, but it sounds like we&#39;re coming\n&gt; at t=\r\nhe same limitations with different approaches?\n\nPerhaps.  Recognize speciat=\r\nion for what it was: an attempt to protect\ngenetic diversity.  Explore the =\r\npossibility that speciation, while\nbeing *A* way to accomplish that goal, m=\r\nay not be the ONLY way, and it\nmay not even be the BEST way.  Humans are on=\r\nly ONE species.  Yet we\nhave a great deal of genetic diversity.   There mus=\r\nt be a way, within\nthe species itself, of accomplishing that goal.\n\nThe mor=\r\ne I think about it, the more I think that the hard-edged\ndemarcation of bou=\r\nndaries is not the best way to go.  The existence of\n&#39;variable speciation t=\r\nhreshold&#39; is evidence that such is the case.\n\nIf you randomly select from a=\r\n population, the results of your sample\nset should be proportional to the p=\r\nroportions of the population.  We\ndon&#39;t want that.  We want to maintain the=\r\n genetic diversity.  But, of\ncourse, we want to manage our resource allocat=\r\nion based on productive\nsearch areas.  So an elegant and flexible method is=\r\n needed that lets\nus control where in this &#39;diverse&#39; sea of genomes we focu=\r\ns.\n\nWhat is an elegant (even if it is computationally intense) solution\nbes=\r\nides speciation?\n\nWell, speciation, done right, is basically &#39;clustering&#39;. =\r\n Done right,\nclustering doesn&#39;t have a fixed threshold.  Nor does it have a=\r\n fixed\ncluster count.  Clusters are where clusters are.  Just find them.  S=\r\no\nthe work to maintain a fixed number of species probably isn&#39;t a good\nidea=\r\n.  But you can&#39;t have every individual in their own species,\nright?  Only b=\r\necause of how a species is used to constrain\nreproduction.  If reproduction=\r\n were constrained not by cluster but by\nindividual pairings of compatible i=\r\nndividuals, then the whole concept\nof a species would not be necessary.  It=\r\n would, however, be useful for\ncontrolling resource allocation, so an alter=\r\nnative / replacement would\nbe needed.\n\nSay you have 1000 individuals in the=\r\n population.  Pair them up, and\nyou have 500 pairs.  Each pair could be com=\r\nbined in multiple ways.  So\neach pairing could produce 2-5 (or more) offspr=\r\ning.  Let&#39;s say they\nall produce 5 offspring.  You could then re-pair each =\r\nindividual with\na different individual.  Repeat however often you like.  Ad=\r\nd to that\nelitism, selecting the most fit individuals from each region of t=\r\nhe\nsearch space.  Add to that random weight mutations.  And random\ntopology=\r\n mutations.\n\nLet&#39;s say that your 1000 individuals become, for the sake of a=\r\nrgument,\n10,000 individuals.  Now, you don&#39;t want to test them all.  So,\nin=\r\nstead, you sample the 1000 of them that best represent the whole\nsearch spa=\r\nce covered by that 10,000, with a little bias for areas of\nthe search space=\r\n where the fitness is higher.\n\nThe purist that tries to squeeze out every l=\r\nast bit of performance\nfrom the genome portion of the evolution would proba=\r\nbly call that a\nwaste of computational resources.  But for a really large a=\r\nnd complex\nsearch space, I propose that this will make for a much more effi=\r\ncient\nsearch that is less likely to get stuck in a local optima.  Thus,\nred=\r\nucing the amount of fitness evaluations (the really expensive part\nof any n=\r\non-trivial domain), you win in the end.\n\nBut the only way to know for sure =\r\nis to try it out and see what the\nresults are.  That means figuring out the=\r\n right way to do that\n&#39;sampling&#39;.  Anybody have any suggestions on how best=\r\n do do that\nrepresentative sampling of the search space covered by the 10,0=\r\n00\nindividuals?\n\n-- John\n\n"}}
