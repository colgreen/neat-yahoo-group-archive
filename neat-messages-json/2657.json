As you&#39;d expect, being a new professor is very time \ncons=\r\numing, which has kept me from posting as much as I&#39;d like to in \nthis group=\r\n.  In any case, I did manage to start a research group, \nwhich is called &quot;E=\r\nPlex,&quot; which is short for the Evolutionary \nComplexity Research Group at UC=\r\nF.  You may find it interesting to \nbrowse our (very new) site:\n\nhttp://epl=\r\nex.cs.ucf.edu/\n\nThis group is about what it says: how to evolve high-level =\r\n\ncomplexity with computers.  Evolutionary computation has so far \nfailed to=\r\n accomplish this feat, even as nature has clearly \nsucceeded.  Thus there i=\r\ns some break in the analogy between the two, \nand we are aiming to bridge t=\r\nhat gap.  Not surprisingly, I think the \nNEAT method is part of the puzzle,=\r\n though clearly not the whole \nthing.  Indirect encoding is another big par=\r\nt.\n\nWe do have a single publication, which is a tech report I just \nrecentl=\r\ny put up.  (A shorter symposium version will also be up \nshortly):\n\nhttp://=\r\neplex.cs.ucf.edu/index.php?\noption=3Dcom_content&task=3Dview&id=3D14&Itemid=\r\n=3D28#stanley.ucftr0601\n\n(It&#39;s also available from the publications section=\r\n of the EPlex site)\n\nYou&#39;ll see from the report and the site that I got a l=\r\not of new \nideas about indirect encoding from playing with NEAT-based Genet=\r\nic \nArt programs! (thanks to Mattias and Holger for writing those \nprograms=\r\n)  Anyway, you can read the paper for more.  I&#39;m happy to \ndiscuss it :)\n\nk=\r\nen\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
