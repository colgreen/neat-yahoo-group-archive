Everytime I think I&#39;ve got a great idea,\n&gt; you post a link to the paper you wrote on it.\n&gt; So the conclusion was that it was good for input types that are easily\n&gt; scalable, like vision processing. That is certainly important to me. Do\n&gt; you have that framework for folks like me to play with?\n\nHi Chad,\n\nSince I&#39;m the author of that software I figured I should reply. The short\nanswer is yes, the code exists. :) The long answer is that yes it exists,\nbut its not very well commented nor particularly user friendy (though it\ndoes have a similar structure to Ken&#39;s implementation). Basically I wrote\na version of NEAT from scratch with the &quot;genes as networks&quot; idea firmly in\nmind, so the code organization really reflects that fundamentally. My\noriginal design really needs to be refactored since there are several very\ncruel bits of code that are necessary for it to function.\n\nThat being said, I&#39;d be more than happy to send you a copy of everything\nand help out with getting it to run on your system (its all linux code,\nbut should port more or less directly since the newtork rendering is\nseparate). Basically there is no public release because 1) I haven&#39;t had a\nlot of time to clean up the code and 2) fundamentally the idea we tried is\na little shaky and could be done better (particularly, if you read the\npaper, separating the subnetworks and expression information genetically\ndoes not seem to be the best idea).\n\nJoe\n\n-- \n\nJoseph Reisinger\nhttp://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/joeraii\n\n"}}
