Because it&#39;s a g=\r\nood opportunity for neuroevolution and evolutionary computation to be highl=\r\nighted in a prominent and entertaining mainstream AI venue (and win a prize=\r\n), I am posting below the call for videos.  I encourage you to submit to th=\r\ne competition.  You do not have to win to be accepted and have your video d=\r\nisplayed and permanently archived:\n\nDear Colleague,\n \nAAAI is pleased to an=\r\nnounce the continuation of the AI Video Competition, now entering its fourt=\r\nh year. The screening of the videos nominated for awards, as well as the aw=\r\nard presentations, will be held in conjunction with AAAI-10 in Atlanta, Geo=\r\nrgia, July 11-15.\n \nThe goal of the competition is to show the world how mu=\r\nch fun AI is by documenting exciting artificial intelligence advances in re=\r\nsearch, education, and application. The rules are simple: Compose a short v=\r\nideo about an exciting AI project, and narrate it so that it is accessible =\r\nto a broad online audience. The developers of award-winning videos will be =\r\npresented with Oscar-like trophies (&quot;Shakeys,&quot; in honor of SRI&#39;s Shakey rob=\r\not and its pioneering video) in an awards ceremony at AAAI-10 on July 11.\nW=\r\ne strongly encourage student participation.\n\nVideo Formats\nEither 1 minute =\r\n(max) short video or a 5 minute (max) long video, with English narration (o=\r\nr English subtitles). Consider combining screen shots, interviews, and vide=\r\no of a system in action. Make the video self-contained, so that newcomers t=\r\no AI can understand and learn from it. We encourage a good sense of humor, =\r\nbut will only accept submissions with serious AI content. For example, we w=\r\nelcome submissions of videos that:\n \n=95\tHighlight your own (contemporary o=\r\nr previous) research \n=95\tFocus on the activities (research and/or applicat=\r\nion) of your (or another) group \n=95\tIntroduce viewers to an exciting new A=\r\nI-related topic \n=95\tDocument some long-term activity of a senior researche=\r\nr \n=95\tInclude interviews with key researchers/practitioners \n=95\tCan be us=\r\ned in the classroom \n=95\tWould otherwise interest prospective students to t=\r\nhe field of AI \n=95\tIncludes a narration \n\nHowever, please note that this l=\r\nist is incomplete and not mandatory.  Novel ideas for AI-based videos, incl=\r\nuding those not necessarily based on a &quot;system in action&quot; are encouraged.  =\r\nNo matter what your choice, creativity is encouraged! (Please note: The dev=\r\nelopers of previous, award-winning AI Videos typically highlighted humor, b=\r\nackground music/tracks, and/or carefully selected movie clips to make their=\r\n presentations come alive and interest our prospective viewers and PC membe=\r\nrs.)  Your video is an opportunity to highlight your area of AI to a wide c=\r\nommunity.\n \nSubmissions\nVideo submissions must be downloadable; they cannot=\r\n be accepted from services like Youtube.  Submit your video by placing it a=\r\nt a publicly-accessible www site & notifying the Video Competition Cochairs=\r\n, Arnav Jhala (jhala@...) and Ken Stanley(kstanley@...), b=\r\ny email. You are also asked to complete a submission form. For complete ins=\r\ntructions about the submission and review process (including the submission=\r\n form), please visit the AI Video website at http://aivideo.org. All submis=\r\nsions are due no later than May 17, 2010. Notifications will be mailed on J=\r\nune 16, 2010, and final videos will be due to the organizers by June 30, 20=\r\n10. All developers of nominated videos will be asked to sign a distribution=\r\n license form. Videos must not contain any copyrighted video, audio, or cha=\r\nracters.\n \nWe look forward to your participation in this exciting event!\n \n=\r\nBest Regards,\n \nKen Stanley, Arnav Jhala, and Chad Jenkins\n2010 AI Video Co=\r\nmpetition CoChairs\n\n\n\n\n"}}
