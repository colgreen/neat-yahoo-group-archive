I developed a NEAT implementation for Borland Delphi. I \nhaven&#39;t made it widely available yet, though it&#39;s open source, and I send \nit out to anyone who wants a copy. \n\nI did a lot of work with NEAT in the end of 2002, my NEAT implementation \ndoesn&#39;t perform as well as Ken&#39;s, though. I havent been able to track \ndown why. On XOR, we&#39;re very comparable, but on pole balancing, I \nfrequently fail to find a solution, something that never happened (as I \nrecall) with Kens implementation.\n\nI&#39;ve done some other stuff in evolution;\n\n* I evolved some movement routines for simulated physical objects (GP and \nNEAT). Jumping creatures, slitherling creatures and crawling creatures. \nFor demos and images, see http://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/Evolved/ . \n\n* I evolved images and films using GP. See \nhttp://www.cambrianlabs.com/Mattias/EvolvedFilms/\n\n* I evolved trading strategies (GP and NEAT) for the stockmarket. I&#39;d \nlike to get back to evolving trading strategies using NEAT and GP, so I \ncan compare them, but that will have to wait. \n\n* I evolved behaviours for agents competing for resources using GP. They \nwere quite agressive, some would even eat their children. Not a good long \nterm strategy, but in short term, it can work out fine. If there&#39;s a flaw \nin your environment, evolution will find it and exploit it remorselessly. \nLike the child eaters; when a creature was ready to pro-create, it would \npick a second parent for it&#39;s child using a set of (evolved) attractions. \nOne attraction might be &quot;has had a lot of children&quot;. This is (can be) a \ngood attraction, because having lots of children will mean that your \noffspring is also likely to have lots of children. What isn&#39;t attractive \nis &quot;has had a lot of children... and then ate them!&quot;! The entire \npopulation was quicky upsurped (sp?) by child eaters, &#39;cause they were so \ndarn sexy, and then died. It was horrible to watch ;)\n\nIt could easily have been done using NEAT instead, but that&#39;ll have to \nwait for a later day.\n\nWith my NEAT implementation, I&#39;ve also added a couple of demos, like \ncorridor following and &quot;symbolic regression&quot;. I&#39;d like to make my NEAT \nwork freely available, but I&#39;m kinda short on time right now.\n\nAs for making sourceforge projects, perhaps I should create a project for \nDelphiNEAT and include my evolved creatures and my &quot;little playground of \nhorrid creatures&quot; - what do you reckon?\n\ncheers,\nm\n\n\n"}}
