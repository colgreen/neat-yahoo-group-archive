Because the cells need the answer to the \nquestion &quot;Who am =\r\nI?&quot;, the CPPN can provide that info without any \ninteraction between cells.=\r\n It can also provide instructions about, for \nexample &quot;Should I divide or n=\r\not? Should I change my type?&quot;. \nWhile it seems like an overkill, because CP=\r\nPNs already abstract this \naway without having to introduce time for develo=\r\npment, the patterns \ngenerated are hard to interpret as distinct physical o=\r\nbjects. \nEspecially in cases of repeating patterns. But objects generated w=\r\nith \ncellular growth instructed by CPPNs produce only a single object, all =\r\n\nwith its distinct parts and regularities. And not ripped apart with \nartif=\r\nacts as it would be after converting it from a CPPN snapshot \nimage. One mi=\r\nght say that such objects can still be infinte in size, \nbut it is easy to =\r\nput a limitation on the number of cells or cell \ndivisions. It is also poss=\r\nible to make the limit dynamic, more complex \nCPPNs producing phenotypes wi=\r\nth more cells.\n\nPeter\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kenneth Stanley&quot; &lt;ksta=\r\nnley@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Alexandre, thank you for bringing up reaction-diffusio=\r\nn systems.  \nYou\n&gt; make a good point- my statement was too broad, in part b=\r\necause\n&gt; &quot;cellular growth model&quot; is a fairly ambiguous term that can\n&gt; pote=\r\nntially refer to many types of systems.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just to clarify my statement=\r\n, I was responding the line of \ndiscussion\n&gt; with Peter about encodings tha=\r\nt actually create distinct bodily \nshapes\n&gt; that are self-contained and hav=\r\ne clear structural boundaries (which\n&gt; reaction-diffusion systems tend not =\r\nto produce; rather they produce\n&gt; wallpaper-like patterns).  Often when gro=\r\nwth-based models are used \nto\n&gt; define actual bodies with distinct borders,=\r\n they are studied in the\n&gt; context of blobs with a particular focus on how =\r\nthe blob knows when \nto\n&gt; stop growing so that a border shape can be create=\r\nd.  That kind of\n&gt; systems goes along with the &quot;skin&quot; issue that we were di=\r\nscussing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nevertheless, the field is quite broad and there are many po=\r\nssible\n&gt; interesting examples of such systems.  If I could revisit my\n&gt; sta=\r\ntement, I would reword it such as to avoid implying any sweeping\n&gt; generali=\r\nzation.\n&gt; \n&gt; ken\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In neat@yahoogroups.com, Alexandre Devert &lt;mar=\r\nmakoide@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Along these lines, I have rarely s=\r\neen a cellular growth model\n&gt; produce anything more than a blob or an amorp=\r\nhous shape without \nclear\n&gt; parts.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you consider reaction-diffu=\r\nsion systems as a cellular growth\n&gt; model, then you might consider the foll=\r\nowing publications :\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Interactive Evolution of Dynamical Systems, Karl =\r\nSims&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Advanced Reaction-Diffusion Models for Texture Synthesis, Allen =\r\n\nR.\n&gt; Sanderson et al.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Those patterns are a bit above the average=\r\n blob and features very\n&gt; compact description.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Alexan=\r\ndre Devert\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
