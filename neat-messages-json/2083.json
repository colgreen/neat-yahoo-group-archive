Would it be making very\nrapid movements in a=\r\n small area?\n\nFYI, this champ was evolved in 17 generations and has 21 gene=\r\ns (nodes\nand connections).  We used a population size of 1000, and our muta=\r\ntion\nscheme with rates of 0.015 for new connections, 0.005 for new nodes,\na=\r\nnd 0.75 for perturbing existing connection weights.
