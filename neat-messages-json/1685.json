Have you posted any information about that? \n&gt;I don&#39;t remember seeing it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHi Mitchell,\n\nI started out wanting to search for optimal connection weight mutate \nschemes, and I did post an explanation of how I was going to do that a \nnot long ago. In the end though I decided to expand the idea to search \nfor all parameters, e.g. initial population size, initial connection \nproportion, selection proportion, mutation rates, etc.\n\nThe idea is a simple one, create a population of parameters and for each \none run the NEAT algorithm and average out the performance of each run. \nThis gives a fitness that I then use to select the children of the next \ngeneration of parameters. I also wrapped up the parameters in a seperate \nclass that incorporates mutation functions - crossover I haven&#39;t yet \nimplemented.\n\nThe result is an evolution algorithm that sits on top of NEATs evolution \nalgorithm and takes a heck of a long time to run, since each individual \nevaluation is a NEAT run.\n\nIf you&#39;re interested in more details then let me know and I&#39;ll try and \nput something together on the SharpNEAT web site.\n\nColin.\n\n"}}
