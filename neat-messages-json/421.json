As people said, such a conversion wouldn&#39;t\nbe too difficult in either direction.  One reason it would be nice is\nbecause for example I would like to run my old genome files through\nDerek and Philip&#39;s visualization, since it looks nicer than what I\ncurrently have working in Gtk.  \n\nA few more comments on the genome format below...\n\n&gt; Derek James wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Our Java implementation persists chromosomes in XML. \n&gt; &gt;Here&#39;s an example of a generational champion from a\n&gt; &gt;successful XOR run:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;chromosome id=&quot;2853&quot; primary-parent-id=&quot;2763&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;neuron id=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;[...]\n&gt; &gt;&lt;neuron id=&quot;2&quot; type=&quot;IN&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;neuron id=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;OUT&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;connection id=&quot;4&quot; src-id=&quot;0&quot; dest-id=&quot;3&quot;\n&gt; &gt;weight=&quot;-1.3731676929130425&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;[...]\n&gt; &gt;&lt;/chromosome&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n\nThe connections gene representation seems to be missing two features\nthat I would expect it to have:\n\n   -An enable/disable bit\n   -A recurrency flag\n\nIn particular, I am not sure how the NEAT algorithm can be \nimplemented (with respect to the standard operations in our papers)\nwithout the ability to disable a gene?  Also the previous discussion\non simplification would require such a tag.\n\nThe recurrency flag isn&#39;t really necessary, but I have one in my\ngenome files because it&#39;s very convenient to sort of quickly get\na sense of how much recurrency is being used, and it is also \nconvenient in some cases for graphing to know immediately which \nconnections are recurrent so they can be treated differently.\n\nOne other thing about printing out entire populations.  In my\npopulation files (which C++ NEAT users may have noticed are usually\ncalled gen_#) I concatenate the whole population of genomes into\na single file, wherein the genomes are clustered by species, and\nthere is a comment line before each species and before each individual\ngiving stats.  It looks like this:\n\n/* Species #2 : (Size 13) (AF 527.769) (Age 95)  */\n\n\n/* Organism #0 Fitness: 581 Error: 0 */\ngenomestart 0\ntrait 1 0 0.848808 0.882801 0.344799 0 0.373562 0.416089 0.0389927 \nnode 1 1 1 1\nnode 2 1 1 1\nnode 3 1 1 1\nnode 4 1 1 1\nnode 5 1 1 1\nnode 6 1 1 1\nnode 7 1 1 1\nnode 8 1 1 1\nnode 9 1 1 1\nnode 10 1 1 1\nnode 11 1 1 1\n....\ngene 1 20 41 3.94827 0 777 3.94827 1\ngene 1 122 39 -0.750441 0 857 -0.750441 1\ngene 1 25 23 -1.79771 0 895 -1.79771 1\ngene 1 29 41 -1.92211 0 956 -1.92211 1\ngene 1 58 27 0.794163 0 996 0.794163 1\ngene 1 39 39 -4.56033 1 1006 -4.56033 1\ngene 1 11 214 1 0 1277 0 1\ngene 1 214 25 4.30976 0 1278 0 1\ngenomeend 0\n\n/* Organism #1 Fitness: 392 Error: 0 */\ngenomestart 1\ntrait 1 0 0.848808 0.882801 0.344799 0 0.74683 0.416089 0.0389927 \nnode 1 1 1 1\nnode 2 1 1 1\nnode 3 1 1 1\nnode 4 1 1 1\nnode 5 1 1 1\n.....\n\n.....\n\n/* Species #3 : (Size 19) (AF 545.263) (Age 95)  */\n\n\n/* Organism #13 Fitness: 523 Error: 0 */\ngenomestart 13\ntrait 1 0.471907 0.659827 0.198161 0.11114 0.174268 0.600994 0.104419\n0.761101 \nnode 1 1 1 1\nnode 2 1 1 1\nnode 3 1 1 1\nnode 4 1 1 1\nnode 5 1 1 1\nnode 6 1 1 1\nnode 7 1 1 1\n\n....\n\n\nSo in other words, it&#39;s really easy to grep through these pop files\nto get different quick summaries of what went on.  For example:\n\n$ grep Species gen_100a \n/* Species #2 : (Size 13) (AF 527.769) (Age 95)  */\n/* Species #3 : (Size 19) (AF 545.263) (Age 95)  */\n/* Species #4 : (Size 17) (AF 486) (Age 95)  */\n/* Species #11 : (Size 1) (AF 285) (Age 93)  */\n/* Species #23 : (Size 13) (AF 550.923) (Age 93)  */\n/* Species #41 : (Size 8) (AF 428) (Age 88)  */\n/* Species #48 : (Size 16) (AF 577.625) (Age 84)  */\n/* Species #49 : (Size 12) (AF 488.25) (Age 84)  */\n/* Species #52 : (Size 22) (AF 552.091) (Age 83)  */\n/* Species #68 : (Size 13) (AF 521.692) (Age 77)  */\n/* Species #70 : (Size 13) (AF 449.615) (Age 74)  */\n/* Species #75 : (Size 1) (AF 338) (Age 70)  */\n/* Species #77 : (Size 16) (AF 544.875) (Age 68)  */\n/* Species #81 : (Size 12) (AF 467.583) (Age 64)  */\n/* Species #88 : (Size 13) (AF 506.769) (Age 24)  */\n/* Species #89 : (Size 13) (AF 534.385) (Age 21)  */\n/* Species #91 : (Size 13) (AF 499.846) (Age 18)  */\n/* Species #93 : (Size 11) (AF 412.273) (Age 3)  */\n/* Species #94 : (Size 16) (AF 475.438) (Age 3)  */\n/* Species #95 : (Size 14) (AF 494) (Age 2)  */\n\nOr, to get summaries of the networks themselves:\n\n[kstanley@localhost NEATkiller]$ grep Fitness gen_100a\n/* Organism #0 Fitness: 581 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #1 Fitness: 392 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #2 Fitness: 473 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #3 Fitness: 548 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #4 Fitness: 422 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #5 Fitness: 573 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #6 Fitness: 552 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #7 Fitness: 567 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #8 Fitness: 477 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #9 Fitness: 598 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #10 Fitness: 584 Error: 0 */\n/* Organism #11 Fitness: 562 Error: 0 */\n\n.....\n\n\nAnyway, just some ideas to keep in mind.  I&#39;ve found it very \nconvenient to to be able to do these things with my output\nfiles, although I realize there are a million ways you can\nvisualize, edit, summarize, etc. population files.\n\nken\n\n\n"}}
