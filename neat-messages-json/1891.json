My p2nv.ne file has both of those parameters set to 0.\nThe effect is then that genes only become disabled when a new node \nis added, and the only way such a gene can become reenabled is \nduring a mating event:  if one of 2 matching genes is disabled \nduring mating, there is a 25% chance it will be reenabled in the \noffspring.  However, neither of those two parameters were used, as \nfar as I know.\n\nOf course, whether or not they were used does not detract from the \nlegitimacy of your question.  It is certainly still interesting the \nrate at which genes should be disabled or reinstated, and it is \nquite related to the work on pruning that e.g. Colin has been doing \nwith SharpNEAT, or Derek and Philip have been doing with ANJI (these \npeople are all in this group).  Although they use actual deletion \noperators, it is still related to disabling and the overall question \nof how much to simplify vs. complexify.  I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve seen \nany of their work in this area?\n\nken\n\n--- In neat@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Mike Frayn&quot; &lt;redcrocodile@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; Experienced programmer but very new to NEAT and to neuroevolution \nin \n&gt; general.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;m working on a project that involves evolving a group of cat \nagents \n&gt; that learn to successfully hunt an AI mouse in a pac-man style \nmaze (line of \n&gt; sight only).  Everything is going well so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I am curious to know everyone&#39;s thoughts about the two \nmutation \n&gt; properties listed in the subject header.  I notice that Ken has \nthem set at \n&gt; 0.1 and 0.05 for the DPNV experiment and 0.0 for the rest.  I am \nusing Mat \n&gt; Buckland&#39;s WinNEAT and have added these two mutators to the code \nbut am \n&gt; unsure at how much to put their probabilities at.  10% seems like \na lot for \n&gt; disabling genes and then only 1/20 of the time will we re-enable \none.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I have two questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Why so high for DPNV in particular?\n&gt; 2) What situations would you say that they are beneficial, when \nwould they \n&gt; not be too helpful?\n&gt; \n&gt; My networks have 16 inputs and 5 outputs, they will end up being \npartially \n&gt; recurrent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks\n&gt; Mike\n\n\n\n\n"}}
