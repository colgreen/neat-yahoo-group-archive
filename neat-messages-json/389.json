The first plots the\naverage number of connections among generational\nchampions from 13 runs.  This is compared to the\ncomplexity of 5 runs in which fitness was assigned\nrandomly, with the same evolutionary parameters.  But\ninstead of showing the average number of connections\namong the population, the averages of the smallest and\nlargest members of each generation are shown.\n\nWhy? Why not show the average complexity of the random\npopulation as a whole, instead of the range?  Just\neyeballing it, it looks like such an average would\nresult in a plot of complexity reasonably close to the\nplot for the average fittest individual complexity (of\ncourse, since we&#39;re only shown the max and min,\nthere&#39;s no way of knowing whether most members of the\nrandom-fitness population tended toward one extreme or\nthe other).\n\nIt seems as if the paper is suggesting that in the\nrandom-fitness population, because some members of the\npopulation complexified greatly, while others did not\ncomplexify much at all, that this demonstrates that\ncomplexification correlates with increased fitness. \nBut that doesn&#39;t look like a conclusion that you can\ndraw, at least from what&#39;s presented here.\n\nIt would seem more appropriate to compare the min and\nmax complexities of members of the regular and the\nrandom-fitness runs.  Is the range of complexity in a\nfitness-based run similar to the range in a\nrandom-fitness run?  \n\nOr, as I&#39;ve suggested above, compare the average\ncomplexity of the fittest member in the regular runs\nto the average complexity of the entire population of\nrandom-fitness runs.  As it stands, it seems like a\ncomparison of apples and oranges.\n\nIntuitively, it seems to me that the phenomenon of\nmaintaining such a range of complexity in a\nrandom-fitness population has to do with NEAT&#39;s\nhandling of speciated mating.  Less complex\nindividuals are going to only mate with one another,\nwhile individuals that are a result of mutated\ncomplexity are likewise going to only mate with one\nanother.  There is no selection pressure to drive\nsimple species to extinction, correct?  So they&#39;ll\nhang around.  But since NEAT is incrementally adding\nfeatures, later generations will tend to include more\nand more complex individuals, even when their fitness\nis not being evaluated.  So the average complexity of\nthe population is going to tend to increase over time,\nisn&#39;t it?\n\nThe paper says: &quot;These bounds show that the increase\nin complexity is not inevitable; both very simple and\nvery complex species exist in the population\nthroughout the run.&quot;\n\nWhat &quot;increase in complexity&quot; is the paper referring\nto?  There is most definitely an increase in\ncomplexity in the most complex member of each\ngeneration, and there seems to be an increase in the\naverage complexity of the population.  All this data\nshows is that some less complex members of the\npopulation are retained throughout a random-fitness\nrun, that not every member of every species\ncomplexifies.  And again, I just don&#39;t see how this\ndemonstrates a correlation between fitness and\ncomplexification.\n\nDerek\n\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
