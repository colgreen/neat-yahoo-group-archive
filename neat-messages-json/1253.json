Either assign it a random value at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the beginning of an each activation, or have its value change every time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is read.  The network will, of course, evolve to minimize the weights\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the random node.  But the presence of random fluctuations in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; environment will force it to adopt a different strategy of execution.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;We tried this with our tic-tac-toe player and it didn&#39;t seem to make\n&gt; &gt;much difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t expect it to make a difference for games.  I would only expect it\n&gt; to help for a controller.\n\nWhy not?  There are plenty of game domains where generating random\nbehavior is beneficial.  For example, the current best poker AI uses a\nprobability distribution to decide among prospective moves.  In poker,\nan easily recognizable (i.e. deterministic) strategy can often be\ndisastrous, especially if your opponent picks up on it.  In other\nwords, unpredictability is advantageous in many game domains.\n\nIn Tic-Tac-Toe, when a player is presented with a blank board at the\nbeginning of a new game, how do you decide where to play?  If a neural\nnetwork were completely deterministic, it would make exactly the same\nopening move every time.  Let&#39;s say for the sake of argument that it\nplays in the center.  But what if it&#39;s playing against a suboptimal\nopponent that knows how to block threats involving the center space,\nbut not those along the edges?  If the deterministic neural network\nnever varied its play, it would never find this weakness.\n\nA random input may not be the best way to evolve random behavior, but\nthere&#39;s little doubt that the ability of a player to generate\nrandomness in many game domains is an important feature.\n\nDerek\n\n"}}
