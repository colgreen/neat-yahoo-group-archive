I guess I&#39;d better introduce myself...\n&gt; I have a degree in Physics from Cardiff (UK), did 3 years \n&gt; Postgraduate research into the computer simulation of Polymers \nwhere \n&gt; I started to become interested in Genetic Algorithms applied to \nthe \n&gt; protein folding problem. Since then I been working for a company \n&gt; providing end-to-end online betting systems for the major \n&gt; bookmakers, but have continued to be intrested in AI techniques in \n&gt; my spare time. I started to get into using GA&#39;s to evolve neural \n&gt; nets after reading Fogel&#39;s Blondie24. My current pet project is \n&gt; trying to use those techniques to evolve a neural net to score \nstock \n&gt; graphs based on wether it thinks they are a buy, hold or sell. I \n&gt; started off with a very naieve GA and a fixed arbitrary net \n&gt; topology. I stumbled onto NEAT whilst doing some google searches \nand \n&gt; am now hoping to apply it to my get rich quick scheme :-) Feel \nfree \n&gt; to contact me if you would like to discuss anything.\n&gt; Emyr\n\n\n"}}
