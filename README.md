# NEAT yahoo group archive
A snapshot of all messages in the NEAT yahoo group as at 2019-10-26 12:00 UTC.

    http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/neat 

Currently this archive contains only the per-message json result returned by the yahoo API, as such these json
files are not in a human readable form. To obtain a human readable form see:

https://github.com/andrewferguson/YahooGroups-Archiver/

  make_Yearly_Text_Archive.py  
  make_Yearly_Text_Archive_html.py  
  
I encountered multiple problems trying to run those scripts, so gave up initially. You may hav more luck with one of the forks
of that repository, or revising/updating/rewriting the scripts yourself.

The main thing for now is that the messages are archives before yahoo delete the messages. The stated deletion date is 2019-12-18.
